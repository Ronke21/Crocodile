<text>A cassette deck is a type of tape machine for playing and recording audio cassettes that does not have a built-in power amplifier or speakers, and serves primarily as a transport. It can be a part of an automotive entertainment system, a part of a portable audio system or a part of a home component system. In the latter case, it is also called a component cassette deck or just a component deck.

== History ==

=== Roots ===
The first consumer tape recorder to employ a tape reel permanently housed in a small removable cartridge was the RCA tape cartridge, which appeared in 1958 as a predecessor to the cassette format. At that time, reel-to-reel recorders and players were commonly used by enthusiasts but required large individual reels and tapes which had to be threaded by hand, making them less accessible to the casual consumer. Both RCA and Bell Sound attempted to commercialize the cartridge format, but a few factors stalled adoption, including lower-than-advertised availability of selections in the prerecorded media catalog, delays in production setup, and a stand-alone design that was not considered by audiophiles to be truly hi-fi.

The &quot;compact cassette&quot; (a Philips trademark) was introduced by the Philips Corporation at the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin in 1963 and marketed as a device purely intended for portable speech-only dictation machines. The tape width was  inch (actually 0.15 inch, 3.81 mm) and tape speed was per second, giving a decidedly non-Hi-Fi frequency response and quite high noise levels.

=== Early cassette decks ===

Early recorders were intended for dictation and journalists and were typically hand-held battery-powered devices with built-in microphones and automatic gain control on recording. Tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s, and a cassette deck with manual level controls and VU meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems. Eventually the reel-to-reel recorder was completely displaced, in part because of the usage constraints presented by their large size, expense, and the inconvenience of threading and rewinding the tape reelscassettes are more portable and can be stopped and immediately removed in the middle of playback without rewinding. Cassettes became extremely popular for automotive and other portable music applications. Although pre-recorded cassettes were widely available, many users would combine (dub) songs from their vinyl records or other cassettes to make a new custom mixtape cassette.

In 1970, the Advent Corporation combined Dolby B noise reduction system with chromium dioxide (CrO2) tape to create the Advent Model 200, the first high-fidelity cassette deck. Dolby B uses volume companding of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9 dB, reducing them (and the hiss) on playback. CrO2 used different bias and equalization settings to reduce the overall noise level and extend the high frequency response. Together these allowed a usefully flat frequency response beyond 15 kHz for the first time. This deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by Nakamichi, then soon replaced by the Model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by Wollensak, a division of 3M, which was commonly used in audio/visual applications. Both featured an unusual single VU meter which could be switched between or for both channels. The Model 200 featured piano key style transport controls, with the Model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era.

Most manufacturers adopted a standard top-loading format with piano key controls, dual VU meters, and slider level controls. There was a variety of configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s, which settled on front-loading (see main picture) with cassette well on one side, dual VU meters on the other, and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle. Mechanical controls were replaced with electronic push buttons controlling solenoid mechanical actuators, though low cost models would retain mechanical controls. Some models could search and count gaps between songs.

=== Widespread use ===
Cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications, home audio systems, and for mobile use in cars, as well as portable recorders. From the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the cassette deck was the preferred music source for the automobile. Like an 8-track cartridge, it was relatively insensitive to vehicle motion, but it had reduced tape flutter, as well as the obvious advantages of smaller physical size and fast forward/rewind capability.
A major boost to the cassette&#x27;s popularity came with the release of the Sony Walkman &quot;personal&quot; cassette player in 1979, designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact &quot;wearable&quot; music source. Although the vast majority of such players eventually sold were not Sony products, the name &quot;Walkman&quot; has become synonymous with this type of device.

Cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio, and many in professional audio, with each company offering models of very high quality.

=== Performance improvements and additional features ===
Cassette decks reached their pinnacle of performance and complexity by the mid-1980s. Cassette decks from companies such as Nakamichi, Revox, and Tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors. Auto-reversing decks became popular and were standard on most factory installed automobile decks.

==== Integrated noise reduction systems - Dolby B, C, and S ====
The Dolby B noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on the - compared to reel-to-reel-technology - relatively slow and narrow cassette tapes. It works by boosting the high frequencies on recording, especially low-level high-frequency sounds, with corresponding high frequency reduction on playback. This lowers the high frequency noise (hiss) by approximately 9 dB. Enhanced versions included Dolby C (from 1980) and Dolby S types. Of the three, however, only Dolby B became common on automobile decks.

==== Three heads for realtime monitoring of recordings and improved sound quality ====
Three-head technology uses separate heads for recording and playback (the third of the three heads being the erase head). 
This allows different record and playback head gaps to be used. 
A narrower head gap is optimal for playback than for recording, so the head gap width of any combined record/playback head must necessarily be a compromise. 
Separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording, permitting immediate verification of the recording quality. 
(Such machines can be identified by the presence of a &quot;monitor&quot; switch with positions for &quot;tape&quot; and &quot;source&quot;, or similar.) 
Three-head systems were common on reel-to-reel decks, but were more difficult to implement for cassettes, 
which do not provide separate openings for record and play heads. 
Some models squeezed a monitor head into the capstan area, and others combined separate record and playback gaps into a single headshell.

==== Auto reverse for automated sequential playback of both cassette sides ====
In later years, an &quot;auto-reverse&quot; feature appeared that allowed the deck to play (and, in some decks, record) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. 
Most auto-reverse machines use a four-channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. 
Auto-reverse decks employ a capstan and pinch roller for each side. 
Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the erase head, 
such decks must fit the erase head (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.

In later auto-reverse machines, the &quot;auto reverse&quot; mechanism uses an ordinary two-track, quarter-width head, 
but operates by mechanically rotating the head 180 degrees so that the two head gaps access the other tracks of the tape. 
There is usually an azimuth adjustment screw for each position. 
Nevertheless, due to the repeated movement, the alignment (in particular, the azimuth) deviates with usage. 
Even in a machine with a four-channel head, slight asymmetries in the cassette shell make it difficult to align the 
head perfectly for both directions. 


In one machine, the Dragon, Nakamichi addressed the issue with a motor-driven automatic head alignment mechanism. 
This proved effective but very expensive. 
Later Nakamichi auto-reverse models, the RX series, was essentially a single-directional deck, 
but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport, flipped it over, and re-inserted it. 
Akai made a similar machine but with the mechanism and cassette laid out horizontally instead of upright.
This permitted the convenience of auto-reverse with little compromise in record or playback quality.

==== Integration of digital electronics, from the 1980s ====
As a part of the Digital Revolution, the ongoing development of electronics technology decreased the cost of digital circuitry to the point that the technology could be applied to consumer electronics. The application of such digital electronics to cassette decks provides an early example of mechatronic design, which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance, increase system flexibility, or reduce cost. The inclusion of logic circuitry and solenoids into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks, often referred to &quot;logic control&quot;, contrasts with earlier &quot;piano-key&quot; transport controls and mechanical linkages. One goal of using logic circuitry in cassette decks or recorders was to minimize equipment damage upon incorrect user input by including fail-safes into the transport and control mechanism. Such fail-safe behavior was described in a review by Julian Hirsch of a particular cassette deck featuring logic control. Some examples of fail-safe mechanisms incorporated into logic control decks include: a mechanism designed to protect internal components from damage when the tape or motor is locked, a mechanism designed to prevent the tape from being wound improperly, among others. Some logic control decks were designed to incorporate light-touch buttons or remote control, among other features marketed as being convenient. In the car stereo industry, full logic control was developed with the aim of miniaturization, so that the cassette deck would take up less dashboard space.

==== Dolby HX Pro for higher recording levels on the same tape material ====
Bang &amp; Olufsen developed the HX Pro headroom extension system in conjunction with Dolby Laboratories in 1982. This was used in many higher-end decks. HX Pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has a high level of high frequency content. Such a signal is self-biasing. Reducing the level of the bias signal permits the desired signal to be recorded at a higher level without saturating the tape, thus increasing headroom or maximum recording level.

Some decks incorporated microprocessor programs to adjust tape bias and record level calibration automatically.

==== Advances in tape materials ====
New tape formulations were introduced. 
Chromium dioxide (referred to as CrO2 or Type II) was the first tape designed for extended high-frequency response, but it required higher bias. Later, as the IEC Type II standard was defined, a different equalization settings was also mandated to reduce hiss, thus giving up some extension at the high end of the audio spectrum. 
Better-quality cassette recorders soon appeared with a switch for the tape type. 
Later decks incorporated coded holes in the shell to autodetect the tape type. 
Chromium dioxide tape was thought to cause increased wear on the heads, so TDK and Maxell adapted cobalt-doped ferric formulations to mimic CrO2. 
Sony briefly tried FerriChrome (Type III) which claimed to combine the best of both; some people, however, stated that the reverse was true because the Cr top layer seemed to wear off quickly, reducing this type to Fe in practice. Most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes (IEC Type IV) which require still higher bias for recording, though they will play back correctly at the II setting since the equalization is the same.

==== Effects achieved by the technological developments ==== 
With all of these improvements, the best units could record and play the full audible spectrum from 20 Hz to over 20 kHz (although this was commonly quoted at -10, -20 or even -30 dB, not at full output level), with wow and flutter less than 0.05% and very low noise. A high-quality recording on cassette could rival the sound of an average commercial CD, though the quality of pre-recorded cassettes has been regarded by the general public as lower than could be achieved in a quality home recording. There was a call for better sound quality in 1981, surprisingly by the head of Tower Records, Russ Solomon. At a meeting of the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) Retail Advisory Committee in Carlsbad, California, Solomon played two recordings of a Santana track; one he had recorded himself and the pre-recorded cassette release from Columbia Records. He used this technique to demonstrate what he called &quot;the tunnel effect&quot; in the audio range of pre-recorded cassettes and commented to the reporter Sam Sutherland, who wrote a news article printed in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine:
&quot;The buyer who is aware of sound quality is making his own.&quot; &quot;They won&#x27;t be satisfied with the &#x27;tunnel effect&#x27; of prerecorded tape. And home tape deck users don&#x27;t use prerecorded tapes at all.&quot; Yet, contended Solomon, while Tower&#x27;s own stores show strong blank tape sales gains, its prerecorded sales have increased by only 2% to 3%. With an estimated 15% of the chain&#x27;s total tape business now generated by the sales of blanks, &quot;it would appear our added tape sales are going to TDK, Maxell and Sony, not you.&quot; he concluded. - &quot;Billboard&quot;, Vol. 93, No. 38, 26 September 1981.
==Noise reduction and fidelity==

A variety of noise reduction and other schemes are used to increase fidelity, with Dolby B being almost universal for both prerecorded tapes and home recording. Dolby B was designed to address the high-frequency noise inherent in cassette tapes, and along with improvements in tape formulation it helped the cassette win acceptances as a high-fidelity medium. At the same time, Dolby B provided acceptable performance when played back on decks that lacked Dolby circuitry, meaning there was little reason not to use it if it was available.

The main alternative to Dolby was the dbx noise reduction system, which achieved a high signal-to-noise ratio, but was essentially unlistenable when played back on decks that lacked the dbx decoding circuitry.

Philips developed an alternative noise reduction system known as Dynamic Noise Limiter (DNL) which did not require the tapes to be processed during recording; this was also the basis of the later DNR noise reduction.

Dolby later introduced Dolby C and Dolby S noise reduction, which achieved higher levels of noise reduction; Dolby C became common on high-fidelity decks, but Dolby S, released when cassette sales had begun to decline, never achieved widespread use. It was only licensed for use on higher end tape decks that included dual motors, triple heads, and other refinements.

Dolby HX Pro headroom extension provided better high-frequency response by adjusting the inaudible tape bias during the recording of strong high-frequency sounds, which had a bias effect of their own. Developed by Bang &amp; Olufsen, it did not require a decoder to play back. Since B&amp;O held patent rights and required paying license fees, many other manufacturers refrained from using it too.

Other refinements to improve cassette performance included Tandberg&#x27;s DYNEQ, Toshiba&#x27;s and Telefunken&#x27;s High Com, and on some high-end decks, automatic recording bias, fine pitch adjustment and (sometimes) head azimuth adjustment such as the Tandberg TCD-330 and TCD-340A.

By the late 1980s, thanks to such improvements in the electronics, the tape material and manufacturing techniques, as well as dramatic improvements to the precision of the cassette shell, tape heads and transport mechanics, sound fidelity on equipment from the top manufacturers far surpassed the levels originally expected of the medium. On suitable audio equipment, cassettes could produce a very pleasant listening experience. High-end cassette decks could achieve 15 Hz-22 kHz±3 dB frequency response with wow and flutter below 0.022%, and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 61 dB (for Type IV tape, without noise-reduction) . With noise reduction typical signal-to-noise figures of 70-76 dB with Dolby C, 80-86 dB with Dolby S, and 85 - 90 dB with dbx could be achieved. Many casual listeners could not tell the difference between compact cassette and compact disc.

From the early 1980s, the fidelity of prerecorded cassettes began to improve dramatically. Whereas Dolby B was already in widespread use in the 1970s, prerecorded cassettes were duplicated onto rather poor quality tape stock at (often) high speed and did not compare in fidelity to high-grade LPs. However, systems such as XDR, along with the adoption of higher-grade tape (such as chromium dioxide, but typically recorded in such a way as to play back at the normal 120 μs position), and the frequent use of Dolby HX Pro, meant that cassettes became a viable high-fidelity option, one that was more portable and required less maintenance than records. In addition, cover art, which had generally previously been restricted to a single image of the LP cover along with a minimum of text, began to be tailored to cassettes as well, with fold-out lyric sheets or librettos and fold-out sleeves becoming commonplace.

Some companies, such as Mobile Fidelity, produced audiophile cassettes in the 1980s, which were recorded on high-grade tape and duplicated on premium equipment in real time from a digital master. Unlike audiophile LPs, which continue to attract a following, these became moot after the compact disc became widespread.

Almost all cassette decks have an MPX filter to improve the sound quality and the tracking of the noise reduction system when recording from an FM stereo broadcast. However, in many especially cheaper decks, this filter cannot be disabled, and because of that record/playback frequency response in those decks typically is limited to 16 kHz. In other decks, the MPX filter can be switched off or on independently from the Dolby switch. On yet other decks, the filter is off by default, and an option to switch it on or off is only provided when Dolby is activated; this prevents the MPX filter from being used when it&#x27;s not required.

== In-car entertainment systems ==
A key element of the cassette&#x27;s success was its use in in-car entertainment systems, where the small size of the tape was significantly more convenient than the competing 8-track cartridge system. Cassette players in cars and for home use were often integrated with a radio receiver. In-car cassette players were the first to adopt automatic reverse (&quot;auto-reverse&quot;) of the tape direction at each end, allowing a cassette to be played endlessly without manual intervention. Home cassette decks soon added the feature.

Cassette tape adaptors have been developed which allow newer media players to be played through existing cassette decks, in particular those in cars which generally do not have input jacks. These units do not suffer from reception problems from FM transmitter based system to play back media players through the FM radio, though supported frequencies for FM transmitters that are not used on commercial broadcasters in a given region (e.g. any frequency below 88.1 in the US) somewhat eliminates that problem.

== Maintenance ==
Cassette equipment needs regular maintenance, as cassette tape is a magnetic medium that is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism. Without such maintenance, the high-frequency response of the cassette equipment will suffer.

One problem occurs when iron oxide (or similar) particles from the tape itself become lodged in the playback head. As a result, the tape heads will require occasional cleaning to remove such particles. The metal capstan and the rubber pinch roller can become coated with these particles, leading them to pull the tape less precisely over the head; this in turn leads to misalignment of the tape over the head azimuth, producing noticeably unclear high tones, just as if the head itself were out of alignment. Isopropyl alcohol and denatured alcohol are both suitable head-cleaning fluids.

The heads and other metallic components in the tape path (such as spindles and capstans) may become magnetized with use, and require demagnetizing (see Cassette demagnetizer).

== Decline in popularity ==

Analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape (DAT), MiniDisc, and the CD-R recorder drives. Philips responded with the digital compact cassette, a system which was backward-compatible with existing analog cassette recordings for playback. However, it failed to garner a significant market share and was withdrawn from the market. One reason proposed for the lack of acceptance of digital recording formats such as DAT was a fear by content providers that the ability to make very high-quality copies would hurt sales of copyrighted recordings.

The rapid transition was not realized and CDs and cassettes successfully co-existed for nearly 20 years. A contributing factor may have been the inability of early CD players to reliably read discs with surface damage and offer anti-skipping features for applications where external vibration would be present, such as automotive and recreation environments. Early CD playback equipment also tended to be expensive compared to cassette equipment of similar quality and did not offer recording capability. Many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the CD playback to be recorded on cassette tape. The rise of inexpensive all-solid-state portable digital music systems based on MP3, AAC and similar formats finally saw the eventual decline of the domestic cassette deck. As of 2020, Marantz, Teac, and Tascam are among the few companies still manufacturing cassette decks in relatively small quantities for professional and niche market use. By the late 1990s, automobiles were offered with entertainment systems that played both cassettes and CDs. By the end of the late 2000s, very few cars were offered with cassette decks. The last vehicle model in the United States that came standard with a factory-installed cassette player was the 2010 Lexus SC 430, however the Ford Crown Victoria came with a cassette deck as an option until the model was discontinued in 2011. As radios became tightly integrated into dashboards, many cars lacked even standard openings that would accept aftermarket cassette player installations.

Despite the decline in the production of cassette decks, these products are still valued by some. Many blind and elderly people find the newest digital technologies very difficult to use compared to the cassette format. Cassette tapes are not vulnerable to scratching from handling (though the exposed magnetic tape is vulnerable to stretching from poking), and play from where they were last stopped (though some modern MP3 players offer savestating electronically). Cassette tapes can also be recorded multiple times (though some solid-state digital recorders are now offering that function).

Today, cassette decks are not considered by most people to be either the most versatile or highest fidelity sound recording devices available, as even very inexpensive CD or digital audio players can reproduce a wide frequency range with no speed variations. Many current budget-oriented cassette decks lack a tape selector to set proper bias and equalization settings to take best advantage of the extended high end of Type II [High Bias] and Type IV [Metal Bias] tapes.

Cassettes remain popular for audio-visual applications. Some CD recorders, particularly those intended for business use, incorporate a cassette deck to allow both formats for recording meetings, church sermons, and books on tape.

<doc id="153918" wikidata="Q493522" url="?curid=153918" title="Municipalities of Belgium">
<text>Belgium comprises 581 municipalities (; ; ), 300 of them grouped into five provinces in Flanders and 262 others in five provinces in Wallonia, while the remaining 19 are in the Brussels Capital Region, which is not divided in provinces. In most cases, the municipalities are the smallest administrative subdivisions of Belgium, but in municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, on the initiative of the local council, sub-municipal administrative entities with elected councils may be created. As such, only Antwerp, having over 500,000 inhabitants, became subdivided into nine districts (). The Belgian arrondissements (; ; ), an administrative level between province (or the capital region) and municipality, or the lowest judicial level, are in English sometimes called districts as well.

== Lists of municipalities ==
Here are three lists of municipalities for each one of the three regions:

* List of municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region (19 municipalities)
* List of municipalities of the Flemish Region (300 municipalities)
* List of municipalities in Wallonia (262 municipalities)

== History ==
=== Before 1830 ===
The municipalities, as an administrative division, were officially created in 1795, when the Directoire reorganised the structures of the Ancien Régime. The municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants were grouped in so-called canton municipalities. In 1800, these canton municipalities were abolished again and the number of autonomous municipalities became 2,776.

Not much changed during the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, only a number of smaller municipalities were merged.

=== Between 1830 and 1961 ===
In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, a number which remained more or less constant until 1961. The law of 30 March 1836 regulated municipalities and their governing bodies. The number of municipalities was reduced to 2,508 when the Belgian borders were recognised in 1839, as 124 municipalities were ceded to the Netherlands and another 119 municipalities became the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (see the article Communes of Luxembourg for details). New municipalities were created until 1928. There were 2,528 municipalities in 1850, 2,572 in 1875, 2,617 in 1900 and a maximum of 2,675 in 1929. This also includes the municipalities of the East Cantons that were added to Belgium following the First World War.

=== From 1961 to 1977 ===
In 1961, the so-called Unitary Law (; ; ), of which the fourth chapter was dedicated to the territorial organisation of the municipalities, was adopted. The authority to abolish municipalities was entrusted to the executive branch for a period of 10 years. Municipalities could be merged on financial grounds or on grounds of a geographical, linguistic, economic, social or cultural nature. In 1964 and in 1969 and 1970, roughly 300 municipalities ceased to exist and were subsumed into other municipalities. The number of municipalities was reduced from 2,663 in 1961 to 2,586 in 1965 and to 2,359 in 1971.

Article 4 of the constitution states that each municipality must belong to only one of the four official language areas that were established in 1962–63. In the three officially unilingual language areas, a couple of dozen municipalities in the vicinity of another language area must provide limited facilities for speakers of that other language. As only a law carried by special majorities can change the language status of any municipality, these arrangements have prevented some small municipalities with facilities to be merged in the 1970s, and thus the most minute Belgian municipalities are still found in this group, notably Herstappe with only 84 inhabitants (in 2006).

Lucien Harmegnies, Minister of the Interior in the government of Gaston Eyskens (1968–1972) decided to continue the process of territorial reorganization of Belgium. In 1971, the provisions of the Unity Law were extended and modified to apply to large agglomerations, which were initially excluded from its provisions. It was another Minister of the Interior, Joseph Michel, who managed the process. On 30 December 1975 the law regarding the merger of the municipalities was adopted. The merger became effective on 1 January 1977. The merger of 1977 further reduced the number of municipalities in Belgium from 2,359 to 596.

====Antwerp====
Because of the specific nature of the reorganization in Antwerp, the law of 30 December 1975 did not enter into force for Antwerp until 1 January 1983. The formerly-independent municipalities were called districts and were given an advisory function. However, on 1 January 2001 they were given an administrative function again. The merger of Antwerp with the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Hoboken, Ekeren, Merksem and Wilrijk in 1983 finally reduced the number of municipalities in Belgium to 589 and was the last reorganization of the municipalities for several decades because the merger of the 19 municipalities of Brussels was postponed indefinitely.

===21st century===
The fifth state reform (2001) transferred the responsibility over municipalities from the federal level to the three regions.

This did not instantly have any significant effect on the reorganisation of municipalities, up until the Flemish Bourgeois Government (2014-2019) provided a legal framework and financial incentives for municipalities to consider merging. This led 15 Flemish municipalities to merge into seven, decreasing the total number of Flemish municipalities from 308 to 300. Their municipal councils were elected in the regular elections of 14 October 2018, and the change took effect on 1 January 2019.

==Municipal organization==
===Mayor===
The mayor (; ; ) is not only the head of the municipality but also the representative of the regional and the federal government at the local level. In that capacity, they are responsible for the execution of laws, decrees, ordinances and orders. The mayor is also responsible for the maintenance of public order in their municipality. They chair the college of mayor and aldermen or the municipal college, depending on the region, as well.

In the Flanders and Brussels, the mayor is appointed by the regional government, on the nomination of the municipal council, for a term of office of six years. In Wallonia, the mayor is the municipal councillor who received the largest number of preferential votes of the majority party that received the largest number of votes in the municipal elections. Hence, it is also possible that the mayor is not a member of the largest party, as the largest party is not always part of the governing coalition. It is also possible in Wallonia for the municipal council to adopt a constructive motion of no confidence in the municipal college.

===College===
The executive organ of the municipality is known as the college of mayor and aldermen (; ), commonly referred to as the college of aldermen (; ), in Flanders and Brussels, and as the municipal college (; ) in Wallonia. This college is responsible for the daily administration of the municipality. It is also responsible for the preparation and implementation of the decisions of the municipal council.

===Council===
The municipal council (; ; ) is the representative assembly of the municipality and consists of members directly elected for a term of office of six years. The number of municipal councillors depends on the number of inhabitants of the municipality, and can vary from 7 to 55. It is responsible for all matters that are of municipal interest.

==Differences between the Regions==
Following the Fifth State Reform in 2001, the responsibility for the composition, the organization, the competences and the activities of the municipal institutions were devolved to the Regions, as well as the responsibility for the provincial institutions. As a result, there are several differences between the municipal institutions in Flanders, in Wallonia and in Brussels. Wallonia has also further devolved part of its responsibilities to the German-speaking Community with regards to its 9 municipalities.

The three Regions can amend or replace the existing legislation on the municipalities, most notably the New Municipal Law. In the Flanders the Municipal Decree of 15 July 2005 applies. In Wallonia the Code of Local Democracy and Decentralization applies. In Brussels several provisions of the New Municipal Law have been modified by ordinance, such as the Ordinance of 17 July 2003. The legal framework in the three Regions is still relatively similar, but that could change in the future.

==Agglomerations and federations==
Since 1970, the Belgian Constitution includes the possibility to create agglomerations and federations of municipalities by law. This possibility was only used once in 1971 when the Brussels Agglomeration, comprising the 19 municipalities of Brussels, was put into place. It &quot;de facto&quot; ceased to exist in 1989 when the organs of the Brussels-Capital Region were established.

<doc id="153926" wikidata="Q435032" url="?curid=153926" title="Alison Bechdel">
<text>Alison Bechdel ( ; born September 10, 1960) is an American cartoonist. Originally known for the long-running comic strip &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot;, she came to critical and commercial success in 2006 with her graphic memoir &quot;Fun Home&quot;. &quot;Fun Home&quot; was subsequently adapted as a musical that won a Tony Award for Best Musical in 2015. In 2012, she released her second graphic memoir &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; She was a 2014 recipient of the MacArthur &quot;Genius&quot; Award. She is also known for originating what would later be called the Bechdel test.

== Early life ==
Bechdel was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. She is the daughter of Helen Augusta (née Fontana) and Bruce Allen Bechdel. Her family was Roman Catholic. Her father was an army veteran who was stationed in West Germany. He was also a high school English teacher, working full-time and operating a funeral home part-time. Her mother was an actress and teacher. Both of her parents contributed to her career as a cartoonist. She has two brothers: Bruce &quot;Christian&quot; Bechdel II and John Bechdel, a keyboard player who has worked with many bands including Fear Factory, Ministry, Prong and Killing Joke. Bechdel left high school a year early and earned her A.A. in 1979 from Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock. She graduated with a degree in studio arts and art history in 1981 from Oberlin College. After her father died in 1980, her mother sold the family house in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania, the small town where Bechdel grew up, and moved to Bellefonte, a less provincial small town near State College with her long-time partner Robert Fenichel.

== Career ==

Bechdel moved to Manhattan during the summer of 1981 and applied to several art schools, but was rejected and worked in many office jobs in the publishing industry.

She began &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; as a single drawing labeled &quot;Marianne, dissatisfied with the morning brew: Dykes to Watch Out For, plate no. 27&quot;. An acquaintance recommended she send her work to &quot;WomaNews&quot;, a feminist newspaper, which published her first work in its June 1983 issue. Bechdel gradually moved from her early single-panel drawings to multi-paneled strips. &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; began this process, developing into a series of posters and postcards, allowing for people to have a look into the urban lesbian community. After a year, other outlets began running the strip.

In the first years, &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; consisted of unconnected strips without a regular cast or serialized storyline. However, its structure eventually evolved into a focus on following a set group of lesbian characters. In 1986, Firebrand Books published a collection of the strips to date. In 1987, Bechdel introduced her regular characters, Mo and her friends, while living in St. Paul, Minnesota. &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; is the origin of the &quot;Bechdel test&quot;, intended as a joke, which has become a frequently used metric in cultural discussion of film. In 1988, she began a short-lived page-length strip about the staff of a queer newspaper, titled &quot;Servants to the Cause&quot;, for &quot;The Advocate&quot;. Bechdel has also written and drawn autobiographical strips and has done illustrations for magazines and websites. The success of &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; allowed Bechdel to quit her day job in 1990 to work on the strip full-time.

In November 2006, Bechdel was invited to sit on the Usage Panel of the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;. In 2012, Bechdel was a Mellon Residential Fellow for Arts and Practice at the Richard and Mary L. Gray Center at the University of Chicago and co-taught &quot;Lines of Transmission: Comics &amp; Autobiography&quot; with Professor Hillary Chute. On April 6, 2017, Bechdel was appointed as Vermont&#x27;s third Cartoonist Laureate.

In 2014, she posted a comic strip based on her &quot;Fun Home! The Musical!&quot; After Donald Trump&#x27;s election as U.S. president she posted three new episodes of &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot;: &quot;Pièce de Résistance,&quot; &quot;Postcards From the Edge,&quot; and &quot;Things Fall Apart.&quot;

Bechdel resides in Bolton, Vermont, and works with the Vermont-based alternative weekly &quot;Seven Days&quot;.

=== &quot;Fun Home&quot; ===
In 2006, Bechdel published &quot;Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic&quot;, an autobiographical &quot;tragicomic&quot; chronicling her childhood and the years before and after her father&#x27;s suicide. It follows the past and present phases of her relationship with her parents, principally her father, and depicts the hardships individuals face when coming out. &quot;Fun Home&quot; has received more widespread mainstream attention than Bechdel&#x27;s earlier work, with reviews in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;People&quot; and several features in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Fun Home&quot; spent two weeks on &quot;The New York Times Bestseller List&quot; for Hardcover Nonfiction.

&quot;Fun Home&quot; was hailed as one of the best books of 2006 by numerous sources, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, amazon.com, &quot;The Times&quot; of London, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, salon.com, &quot;New York&quot; magazine, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named Alison Bechdel&#x27;s &quot;Fun Home&quot; number one of its &quot;10 Best Books of the Year.&quot; Lev Grossman and Richard LeCayo described &quot;Fun Home&quot; as &quot;the unlikeliest literary success of 2006,&quot; and called it &quot;a stunning memoir about a girl growing up in a small town with her cryptic, perfectionist dad and slowly realizing that a) she is gay and b) he is too… Bechdel&#x27;s breathtakingly smart commentary duets with eloquent line drawings. Forget genre and sexual orientation: this is a masterpiece about two people who live in the same house but different worlds, and their mysterious debts to each other.&quot;

&quot;Fun Home&quot; was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award in the memoir/autobiography category. It also won the 2007 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work. &quot;Fun Home&quot; was also nominated for the Best Graphic Album award, and Bechdel was nominated for Best Writer/Artist.

In 2014, the Republican-led South Carolina House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee considered cutting the College of Charleston&#x27;s funding by $52,000 for selecting &quot;Fun Home&quot;. The addition of &quot;Fun Home&quot; to the summer reading list caused significant backlash from some conservative students who found the depiction of sexuality to be &quot;immoral,&quot; and &quot;pornographic&quot; for &quot;graphically showing lesbian acts.&quot;

&quot;Fun Home&quot; premiered as a musical Off-Broadway at The Public Theater on September 30, 2013, and officially opened on October 22, 2013. The score was written by Jeanine Tesori and the book and lyrics were written by Lisa Kron. Kron and Tesori made history as the first all-woman team to win a Tony Award for best score. Originally scheduled to run through November 3, 2013, the run was extended multiple times and the musical closed on January 12, 2014. The Public Theater production was directed by Sam Gold. Sets and costumes were by David Zinn, lighting by Ben Stanton, sound by Kai Harada, projections by Jim Findlay and Jeff Sugg and choreography by Danny Mefford. The musical played at Broadway&#x27;s Circle in the Square Theatre, with previews from March 27, 2015, and an official opening on April 19, 2015, running to September 10, 2016. Sam Gold, who directed the Public Theater production, also directed the show on Broadway, leading the Off-Broadway production team. The Off-Broadway cast reprised their roles on Broadway, except for the actors playing John, Christian, and Medium Alison. The Broadway musical won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Performance by an Actor in Leading Role in a Musical, Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre, Best Book of a Musical, and Best Direction of a Musical.

On January 3, 2020, it was announced that Jake Gyllenhaal and his Nine Stories Productions banner secured the rights to adapt the musical version of &quot;Fun Home&quot; into a film. Sam Gold, who directed the Broadway production, is set to helm the film, in which Gyllenhaal will star as Bruce Bechdel.

=== &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; ===
Bechdel suspended work on &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; in 2008 so that she could work on her second graphic memoir, &quot;Are You My Mother?: A Comic Drama&quot;, which was released in May 2012. It focuses on her relationship with her mother. Bechdel described its themes as &quot;the self, subjectivity, desire, the nature of reality, that sort of thing,&quot; which is a paraphrase of a quote from Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;.

The story&#x27;s dramatic action is multi-layered and divides into a number of narrative strands:
*Bechdel&#x27;s phone-conversations with her mother in the present.
*Bechdel&#x27;s memories of interactions with her mother throughout her life, beginning in childhood.
*Bechdel&#x27;s therapy sessions, whose primary content is composed of analysis of her relationship with her mother.
*Bechdel&#x27;s richly imagined, and diligently researched, historical portrayals of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, and author Virginia Woolf, spliced together with Bechdel&#x27;s own therapeutic journey with text from the psychoanalytic writings of Alice Miller, along with the story of Bechdel&#x27;s own reading-through and relating to the works of Sigmund Freud.

An excerpt of the book, entitled &quot;Mirror&quot;, was included in the &quot;Best American Comics 2013&quot;, edited by Jeff Smith. This episode riffs heavily on psychoanalytic themes quoted explicitly from the work of psychoanalysts Alice Miller and Donald Winnicott.

=== &quot;The Secret to Superhuman Strength&quot; ===
Bechdel published another memoir, &quot;The Secret to Superhuman Strength&quot;, in 2021. The book chronicles Bechdel&#x27;s fascination with fitness, jumping from sport to sport and discovering that she gets in her own way.

== Personal life ==
Bechdel came out as a lesbian at age 19. Her sexuality and gender non-conformity are a large part of the core message of her work, and she has said that &quot;the secret subversive goal of my work is to show that women, not just lesbians, are regular human beings&quot;. In February 2004, Bechdel married Amy Rubin, her girlfriend since 1992, in a civil ceremony in San Francisco. However, all same-sex marriage licenses given by the city at that time were subsequently voided by the California Supreme Court. Bechdel and Rubin separated in 2006. She subsequently lived with her partner Holly Rae Taylor, a painter, for seven and a half years before their marriage in July 2015. She lives in Bolton, Vermont, in a house she bought in 1996, adding her own studio to work in. Bechdel goes by she/her pronouns.

<doc id="153927" wikidata="Q824569" url="?curid=153927" title="Duke of Edinburgh">
<text>Duke of Edinburgh, named after the capital city of Scotland, Edinburgh, is a substantive title that has been created four times since 1726 for members of the British royal family. It does not include any territorial landholdings and does not produce any revenue for the title-holder.

The current holder, Prince Edward, was created duke in 2023 on his 59th birthday by his eldest brother, King Charles III. The dukedom had previously been granted to their father, then Philip Mountbatten, on the day of his marriage to then-Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth II. Upon Philip&#x27;s death, the title was inherited by Charles and held by him until Elizabeth died and Charles became king, at which time the title reverted to the Crown.

==1726 creation==

The title was first created in the Peerage of Great Britain on 26 July 1726 by King George I, who bestowed it on his grandson Prince Frederick, who subsequently became Prince of Wales in 1728. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom were Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham, in the County of Kent, Viscount of Launceston, in the County of Cornwall, and Baron of Snowdon, in the County of Caernarvon, all of which were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. The marquessate was gazetted as Marquess of the Isle of Wight, apparently erroneously. In later editions of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; the Duke is referred to as the Marquess of the Isle of Ely. Upon Frederick&#x27;s death, the titles were inherited by his son Prince George. When Prince George became King George III in 1760, the titles merged in the Crown and ceased to exist.

==1866 creation==

Queen Victoria re-created the title, this time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, on 24 May 1866 for her second son Prince Alfred, instead of Duke of York, the traditional title of the second son of the monarch. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom were Earl of Kent and Earl of Ulster, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. When Alfred became the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1893, he retained his British titles. His only son that survived birth, Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, committed suicide in 1899, so the Dukedom of Edinburgh and subsidiary titles became extinct upon the elder Alfred&#x27;s death in 1900.

==1947 creation==

The title was created for a third time on 19 November 1947 by King George VI, who bestowed it on his future son-in-law Philip Mountbatten, when he married Princess Elizabeth. Subsequently, Elizabeth was styled &quot;HRH The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh&quot; until her accession in 1952. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom were Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich, of Greenwich in the County of London; all these titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Earlier that year, Philip had renounced his Greek and Danish royal titles (he was born a prince of Greece and Denmark, being a male-line grandson of King George I of Greece and male-line great-grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark) along with his rights to the Greek throne. In 1957, Philip became a prince of the United Kingdom.

Upon Philip&#x27;s death on 9 April 2021, his eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales, succeeded to all of his hereditary titles. Upon Charles&#x27;s accession to the throne on 8 September 2022, the peerages merged in the Crown and ceased to exist.

==2023 creation==
It was announced in 1999, at the time of his wedding, that Prince Edward would eventually be granted the Dukedom of Edinburgh. The idea came from Prince Philip, who unexpectedly conveyed his wish to Edward and his fiancée, Sophie Rhys-Jones, only days before their wedding. Edward, then seventh in the line of succession to the British throne, had expected the dukedom to be granted to Prince Andrew, his older brother.

Prince Philip died in April 2021. His dukedom was inherited by his eldest son, Prince Charles, before it &#x27;merged in the Crown&#x27; when Charles became King. The dukedom was then recreated for Prince Edward, in accordance with Prince Philip&#x27;s wishes. Edward, who had by then dropped to the 14th place in the line of succession because of births of those higher in line, said in June that him getting such a prestigious title was &quot;a pipe dream of my father&#x27;s&quot;. In July, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Charles had decided not to give the title to his brother. Clarence House did not deny the reports, which were met with disapproval by commentators in light of Edward and Sophie&#x27;s increased role in the monarchy after Andrew withdrew from public life and Charles&#x27;s son Prince Harry and daughter-in-law Meghan quit royal duties.

It was suggested in November 2022, shortly after Charles III ascended the throne, that Buckingham Palace was considering saving the dukedom for the new king&#x27;s granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Wales in recognition of her high place in the line of succession and her being the first female member of the royal family whose place in the line of succession cannot be superseded by a younger brother.

The dukedom was bestowed on Prince Edward on the occasion of his 59th birthday on 10 March 2023. This fourth creation of the title is a life peerage, meaning that Edward&#x27;s son, James, will not inherit the dukedom (unlike with Edward&#x27;s other peerages). This allows Charles to honour his father&#x27;s wish and reward his brother and sister-in-law while making it possible for Charles&#x27;s heir-apparent, Prince William, to confer it on one of his children. According to Camilla Tominey of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, there had been concerns regarding the effect that &quot;giv(ing) the Edinburgh dukedom to someone descending fast down the royal ranking&quot; would have on the Scottish independence debate. She proposes that &quot;the prospect of Scottish independence now looking less likely&quot; in the light of Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s resignation made the conferral less of a risk.

<doc id="153928" wikidata="Q165654" url="?curid=153928" title="Constable">
<text>A constable is a person holding a particular office, most commonly in law enforcement. The office of constable can vary significantly in different jurisdictions. &quot;Constable&quot; is commonly the rank of an officer within a police service. Other people may be granted powers of a constable without holding this title. 
==Etymology==

Historically, the title comes from the Latin &quot;comes stabuli&quot; (attendant to the stables, literally &#x27;count of the stable&#x27;) and originated from the Roman Empire; originally, the constable was the officer responsible for keeping the horses of a lord or monarch.

The title was imported to the monarchies of medieval Europe, and in many countries developed into a high military rank and great officer of state (e.g. the Constable of France, in French &quot;Connétable de France&quot;, who was the commander-in-chief of all royal armed forces (second to the king) until Prime Minister Cardinal Richelieu abolished the charge in 1627).

Most constables in modern jurisdictions are law enforcement officers. In the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Nations and some Continental European countries, a constable is the lowest rank of police officer (it is also, when preceded by the term &quot;sworn&quot;, used to describe any police officer with arrest and other powers), while in the United States a constable is generally an elected peace officer with lesser jurisdiction than a sheriff; however, in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office-holder at the parish level.

Historically, a constable could also refer to a castellan, the officer charged with the defence of a castle. Even today, there is a Constable of the Tower of London.

An equivalent position is that of marshal, which derives from Old High German &quot;marah&quot; (&#x27;horse&#x27;) and &quot;schalh&quot; (&#x27;servant&#x27;), and originally meant &quot;stable keeper&quot;, which has a similar etymology.

==Usage by country and region==
===Australia===

In Australia, as in the United Kingdom, constable is the lowest rank in most police services. It is often categorised into the following (from lowest to highest): probationary constable; constable; constable first class; senior constable; leading senior constable. These variations depend on the individual state or territory police force in question.

&quot;Senior constable&quot; generally refers to a police officer of the rank above constable, and is denoted by way of two chevrons or stripes.

The New South Wales Police Force has three grades of senior constable, namely senior constable (two chevrons), incremental senior constable (two chevrons and a horizontal bar), and leading senior constable (two chevrons and two horizontal bars). A senior constable is senior to a constable but junior to an incremental senior constable. Promotion to senior constable can occur after a minimum of five years&#x27; service (one year as a probationary constable in addition to four years as constable) and then upon passing probity checks and an exam. Incremental senior constable is attained after ten years of service automatically. One is appointed to the rank of leading senior constable on a qualification basis, but must have a minimum of seven years&#x27; service amongst other criteria in order to be eligible. Leading senior constable is a specialist position of which there are limited allocated numbers within any section/unit or local area command. If an officer is transferred to another duty type or station, the officer is then relieved of the position of leading senior constable: it is primarily a position for field training officers who oversee the training and development of inexperienced probationary constables or constables.

Within the Victoria Police, senior constable is the rank above constable, while above senior constable is leading senior constable. When first introduced into the Victoria Police, leading senior constable was a classification not a rank, somewhat like &quot;detective&quot;; leading senior constables were appointed specifically to assist in the training and mentoring of more junior members. The last round of wage negotiations, however, saw leading senior constable become a rank in its own right, one that a lot of members pass through on their way from constable to sergeant, though this is not strictly necessary and it is permissible to be promoted to sergeant direct from senior constable. The general form of address for both senior constable and leading senior constable is &quot;senior&quot;, and this is acceptable even in courts.

===Canada===
In Canada, as in the United Kingdom, constable is the lowest rank in most law enforcement services, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In Newfoundland the provincial police are the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, whereby all officers are addressed by the term &quot;constable&quot;.

In addition, the chief officers of some municipal police services in Canada, notably Vancouver Police Department, carry the title of chief constable.

In Canadian French, constable is translated to &quot;agent&quot;, except in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police where it is translated as &quot;gendarme&quot;.

Appointments can further be separated into:
* Special constables
** RCMP special constables are appointed for specific skills, for example aboriginal language skills. They are peace officers under the &quot;Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act&quot;.
** Outside of the RCMP, special constables are not police officers but are appointed to serve certain law enforcement functions, for example SPCA agents or court/jail officers.
* Auxiliary constables, or reserve constables, are volunteers with a policing agency. They generally have peace officer status only when engaged in specific authorized tasks.
* Provincial civil constables (in Nova Scotia) deal with matters of a civil nature.

===Denmark===

Within the Danish Defence, constables are the lowest rank group. The ranks of , and are used for professional enlisted soldiers, sailors and airmen. However, is only used within the army, as both the navy and air force use a specialist rank instead.

===Finland===
In the Finnish Police, the lowest rank of police officer is called &quot;nuorempi konstaapeli&quot;, translated into English as (junior) constable.

The next rank is &quot;vanhempi konstaapeli&quot; or senior constable.

The next highest rank (equivalent to a police sergeant in the English-speaking world) is &quot;ylikonstaapeli&quot; (&quot;yli-&quot; &quot;leading&quot;), literally &quot;over-constable&quot;.

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Police Force have two ranks for constables:

* Senior constable—lead officer in a beat patrol; SPCs wear a single chevron on their shoulder above their unique identification (UI) number.
* Constable—officer in a beat patrol; PCs wear no insignia other than the unique identification (UI) number.

Senior constable is not a rank: it is merely a designation for officers who have served for 18 years.

===India===

Police constable (abbreviated PC) is the lowest police rank in India, below head constable. General law and order being a state subject in India, each state government recruits police constables. A police constable has no shoulder insignia, while a head constable has one or more stripes or chevrons, depending on the state. Since each state has its own police force, the uniforms and insignia of the police vary, though the rank structure is the same.

In the Kerala State Police, the designations for personnel in the ranks of constable and head constable are Civil Police Officer (CPO) and Senior Civil Police Officer (SCPO), respectively.

The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), under the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India, also maintain the same ranks as state police even though their jurisdiction varies considerably, with the constables recruited to the CAPF having to do duty all over India. They perform duties such as maintaining internal security, border guarding, and counter-insurgency operations and riot control. Similarly, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) maintains the ranks of Constable and Head Constable. However, their duties and jurisdiction are specifically focused on the Indian railway network. RPF personnel are responsible for protecting railway property, preventing accidents, and ensuring passenger safety. Nearly all the police constables wear khaki-coloured uniforms, which indicate that they are police personnel.

Generally there are three types of constables in India, depending upon the unit, wing, branch or section they are attached to. Civil police constables are attached to a police station, traffic police constables control road traffic, telecommunication constables manage communications, whereas armed police constables are attached to armed police units. The types of constables are based on nature of their duties. The Indian police constables do a wide range of duties like patrol, beat system, crime detection, escorting of prisoners and VIPs, guarding vital offices and installations, vehicle traffic control on roads, riot control, assisting civil administration during disasters, epidemics and elections. Generally a police constable does his duty in his jurisdiction area, but can be assigned anywhere by his superiors depending on the situation or need. The duty hours of Indian police constables are erratic, many times without weekly time off or leave.

Police recruitment is based on a written test, plus physical and medical tests. After appointment all police constables have to undergo compulsory training; the duration of training may vary from nine months to one year depending on state. The training and duty of police is physically and mentally strenuous in India.

=== New Zealand ===

The New Zealand Police rank structure is heavily influenced by the Metropolitan Police rank structure and as such constable is the lowest sworn rank in the police service. There are three constable grades within the New Zealand Police, being probationary constable, constable and senior constable. The New Zealand Police does not have a chief constable instead having a commissioner which combines the role of chief executive and chief constable. The rank epaulette insignia of a probationary constable and constable is a lack of any insignia on the rank slide. The rank epaulette insignia of a senior constable is a single chevrons on the rank slide.

Constables in New Zealand have powers under the Policing Act 2008, a police employee receives these powers and becomes a constable by swearing the oath under section 22 of the Policing Act 2008. After becoming a sworn officer a police employee will leave the Royal New Zealand Police College and be promoted from recruit to probational constable. A probationary constable will be promoted to constable once they obtaining permanent appointment which is 10 workplace assessment standards which usually takes around two years. All police officers in the New Zealand Police are referred to in legislation as constables even if they are a sergeant or above and do not hold the rank of constable. For example the charge for assaulting a police officer is assaulting a constable even if the police officer assaulted was a sergeant or above and does not hold the rank title of constable. 

Unlike many police services in the New Zealand Police, detectives are constables and do not outrank their frontline counterparts.

===Norway===
In the Norwegian Police Service the rank was until 2003 the lowest rank in the police, the next ranks being &quot;politioverkonstabel&quot;, &quot;politibetjent&quot;, &quot;politiførstebetjent&quot;, &quot;politioverbetjent&quot; and &quot;politistasjonssjef&quot;, &quot;lensmann&quot; or &quot;sysselmannsoverbetjent&quot; (all officially translated as chief superintendent). In 2003, the ranks &quot;politikonstabel&quot;, &quot;politioverkonstabel&quot; and &quot;politibetjent&quot; were renamed &quot;politibetjent 1&quot;, &quot;politibetjent 2&quot; and &quot;politibetjent 3&quot;, where &quot;politibetjent 1&quot; is the entry-level rank for a policeman and most junior rank of the police service. All ranks higher than chief superintendent are commissioned ranks, known simply as &quot;higher ranks&quot;, and traditionally required a law degree.

The Norwegian Police Service has an integrated prosecution service in which the police lawyers, who all hold higher ranks, require the law degree &quot;candidatus/candidata juris&quot; or &quot;Master of Laws&quot; (&quot;master i rettsvitenskap&quot;), awarded after five or six years of law studies. Following reforms of the police, a law degree is no longer required by law for all higher ranks, although only lawyers can act as prosecutors and supervise criminal investigations, for which reason it is still common for those holding higher ranks to be lawyers. The entry-level rank for a lawyer, junior police prosecutor, outranks the most senior rank for a policeman, chief superintendent, as the former is the most junior of the &quot;higher ranks&quot; whereas the latter is the most senior of the &quot;lower ranks&quot;.

The fire brigades (all municipal) still use &quot;konstabel&quot; as in &quot;brannkonstabel&quot; (fire-constable).

In 2016 the Royal Norwegian Navy started using &quot;konstabel&quot; to describe the enlisted ranks in the navy. Other ranks (OR) 2 to 4+ all use the term &quot;konstabel&quot;:

* OR 2 Visekonstabel
* OR 3 Ledende Visekonstabel
* OR 4 Konstabel
* OR 4+ Ledende Konstabel

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, constable and head constable are, respectively, the lowest and second-lowest ranks in the police force. The police constables in Pakistan do a wide range of duties like patrol, crime detection, escort of prisoners and VIPs, vehicle traffic control on roads, riot control, assisting civil administration during disasters, epidemic, elections and other tasks.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, the constable (Polish: &quot;posterunkowy&quot;) is the lowest rank in the Police. The next rank in hierarchy is the senior constable (Polish: &quot;starszy posterunkowy&quot;), and then, the sergeant. To be promoted, the police officer has to serve as a constable for a year, and again for a year as a senior constable.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, a police constable (abbreviated to PC) is the lowest rank in the Singapore Police Force.

The rank of special constable exists, but is centralised under the Volunteer Special Constabulary in Singapore.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, this rank is the lowest in the South African Police Service

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Police have the rank of &quot;police constable&quot;, with four classes.

===United Kingdom===

There are two main definitions of a constable in the United Kingdom:
*The lowest rank of a police force.
*A legal term for an officer with the powers of a police officer.
The latter usage is mainly in formal contexts, including legislation such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. By this definition all police officers are constables, even those that do not hold the actual rank of constable. The head of most police forces is a chief constable, volunteer officers of any rank are known as special constables, and some police forces have the word &quot;Constabulary&quot; in their name.

===United States===
In the United States, use of the term constable is varied, and use may differ within a state. A constable may be an official responsible for service of process, such as summonses and subpoenas for people to appear in court in criminal and/or civil matters; on the other hand, they can be fully empowered law enforcement officers. Constables may also have additional specialized duties unique to the office. In some states, a constable may be appointed by the governor or a judge or magistrate of the court which he or she serves; in others the constable is an elected or appointed position at the state or local level of local government. Their jurisdiction can vary from statewide to county/parish and local township boundaries based on the state&#x27;s laws.

The office developed from its British counterpart during the colonial period. Prior to the modernization of law enforcement which took place in the mid-19th century, local law enforcement was performed by constables and watchmen. Constables were appointed or elected at the local level for specific terms and, like their UK counterparts the parish constable, were not paid and did not wear a uniform. However, they were often paid a fee by the courts for each writ served and warrant executed. Following the example of the British Metropolitan Police established in 1829, the states gradually enacted laws to permit municipalities to establish police departments. This differed from the UK in that the old system was not uniformly abolished in every state. Often the enacting legislation of the state conferred a police officer with the powers of a constable, the most important of these powers being the common law power of arrest. Police and constables exist concurrently in many jurisdictions. Perhaps because of this, the title &quot;constable&quot; is not used for police of any rank. The lowest rank in a police organization would be officer, deputy, patrolman, trooper and, historically, private, depending on the particular organization.

In many states, constables do not conduct patrols or preventive policing activities. In such states the office is relatively obscure to its citizens.

A constable may be assisted by deputy constables as sworn officers or constable&#x27;s officers as civil staff, usually as process servers. In some states, villages or towns, an office with similar duties is marshal.

==Historical usage==
===Medieval Armenia and Georgia===
The titles of &quot;sparapet&quot; and &quot;spaspet&quot;, derived from the ancient Iranian &quot;spahbod&quot;, were used to designate the supreme commander of the armed forces in the medieval kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia, respectively.

===Byzantine Empire===
The position of constable originated from the Roman Empire; by the 5th century AD the Count of the Stable () was responsible for the keeping of horses at the imperial court. The West European term &quot;constable&quot; itself was adopted, via the Normans, as &quot;konostaulos&quot; in the Komnenian and Palaiologan periods, when it became a high military office of dignity.

Late Roman administrative titles were used by Charlemagne in developing his empire; the position of Constable, along with the similar office of Marshal, spread throughout the emerging states of Western Europe during this period. In most medieval nations, the constable was the highest-ranking officer of the army, and was responsible for the overseeing of martial law.

===China===
Village-level Chinese officialsknown as &quot;tingzhang&quot; during the Qin and Han dynasties, &quot;lizheng&quot;, during the Sui and Tang, &quot;baozheng&quot; during the Song, and &quot;dibao&quot; and &quot;shoubao&quot; during the Qingare sometimes translated constable for their functions of reporting crimes and administering local justice, although they also served as tax agents and notaries.

===France===

The Constable of France (&quot;Connétable de France&quot;), under the French monarchy, was the First Officer of the Crown of France and was originally responsible for commanding the army. His symbol of office was a longsword held by a hand issuing out of a cloud, a reference to the constable&#x27;s duty of carrying the king&#x27;s sword during a coronation ceremony. Some constables were prominent military commanders in the medieval period, such as Bertrand du Guesclin who served from 1370 to 1380.

===United Kingdom===

The office of the constable was introduced in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066 and was responsible for the keeping and maintenance of the king&#x27;s armaments and those of the villages as a measure of protecting individual settlements throughout the country. Some authorities place the origins of constables in England earlier, attributing the creation of the office to during the reign of King Alfred (871 A.D.).

The office of Lord High Constable, one of the Great Officers of State, was established in the kingdoms of England and Scotland during the reigns of King Stephen (1135–1154) and King David (1124–1154) respectively, and was responsible for the command of the army. However, the term was also used at the local level within the feudal system, describing an officer appointed to keep order. One of the first descriptions of one of the legal duties of a constable, that of the collation of evidence, comes from Bracton, a jurist writing between 1220 and 1250:
In whatever way they come and on whatever day, it is the duty of the constable to everything in order, for he has record as to the things he sees; but he cannot judge, because there is no judgment at the Tower, since there the third element of a judicial proceeding is lacking, namely a judge and jurisdiction. He has record as to matters of fact, not matters of judgment and law. In Bracton&#x27;s time, anyone seeing a &quot;misdeed&quot; was empowered to make an arrest. The role of the constable in Bracton&#x27;s description was as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the court, finding evidence and recording facts on which judges could make a ruling. By extension, the constable was also the &quot;strong arm&quot; of the court (i.e., of the common law), marking the basic role of the constable that continues into the present day.

In 1285, King Edward I of England passed the Statute of Winchester, with provisions which &quot;constituted two constables in every hundred to prevent s in towns and [on] highways&quot;. Records of their narrower area successors, parish constables, appear in the early 17th century in the records of Buckinghamshire; traditionally they were elected by the parishioners, but from 1617 onwards were typically appointed by justices of the peace (magistrates) in each county.

The system of policing by unpaid parish constables continued in England until the 19th century; in the London metropolitan area it started to be ended with the creation of the Metropolitan Police by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829, and was completely ended by the Metropolitan Police Act 1839. Outside London, the mandatory introduction of county police forces by the County and Borough Police Act 1856, after nearly 20 years of the permissive County Police Act 1839, finally ended parish constables. After 1856, all areas of England and Wales were covered by a police force. The lowest rank of the police forces and constabularies is &quot;constable&quot;, and most outside London are headed by a chief constable.

The unique office of &#x27;Parks Constable&#x27; was first created when section 221 of the Liverpool Corporation Act 1921 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5. c. lxxiv) allowed for their appointment; prior to that a body of constables, whom were attested as special constables, had policed the parks. Specific legislation for the Royal Parks of London continued the unique office of &#x27;Parks Constable&#x27;. However, the Royal Parks Constabulary was disbanded in 2001. The Kew Constabulary are sworn in under the same legislation and remain as the holders of the office of Parks Constable. Whilst some local authorities have parks constabularies, their officers are attested as constables, not parks constables.

===Other European nations===
The position of hereditary constable persists in some current or former monarchies of Europe. The position of Lord High Constable of Scotland is hereditary in the family of the Earl of Erroll. There is also a hereditary constable of Navarre in Spain; this position is currently held by the Duke of Alba.

Historically, many other hereditary constables existed as officers of state in former monarchies. Examples are the Constable of Castile (&quot;Condestable de Castilla&quot;) and the Constable of Portugal (&quot;Condestável do Reino&quot;).

<text>Turner is a common surname originating from Normandy, France, arriving in England after the Norman conquest with the earliest known records dated in the 12th century. It is the 28th-most common surname in the United Kingdom.

Most often it derives from an occupational name applied to a maker of small objects out of wood, metal or bone, by turning on a lathe (from Old French &quot;tornier&quot;, &quot;lathe&quot;, ultimately from Latin). In this sense it is analogous to the German surnames Drexel, Drechsler, Dressler, and Dreyer, Polish , Finnish , Russian Токарев (&quot;Tokarev&quot;) and related to English surnames such as Potter and Crocker.
Other occasional origins include Old French &quot;tournoieur&quot;, referring to someone either in charge of, or who participates in a tournament, and &quot;Turnhare&quot;, referring to a fast runner (one who can outrun a hare).

Early recordings of this surname include Ralph le Turner in the late 12th century. The earliest recorded spelling of this family name dates from 1180 for &quot;Warner le Turnur&quot;.

<text>Richard Wilson (1 August 1714 – 15 May 1782) was an influential Welsh landscape painter, who worked in Britain and Italy. With George Lambert he is recognised as a pioneer in British art of landscape for its own sake and was described in the Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales as the &quot;most distinguished painter Wales has ever produced and the first to appreciate the aesthetic possibilities of his country&quot;. In December 1768 Wilson became one of the founder-members of the Royal Academy. A &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of the artist&#x27;s work compiled by Paul Spencer-Longhurst is published by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.

==Life==
The son of a clergyman, Richard Wilson was born on 1 August 1714, in the village of Penegoes in Montgomeryshire (now Powys). The family was an established one, and Wilson was first cousin to Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. In 1729 he went to London, where he began as a portrait painter, under the apprenticeship of an obscure artist, Thomas Wright. Wilson could often be found walking around Marylebone Gardens with his acquaintance Baretti heading toward the Farthing Pie House, now known as the Greene Man.

From 1750 to 1757 Wilson was in Italy, and became a landscape painter on the advice of Francesco Zuccarelli. Painting in Italy and afterwards in Britain, he was the first major British painter to concentrate on landscape. He composed well, but saw and rendered only the general effects of nature, thereby creating a personal, ideal style influenced by Claude Lorrain and the Dutch landscape tradition. John Ruskin wrote that Wilson &quot;paints in a manly way, and occasionally reaches exquisite tones of colour&quot;. He concentrated on painting idealised Italianate landscapes and landscapes based upon classical literature, but when his painting, &quot;The Destruction of the Children of Niobe&quot; (c.1759–60), won acclaim, he gained many commissions from landowners seeking classical portrayals of their estates. 
Among Wilson&#x27;s pupils was the painter Thomas Jones. His landscapes were acknowledged as an influence by Constable, John Crome and Turner.

Wilson died at Colomendy, Denbighshire on 15 May 1782, and is buried in the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Mold, Flintshire.

<text>Franz Xaver Gruber (25 November 1787 – 7 June 1863) was an Austrian primary school teacher, church organist and composer in the village of Arnsdorf, who is best known for composing the music to &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; (&quot;Silent Night&quot;).

==Life==
Gruber was born on 25 November 1787 in the village of Hochburg-Ach, Upper Austria, the son of linen weavers, Josef and Maria Gruber. His given name was recorded in the baptismal record as &quot;Conrad Xavier,&quot; but this was later changed to &quot;Franz Xaver&quot;. The Hochburger schoolteacher Andreas Peterlechner gave him music lessons.


Gruber worked as a weaver until the age of 18, then trained to become a schoolteacher. He completed his music education studying with the church organist of Burghausen, Georg Hartdobler. In 1807 Gruber became a schoolteacher in Arnsdorf. He also became the church caretaker and organist. In 1808 he married a widow, Maria Elisabeth Fischinger Engelsberger. They had two children, both of whom died young. After the death of his first wife in 1825, Gruber married a former student, Maria Breitfuss. They had ten children, four of whom survived to adulthood. In 1829 Gruber moved to Berndorf, and in later years to Hallein, Salzburg, where he was named choir director, singer and organist.

Maria Gruber died in childbirth in 1841. The following year he married Katherine Wimmer.

==&quot;Silent Night&quot;==
In 1816 he took on the additional responsibilities of organist and choirmaster at the Nikolauskirche in the neighboring village of Oberndorf.

Together with Joseph Mohr, a Catholic priest who wrote the original German lyrics, Gruber composed the music for the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot;. On Christmas Eve of 1818, Mohr, an assistant priest at the Nikolauskirche, showed Gruber a six-stanza poem he had written in 1816. He asked Gruber to set the poem to music. The organ was in fine condition but a yearly tradition of sharing a new carol continued. The two men sang &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; for the first time at Christmas Mass in St Nicholas Church while Mohr played guitar and the choir repeated the last two lines of each verse. For a long time many thought that Silent Night was written by Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven.

In later years, Gruber composed additional arrangements of the carol for organ and for organ with orchestra, as well as scores of other carols and masses, many of which are still in print and sung today in Austrian churches.

== Family ==
Gruber was the son of Joseph Gruber (1761-1821) and Anna Gruber (1766-1825). He was married three times: first to Elizabeth Tischinger (1781-1825), then to Maria Breitfuss (1806-1841) and finally to Katharina Wimmer (1842-1873). He had two sons with his second wife: Felix (1823-1868) and Franz (1827-1917).

<doc id="153942" wikidata="Q165425" url="?curid=153942" title="Battle of Lepanto">
<text>The Battle of Lepanto was a naval engagement that took place on 7 October 1571 when a fleet of the Holy League, a coalition of Catholic states arranged by Pope Pius V, inflicted a major defeat on the fleet of the Ottoman Empire in the Gulf of Patras. The Ottoman forces were sailing westward from their naval station in Lepanto (the Venetian name of ancient Naupactus – Greek , Turkish ) when they met the fleet of the Holy League which was sailing east from Messina, Sicily.

The fleet of the Holy League consisted of 109 galleys and six galleasses from the Republic of Venice, 49 galleys from the Spanish Empire, 27 galleys from the Republic of Genoa, seven galleys from the Papal States, five galleys from the Order of Saint Stephen and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, three galleys from the Duchy of Savoy, three galleys from the Knights of Malta and some private ships. John of Austria, half-brother of Philip II of Spain, was named by Pope Pius V as overall commander of the fleet and led the centre division along with Papal captain Marcantonio Colonna and the Venetian Sebastiano Venier; the wings were commanded by the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo and the Genoese Gianandrea Doria. The Ottoman fleet consisted of 222 galleys and 56 galliots and was led by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, Mahomet Sirocco and Occhiali.

In the history of naval warfare, Lepanto marks the last major engagement in the Western world to be fought almost entirely between rowing vessels, namely the galleys and galleasses which were the direct descendants of ancient trireme warships. The battle was in essence an &quot;infantry battle on floating platforms&quot;. It was the largest naval battle in Western history since classical antiquity, involving more than 450 warships. Over the following decades, the increasing importance of the galleon and the line of battle tactic would displace the galley as the major warship of its era, marking the beginning of the &quot;Age of Sail&quot;.

The victory of the Holy League is of great importance in the history of Europe and of the Ottoman Empire, with the Ottoman fleet almost completely destroyed. However, the battle had no lasting impact on the Ottoman navy as the Ottomans rapidly rebuilt their fleet in under 6 months. The battle has long been compared to the Battle of Salamis, both for tactical parallels and for its crucial importance in the defense of Europe against imperial expansion. It was also of great symbolic importance in a period when Europe was torn by its own wars of religion following the Protestant Reformation. Pope Pius V instituted the feast of Our Lady of Victory, and Philip II of Spain used the victory to strengthen his position as the &quot;Most Catholic King&quot; and defender of Christendom against Muslim incursion. Historian Paul K. Davis writes that

More than a military victory, Lepanto was a moral one. For decades, the Ottoman Turks had terrified Europe, and the victories of Suleiman the Magnificent caused Christian Europe serious concern. The defeat at Lepanto further exemplified the rapid deterioration of Ottoman might under Selim II, and Christians rejoiced at this setback for the Ottomans. The mystique of Ottoman power was tarnished significantly by this battle, and Christian Europe was heartened.

== Background ==


The Christian coalition had been promoted by Pope Pius V to rescue the Venetian colony of Famagusta on the island of Cyprus, which was being besieged by the Turks in early 1571 subsequent to the fall of Nicosia and other Venetian possessions in Cyprus in the course of 1570. On 1 August the Venetians surrendered after being reassured that they could leave Cyprus freely. However, the Ottoman commander, Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha had lost some 50,000 men in the siege and broke his word, imprisoning the Venetians, and had Marco Antonio Bragadin flayed alive.

The members of the Holy League were the Republic of Venice, the Spanish Empire (including the Kingdom of Naples, the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdoms of Sicily and Sardinia as part of the Spanish possessions), the Papal States, the Republic of Genoa, the Duchies of Savoy, Urbino and Tuscany, the Knights Hospitaller, and others.

The banner for the fleet, blessed by the Pope, reached the Kingdom of Naples (then ruled by Philip II of Spain) on 14 August 1571, where it was solemnly consigned to John of Austria.

All members of the alliance viewed the Ottoman navy as a significant threat, both to the security of maritime trade in the Mediterranean Sea and to the security of continental Europe itself. Spain was the largest financial contributor, though the Spaniards preferred to preserve most of their galleys for Spain&#x27;s own wars against the nearby sultanates of the Barbary Coast rather than expend its naval strength for the benefit of Venice. The combined Christian fleet was placed under the command of John of Austria with 
Marcantonio Colonna as his principal deputy. The various Christian contingents met the main force from Venice under Sebastiano Venier, later Doge of Venice, in July and August 1571 at Messina, Sicily.

==Deployment and order of battle==

The Christian fleet consisted of 206 galleys and six galleasses (large new galleys with substantial artillery, developed by the Venetians). John of Austria, half-brother of Philip II of Spain, was named by Pope Pius V as overall commander of the fleet and led the centre division, with his principal deputies and counselors being the Roman Marcantonio Colonna and the Venetian Sebastiano Venier; the wings were commanded by the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo and the Genoese Gianandrea Doria. The Republic of Venice contributed 109 galleys and six galleasses, 49 galleys came from the Spanish Empire (including 26 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily, and other Italian territories), 27 galleys of the Genoese fleet, seven galleys from the Papal States, five galleys from the Order of Saint Stephen and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, three galleys each from the Duchy of Savoy and the Knights of Malta, and some privately owned galleys in Spanish service. This fleet of the Christian alliance was manned by 40,000 sailors and oarsmen. In addition, it carried approximately 30,000 fighting troops: 7,000 Spanish Empire regular infantry of excellent quality, (4,000 of the Spanish Empire&#x27;s troops were drawn from the Kingdom of Naples, mostly Calabria), 7,000 Germans, 6,000 Italian mercenaries in Spanish pay, all good troops, in addition to 5,000 professional Venetian soldiers. A significant number of Greeks also participated in the conflict on the side of the Holy League with three Venetian galleys commanded by Greek captains. The historian George Finlay estimated that over 25,000 Greeks fought on the side of the Holy League during the battle (both as soldiers and sailors/oarsmen) and stated that their numbers &quot;far exceeded that of the combatants of any other nation engaged&quot;.

Oarsmen were mainly drawn from local Greek populations, who were experienced in maritime affairs, although there were some Venetian oarsmen as well. Free oarsmen were generally acknowledged to be superior to enslaved or imprisoned oarsmen, but the former were gradually replaced in all galley fleets (including those of Venice from 1549) during the 16th century by cheaper slaves, convicts, and prisoners-of-war owing to rapidly rising costs. The Venetian oarsmen were mainly free citizens and able to bear arms, adding to the fighting power of their ships, whereas convicts were used to row many of the galleys in other Holy League squadrons.

Ali Pasha, the Ottoman admiral (&quot;Kapudan-i Derya&quot;), supported by the corsairs Mehmed Sirocco (Mehmed Şuluk) of Alexandria and Uluç Ali, commanded an Ottoman force of 222 war galleys, 56 galliots, and some smaller vessels. The Turks had skilled and experienced crews of sailors but were significantly deficient in their elite corps of janissaries. The number of oarsmen was about 37,000, virtually all of them slaves, many of them Christians who had been captured in previous conquests and engagements. The Ottoman galleys were manned by 13,000 experienced sailors—generally drawn from the maritime nations of the Ottoman Empire—mainly Greeks (according to Finlay, around 5,000), Berbers, Syrians, and Egyptians—and 25,000 soldiers from the Ottoman Empire as well as a few thousand from their North African allies.

While soldiers on board the ships were roughly matched in numbers, an advantage for the Christians was the numerical superiority in guns and cannon aboard their ships. It is estimated that the Christians had 1,815 guns, while the Turks had only 750 with insufficient ammunition. The Christians embarked with their much improved arquebusier and musketeer forces, while the Ottomans trusted in their greatly feared composite bowmen.

The Christian fleet started from Messina on 16 September, crossing the Adriatic and creeping along the coast, arriving at the group of rocky islets lying just north of the opening of the Gulf of Corinth on 6 October. Serious conflict had broken out between Venetian and Spanish soldiers, and Venier enraged Don Juan by hanging a Spanish soldier for impudence. Despite bad weather, the Christian ships sailed south and, on 6 October, reached the port of Sami, Cephalonia (then also called Val d&#x27;Alessandria), where they remained for a while.

Early on 7 October, they sailed toward the Gulf of Patras, where they encountered the Ottoman fleet. While neither fleet had immediate strategic resources or objectives in the gulf, both chose to engage. The Ottoman fleet had an express order from Selim II to fight, and John of Austria found it necessary to attack in order to maintain the integrity of the expedition in the face of personal and political disagreements within the Holy League. On the morning of 7 October, after the decision to offer battle was made, the Christian fleet formed up in four divisions in a north–south line:
* At the northern end, closest to the coast, was the Left Division of 53 galleys, mainly Venetian, led by Agostino Barbarigo, with Marco Querini and Antonio da Canale in support.
* The Centre Division consisted of 62 galleys under John of Austria himself in his &quot;Real&quot;, along with Marcantonio Colonna commanding the papal flagship, Venier commanding the Venetian flagship, Paolo Giordano I Orsini and Pietro Giustiniani, prior of Messina, commanding the flagship of the Knights of Malta, and Diego Fernández de Medrano, captain of the &quot;Fortuna de Napoli&quot; galley, positioned near John of Austria in the central division.
* The Right Division to the south consisted of another 53 galleys under the Genoese Giovanni Andrea Doria, great-nephew of admiral Andrea Doria.
* A reserve division was stationed behind (that is, to the west of) the main fleet, to lend support wherever it might be needed, commanded by Álvaro de Bazán, the Marquis of Santa Cruz.

The Ottoman fleet consisted of 57 galleys and two galliots on its right under Mehmed Siroco, 61 galleys and 32 galliots in the centre under Ali Pasha in the &quot;Sultana&quot;, and about 63 galleys and 30 galliots in the south offshore under Uluç Ali. A small reserve consisted of eight galleys, 22 galliots, and 64 fustas, behind the centre body. Ali Pasha is supposed to have told his Christian galley slaves, &quot;If I win the battle, I promise you your liberty. If the day is yours, then God has given it to you.&quot; John of Austria, more laconically, warned his crew, &quot;There is no paradise for cowards.&quot;

== Battle ==
The lookout on the &quot;Real&quot; sighted the Turkish van at dawn of 7 October. Don Juan called a council of war and decided to offer battle. He travelled through his fleet in a swift sailing vessel, exhorting his officers and men to do their utmost. The Sacrament was administered to all, the galley slaves were freed from their chains, and the standard of the Holy League was raised to the truck of the flagship.

The wind was at first against the Christians, and it was feared that the Turks would be able to make contact before a line of battle could be formed. But around noon, shortly before contact, the wind shifted to favour the Christians, enabling most of the squadrons to reach their assigned position before contact. Four galeasses stationed in front of the Christian battle line opened fire at close quarters at the foremost Turkish galleys, confusing their battle array in the crucial moment of contact. Around noon, first contact was made between the squadrons of Barbarigo and Sirocco, close to the northern shore of the Gulf. Barbarigo had attempted to stay so close to the shore as to prevent Sirocco from surrounding him, but Sirocco, knowing the depth of the waters, managed to still insert galleys between Barbarigo&#x27;s line and the coast. In the ensuing mêlée, the ships came so close to each other as to form an almost continuous platform of hand-to-hand fighting in which both leaders were killed. The Christian galley slaves freed from the Turkish ships were supplied with arms and joined in the fighting, turning the battle in favour of the Christian side.

Meanwhile, the centres clashed with such force that Ali Pasha&#x27;s galley drove into the &quot;Real&quot; as far as the fourth rowing bench, and hand-to-hand fighting commenced around the two flagships, between the Spanish Tercio infantry and the Turkish janissaries. When the &quot;Real&quot; was nearly taken, Colonna came alongside, with the bow of his galley, and mounted a counter-attack. With the help of Colonna, the Turks were pushed off the &quot;Real&quot; and the Turkish flagship was boarded and swept. The entire crew of turkish&#x27;s flagship was killed, including Ali Pasha himself. The banner of the Holy League was hoisted on the captured ship, breaking the morale of the Turkish galleys nearby. After two hours of fighting, the Turks were beaten left and centre, although fighting continued for another two hours. A flag taken at Lepanto by the Knights of Saint Stephen, said to be the standard of the Turkish commander, is still on display, in the Church of the seat of the Order in Pisa.

On the Christian right, the situation was different, as Doria continued sailing towards the south instead of taking his assigned position. He would explain his conduct after the battle by saying that he was trying to prevent an enveloping manoeuvre by the Turkish left. But Doria&#x27;s captains were enraged, interpreting their commander&#x27;s signals as a sign of treachery. When Doria had opened a wide gap with the Christian centre, Uluç Ali swung around and fell on Colonna&#x27;s southern flank, with Doria too far away to interfere. Ali attacked a group of some fifteen galleys around the flagship of the Knights of Malta, threatening to break into the Christian centre and still turn the tide of the battle. This was prevented by the arrival of the reserve squadron commanded by Bazán. Uluç Ali was forced to retreat, escaping the battle with the captured flag of the Knights of Malta.

Isolated fighting continued until the evening. Even after the battle had clearly turned against the Turks, groups of janissaries kept fighting to the last. It is said that at some point the Janissaries ran out of weapons and started throwing oranges and lemons at their Christian adversaries, leading to awkward scenes of laughter among the general misery of battle. Many Greek rowers serving on Turkish galleys managed to seize them with mutiny and deliver them in time to the Christian allies. At the end of the battle, the Christians had taken 117 galleys and 20 galliots, and sunk or destroyed some 50 other ships. Around ten thousand Turks were taken prisoner, and many thousands of Christian slaves were rescued. The Christian side suffered around 7,500 deaths, the Turkish side about 30,000.

== Aftermath ==

The engagement was a significant defeat for the Ottomans, who had not lost a major naval battle since the fifteenth century. However, the Holy League failed to capitalize on the victory, and while the Ottoman defeat has often been cited as the historical turning-point initiating the eventual stagnation of Ottoman territorial expansion, this was by no means an immediate consequence. The Christian victory at Lepanto confirmed the &quot;de facto&quot; division of the Mediterranean, with the eastern half under firm Ottoman control and the western under the Spanish Crown and their Italian allies. The battle halted the Ottoman encroachment on Italian territories, but the Holy League did not regain any territories that had been lost to the Ottomans prior to Lepanto. Historian Paul K. Davis sums up the importance of Lepanto this way: &quot;This Turkish defeat stopped Ottomans&#x27; expansion into the Mediterranean, thus maintaining Western dominance, and confidence grew in the West that Turks, previously unstoppable, could be beaten.&quot;

The Ottomans were quick to rebuild their navy. By 1572, about six months after the defeat, more than 150 galleys, 8 galleasses, and in total 250 ships had been built, including eight of the largest capital ships ever seen in the Mediterranean. With this new fleet the Ottoman Empire was able to reassert its supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Sultan Selim II&#x27;s Chief Minister, the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, even boasted to the Venetian emissary Marcantonio Barbaro that the Christian triumph at Lepanto caused no lasting harm to the Ottoman Empire, while the capture of Cyprus by the Ottomans in the same year was a significant blow, saying that:
In 1572, the allied Christian fleet resumed operations and faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha, but the Ottoman commander actively avoided engaging the allied fleet and headed for the safety of the fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don Juan squandered the opportunity.

Pius V died on 1 May 1572. The diverging interests of the League members began to show, and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don Juan attacked and took Tunis, only for it to be retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of its Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of Friuli, and eager to cut its losses and resume the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated unilateral negotiations with the Porte.

The Holy League was disbanded with the peace treaty of 7 March 1573, which concluded the War of Cyprus. Venice was forced to accept loser&#x27;s terms in spite of the victory at Lepanto. Cyprus was formally ceded to the Ottoman Empire, and Venice agreed to pay an indemnity of 300,000 ducats. In addition, the border between the two powers in Dalmatia was modified by the Turkish occupation of small but important parts of the hinterland that included the most fertile agricultural areas near the cities, with adverse effects on the economy of the Venetian cities in the region. Peace would hold between the two states until the Cretan War of 1645.

In 1574, the Ottomans retook the strategic city of Tunis from the Spanish-supported Hafsid dynasty, which had been re-installed after John of Austria&#x27;s forces reconquered the city from the Ottomans the year before. Thanks to the long-standing Franco-Ottoman alliance, the Ottomans were able to resume naval activity in the western Mediterranean. In 1576, the Ottomans assisted in Abdul Malik&#x27;s capture of Fez – this reinforced the Ottoman indirect conquests in Morocco that had begun under Suleiman the Magnificent. The establishment of Ottoman suzerainty over the area placed the entire southern coast of the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to Greece under Ottoman authority, with the exceptions of the Spanish-controlled trading city of Oran and strategic settlements such as Melilla and Ceuta. But after 1580, the Ottoman Empire could no longer compete with the advances of European navies, especially following the development of the galleon and line of battle tactics.

==Legacy==

===Commemoration===
The Holy League credited the victory to the Virgin Mary, whose intercession with God they had implored for victory through the use of the Rosary. Andrea Doria had kept a copy of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe given to him by King Philip II of Spain in his ship&#x27;s state room. Pope Pius V instituted a new Catholic feast day of Our Lady of Victory to commemorate the battle, which is now celebrated by the Catholic Church as the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary. Dominican friar Juan Lopez in his 1584 book on the rosary states that the feast of the rosary was offered &quot;in memory and in perpetual gratitude of the miraculous victory that the Lord gave to his Christian people that day against the Turkish armada&quot;. A piece of commemorative music composed after the victory is the motet &quot;Canticum Moysis&quot; (Song of Moses Exodus 15) &quot;Pro victoria navali contra Turcas&quot; by the Spanish composer based in Rome Fernando de las Infantas. The other piece of music is Jacobus de Kerle&#x27;s &quot;Cantio octo vocum de sacro foedere contra Turcas&quot; 1572 (Song in Eight Voices on the Holy League Against the Turks), in the opinion of Pettitt (2006) an &quot;exuberantly militaristic&quot; piece celebrating the victory. There were celebrations and festivities with &quot;triumphs&quot; and pageants at Rome and Venice with Turkish slaves in chains.

===Accounts===
Giovanni Pietro Contarini&#x27;s &quot;History of the Events, which occurred from the Beginning of the War Brought against the Venetians by Selim the Ottoman, to the Day of the Great and Victorious Battle against the Turks&quot; was published in 1572, a few months after Lepanto. It was the first comprehensive account of the war, and the only one to attempt a concise but complete overview of its course and the Holy League&#x27;s triumph. Contarini&#x27;s account went beyond effusive praise and mere factual reporting to examine the meaning and importance of these events. It is also the only full historical account by an immediate commentator, blending his straightforward narrative with keen and consistent reflections on the political philosophy of conflict in the context of the Ottoman–Catholic confrontation in the early modern Mediterranean.

===Paintings===
There are many pictorial representations of the battle. Prints of the order of battle appeared in Venice and Rome in 1571. Numerous paintings were commissioned, including one in the Doge&#x27;s Palace, Venice, by Andrea Vicentino on the walls of the &quot;Sala dello Scrutinio&quot;, which replaced Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Victory of Lepanto&quot;, destroyed by fire in 1577. Titian painted the battle in the background of an allegorical work showing Philip II of Spain holding his infant son, Don Fernando, his male heir born shortly after the victory, on 4 December 1571. An angel descends from heaven bearing a palm branch with a motto for Fernando, who is held up by Philip: &quot;Majora tibi&quot; (may you achieve greater deeds; Fernando died as a child, in 1578).

&quot;The Allegory of the Battle of Lepanto&quot; (c. 1572, oil on canvas, 169 x 137 cm, Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia, Venice) is a painting by Paolo Veronese. The lower half of the painting shows the events of the battle, whilst at the top a female personification of Venice is presented to the Virgin Mary, with Saint James Major (patron of Spain), Saint Peter (patron of the Papal States), Saint Justina (patron of Padua), Saint Mark (patron of Venice), and a group of angels in attendance.

A painting by Wenceslas Cobergher, dated to the end of the 16th century, now in San Domenico Maggiore, shows what is interpreted as a victory procession in Rome on the return of admiral Colonna. On the stairs of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Pius V is visible in front of a kneeling figure, identified as Marcantonio Colonna returning the standard of the Holy League to the pope. On high is the Madonna and child with victory palms.

Tommaso Dolabella painted his &quot;The Battle of Lepanto&quot; in c. 1625–1630 on the commission of Stanisław Lubomirski, commander of the Polish left wing in the Battle of Khotyn (1621). The monumental painting (3.05 m × 6.35 m) combines the Polish victory procession following this battle with the backdrop of the Battle of Lepanto. It was later owned by the Dominicans of Poznań and since 1927 has been on display in Wawel Castle, Kraków.

&quot;The Battle of Lepanto&quot; by Juan Luna (1887) is displayed at the Spanish Senate in Madrid.
===Sculpture===
The statue of John of Austria in Messina was erected by decision of the city&#x27;s Senate in 1571, as John had returned to Messina after the battle. It was sculpted by Andrea Calamech and dedicated in 1572.

===Poetry and fiction===
There was an immediate poetical response to the victory at Lepanto. In Italy alone 233 titles of sonnets, madrigals and poems were printed between 1571 and 1573, some of these including writing in dialect or Latin.

This was replicated by the Spanish response, with poems in Catalan and the Mallorcan dialect and full scale epics by Juan Latino (&quot;Austriados libri duo&quot; 1573), Jerónimo Corte-Real ( &quot;Austriada ou Felicissima Victoria&quot;, 1578) and :es:Juan Rufo (&quot;La Austriada&quot;, 1586). Though these longer works have, in the words of a later critic, &quot;not unjustly been consigned to that oblivion which few epics have escaped&quot;, there was also a Spanish ballad which retained its popularity and was translated into English by Thomas Rodd in 1818.

The most popular British poem on the subject was &quot;The Lepanto&quot; by King James VI of Scotland. Written in fourteeners about 1585, its thousand lines were ultimately collected in &quot;His Maiesties Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres&quot; (1591), then published separately in 1603 after James had become king of England too. There were also translations in other languages, including into Dutch as &quot;Den Slach van Lepanten&quot; (1593) by Abraham van der Myl, &quot;La Lepanthe&quot;, the French version by Du Bartas, accompanied James&#x27; 1591 edition; a Latin version, the &quot;Naupactiados Metaphrasis&quot; by Thomas Murray (1564–1623), followed a year after James&#x27; 1603 publication.

The royal connection ensured that the battle was featured in Stuart aquatic pageants representing sea battles between Christians and Turks well into the reign. In 1632, the story of the battle was retold in couplets in Abraham Holland&#x27;s &quot;Naumachia&quot;.

Centuries later G. K. Chesterton revisited the conflict in his lively narrative poem &quot;Lepanto&quot;, first published in 1911 and republished many times since. It provided a series of poetic visions of the major characters in the battle, particularly the leader of the Christian forces, Don Juan of Austria, then closed with verses linking Miguel de Cervantes, who also fought in the battle, with the &quot;lean and foolish knight&quot; he would later immortalise in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

At the start of the 20th century too, Emilio Salgari devoted his historical novel, &quot;Il Leone di Damasco&quot; (&quot;The Lion of Damascus&quot;, 1910), to the Battle of Lepanto, which was eventually to be adapted to film by Corrado D&#x27;Errico in 1942.

In 1942 as well, English author Elizabeth Goudge has a character in her war-time novel, &quot;The Castle on the Hill&quot; (1942), recall the leading role of John of Austria in the battle and the presence of Cervantes there. Much as combatants had appropriated Chesterton&#x27;s poem to the circumstances of World War I, Goudge harnessed that ancient incident to British resistance to Nazi Germany during World War II.

<text>A vow (Lat. &quot;votum&quot;, vow, promise; see vote) is a promise or oath. A vow is used as a promise that is solemn rather than casual.

==Marriage vows==

Marriage vows are binding promises each partner in a couple makes to the other during a wedding ceremony. Marriage customs have developed over history and keep changing as human society develops. In earlier times and in most cultures the consent of the partners has not had the importance now attached to it, at least in Western societies and in those they have influenced. Protestants, for instance, consider marriage vow as an unchangeable divine law since it needs not only &quot;conciliar assertion&quot; but also the support of the Scripture, making marriage a form of divine ordinance.

==Divine vows==
Within the world of monks and nuns, a vow is sometimes a transaction between a person and a deity, where the former promises to render some service or gift, or devotes something valuable to the deity&#x27;s use. The vow is a kind of oath, with the deity being both the witness and recipient of the promise. For examples, see the Book of Judges or the Bodhisattva vows. In the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law, the vow and the oath are not considered acts of worship (&quot;cultus&quot;) like the liturgical celebration. However, they are considered acts of religion due to their sacred character, including the religious obligations they entail. Here, an important characteristic of the vow involves the manner by which non-Catholics are recognized to be capable of making a vow, which must also be fulfilled by reason of the virtue of religion.

The god is usually expected to grant, on entering into contracts or covenants with man, the claims his vow establishes on their benevolence, and valuing of his gratitude. Conversely, in taking a vow, the petitioner&#x27;s piety and spiritual attitude have begun to outweigh those merely ritual details of the ceremony that are all-important in magical rites.

Sometimes the old magical usage survives side by side with the more developed idea of a personal power to be approached in prayer. For example, in the Maghreb (in North Africa), in time of drought the maidens of Mazouna carry every evening in procession through the streets a doll called ghonja, really a dressed-up wooden spoon, symbolizing a pre-Islamic rain-spirit. Often one of the girls carries on her shoulders a sheep, and her companions sing the following words:

Here we have a sympathetic rain charm, combined with a prayer to the rain viewed as a personal goddess and with a promise or vow to give her the animal. The point of the promise lies of course in the fact that water is in that country stored and carried in sheep-skins.

Secondly, the vow is quite apart from established cults, and is not provided for in the religious calendar. The Roman vow (votum), as W. W. Fowler observes in his work &quot;The Roman Festivals&quot; (London, 1899), p. 346, &quot;was the exception, not the rule; it was a promise made by an individual at some critical moment, not the ordered and recurring ritual of the family or the State.&#x27; The vow, however, contained so large an element of ordinary prayer that in the Greek language one and the same word () expressed both. The characteristic mark of the vow, as the &quot;Suda&quot; and the Greek Church Fathers remark, was that it was a promise either of things to be offered to God in the future and at once consecrated to Him in view of their being so offered, or of austerities to be undergone. For offering and austerity, sacrifice and suffering, are equally calculated to appease an offended deity&#x27;s wrath or win his goodwill.

The Bible affords many examples of vows. Thus in Judges xi. Jephthah &quot;vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, then it shall be that whosoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the Lord&#x27;s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.&quot; In the sequel it is his own daughter who so meets him, and he sacrifices her after a respite of two months, granted so she could &quot;bewail her virginity upon the mountains.&quot; A thing or person thus vowed to the deity became holy and sanctified to God. (Jephthah could not have lawfully burned his daughter in sacrifice as it would constitute human sacrifice - something that God explicitly forbade. Some have suggested that his daughter remained unmarried and was given to serve the Lord in the temple.) It belonged to once to the sanctuary or to the priests who represented the god. In the Jewish religion, the latter, under certain conditions, defined in Leviticus 27, could permit it to be redeemed. But to substitute an unclean for a clean beast that had been vowed, or an imperfect victim for a flawless one, was to court with certainty the divine displeasure.

It is often difficult to distinguish a vow from an oath. A vow is an oath, but an oath is only a vow if the divine being is the recipient of the promise and is not merely a witness. Therefore, in Acts 23:21, over forty men, enemies of Paul, bound themselves, under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they had slain him. In the Christian Fathers we hear of vows to abstain from flesh diet and wine. But of the abstentions observed by votaries, those with no relation to the barber&#x27;s art were the commonest. Wherever individuals were concerned to create or confirm a tie connecting them with a god, a shrine or a particular religious circle, a hair-offering was in some form or other imperative. They began by polling their locks at the shrine and left them as a soul-token in charge of the god, and never polled them afresh until the vow was fulfilled. So Achilles consecrated his hair to the river Spercheus and vowed not to cut it until he should return safe from Troy; and the Hebrew Nazarite, whose strength resided in his flowing locks, only cut them off and burned them on the altar when the days of his vow were ended, and he could return to ordinary life, having achieved his mission. So in Acts 18:18 Paul had shorn his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow. In Acts 21:23 we hear of four men who, having a vow on them, had their heads shaved at Paul&#x27;s expense. Among the ancient Chatti, as Tacitus relates (&quot;Germania&quot;, 31), young men allowed their hair and beards to grow, and vowed to court danger in that guise until they each had slain an enemy.&quot;

In Christianity, the vow has more weight than an oath when approached from the view that it binds one to God whereas the oath binds one to man. This was explained further by St. Thomas Aquinas, who said:The obligation both of a vow and of an oath arises from something Divine; but in different ways. For the obligation of a vow arises from the fidelity we owe God, which binds us to fulfil our promises to Him. On the other hand, the obligation of an oath arises from the reverence we owe Him which binds us to fulfil our promises to Him.

<doc id="153948" wikidata="Q563" url="?curid=153948" title="Brigitte Fontaine">
<text>Brigitte Fontaine (born 24 June 1939) is a French singer of avant-garde music. She has employed numerous unusual musical styles, melding rock and roll, folk, jazz, electronica, spoken word poetry, and world. She has collaborated with Stereolab, Michel Colombier, Jean-Claude Vannier, Areski Belkacem, Gotan Project, Sonic Youth, Antoine Duhamel, Grace Jones, Noir Désir, Archie Shepp, Arno, and The Art Ensemble of Chicago.
She is also a novelist, playwright, poet, and actress.

== Early life ==
The daughter of two teachers, Brigitte Fontaine developed her taste for writing and drama very early. She spent her childhood in small villages of Finistère, then in Morlaix. At 17 years old, she moved to Paris to become an actress.

In 1971, she was one of the women who signed the Manifesto of the 343, publicly admitting to having an abortion at a time when it was illegal in France.

==Artistic overview==
===1963–1968===
In 1963, she turned to singing and appeared in several Parisian theatres, interpreting her own works. In 1964, she opened for Barbara and George Brassens&#x27;s show at the Bobino. Even so, she did not give up theatre. With Jacques Higelin and actor Rufus, she created the play &quot;Maman j&#x27;ai peur&quot; (&quot;Mom I am afraid&quot;), which played first at the Vieille-Grille theatre, and then at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. It met with such a critical and popular success that it stayed in Paris for more than two seasons and toured throughout Europe.

In 1965 and then in 1968, she made two albums, one jazz and one avant-pop, as well as two 45s with Jacques Higelin. In 1969, she began what would be a long collaboration with Kabyle musician Areski Belkacem. With Belkacem and in the company of Higelin, she conceived &quot;Niok&quot;, an innovative spectacle of theatre and song, for the Lucernaire theatre. Soon after, Fontaine wrote a series of works in free verse and prose which comprised the show &quot;Comme à la radio&quot; at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier before being turned into an album of the same name. Recorded with the Art Ensemble of Chicago, this album marks a clean break with traditional French songs, building the first bridges to world music.

===1969–1979===
Brigitte Fontaine became a major figure in the French underground. In a half-dozen albums, the majority of which were released through the independent label Saravah, Fontaine explored different poetic worlds. She renounced the use of rhyme, and using talk-over sometimes, she recorded, with very little means and often on two tracks, songs which addressed topics with humour or gravity, according to the mood, as various as death (&quot;Dommage que tu sois mort&quot;), life (&quot;L’été, l’été&quot;), alienation (&quot;Comme à la radio&quot;), madness (&quot;Ragilia&quot;), love (&quot;Je t’aimerai&quot;), social injustice (&quot;C’est normal&quot;), the inequality of the sexes (&quot;Patriarcat&quot;) and racism (&quot;Y&#x27; a du lard&quot;). However, she also knew how to make light of herself (&quot;L&#x27;Auberge (Révolution)&quot;).

Because they sail among pop, folk, electro and world music, the albums &quot;L&#x27;Incendie&quot; and &quot;Vous et Nous&quot; by the Areski-Fontaine duo figure among the most unclassifiable records of the French scene. Almost thirty years later, the international audience of these LPs (since re-edited for CD) is comparable to that of the cult record &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot; by Serge Gainsbourg and Jean-Claude Vannier, notably due to the enthusiastic remarks made by members of the band Sonic Youth in the English-speaking press.

===1980–1990===
The 1980s were a period of silence, musically speaking, for Brigitte Fontaine and her partner Areski Belkacem. Far from the recording studio, she devoted herself to writing and the theatre. Always active, she appeared onstage in Quebec, she performed her play &quot;Acte 2&quot; in a grand tour of the French-speaking world, interpreted &quot;Les Bonnes&quot; by Jean Genet in Paris, and published a novel (&quot;Paso doble&quot;) as well as a collection of short stories (&quot;Nouvelles de l’exil&quot;). In 1984, she recorded a single (&quot;Les Filles d’aujourd’hui&quot;).

After having given a series of concerts in Tokyo and other large Japanese cities, she had to wait about five years for a French company to distribute her new album &quot;French corazon&quot; (written and composed in 1984 but released in 1988 in Japan). Having been broadcast notably on French television, the video for the single &quot;Le Nougat&quot;, directed by comics artist Olivia Tele Clavel, prepared the public for the big return of the singer to the French stage which commenced with a concert in 1993 at the Bataclan.

===1990–2001===
In the 1990s, Brigitte Fontaine moved closer to the musical worlds of Björk and Massive Attack by testing new, more electric musical forms and, especially, more electronic forms than before. Her lyrics mark a return to a more classical, versified form. The release of her album &quot;Genre humain&quot;, in 1995, met with great success (more so on the part of the critics than the general public) with surprising titles like &quot;Conne&quot; (produced by Étienne Daho), lyric titles like &quot;La Femme à barbe&quot; (produced by Les Valentins), and poetic ones like &quot;Il se mêle à tout ça&quot; (produced by Yann Cortella and Areski Belkacem).

In 1997, while she published a new novel (&quot;La Limonade bleue&quot;), she recorded &quot;Les Palaces&quot; and its landmark track &quot;Ah que la vie est belle!&quot;. The album, very well received by the press, is enriched by the collaboration of Areski Belkacem, Jacques Higelin and Alain Bashung.

===2001–present===
Her albums &quot;Kékéland&quot; (2001) and &quot;Rue Saint Louis en l&#x27;Île&quot; (2004) benefited from prestigious collaborations with artists such as Noir désir (with whom she also co-wrote and recorded the 23-minute track &quot;L&#x27;Europe&quot; on des Visages des Figures), Sonic Youth, Archie Shepp, - M-, Gotan Project, Zebda, etc. In 2005, after having given a series of concerts with her usual band (but also with La Compagnie des musiques à ouïr), she published a new novel, &quot;La Bête curieuse&quot;, whose erotic ambiance somewhat foretold the tonality of her sixteenth album, &quot;Libido&quot; (2006). This new album renewed her concerts with a lively energy and gave them a very &quot;baroque &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; ambiance, in which Teresa of Avila, Sufis, Hollywood films, and Melody Nelson are invoked.

In October 2006, Fontaine appeared at the Barbican Centre in London along with Jarvis Cocker, Badly Drawn Boy and other English artists, for the first public interpretation of the mythic &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot;. In January 2007, she appeared onstage with graphic novelist Blutch at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. On 29 March 2007, she invested in the Olympia music hall, supported by her friends Jacno, Arthur H, Christophe, Anaïs, Jacques Higelin, Maya Barsony and Jean-Claude Vannier. In April, she played at the Printemps de Bourges music festival and participated in her Québécois admirer Pierre Lapointe&#x27;s concert for a duo of &quot;La Symphonie pastorale&quot;. After having given a series of intimate concerts all through September on a barge anchored under the Pont des Arts on the Seine river in Paris, Fontaine toured throughout France. Between two concerts, she went into the studio with Olivia Ruiz to record a new single, &quot;Partir ou rester&quot;, for which she wrote the lyrics.

In February 2008, she published a new novel, &quot;Travellings&quot; by Flammarion, while Benoît Mouchart wrote a monograph on her life and work(&quot;Brigitte Fontaine, intérieur/extérieur&quot;), published by Panama. A new album titled &quot;Prohibition&quot; and produced by Ivor Guest including collaborations with Grace Jones and Philippe Katerine was subsequently released in the fall of 2009. The lyrics of this new work mark the return of Brigitte Fontaine to an anti-authority political position.

In March 2011 she released a new album, also produced by Ivor Guest. It is called &quot;L&#x27;un n&#x27;empêche pas l&#x27;autre&quot;, and consists primarily of duets, among others the dance track &#x27;Dancefloor&#x27; with Grace Jones, which Polydor uploaded on their official site. In 2013, she released her latest album, named &quot;J&#x27;ai l&#x27;honneur d&#x27;être&quot;. The video for the first single &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; has been directed by Enki Bilal.

<doc id="153953" wikidata="Q22677" url="?curid=153953" title="Michael S. Hart">
<text>Michael Stern Hart (March 8, 1947 – September 6, 2011) was an American author, best known as the inventor of the e-book and the founder of Project Gutenberg (PG), the first project to make e-books freely available via the Internet. He published e-books via ARPANET years before the Internet existed, and later on BBS networks and Gopher servers.

Hart devoted his life after founding PG in 1971 to digitizing and distributing literature from works in the public domain with free and expired copyrights. The first e-books were typed in plain text format and published as text files; other formats were made available later. Hart typed most of the early e-books himself; later, volunteers expanded the project.

==Early life==
Michael Hart was born on March 8, 1947, in Tacoma, Washington. His father was an accountant and his mother, a former cryptanalyst during World War II, was a business manager at a retail store. In 1958 his family relocated to Urbana, Illinois, and his father and mother became college professors in Shakespearean studies and mathematics education, respectively. Hart attended the University of Illinois, graduating in just two years with a degree in Human-Machine Interfaces. He then attended but did not complete graduate school. He was also, briefly, a street musician.

==Project Gutenberg==
During Hart&#x27;s time at the University of Illinois, the computer center gave Hart a user&#x27;s account on its computer system; Hart&#x27;s brother&#x27;s best friend was the mainframe operator and gave an account with a virtually unlimited amount of computer time; its value at that time has since been variously estimated at $100,000 or $100,000,000. Although the focus of computer use there tended to be data processing, Hart was aware that it was connected to a network (part of what would become the Internet) and chose to use his computer time for information distribution. Hart related that after his account was created on July 4, 1971, he wanted to &quot;give back&quot; by doing something that could be considered to be of great value. He happened to have with him a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, which he had been given at a grocery store after watching fireworks for the Independence Day celebration earlier that evening. He typed the text into the computer but was told that it would be unacceptable to transmit it to numerous people at once via e-mail. Thus, to avoid crashing the e-mail system, he made the e-text available for people to download.

This was the beginning of Project Gutenberg as the first digital library. Hart began posting text copies of such classics as the Bible and the works of Homer, Shakespeare, and Mark Twain. As of 1987 he had typed in a total of 313 books in this fashion. Then, through being involved in the University of Illinois PC User Group and with assistance from Mark Zinzow, a programmer at the school, Hart was able to recruit volunteers and set up an infrastructure of mirror sites and mailing lists for the project. With this, the project was able to grow much more rapidly.

The mission statements for the project were:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Encourage the Creation and Distribution of eBooks&quot;
&quot;Help Break Down the Bars of Ignorance and Illiteracy&quot;
&quot;Give As Many eBooks to As Many People As Possible&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

His overall outlook in the project was to develop in the least demanding format possible: as worded in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, to him, open access meant &quot;open access without proprietary displays, without the need for special software, without the requirement for anything but the simplest of connections.&quot; His initial goal was to make the 10,000 most consulted books available to the public at little or no charge and to do so by the end of the 20th century.

==Other activities==
Hart was an author and his works are available free of charge on the Project Gutenberg server. He was also a member of the RepRap Project, which aims at creating a self-replicating machine.

Hart was involved in an early effort in 1993 to develop a free and openly accessible &quot;Internet Encyclopedia&quot;, called &quot;Interpedia&quot;. However, the effort did not go beyond the planning stage.

==Personal life==
Hart cobbled together a living with the money he earned as an adjunct professor and with grants and donations to Project Gutenberg. He supported himself by doing odd jobs and used an unpaid appointment at Illinois Benedictine College to solicit donations for the project. &quot;I know that sounds odd to most people, but I just never bought into the money system all that much. I never spent it when I got it. It&#x27;s all a matter of perspective&quot;. Hart&#x27;s expenses were minimized by his habits of using home remedies, fixing his own house and car, and building computers, stereos, and other gear from discarded components.

Hart died on September 6, 2011, of a heart attack at his home in Urbana, Illinois. He was 64.

== Writing style ==
Michael Hart&#x27;s email messages and blog posts had equal line length paragraphs in monospaced font: he chose the wording in such a way that each line had the same number of characters.

Sample writing from his last newsletter that was distributed in July 2011:

<doc id="153956" wikidata="Q48410" url="?curid=153956" title="Richard Gere">
<text>Richard Tiffany Gere ( ; born August 31, 1949) is an American actor. He began appearing in films in the 1970s, playing a supporting role in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977) and a starring role in &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978). Gere came to prominence with his role in the film &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980), which established him as a leading man and a sex symbol. Gere&#x27;s other films include &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;No Mercy&quot; (1986), &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), &quot;Sommersby&quot; (1993), &quot;Intersection&quot; (1994), &quot;First Knight&quot; (1995), &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996), &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (1999), &quot; Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; (2000), &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (2004), &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007), &quot;Arbitrage&quot; (2012) and &quot;Norman&quot; (2016). For portraying Billy Flynn in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), he won a Golden Globe Award.

==Early life and education==
Gere was born in Philadelphia on August 31, 1949, the eldest son and second child of homemaker Doris Ann ( Tiffany; 19242016) and NMIC insurance agent Homer George Gere (1922–2023). His father originally intended to become a minister. Gere was raised Methodist in Syracuse, New York. His paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from &quot;Geer&quot;. One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from Heavitree, England, and settled in the Connecticut Colony in 1638. Both of Gere&#x27;s parents were &quot;Mayflower&quot; descendants; his ancestors include Pilgrims such as John Billington, William Brewster, Francis Eaton, Francis Cooke, Degory Priest, George Soule and Richard Warren.

In 1967, Gere graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet. Gere attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.

==Career==

Gere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. His first major acting role was in the 1971 rock opera &quot;Soon&quot;, written by Scott Fagan and Joe Kookoolis, which opened on Broadway at the Ritz Theatre and closed after three performances. Following that, he appeared in the original London stage version of &quot;Grease&quot;, in 1973. Gere was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of &quot;Bent&quot;, for which he earned a Theatre World Award.

Gere began appearing in Hollywood films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star Sylvester Stallone. Gere played a small but significant part in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick&#x27;s well-reviewed drama &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978). The crime drama &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere&#x27;s ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million and winning two Academy Awards out of six nominations; Gere himself received his first Golden Globe Award nomination. For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception. His career rebounded with the releases of &quot;Internal Affairs&quot; (1990) and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), the latter of which earned Gere his second Golden Globe Award nomination. The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including &quot;Sommersby&quot; (1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996) and &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (1999) (which reunited him with his &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; co-star Julia Roberts). He also took a leading role in the action thriller &quot;The Jackal&quot; (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.

Gere was named &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit films &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; (2002), &quot;Unfaithful&quot; (2002), and the Academy Award-winning musical film adaptation &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), for which Gere won his first Golden Globe Award. His ballroom dancing drama &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide. His next film, the book-to-screen adaptation &quot;Bee Season&quot; (2005), was a commercial failure. Gere went on to co-star with Jesse Eisenberg and Terrence Howard in &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett in Todd Haynes&#x27; semi-biographical film about Bob Dylan, &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. He co-starred with Diane Lane in the romantic drama &quot;Nights in Rodanthe&quot; (2008). The film was widely panned by critics (making #74 on &quot;The Times&quot; Worst Films of 2008 list), but grossed over $84 million worldwide. The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a major film studio.

Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major Hollywood studios, have made him unwelcome within Hollywood. Gere embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood and instead appeared in independent films that garnered some of the best reviews of his career. Gere was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in &quot;Arbitrage&quot; (2012), earning his fourth Golden Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited Gere&#x27;s performance as &quot;too good to ignore&quot; and &quot;an implosive tour de force&quot;. Also in 2012, he received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Awards. Gere had earlier received an award from the 34th Cairo International Film Festival in December 2010.

Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with Joseph Cedar&#x27;s political drama &quot;Norman&quot; (2016). The film saw Gere portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish fixer. Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the &quot;sides of us we know are annoying and needy&quot;. His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called &quot;consistently, completely fascinating&quot; by RogerEbert.com and was singled out as a worthy Academy Award contender by &quot;Variety&quot;.

Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; piano theme and a guitar solo in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. He studied tap for three months to shoot half a day of dancing for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in &quot;Chicago.&quot; He also studied karate for &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;.

Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

==Political views and activism==
Gere regularly visits Dharamshala, the headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile. He is an advocate for human rights in Tibet and is a co-founder of the Tibet House US, creator of the Gere Foundation, and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the International Campaign for Tibet. Because he supports the Tibetan Independence Movement, Gere is permanently banned from entering China. In 2017, Gere stated he believed his advocacy had resulted in him no longer being cast in Hollywood blockbusters so as not to offend the growing Chinese audience for blockbuster films, with China now the second-largest film market in the world.

In 1993, Gere was banned from being an Academy Award presenter after he denounced the Chinese government while announcing the nominees.

In September 2007, Gere called for the boycott of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games to put pressure on China to make Tibet independent. He starred in a Free Tibet-themed Lancia commercial featuring the Lancia Delta. On June 27, 2011, Gere meditated in Borobudur Temple in Indonesia. He actively supports Survival International, an organization dedicated to protecting the rights and lands of tribal peoples throughout the world.

Gere campaigns for ecological causes and AIDS awareness. He currently serves on the board of directors for Healing the Divide, an organization that supports global initiatives to promote peace, justice and understanding. Gere helped to establish the AIDS Care Home, a residential facility in India for women and children with AIDS, and also supports campaigns for AIDS awareness and education in that country. In 1999, he created the Gere Foundation India Trust to support a variety of humanitarian programs in India.
On April 15, 2007, Gere appeared at an AIDS awareness rally in Jaipur. During a live news conference to promote condom use among truck drivers, he embraced Bollywood superstar Shilpa Shetty, dipped her, and kissed her several times on the cheek. As a result of that gesture, a local court ordered the arrest of Gere and Shetty, finding them in violation of public obscenity laws. Gere has said the controversy was &quot;manufactured by a small hard-line political party&quot;. About a month later, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, described the case as &quot;frivolous&quot; and believed that such complaints against celebrities were filed for &quot;cheap publicity&quot; and have brought a bad name to the country. They ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country.

Gere contributed some of his writing for the book &quot;We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples&quot;, released in October 2009. Gere discussed the persecution and loss of land of the Jumma people as an example of a tragic story that repeats itself in different continents of the world, calling attention to the crime against their peaceful culture and how it reflects on humanity&#x27;s relationship with nature and capacity to survive. The royalties from the book&#x27;s sale go to the indigenous rights organization Survival International.

In 2010, Gere stated that the war in Iraq was not supported by the American people and that the presidency of George W. Bush had &quot;bullied&quot; Americans into the decision. He called George W. Bush a &quot;very poor president&quot;. In a press conference held on the sidelines of the 34th Cairo International Film Festival, Gere said, &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry about what the U.S. has done in Iraq. This war has been a tragedy for everyone. I hope that the people of Iraq can rebuild their country.&quot;

In 2016, Gere endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and donated $2,700 to her campaign.

In 2017, Gere criticized Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s policies on the Palestinians and Israel&#x27;s expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank, stating, &quot;Settlements are such an absurd provocation and, certainly in the international sense, completely illegal—and they are certainly not part of the program of someone who wants a genuine peace process.&quot;

In February 2023, Gere was one of the 480 global figures who signed a statement from Freedom House expressing support for Mahsa Amini protesters, urging sanctions on Iranian officials, and calling for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to be proscribed as a terror group.

==Personal life==

Gere had on-again/off-again relationships with actress Penelope Milford from 1971 to 1978, and painter Sylvia Martins from 1978 to 1986. During those years, he was also sporadically linked with Tuesday Weld, Carole Mallory, Dawn Steel, Loree Rodkin, Barbara Carrera, and Barbra Streisand. It was suggested that Gere had affairs with Priscilla Presley and Kim Basinger in tell-all books written by Presley&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Michael Edwards and Basinger&#x27;s ex-husband Ron Snyder. Gere has also reportedly dated models Laura Bailey, Tina Chow, Dalila Di Lazzaro, and Padma Lakshmi. He was married to model Cindy Crawford from 1991 to 1995.

In November 2002, Gere married model and actress Carey Lowell. They have a son, Homer James Jigme Gere, who was born in February 2000 and is named for his grandfathers as well as the Tibetan name &quot;Jigme&quot;. In September 2013, the two separated after 11 years of marriage. They spent three years in highly contested divorce proceedings in New York County Supreme Court. The case was settled in October 2016. In early April 2018, Gere married Spanish activist Alejandra Silva. In August 2018, they announced that they were expecting their first child; their son was born in February 2019. In April 2020, the birth of their second son was reported.

Gere&#x27;s interest in Buddhism began when he was in his 20s. Gere first studied Zen Buddhism under Kyozan Joshu Sasaki. After studying Zen for five or six years, he and Brazilian painter Sylvia Martins traveled in 1978 to Nepal, where Gere met many Tibetan monks and lamas. He then met the 14th Dalai Lama in India and became a practicing Tibetan Buddhist (specifically of the Gelugpa school) and an active supporter of the Dalai Lama.

In February 2023, Gere was diagnosed and hospitalized with pneumonia during a family vacation in Nuevo Vallarta in Mexico. It was reported by his wife that he had fully recovered from his illness.

Gere has often been included on lists of famous vegetarians; however, there is no clear evidence either way.

In 1995, Gere was the president of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.

On May 17, 2012, Albanian President, Bamir Topi awarded the Medal of Gratitude to Gere with the citation: &quot;With gratitude and honor outstanding personality of the world art, great humanist and activist for the protection of human rights, which unmasked and the American public made known, and further, inhuman crimes, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, in 1999, the Serbian military machine against the Albanian civilian population living in its land.&quot; On February 16, 2012, the George Eastman Museum honored Gere with the George Eastman Award for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

<text>Lancelot du Lac (French for Lancelot of the Lake), alternatively written as Launcelot and other variants, is a popular character in Arthurian legend&#x27;s chivalric romance tradition. He is typically depicted as King Arthur&#x27;s close companion and one of the greatest Knights of the Round Table, as well as a secret lover of Arthur&#x27;s wife, Guinevere.

In his most prominent and complete depiction, Lancelot is a beautiful orphaned son of King Ban of the lost kingdom of Benoïc. He is raised in a fairy realm by the Lady of the Lake while unaware of his real parentage prior to joining Arthur&#x27;s court as a young knight and discovering his origins. A hero of many battles, quests and tournaments, and famed as a nearly unrivalled swordsman and jouster, Lancelot soon becomes the lord of the castle Joyous Gard and personal champion of Queen Guinevere, to whom he is devoted absolutely. He also develops a close relationship with Galehaut and suffers from frequent and sometimes prolonged fits of violent rage and other forms of madness. After Lady Elaine seduces him using magic, their son Galahad, devoid of his father&#x27;s flaws of character, becomes the perfect knight that succeeds in completing the greatest of all quests, achieving the Holy Grail when Lancelot himself fails due to his sins. Eventually, when Lancelot&#x27;s adulterous affair with Guinevere is publicly discovered, it develops into a bloody civil war that, once exploited by Mordred, brings an end to Arthur&#x27;s kingdom. 

Lancelot&#x27;s first datable appearance as main character is found in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; 12th-century French poem &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, which already centered around his courtly love for Guinevere. However, another early Lancelot poem, &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, a German translation of an unknown French book, did not feature such a motif and the connections between the both texts and their possible common source are uncertain. Later, his character and story was expanded upon Chrétien&#x27;s tale in the other works of Arthurian romance, especially through the vast &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; prose cycle that presented the now-familiar version of his legend following its abridged retelling in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Both loyal and treasonous, Lancelot has remained a popular character for centuries and is often reimagined by modern authors.

==History==
===Name and origins===
There have been many theories regarding the origins of Lancelot as an Arthurian romance character. In those postulated by Ferdinand Lot and Roger Sherman Loomis, Lancelot&#x27;s figure is related to Llenlleog (Llenlleawc), an Irishman in the early Arthurian Welsh tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; (which associates him with the &quot;headland of Gan[i]on&quot;), and the Welsh hero Llwch Llawwynnauc (most likely a version of the euhemerised Irish deity Lug[h] Lonbemnech, with &quot;Llwch&quot; meaning &quot;Lake&quot; in Welsh), possibly via a now-forgotten epithet such as &quot;Lamhcalad&quot;, suggesting that they are the same figure; their similarities beyond the name include wielding a sword and fighting for a cauldron in &quot;Culhwch&quot; and &quot;Preiddeu Annwn&quot;. Loomis also linked Lancelot to the Welsh mythological hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes, while T. Gwynn Jones claimed links between Lancelot and Eliwlod (Eliwlad), a nephew of Arthur in the Welsh legend. Proponents of the Scythian origins of Arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been &quot;Alanus-à-Lot&quot;, that is &quot;Alan of the river Lot&quot;, and those looking for clues in classical antiquity see elements of Lancelot in the Ancient Greek mythical figures of Askalos and Mopsus (Moxus).

Alfred Anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name &quot;Lancelot&quot; came from Germanic *&quot;Wlancloth&quot;, with roots in the Old English &quot;wlenceo&quot; (pride) and &quot;loða&quot; (cloak), in connection with Vinoviloth, the name of a Gothic chief or tribe mentioned in the 6th-century &quot;Getica&quot;. According to more recent authors, such as Norma Lorre Goodrich, the name, if not just an invention of the 12th-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes, may have been derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s character Anguselaus, probably a Latinised name of Unguist, the name of a son of the 6th-century Pictish king Forgus; when translated from Geoffrey&#x27;s Latin into Old French, it would become &quot;Anselaus&quot;. Other 6th-century figures proposed in modern times as candidates for the prototype of Lancelot include the early French saint Fraimbault de Lassay; Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd; and Llaennog (Llaenauc), father of Gwallog, king of Elmet.

Lancelot may have been the hero of a popular folk tale that was originally independent but was ultimately absorbed into the Arthurian tradition. The theft of an infant by a water fairy, the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises, and the rescue of a queen or princess from an Otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale, variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by Theodore Hersart de la Villemarqué in his &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot;, by Emmanuel Cosquin in his &quot;Contes Lorrains&quot;, and by John Francis Campbell in his &quot;Tales of the West Highlands&quot;. As for his name, &quot;Lancelot&quot; may be a variant of the French name Lancelin (the word likely meaning javelin in Old French) as proposed by Gaston Paris in 1881, later supported by Rachel Bromwich. It is also possibly derived from the Old French word &quot;L&#x27;Ancelot&quot;, meaning &quot;Servant&quot; (the hypothesis first put forward by de la Villemarqué in 1842); Lancelot&#x27;s name is actually written this way in several manuscripts. It is furthermore reminiscent of an uncommon Saxon name Wlanc, meaning &quot;The Proud One&quot;.

Stephen Pow has recently argued that the name &quot;Lancelot&quot; represents an Old French pronunciation of Hungarian &quot;László&quot; (Ladislaus) as inspired by the historical King Ladislaus I of Hungary. In the early 1180s, King Béla III of Hungary was pursuing Ladislaus&#x27; canonization as a saint (approved 1192) and a marriage alliance with France through Margaret of France (whom he married 1186). Margaret was the half-sister of Chrétien&#x27;s patroness, Marie de Champagne, and the creation of Lancelot would thus meant to honor the Hungarian king around the time of his marriage to a member of the French royal house.

===Chrétien and Ulrich===
Lancelot&#x27;s name appears third on a list of knights at King Arthur&#x27;s court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character: Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; Old French poem &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; (1170). The fact that his name follows Gawain and Erec indicates the presumed importance of the knight at court, even though he did not figure prominently in Chrétien&#x27;s tale. Lancelot reappears in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Cligès&quot;, in which he takes a more important role as one of the knights that Cligès must overcome in his quest. It is not until Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot; (&quot;Le Chevalier de la charrette&quot;), however, that he becomes the protagonist and is given the full name Lancelot du Lac (Lancelot of the Lake), which was later picked up by the French authors of the Lancelot-Grail and then by Thomas Malory. Chrétien treats Lancelot as if his audience were already familiar with the character&#x27;s background, yet most of the characteristics and exploits that are commonly associated with Lancelot today are first mentioned here. The story centers on his rescue of Queen Guinevere after she has been abducted by Meliagant. In the words of Matilda Bruckner, &quot;what existed before Chrétien remains uncertain, but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of Lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably linked to his love for Arthur&#x27;s Queen.&quot;

Lancelot&#x27;s passion for Arthur&#x27;s wife Guinevere is entirely absent from another early work, &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, a Middle High German epic poem by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century (no earlier than 1194). Ulrich asserts that his poem is a translation of an earlier work from a &quot;French book&quot; he had obtained, assuring the reader that &quot;there is nothing left out or added compared to what the French book tells.&quot; He describes his source as written by a certain Arnaud Daniel in Provençal dialect and which must have differed markedly in several points from Chrétien&#x27;s story. In &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, the abductor of Ginover (Guinevere) is named as King Valerin, whose name, unlike that of Chrétien&#x27;s Meliagant, does not appear to derive from the Welsh Melwas. Furthermore, Ginover&#x27;s rescuer is not Lanzelet, who instead ends up finding happiness in marriage with the fairy princess Iblis. The book&#x27;s Lancelot is Arthur&#x27;s nephew, the son of Arthur&#x27;s sister Queen Clarine. Similar to Chrétien&#x27;s version, Lanzelet too is raised by a water fairy (here the Queen of the Maidenland), having lost his father King Pant of Genewis to a rebellion. It has been suggested that Lancelot was originally the hero of a story independent of the love triangle of Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot and perhaps very similar to Ulrich&#x27;s version. If this is true, then the motif of adultery might either have been invented by Chrétien for his &quot;Chevalier de la Charrette&quot; or have been present in the (now lost) source provided to him by his patroness, Marie de Champagne, a lady well known for her keen interest in matters relating to courtly love. Chrétien himself abandoned the poem for unknown reason, perhaps because of his personal distaste for the subject, which was then finished by Godefroi de Leigni as &quot;Lanselos del Lac&quot;.

===Evolution of the legend===
Lancelot&#x27;s character was further developed during the early 13th century in the Old French prose romance Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail. There, he appears prominently in the later parts, known as the &quot;Lancelot en prose&quot; (Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;), the &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; (&quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail&quot;), and the &quot;Mort Artu&quot; (&quot;The Death of Arthur&quot;). When Chrétien de Troyes wrote at the request of Countess Marie, she was only interested in the romantic relationship between Lancelot and the queen. However, the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; greatly expands the story: he is assigned a family, a descent from lost kingdom, and many further adventures. Gaston Paris argued that the Guinevere-Meleagant episode of the Prose &quot;Lancelot &quot; is an almost literal adaptation of Chrétien&#x27;s poem, the courtly love theme of which seemed to be forced on the unwilling Chrétien by Marie, though it can be seen as a considerable amplification. The forbidden love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of Tristan and Iseult, with Lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the Round Table in the later works continuing Chrétien&#x27;s story. In &quot;Perceforest&quot;, the different daughters of the ancient knight Lyonnel and the fairy queen Blanchete are actually ancestors of both Lancelot and Guinevere, as well of as Tristan. However, much of the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; material from the Vulgate Cycle has been soon later removed in the rewriting known as the Post-Vulgate Cycle, where Lancelot is no longer the central protagonist, with the surviving parts being reworked and attached to the other parts of this cycle. 

Lancelot is often tied to the religiously Christian themes within the genre of Arthurian romance. His quest for Guinevere in &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot; is similar to Christ&#x27;s quest for the human soul. His adventure among the tombs is described in terms that suggest Christ&#x27;s harrowing of Hell and resurrection; he effortlessly lifts the lid off the sarcophagus, which bears an inscription foretelling his freeing of the captives. Lancelot would later become one of the chief knights associated with the Quest for the Holy Grail, yet Chrétien did not include him at all in his final romance, the unfinished &quot;Perceval, le Conte du Graal&quot; (&quot;Perceval, or the Story of the Grail&quot;) which introduced the Grail motif into medieval literature. Perceval is the sole seeker of the Grail in Chrétien&#x27;s treatment; Lancelot&#x27;s involvement in the Grail quest is first recorded in the prose romance &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, written between 1200 and 1210.

German romance &quot;Diu Crône&quot; gives Lancelot aspects of solar deity type hero, making his strength peak during high noon, a characteristic usually associated with Gawain. The Middle Dutch so-called Lancelot Compilation (c. 1320) contains seven Arthurian romances, including a new Lancelot one, folded into the three parts of the cycle. This new formulation of a Lancelot romance in the Netherlands indicates the character&#x27;s widespread popularity independent of the Lancelot-Grail cycle. In this story, &quot;Lanceloet en het Hert met de Witte Voet&quot; (&quot;Lancelot and the Hart with the White Foot&quot;), he fights seven lions to get the white foot from a hart (deer) which will allow him to marry a princess. Near the end of the 15th century, Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; followed the Lancelot-Grail in presenting Lancelot as the best knight, a departure from the preceding English tradition in which Gawain had been the most prominent.

==Cyclical prose tradition==

===Birth and childhood===
In his backstory, as told in the Vulgate Cycle, Lancelot is born &quot;in the borderland between Gaul and Brittany&quot; as Galahad (originally written &quot;Galaad&quot; or &quot;Galaaz&quot;, not to be confused with his own son of the same name), son of the Gallo-Roman ruler King Ban of Bénoïc (English &#x27;Benwick&#x27;, corresponding to the eastern part of Anjou). Ban&#x27;s kingdom has just fallen to his enemy, King Claudas, and the mortally wounded king and his wife Queen Élaine flee the destruction of their final stronghold of Trebe or Trébes (likely the historic Trèves Castle in today&#x27;s Chênehutte-Trèves-Cunault), carrying the infant child with them. As Elaine tends to her dying husband, Lancelot is carried off by a fairy enchantress known as the Lady of the Lake; the surviving Elaine will later become a nun. In an alternate version as retold in the Italian &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Lancelot is born when the late Ban&#x27;s wife Gostanza delivers him two months early and soon after also dies.

The Lady then raises the child in her magical realm. After three years pass in human world, the child Lancelot grows up and matures much faster than he would naturally do, and it is from this upbringing that he earns the name &quot;du Lac&quot;of the Lake. His double-cousins Lionel and Bors the Younger, sons of King Bors of Gaul and Elaine&#x27;s sister Evaine, are first taken by a knight of Claudas and later spirited away to the Lady of the Lake to become Lancelot&#x27;s junior companions. Lancelot&#x27;s other notable surviving kinsmen often include Bleoberis de Ganis and Hector de Maris among other and usually more distant relatives. Many of them will also join him at the Round Table, as do all of those mentioned above, as well as some of their sons, such as Elyan the White, and Lancelot&#x27;s own son, too. In the prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, the more or less minor Knights of the Round Table also mentioned as related to Lancelot in one way or another are Aban, Acantan the Agile, Banin, Blamor, Brandinor, Crinides the Black, Danubre the Brave, Gadran, Hebes the Famous, Lelas, Ocursus the Black, Pincados, Tanri, and more (they are different and fewer in Malory).

An early part of the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; also describes in a great detail what made him (in a translation by Norris J. Lacy) &quot;the most handsome lad in the land&quot;, noting the feminine qualities of his hands and neck and the just right amount of musculature. Diverging on Lancelot&#x27;s personality, the narration then adds the first mention of his mental instability (which was not explicitly stated in Chrétien&#x27;s version, although Chrétien&#x27;s Lancelot is notably relentless on his quest to rescue Guinevere, leaping into danger without thinking and ignoring wounds and pain), in particular proneness to berserk-like combat frenzy:

===Lancelot and Arthur===
Initially known only as the nameless White Knight (&quot;Chevalier Blanc&quot;), clad in silver steel on a white horse, the young Lancelot (claiming to be 18 years old, although it is later revealed that he is really only 15) arrives in Arthur&#x27;s kingdom of Logres with the Lady of the Lake to be knighted by the king at her behest. The Lady equips him a powerful magic ring able to dispel any enchantment (as his anonymous fairy foster mother also does in Chrétien&#x27;s version; later parts of the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; instead retcon this as given to him by Guinevere). She also provides him with other enchanted items with various abilities, including a lance, a sword, a tent, and a mirror. She and her damsels continue to aid him throughout the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;. The White Knight later takes the name of his grandfather, King Lancelot, upon discovering his identity. Lancelot eventually is made a member of Arthur&#x27;s elite Round Table after freeing the king&#x27;s nephew Gawain from enemy captivity.

===Lancelot and Guinevere===
Almost immediately upon his arrival, Lancelot and the young Queen Guinevere fall in love through a strange magical connection between them, and one of his adventures in the prose cycles involves saving her from abduction by Arthur&#x27;s enemy Maleagant. The exact timing and sequence of events vary from one source to another, and some details are found only in certain sources. The Maleagant episode actually marked the end of the original, non-cyclic version of the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; (before the later much longer versions), telling of only of the hero&#x27;s childhood and early youth. In the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, he is actually knighted by Guinevere instead of by Arthur.

In Malor&#x27;s abridged telling in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Lancelot&#x27;s knighting is performed by the King, and both Lancelot&#x27;s rescue of the Queen from Meleagant and the physical consummation of their relationship is postponed for years. As described by Malory, after having broken through the iron bars of her prison chamber with his bare hands, &quot;Sir Launcelot wente to bedde with the Quene and toke no force of his hurte honed, but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day.&quot; This transgression takes place late in Malory&#x27;s telling, following Lancelot&#x27;s failure in the Grail Quest. Nevertheless, just as in Malory&#x27;s &quot;French book&quot; source, his Lancelot too devotes himself to the service of Guinevere early on in his tale. Expanding on the account from the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, Malory also has his Lancelot act as one of the chief leaders in Arthur&#x27;s Roman War, including personally saving the wounded Bedivere during the final battle against Emperor Lucius. Since much of &quot;Le Morte&quot; was composed unchronologically, the Roman episode actually takes place within Malory&#x27;s Book II, prior to Book III that relates Lancelot&#x27;s youth.

Lancelot&#x27;s initial knight-errant style adventures from the Vulgate Cycle did make their way into Malory&#x27;s compilation range from proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of King Bagdemagus, through slaying the mighty villain Turquine who had been holding several of Arthur&#x27;s knights prisoner, to overcoming a damsel&#x27;s betrayal and defending himself unarmed against her husband Phelot. In the adventures exclusive to the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;, his further great deeds include slaying multiple dragons and giants. He also plays a decisive role in the war against the Saxons in Lothian (Scotland), when he again rescues Arthur and Gawain (which he does on several occasions) and forces the Saxon witch-princess Camille to surrender.

Lancelot dedicates his deeds to his lady Guinevere, acting in her name as her knight. At one point, he goes mad when he is led to believe that Guinevere doubts his love until he is found and healed by the Lady of the Lake. Another instance of Lancelot temporarily losing his mind occurs during his brief imprisonment by Camille, after which he is cured by the Lady of the Lake as well. The motif of his recurring fits of madness (especially &quot;in presence of sexually charged women&quot;) and suicidal tendencies (usually relating to the false or real news of the death of either Gawain or Galehaut) return often throughout the Vulgate and sometimes in other versions as well. He also may harbor a darker, more violent side that is usually suppressed by the chivalric code but can become easily unleashed during the moments of action. Nevertheless, the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; notes that &quot;for all the knights in the world he was the one most unwilling to hurt any lady or maiden.&quot;

At one point, Lancelot (up to then still going as just the White Knight) conquers and wins for himself a castle in Britain, known as Joyous Gard (a former Dolorous Gard), where he learns his real name and heritage, taking the name of his illustrious ancestor Lancelot as his own. With the help of King Arthur, Lancelot then defeats Claudas (and his allied Romans in the Vulgate) and recovers his father&#x27;s kingdom. However, he again decides to remain at Camelot, along with his cousins Bors and Lionel and his illegitimate half-brother Hector de Maris (Ector).

===Lancelot and Galehaut===
Lancelot, incognito as the Black Knight (on another occasion he disguises himself as the Red Knight as well), also plays a decisive role in the war between Arthur and a powerful foreign invader, Prince Galehaut (Galahaut). Galehaut is poised to become the victor and conquer Arthur&#x27;s kingdom, but he is taken by Lancelot&#x27;s amazing battlefield performance and offers him a boon in return for the privilege of one night&#x27;s company in the bivouac. Lancelot accepts and uses his boon to demand that Galehaut surrender peacefully to Arthur. The exact nature of Galehaut&#x27;s passion for Lancelot is a subject of debate among modern scholars, with some interpreting it as intimate friendship and others as love similar to that between Lancelot and Guinevere.

At first, Lancelot continues to serve Galehaut in his home country of Sorelois, where Guinevere joins him, after Lancelot saves her from the bewitched Arthur during the &quot;false Guinevere&quot; episode. After that, Arthur invites Galahaut to join the Round Table. Despite this happy outcome, Galahaut is the one who convinces Guinevere that she may return Lancelot&#x27;s affection, an action that at least partially results in the fall of Camelot. In the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and its adaptations, including the account within the post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;, Lancelot himself harbors in his castle the fugitive lovers Tristan and Iseult as they flee from the vengeful King Mark of Cornwall.

Lancelot becomes one of the most famous Knights of the Round Table, even attested as the best knight in the world in Malory&#x27;s own episode of Sir Urry of Hungary, as well as an object of desire by many ladies, beginning with the gigantic Lady of Malehaut when he is her captive early on in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;. An evil sorceress named Hellawes wants him for herself so obsessively that, failing in having him either dead or alive in Malory&#x27;s chapel perilous episode, she soon herself dies from sorrow. Similarly, Elaine of Astolat (Vulgate&#x27;s &quot;Demoiselle d&#x27;Escalot&quot;, in modern times better known as &quot;the Lady of Shalott&quot;), also dies of heartbreak due to her unrequited love of Lancelot. On his side, Lancelot falls in a mutual but purely platonic love with an avowed virgin maiden, whom Malory calls Amable (unnamed in the Vulgate).

Faithful to Queen Guinevere, he refuses the forceful advances of Queen Morgan le Fay, Arthur&#x27;s enchantress sister. Morgan constantly attempts to seduce Lancelot, whom she at once lustfully loves and hates with the same great intensity. She even kidnaps him repeatedly, once with her coven of fellow magical queens including Sebile. On one occasion (as told in the prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;), Morgan agrees to temporarily release Lancelot to save Gawain, on the condition that Lancelot will return to her immediately afterwards; she then sets him free under the further condition that he not spend any time with either Guinevere or Galehaut for a year. This condition causes Lancelot to go half mad, and Galehaut to fall sick out of longing for him. Galehaut eventually dies of anguish, after he receives a false rumour of Lancelot&#x27;s suicide.

===Galahad and the Grail===
Princess Elaine of Corbenic, daughter of the Fisher King, also falls in love with him but is more successful than the others. With the help of magic, Lady Elaine tricks Lancelot into believing that she is Guinevere, and thus makes him sleep with her by deception. The ensuing pregnancy results in the birth of his son Galahad, whom Elaine will send off to grow up without a father. Galahad later emerges as the Merlin-prophesied Good Knight, destined for great deeds, who will find the Holy Grail.

But Guinevere learns of their affair, and becomes furious when she finds that Elaine has made Lancelot sleep with her by magic trickery for a second time and in Guinevere&#x27;s own castle. She blames Lancelot and banishes him from Camelot. Broken by her reaction, Lancelot goes mad again. He flees and vanishes, wandering the wilderness for (either two or five) years. During this time, he is searched for by the remorseful Guinevere and the others. Eventually, he arrives back at Corbenic, where he is recognised by Elaine. Lancelot, shown the Holy Grail through a veil, is cured of his madness, and then chooses to live with her on a remote isle, where he is known incognito as the Wicked Knight (&quot;Chevalier Malfait&quot;, the form also used by Malory). After ten years pass, Lancelot is finally found by Perceval and Ector, who meanwhile have been sent to look for him by Guinevere (the prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; narrates the adventures of them and various other knights in the Quest for Lancelot).

Upon his return to the court of Camelot, Lancelot takes part in the great Grail Quest. The quest is initiated by Lancelot&#x27;s estranged son, the young teenage Galahad, having prevailed over his father in a duel during his own dramatic arrival at Camelot, among other acts that proved him as the most perfect knight. Following further adventures, during which he experiences defeat and humiliation, Lancelot himself is again allowed only a glimpse of the Grail because he is an adulterer and was distracted from faith in God by earthly honours that came through his knightly prowess. Instead, it is his spiritually-pure son who ultimately achieves the Grail. Galahad&#x27;s also virgin companions, Lancelot&#x27;s cousin Bors the Younger and Pellinore&#x27;s son Perceval, then witness his ascension into the Heaven. As noted by George Brown, while &quot;Galahad is the typological descendant of Solomon through Joseph of Arimathea, Lancelot is equivalent to David, the warrior-sinner.&quot;

===Later years and death===
Ultimately, Lancelot&#x27;s affair with Guinevere is a destructive force, which was glorified and justified in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; but becomes condemned by the time of the Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;. After his failure in the Grail quest, Lancelot tries to live a chaste life, angering Guinevere who sends him away, although they soon reconcile and resume their relationship as it had been before Elaine and Galahad. When Maleagant tries to prove Guinevere&#x27;s infidelity, he is killed by Lancelot in a trial by combat. Lancelot also saves the Queen from an accusation of murder by poison when he fights as her champion against Mador de la Porte upon his timely return in another episode included in Malory&#x27;s version. In all, Lancelot fights in five such duels throughout the prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;.

However, after the truth about Lancelot and Guinevere is finally revealed to Arthur by Morgan, it leads to the death of three of Gawain&#x27;s brothers (Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth) when Lancelot with his family and followers arrive to violently save the condemned queen from being burned at the stake. During her rescue, the rampaging Lancelot and his companions slaughter the men sent by Arthur to guard the execution, including those who went unwilling and unarmed (as did Lancelot&#x27;s own close friend Gareth, whose head he crushes in a blind rage). In Malory&#x27;s version, Agravain is killed by Lancelot earlier, during his bloody escape from Camelot, as well as Florent and Lovel, two of Gawain&#x27;s sons (Arthur&#x27;s nephews) who accompanied Agravain and Mordred in their ambush of Lancelot in Guinevere&#x27;s chambers along with several other knights from &quot;Scotland&quot;. In the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, Lancelot&#x27;s now-vacated former seat at the Round Table is given to an Irish knight named Elians.

The killing of Arthur&#x27;s loyal knights, including some of the king&#x27;s own relatives, sets in motion the events leading to the treason by Mordred and the disappearance and apparent death of Arthur. The civil war between Arthur and Lancelot was introduced in the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, where it replaced the great Roman War taking place at the end of Arthur&#x27;s reign in the chronicle tradition. What first occurs is a series of engagements waged against Lancelot&#x27;s faction by Arthur and the vengeful Gawain; they besiege Lancelot at Joyous Gard for two months and then pursue him with their army into Gaul (France in Malory). The eventual result of this is the betrayal of Arthur by Mordred, the king&#x27;s bastard son (and formerly one of Lancelot&#x27;s young followers), who falsely announces Arthur&#x27;s death to seize the throne for himself. Meanwhile, Gawain challenges Lancelot to a duel twice; each time Lancelot delays because of Gawain&#x27;s enchantment that makes him grow stronger between morning and noon. Lancelot then strikes down Gawain with Galahad&#x27;s sword but spares Gawain&#x27;s life (in the Vulgate, despite being urged by Hector to finish him off). However, Gawain&#x27;s head wound nevertheless proves to be fatal later, when it reopens during the war with Mordred back in Britain. Upon receiving a desperate letter from the dying Gawain offering him forgiveness and asking for his help in the fight against Mordred, Lancelot hurries to return to Britain with his army, only to hear the news of Arthur&#x27;s death at Salisbury Plain (romance version of the Battle of Camlann).

There are two main variants of Lancelot&#x27;s demise, both involving him spending his final years removed from society as a hermit monk. In the original from the variants of &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, after mourning his king, Lancelot abandons society, with exception of his later participation in a victorious war against the young sons of Mordred and their Briton supporters and Saxon allies that provides him with partial atonement for his earlier role in the story. It happens shortly after the death of Guinevere, as Lancelot personally kills one of Mordred&#x27;s sons after chasing him through a forest in the battle at Winchester, but himself goes abruptly missing. Lancelot dies of illness four years later, accompanied only by Hector, Bleoberis, and the former archbishop of Canterbury. It is implied that he wished to be buried beside the king and queen, however, he had made a vow some time before to be buried at Joyous Gard next to Galehaut, so he asks to be buried there to keep his word. In the Post-Vulgate, the burial site and bodies of Lancelot and Galehaut are later destroyed by King Mark when he ravages Arthur&#x27;s former kingdom.

There is no war with the sons of Mordred in the version included in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In it, Guinevere blames all the destruction of the Round Table upon their adulterous relationship, which is the seed of all the dismay that followed, and becomes a nun. She refuses to kiss Lancelot one last time, telling him to return to his lands and that he will never see her face again. Upon hearing this, Lancelot declares that if she will take a life of penitence, then so will he. Lancelot retires to a hermitage to seek redemption, with eight of his kin joining him in a monastic life, including Hector. As a monk, he later conducts last rites over Guinevere&#x27;s body (who had become an abbess). In a dream, he is warned that she is dying and sets out to visit her, but Guinevere prays that she might die before he arrives, which she does; as she had declared, he never saw her face again in life. After the queen&#x27;s death, Lancelot and his fellow knights escort her body to be interred beside King Arthur. The distraught Lancelot&#x27;s health then begins to fail (&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; states that even before this time, he had lost a cubit of height due to his fastings and prayers) and he dies six weeks after the death of the queen. His eight companions return to France to take care of the affairs of their lands before, acting on Lancelot&#x27;s death-bed request, they go on a crusade to the Holy Land and die there fighting the Saracens (&quot;Turks&quot; in Malory).

He has been played by Robert Taylor in &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1953), William Russell in &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; (1956–1957), Robert Goulet in &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960), Cornel Wilde in &quot;Sword of Lancelot&quot; (1963), Franco Nero in &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967), Luc Simon in &quot;Lancelot du Lac&quot; (1974), Nicholas Clay in &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), Richard Gere in &quot;First Knight&quot; (1995), Jeremy Sheffield in &quot;Merlin&quot; (1998), Phil Cornwell in &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Disasters&quot; (2005–2006), Santiago Cabrera in &quot;Merlin&quot; (2008–2011), Christopher Tavarez in &quot;Avalon High&quot; (2010), Sinqua Walls in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (2012–2015), Dan Stevens in &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot; (2014), and Martin McCreadie in &quot;&quot; (2017), among others. 

* T. H. White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (1958) portrays Lancelot very differently from his usual image in the legend. Here, Lancelot is immensely ugly and introverted, having difficulty dealing with people.
* Lancelot is played by John Cleese in the Arthurian comedy film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975). He is portrayed as an awkward knight prone to sudden and uncontrolled outbursts of violence in the section &quot;Sir Lancelot the Brave&quot; that shows his misguided bloody rampage to save a princess who turns out to be a prince and who did not really need to be rescued. He is also a principal character in &quot;Spamalot&quot; (2005), a stage musical adaptation of the film. Lancelot was played by Hank Azaria in the original Broadway production. In this version, Lancelot is gay and marries Prince Herbert (portrayed by Christian Borle in the original Broadway production).
* In Roger Zelazny&#x27;s short story &quot;The Last Defender of Camelot&quot; (1979), the magically immortal Lancelot finally dies helping Morgana save the world from the mad Merlin in the 20th century. He is played by Richard Kiley in a 1986 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; based on the story.
* In Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (1982), Lancelet is another name of Galahad, and an estranged son of the Lady of the Lake, Viviane. A handsome and great warrior, he is the protagonist Morgaine&#x27;s cousin and first love interest, himself being bisexual and loving both Gwenhwyfar and Arthur. He is played by Michael Vartan in the novel&#x27;s film adaptation (2001).
* Lancelot is a major character in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot; trilogy of novels (1995–1997). This version of Lancelot is presented as a self-serving and cowardly prince of the lost kingdom of Benoic, left by him to be destroyed by Frankish barbarians. To seize the throne of Dumnonia, Lancelot conspires against Arthur with Guinevere, incites a Christian rebellion, and defects to the invading Saxons, ending up being hanged by his own half-brother Galahad and by the narrator Derfel (who had lost his daughter to Lancelot&#x27;s scheming). Lancelot&#x27;s glowing depictions in legends are explained as merely an influence of the stories invented by the bards hired by his mother.
* A character based on him named Sir Loungelot is one of the main characters in the animated series &quot;Blazing Dragons&quot; (1996), but being adapted as a fat, arrogant and cowardly dragon who is the leader of the Knights of Camelhot.
* Lancelot is a recurring character in &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tales&quot; series (1998–2010) by Gerald Morris. In some books he is a major character and in others is a secondary character. This version of Lancelot is initially presented as a talented knight, but somewhat pompous and vain. In later books, filled with regret over his affair with Guinevere, he renounces court and is presented as more humble and wise. He leaves court to become a woodcutter, though he is occasionally swept up in quests to help Arthur and other knights. 
* The video game &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot; (1999) features Lancelot as a paladin.
* The 2003 novel &quot;Clothar the Frank&quot; by Jack Whyte is told from the perspective of Lancelot. It follows his journeys, starting as a young child until his arrival in Camelot and his meeting with Merlyn and Arthur Pendragon.
* Lancelot is played by Ioan Gruffudd in the non-fantasy film &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), in which he is one of Arthur&#x27;s warriors. He is mortally wounded when he saves the young Guinevere and slays the Saxon chieftain Cynric during the Battle of Badon Hill.
* Thomas Cousseau played Lancelot du Lac in the French comedy TV series &quot;Kaamelott&quot; (2005–2009), in which he is portrayed as the only competent Knight of the Round Table and a classically chivalrous hero unlike all the others, however still ill-fated.
* Jason Griffith portrayed him in the video game &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot; (2009). Lancelot&#x27;s appearance is based on Shadow the Hedgehog.
* Lancelot appears in the light novel and its 2011 anime adaptation &quot;Fate/Zero&quot; as the Servant &quot;Berserker&quot;, played by Ryōtarō Okiayu/Kyle Herbert. Lancelot also appears in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as a Berserker but also as a Saber class Servant.

* Lancelot is the primary antagonist in the first season of &quot;The Librarians&quot; (2014), portrayed by both Matt Frewer and Jerry O&#x27;Connell. He gained immortality sometime after the fall of Camelot through magic and has spent centuries seeking to reverse the events that brought about its destruction. As the mysterious Dulaque (a respelling of his name &quot;du Lac&quot;), he leads the Serpent Brotherhood, a cult that has long opposed the Library&#x27;s mission to keep magic out of the hands of humans.
*In the video game &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot; (2016), Lancelot is a playable character portrayed as Guinevere&#x27;s brother.

<text>Bistorta officinalis (synonym Persicaria bistorta), known as bistort, common bistort, European bistort, or meadow bistort, is a species of flowering plant in the dock family Polygonaceae native to Europe and northern and western Asia. Other common names include snakeroot, snake-root, snakeweed, and Easter-ledges.

==Description==

&quot;Bistorta officinalis&quot; is an herbaceous perennial growing to tall by wide. It has a thick, twisted rootstock which has probably given it its common name of snakeroot. The foliage is normally basal with a few smaller leaves produced near the lower end of the flowering stems. The leaves usually hairless; the basal ones are longish-oval with long winged stalks and rounded or heart-shaped bases; the upper ones are few and are triangular, tapered and stalkless. There are stipules at their base which are fused into a sheath surrounding the stem. The petioles are broadly winged. The inflorescence is a spike. The plant blooms from late spring into autumn, producing tall, erect, unbranched, and hairless stems ending in single terminal racemes that are club-like spikes, long, of rose-pink flowers. The individual flowers are pink with five perianth segments, eight stamens, three fused carpels, and three free styles. The fruit is a glossy black nut. Flowering takes place in June and July. The plant grows in moist soils and under dry conditions goes dormant, losing its foliage until adequate moisture exists again.

== Taxonomy ==

The generic placement of this species was historically in flux, having been placed in &quot;Polygonum&quot; or &quot;Persicaria&quot; but is now accepted as &quot;Bistorta&quot;.

=== Etymology ===

The Latin name &quot;bistorta&quot;, from &quot;bis&quot; (&quot;twice&quot;) + &quot;torta&quot; (&quot;twisted&quot;), refers to the twisted appearance of the root.

Numerous other vernacular names have been recorded for the species in historical texts, though none is used to any extent. Many of the following refer to the plant&#x27;s use in making puddings:
== Distribution and habitat ==

Bistort is a native of Europe but is often cultivated and has become naturalized in other parts of the world such as in the United States in New England. It is typically found growing in moist meadows, nutrient-rich wooded swamps, forest edges, wetlands, parks, gardens, and disturbed ground.

==Cultivation==
This species is grown as an ornamental garden plant, especially the form &#x27;Superba&#x27; which has larger, more showy flowers, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. It is suitable for use as a marginal or in bog gardens. Bistort has been cultivated as a vegetable, its roots, leaves, and young shoots being steamed or boiled. Many of its occurrences in the wild may be as a garden escape.

==Uses==
Bistort has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. The roots are rich in tannic and gallic acids and both these and the leaves have been used to treat wounds.

In Northern England, the plant was used to make a bitter pudding in Lent from a combination of the leaves, oatmeal, egg, and other herbs. It is the principal ingredient of dock pudding or Easter-Ledge pudding. The root of Bistort can be used to produce an astringent that was used in medicine. The roots are also eaten in Russia and northern Asia.

<text>A wax museum or waxworks usually consists of a collection of wax sculptures representing famous people from history and contemporary personalities exhibited in lifelike poses, wearing real clothes.

Some wax museums have a special section dubbed the &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot;, in which the more grisly exhibits are displayed. Some collections are more specialized, as, for example, collections of wax medical models once used for training medical professionals. Many museums or displays in historical houses that are not wax museums as such use wax figures as part of their displays. The origin of wax museums goes back to the early 18th century at least, and wax funeral effigies of royalty and some other figures exhibited by their tombs had essentially been tourist attractions well before that.

==History before 1800==

The making of life-size wax figures wearing real clothes grew out of the funeral practices of European royalty. In the Middle Ages it was the habit to carry the corpse, fully dressed, on top of the coffin at royal funerals, but this sometimes had unfortunate consequences in hot weather, and the custom of making an effigy in wax for this role grew, again wearing actual clothes so that only the head and hands needed wax models. After the funeral these were often displayed by the tomb or elsewhere in the church, and became a popular attraction for visitors, which it was often necessary to pay to view.

The Westminster Abbey Museum in London has a collection of British royal funeral effigies made of varying materials going back to that of Edward III of England&#x27;s wooden likeness (died 1377), as well as those of figures such as the naval hero Horatio Nelson, and Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond, who also had her parrot stuffed and displayed. From the funeral of Charles II in 1680 they were no longer placed on the coffin but were still made for later display. The effigy of Charles II, open-eyed and standing, was displayed over his tomb until the early 19th century, when all the Westminster effigies were removed from the abbey itself. Nelson&#x27;s effigy was a pure tourist attraction, commissioned the year after his death in 1805, and his burial not in the Abbey but in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral after a government decision that major public figures should in future be buried there. Concerned for their revenue from visitors, the Abbey decided it needed a rival attraction for admirers of Nelson.
In European courts including that of France the making of posed wax figures became popular. Antoine Benoist (1632–1717) was a French court painter and sculptor in wax to King Louis XIV. He exhibited forty-three wax figures of the French &quot;Royal Circle&quot; at his residence in Paris. Thereafter, the king authorized the figurines to be shown throughout France. His work became so highly regarded that James II of England invited him to visit England in 1684. There he executed works of the English king and members of his court. A seated figure of Peter the Great of Russia survives, made by an Italian artist, after the Tsar was impressed by the figures he saw at the Chateau of Versailles. The Danish court painter Johann Salomon Wahl executed figures of the Danish king and queen in about 1740.

The &#x27;Moving Wax Works of the Royal Court of England&#x27;, a museum or exhibition of 140 life-size figures, some apparently with clockwork moving parts, opened by Mrs Mary in Fleet Street in London was doing excellent business in 1711. Philippe Curtius, waxwork modeller to the French court, opened his &quot;Cabinet de Cire&quot; as a tourist attraction in Paris in 1770, which remained open until 1802. In 1783 this added a &quot;Caverne des Grands Voleurs&quot; (&quot;Cave of the Great Thieves&quot;), an early &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot;. He bequeathed his collection to his protégée Marie Tussaud, who during the French Revolution made death masks of the executed royals.

==Notable wax museums==

Madame Tussauds, historically associated with London, is the most famous name associated with wax museums, although it was not the earliest wax museum, as is sometimes thought. In 1835 Madame Tussaud established her first permanent exhibition in London&#x27;s Baker Street. By the late 19th century most large cities had some kind of commercial wax museum, like the in Paris or the Panoptikum Hamburg, and for a century these remained highly popular. In the late 20th century it became harder for them to compete with other attractions.

Today there are also Madame Tussauds in Dam Square, Amsterdam; Berlin; Madame Tussauds Hong Kong; Shanghai; and four locations in the United States: the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, Times Square in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood.

Louis Tussaud&#x27;s wax museum in San Antonio, Texas, is across the street from the historic Alamo. Others are located on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, and Grand Prairie, Texas.

Among the most notable wax museums is the Life of Christ Museum located in Fatima, the city internationally known for the phenomenon of the apparitions of the Virgin Mary that allegedly occurred in Portugal. Tony Julius, director of the London company that manufactured the wax figures and former collaborator of the Madame Tussauds Museum, considered it the third best wax museum in the world.

One of the most popular and famous wax museums in the United States for decades was The Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California, near Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. The museum opened in 1962 and through the years added many wax figures of famous show business figures. Several stars attended the unveilings of the wax incarnations and some added their handprints, footprints, and/or signatures in cement there ala Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. The museum was profiled on a number of television programs and occasionally referenced on TV dramas given its longtime success as a tourist attraction, no doubt in part due to the close proximity to Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm and Disneyland. The museum closed its doors on October 31, 2005, after years of dwindling attendance.

A very similar museum occasionally confused with the Movieland Wax Museum is the Hollywood Wax Museum located in Hollywood, California which features almost exclusively figures of movie actors displayed in settings associated with their roles in popular movies. This group of museums includes Hollywood Wax Museum Branson in Branson, Missouri along with Hollywood Wax Museum Pigeon Forge in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and Hollywood Wax Museum Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. With the original location having been developed in the mid-1960s, this group of museums went against the late 20th century trend of declining wax museum attendance, with the Branson location having undergone a substantial expansion and remodeling in 2008 and 2009 including an animated ride and a mirror maze.

Another popular wax museum is the Musée Conti Wax Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, which features wax figures portraying the city&#x27;s history as well as a &quot;Haunted Dungeon&quot; section of wax figures of famous characters from horror films and literature. This museum is now closed and the Conti building was converted into condos. The museum was rumored to reopen at Jazzland theme park some indefinite date in the future but that park itself closed before long. Several of the wax figures are now on display in Darrow, Louisiana at The Great River Road Museum near Houmas House.

Another popular wax museum in the U.S. is the Wax Museum at Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf in San Francisco, California.

BibleWalk is a Christian wax museum in Mansfield, Ohio. It has received attention for its use of celebrity wax figures in its religious scenes, originally a cost-saving measure when new wax figures were deemed too expensive.

The Royal London Wax Museum was open in downtown Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, from 1970 to 2010 in the Steamship Terminal building, it featured &quot;royalty to rogues and the renowned.&quot; It was forced to close when the building required seismic upgrades.

The National Wax Museum in Dublin, Ireland is a wax museum which hosts well over a hundred figures. For many years it has had only one sculptor, PJ Heraty, who continued producing figures even while the museum was closed. Meanwhile, it could be re-opened at a new location. During the last few years some other new wax museums are starting around the world. In 2009 Dreamland Wax Museum opened in Gramado, in the south of Brazil.

The National Presidential Wax Museum in Keystone, South Dakota is the only wax museum in the world to feature every U.S. president. Their exhibits also include other notable figures from history such as General George Custer, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Sitting Bull. Originally created by the famed sculptor Katherine Stubergh, the museum includes death and life masks of notable Hollywood celebrities including Mae West and Sid Grauman. Their most revered exhibit is a depiction of George W. Bush standing on the rubble of the World Trade Center with NYFD fireman Bob Beckwith following the attacks on September 11, 2001.

India&#x27;s first wax museum opened in December 2005 in Kanyakumari. Now located to Kanyakumari Railway Station it contains wax statues of celebrities at Multi Functional Complex Kanyakumari. The biggest wax museum in India named Mother&#x27;s Wax Museum was opened in November 2014 in New Town, Kolkata. Another branch opened in July 2008 at the historical site of Old Goa with a collection of religious statues.

Madame Tussauds opened its first museum in India at New Delhi in 2017.

New York wax museum has Lina Medina’s wax figure.

<doc id="153961" wikidata="Q368373" url="?curid=153961" title="Heliacal rising">
<text>The heliacal rising ( ) of a star or a planet occurs annually when it becomes visible above the eastern horizon at dawn just before sunrise (thus becoming &quot;the morning star&quot;). A heliacal rising marks the time when a star or planet becomes visible for the first time again in the night sky after having set with the Sun at the western horizon in a previous sunset (its heliacal setting), having since been in the sky only during daytime, obscured by sunlight.

Historically, the most important such rising is that of Sirius, which was an important feature of the Egyptian calendar and astronomical development. The rising of the Pleiades heralded the start of the Ancient Greek sailing season, using celestial navigation, as well as the farming season (attested by Hesiod in his Works and Days). Heliacal rising is one of several types of risings and settings, mostly they are grouped into morning and evening risings and settings of objects in the sky. Culmination in the evening and then morning is set apart by half a year, while on the other hand risings and settings in the evenings and the mornings are only at the equator set apart by half a year.

== Cause and significance ==
Relative to the stars, the Sun appears to drift eastward about one degree per day along a path called the ecliptic because there are 360 degrees in any complete revolution (circle), which takes about 365 days in the case of one revolution of the Earth around the Sun. Any given &quot;distant&quot; star in the belt of the ecliptic will be visible at night for only half of the year, when it will always remain below the horizon. During the other half of the year it will appear to be above the horizon but not visible because the sunlight is too bright during the day. The star&#x27;s heliacal rising will occur when the Earth has moved to a point in its orbit where the star appears on the eastern horizon at dawn. Each day after the heliacal rising, the star will rise slightly earlier and remain visible for longer before the light from the rising sun overwhelms it. Over the following days the star will move further and further westward (about one degree per day) relative to the Sun, until eventually it is no longer visible in the sky at sunrise because it has already set below the western horizon. This is called the &quot;acronycal setting&quot;.

The same star will reappear in the eastern sky at dawn approximately one year after its previous heliacal rising. For stars near the ecliptic, the small difference between the solar and sidereal years due to axial precession will cause their heliacal rising to recur about one sidereal year (about 365.2564 days) later, though this depends on its proper motion. For stars far from the ecliptic, the period is somewhat different and varies slowly, but in any case the heliacal rising will move all the way through the zodiac in about 26,000 years due to precession of the equinoxes.

Because the heliacal rising depends on the observation of the object, its exact timing can be dependent on weather conditions.

Heliacal phenomena and their use throughout history have made them useful points of reference in archeoastronomy.

== Non-application to circumpolar stars ==
Some stars, when viewed from latitudes not at the equator, do not rise or set. These are circumpolar stars, which are either always in the sky or never. For example, the North Star (Polaris) is not visible in Australia and the Southern Cross is not seen in Europe, because they always stay below the respective horizons. 

The term &quot;circumpolar&quot; is somewhat localised as between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the Southern polar constellations have a brief spell of annual visibility (thus &quot;heliacal&quot; rising and &quot;cosmic&quot; setting) and the same applies as to the other polar constellations in respect of the reverse tropic.

== History ==
Constellations containing stars that rise and set were incorporated into early calendars or zodiacs. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks all used the heliacal risings of various stars for the timing of agricultural activities.

Because of its position about 40° off the ecliptic, the heliacal risings of the bright star Sirius in Ancient Egypt occurred not over a period of exactly one sidereal year but over a period called the &quot;Sothic year&quot; (from &quot;Sothis&quot;, the name for the star Sirius). The Sothic year was about a minute longer than a Julian year of 365.25 days. Since the development of civilization, this has occurred at Cairo approximately on July 19 on the Julian calendar. Its returns also roughly corresponded to the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile, although the flooding is based on the tropical year and so would occur about three quarters of a day earlier per century in the Julian or Sothic year. (July 19, 1000 BC in the Julian Calendar is July 10 in the proleptic Gregorian Calendar. At that time, the sun would be somewhere near Regulus in Leo, where it is around August 21 in the 2020s.) The ancient Egyptians appear to have constructed their 365-day civil calendar at a time when Wep Renpet, its New Year, corresponded with Sirius&#x27;s return to the night sky. Although this calendar&#x27;s lack of leap years caused the event to shift one day every four years or so, astronomical records of this displacement led to the discovery of the Sothic cycle and, later, the establishment of the more accurate Julian and Alexandrian calendars.

The Egyptians also devised a method of telling the time at night based on the heliacal risings of 36 decan stars, one for each 10° segment of the 360° circle of the zodiac and corresponding to the ten-day &quot;weeks&quot; of their civil calendar.

To the Māori of New Zealand, the Pleiades are called Matariki, and their heliacal rising signifies the beginning of the new year (around June). The Mapuche of South America called the Pleiades &quot;Ngauponi&quot; which in the vicinity of the &quot;we tripantu&quot; (Mapuche new year) will disappear by the west, &quot;lafkenmapu&quot; or &quot;ngulumapu&quot;, appearing at dawn to the East, a few days before the birth of new life in nature. Heliacal rising of Ngauponi, i.e. appearance of the Pleiades by the horizon over an hour before the sun approximately 12 days before the winter solstice, announced &quot;we tripantu&quot;.

When a planet has a heliacal rising, there is a conjunction with the sun beforehand. Depending on the type of conjunction, there may be a syzygy, eclipse, transit, or occultation of the sun.

==Acronycal and cosmic(al)==
The rising of a planet above the eastern horizon at sunset is called its &quot; rising&quot;, which for a superior planet signifies an opposition, another type of syzygy. When the Moon has an acronycal rising, it will occur near full moon and thus, two or three times a year, a noticeable lunar eclipse.

&quot;&quot; can refer to rising with sunrise or setting at sunset, or the first setting at morning twilight.

Risings and settings are furthermore differentiated between &quot;apparent&quot; (the above discussed) and actual or &quot;true&quot; risings or settings.

===Overview===
The use of the terms cosmical and acronycal is not consistent. The following table gives an overview of the different application of the terms to the rising and setting instances.

<text>Frederick Griffith (1877–1941) was a British bacteriologist whose focus was the epidemiology and pathology of bacterial pneumonia. In January 1928 he reported what is now known as Griffith&#x27;s experiment, the first widely accepted demonstrations of bacterial transformation, whereby a bacterium distinctly changes its form and function.
He showed that &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, implicated in many cases of lobar pneumonia, could transform from one strain into a different strain. The observation was attributed to an unidentified underlying principle, later known in the Avery laboratory as the &quot;transforming principle&quot; (abbreviated as T. P.) and identified as DNA.
America&#x27;s leading pneumococcal researcher, Oswald T. Avery, speculated that Griffith had failed to apply adequate controls. A cautious and thorough researcher, and a reticent individual, Griffith&#x27;s tendency was to publish only findings that he believed truly significant, and Griffith&#x27;s findings were rapidly confirmed by researchers in Avery&#x27;s laboratory. His discovery was one of the first to show the central role of DNA in heredity.

==Early life==

Frederick Griffith was born in Prescot, Merseyside (formerly in Lancashire) England, in late 1877 (Registered December quarter in Prescot, Lancashire registration district, vol 8b, page 670), and attended Liverpool University. Thereafter, he worked at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, the Joseph Tie Laboratory, and the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis. In 1910 Fred Griffith was hired by the local government board.

==Ministry of Health office==
During World War I (1914–18), the local government board&#x27;s laboratory was assumed by the national government, namely UK government, and became the Ministry of Health&#x27;s Pathological Laboratory—where Griffith was medical officer. UK government spent money sparingly on the laboratory, which remained very basic, though Griffith and his colleague, William M. Scott, &quot;could do more with a kerosene tin and a primus stove than most men could do with a palace&quot;.

Griffith was sent pneumococci samples taken from patients throughout the country, amassed a large number, and would type—in other words classify—each pneumococci sample to search patterns of pneumonia epidemiology, and Griffith experimented on mice for improved understanding of its pathology. Griffith performed the pivotal experiments—actually very many experiments—during the 1920s.

With outbreak of World War II (1939–45), the laboratory was expanded into the Emergency Public Health Laboratory Service.

==Griffith&#x27;s experiment==

Pneumococci has two general forms—&quot;rough&quot; (R) and &quot;smooth&quot; (S). The S form is more virulent, and bears a capsule, which is a slippery polysaccharide coat—outside the peptidoglycan cell wall common among all classical bacteria—and prevents efficient phagocytosis by the host&#x27;s innate immune cells. Injected subcutaneously with S form, mice succumbed to pneumonia and death within several days. However, the R form, lacking a capsule—its outer surface being cell wall—is relatively avirulent, and does not cause pneumonia as often.

When Griffith injected heat-killed S into mice, as expected, no disease ensued. When mice were injected with a mixture of heat-killed S and live R, however, pneumonia and death ensued. The live R had transformed into S—and replicated as such—often characterized as Griffith&#x27;s Experiment. More accurately, point six of Griffith&#x27;s abstract reports that R tended to transform into S if a large amount of live R, alone, were injected, and that adding much heat-killed S made transformation &quot;reliable&quot; Griffith also induced some pneumococci to transform back and forth.

Griffith also reported transformation of serological &quot;type&quot;—bacterial antigenicity—distinct from presence or absence of a capsule. Bacteriologist Fred Neufeld, of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany, had earlier identified the pneumococcal types, confirmed and expanded by Alphonse Dochez at Oswald Avery&#x27;s laboratory in America at The Rockefeller Hospital. Types I, II, and III were each a distinct antigenic grouping, whereas type IV was a catchall of varying antigenicities not matching other types.

Illustrating the plasticity of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, the abstract of Griffith&#x27;s paper reports, &quot;The S form of Type I has been produced from the R form of Type II, and the R form of Type I has been transformed into the S form of Type II&quot;.

==Impact of Griffith&#x27;s discovery==

===Biomedical reception===

One of America&#x27;s most prominent pneumococcus experts, Oswald Avery, in New York at The Rockefeller Hospital—which opened in 1910 on The Rockefeller Institute&#x27;s campus—initially explained that Griffith&#x27;s experiments must have been poorly conducted and succumbed to contamination. Avery biographer and colleague at The Rockefeller Institute, microbiologist Rene Dubos, recruited by The Rockefeller Institute from France, later described Griffith&#x27;s findings as &quot;exploding a bombshell in the field of pneumococcal immunology&quot;.

Avery&#x27;s associate Martin Dawson at The Rockefeller Hospital confirmed each of Griffith&#x27;s reported findings. Even before Griffith&#x27;s publication, Fred Neufeld had confirmed them as well, and was merely awaiting publication of Griffith&#x27;s findings before publishing his confirmation. Over the following years, Avery&#x27;s illness, Graves&#x27; disease, kept him much out of his laboratory as other researchers in it experimented to determine, largely by process of elimination, which constituent was the transforming factor.

Microbiologists endeavored during the 1930s to dispel the monomorphist tenet, prevailing as institutional dogma, largely prevailing into the 21st century.

==Posthumous identification of transforming factor==

===Last days of Griffith and colleague===
The first Griffith Memorial Lecture indicates that Fred Griffith died on the night of 17 April 1941—though the fourth lecture indicates that he died in his apartment in February 1941—alongside friend and colleague William M. Scott amid an air raid during World War II&#x27;s London Blitz. A few weeks earlier, Scott had become director of the laboratory, which, with the outbreak of war, had become Emergency Public Health Laboratory Service. Both dated 3 May 1941, his obituary in &quot;The Lancet&quot; mentioned the historical discovery briefly, and his obituary in &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; failed to mention it.

===Avery &quot;et al&quot; then Watson &amp; Crick===
In 1944 identification of the transforming factor was published in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Medicine&quot; by Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty of The Rockefeller Hospital. This identification departed from the prevailing belief that the &quot;protein&quot; content of chromosomes probably was the anatomical structure of genes, although it would take another decade—till Watson and Crick&#x27;s 1953 paper in &quot;Nature&quot; indicating DNA&#x27;s molecular structure suggesting how a molecule as seemingly simple as DNA could encode the structure of proteins—for the interpretation of DNA as genes to become widely accepted.

===Applications===

Biologists made little more than speculation of Griffith&#x27;s report of transformation until genetics research in 1951. Griffith&#x27;s report was virtually ignored by clinicians, and by the medical sector as a whole.

==Griffith&#x27;s further work and legacy==
===Bacteriology===
In 1931 Frederick Griffith coauthored a paper on acute tonsillitis—its sequelae, epidemiology, and bacteriology. In 1934, Griffith reported voluminous findings on the serological typing of &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. More casually as well as medically called simply streptococcus, &quot;S pyogenes&quot; is implicated in conditions ranging from the usually minor strep throat, to the sometimes fatal scarlet fever, to the often fatal puerperal fever, to the usually fatal streptococcal sepsis. Streptococcal infection was a frequent coinfection complicating recovery from lobar pneumonia by pneumococci infection.

===Medicine===
By 1967 pneumococcal transformation had been shown to occur &quot;in vivo&quot; naturally, and it was further shown that treatment with streptomycin during dual infection by two pneumococcal strains could increase transformation—and virulence—while for the first time pneumococcal transformation was shown to occur in the respiratory tract. In 1969 it was shown &quot;in vivo&quot; that during drug treatment of a host, pneumococci could acquire genes from antibiotic-resistant streptococci, already in the host, and thereby the pneumococci could become resistant to erythromycin.

<text>In naval architecture, a poop deck is a deck that forms the roof of a cabin built in the rear, or &quot;aft&quot;, part of the superstructure of a ship.

The name originates from the French word for stern, , from Latin . Thus the poop deck is technically a stern deck, which in sailing ships was usually elevated as the roof of the stern or &quot;after&quot; cabin, also known as the &quot;poop cabin&quot; (or simply the poop). On sailing ships, the helmsman would steer the craft from the quarterdeck, immediately in front of the poop deck. At the stern, the poop deck provides an elevated position ideal for observation. While the main purpose of the poop is adding buoyancy to the aft, on a sailing ship the cabin was also used as an accommodation for the shipmaster and officers.

On modern, motorized warships, the ship functions which were once carried out on the poop deck have been moved to the bridge, usually located in a superstructure.

<text>Airliners.net is a Canadian-owned, Australian-based global aviation website that includes an extensive photo database of aircraft and airports, as well as a forum catering to aviation enthusiasts. Inititally Swedish-based, created by Swede Johan Lundgren, Jr., the site originated in 1996 as &quot;Pictures of Modern Airliners&quot;. It was acquired by the US company Demand Media (now known as Leaf Group) in 2007, and underwent a major redesign in 2016.

==History==
Johan Lundgren, Jr., an IT student/aviation enthusiast attending Luleå University of Technology in Sweden, created the site &quot;Pictures of Modern Airliners&quot; in 1996. Lundgren had been working on the site during his military service. It initially hosted only his own aircraft photos before a new section was created for other photographers to upload their photos.

In 1997, Lundgren transitioned to a new site entitled &quot;Airliners.net&quot; and established a web server in his dormitory room. Three more servers were added, and eventually all servers were relocated to the computer rooms at the university. Lundgren started investing all of his time into the site, although he received help from a growing number of volunteers.

On 27 July 2007, Lundgren announced that the site would be acquired by Demand Media. It was sold to the company for US$8.2 million. Reasons behind the decision included the difficulty of managing the rapidly growing site, which was by that point supported by 25 servers.

A revamped site was launched on 14 June 2016.

In February 2017, the site was acquired by VerticalScope, majority-owned by Torstar.

==Membership==
The site offers free membership, using online advertising instead as a source of revenue. Before the June 2016 redesign, Airliners.net provided three levels of membership: the Photographer Account, Premium Membership and First Class Membership. The latter two required payment, while a Photographer Account could be created for free.

==Features==
The site has two main features: the photo database and the forum. The database contains over 2.7 million photos with over 8.6 billion total views as of June 2016. All photos undergo screening prior to being admitted to the database, which can be searched by various factors including aircraft type, the airport at which the photo was taken and the aircraft registration. The forum is divided into ten subforums: Civil Aviation; Travel, Polls &amp; Preferences; Technical/Operations; Aviation Hobby; Aviation Photography; Photography Feedback; Trip Reports; Military Aviation &amp; Space Flight; Non-Aviation; and Site Related. Airliners.net also offers a complimentary newsletter service and a database of information on aircraft types developed with the help of Aerospace Publications.

<text>Skin Two is a fetish magazine covering aspects of the worldwide fetish subculture. The name is a reference to fetish clothing as a &quot;second skin&quot;.

==History and profile==
&quot;Skin Two&quot; was founded in 1983 by the publisher Tim Woodward and the photographer Grace Lau.

Published in London, Britain and circulated throughout the globe, &quot;Skin Two magazine&quot; provides information about fetish fashion, events, parties, people and news. A major concentration of the magazine is latex and other fetish clothing and the people and events related to the wearing of this clothing and alternative fashion in general. There is also a lot of information and features on fetishism and BDSM in general. The German version of the magazine, &quot;Skin Two Germany&quot;, was started by Peter Czernich in 1987. It was closed in 1989.

The magazine has also provided a stepping stone to further success for several internationally known writers, fetish models and photographers. Notable names featured in Skin Two include Tim Burton, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Dita Von Teese and Katy Perry.

&quot;Skin Two magazine&quot; is still published by Tim Woodward&#x27;s company KFS Media, which has recently launched a sister periodical called &quot;KFS Magazine&quot;, covering the wider range of alternative sexuality as a whole.

==Skin Two Clothing==
Skin Two is also a clothing and accessories label, which is currently manufactured and sold by UK-based fetishwear company Honour Ltd under licence of KFS Media. As of 2022, Honour has re-branded itself as Skin Two.

==Skin Two Rubber Ball==
The magazine hosts this ball for fetish-related wear and people into fetishism and BDSM in general. It&#x27;s the central event in a weekend of fetish parties, held in London annually.

<doc id="153975" wikidata="Q608561" url="?curid=153975" title="Motorcycle personal protective equipment">
<text>To improve motorcycle safety, many countries mandate the wearing of personal protective equipment such as protective clothing and helmets. Protective clothing may include certain types of jackets, gloves, boots, and pants. Jackets meant for motorcyclists are typically made of leather or specialized man-made fabrics like cordura or Kevlar. These jackets typically include padding on the elbow, spine, and shoulder regions. This was once quite bulky, but modern technology and materials have made it unobtrusive. Gloves are generally made of leather or Kevlar and some include carbon fiber knuckle protection. Boots, especially those for sport riding, include reinforcement and plastic caps on the ankle and toe areas. Pants are usually leather, cordura, or Kevlar. Except for helmets, none of these items are required by law in any state in the USA, or in any part of the UK but are recommended by many of those who ride.

&quot;Off road&quot; riders wear a range of plastic armour to protect against injury from falling off, hitting other riders and bikes, debris kicked up from the rear wheel of leading bikes, and from running into track barriers protecting the public. This armour protects the extremities from breakage and dislocation and the back and chest from strain and broken bones. Although fairly efficient, it is of course not always completely effective. Many riders wear &quot;roost protectors&quot; designed specifically to protect against painful debris from other bikes, but are of no use in a fall or collision.

==Clothing==

===Historical development===
Originally, motorcycle leathers were adapted from tank corps gear immediately following World War I. Duster coats, which tended to catch in the wheels, were switched for short coats. Wide-pegged breeches were worn by some motorcycle police and by dispatch riders in World War II. The classic American Perfecto motorcycle jacket with epaulets and diagonal zipper, made famous by Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild One,&quot; (1954) was invented in 1928 by Irving Schott, of Schott NYC in New York City. Leather chaps, adapted from cowboy gear, were used by American bikers starting in the early 1960s.

The one-piece racing leather suit, usually referred to as &#x27;racing leathers&#x27;, was first used by world champion motorcycle racer Geoff Duke in the 1950s. Duke had the suit made for the purposes of streamlining, not safety, and like the majority of the leathers used at the time, was made from horsehide.

In 1994, the first leathers to achieve the European Standard for motorcycle clothing (EN 13595) were made by BKS (Made-to-Measure) Ltd and then Hideout Leather Ltd. These two companies went on to become the main suppliers of motorcycle clothing to the British police and emergency services (as well as supplying professional racers and ordinary civilians).

In the European Union and UK, motorcycle garments must have armour on the inside at major impact regions such as shoulders, elbows, hips (with the exception of Class A or B) and knees. Optional protection may be present at the back, chest and lumbar. The European Standards for these protectors are EN 1621-1:2012, EN 1621-2:2014 and EN 1621-3:2018. Motorcycle armor was originally made from high density foam or foam backed hard polymers for impact absorption, and designed to prevent or reduce injury by spreading and dampening impact and shear strains to the wearer. However, viscoelastic materials are increasingly being used because they combine being soft to wear with significant impact absorption. In Europe, by law, armor has to have a CE mark. CE-marked armor comes in two levels, with Level 2 providing greater protection.

Also, some motorcycle jackets use an airbag system. It deploys in the event of an accident, inflating to protect the rider&#x27;s neck, torso, and lower back (see also Airbag and Air bag vest). Airbag protection has been used in MotoGP since 2007, and has been compulsory since 2018.

In September 2021, &quot;Motorcycle News&quot; reported that variable-rigidity clothing could be the future of motorcycle clothing. Wang &quot;et al&quot; (2021) described fabrics with tunable mechanical properties: &quot;Their design can target desirable characteristics, such as high impact resistance.&quot;

===Leathers===

Leathers are one-piece suits or two-piece jackets and trousers worn by motorcyclists, mainly for protection in a crash. In most cases, the type of leather used is not fashion leather but protective leather, which is thicker, stronger, and only moderately flexible. Today, kangaroo leather is becoming popular for its suppleness, light weight, and strength compared to cowhide. Not all leathers used in garments perform equally; products made from full grain, top grain, corrected grain, and suede can have different levels of resistance to abrasion, as well as tearing and bursting forces.

Leather suits were the first motorcyclists&#x27; garments to be tested using the Cambridge impact abrasion tester, Some leather products available have been certified as meeting the European Standard EN 13595-1:2002.

===Textiles===

An alternative to leather is clothing constructed of engineered textiles. These can offer improved weather protection from heat, cold, and water, and the increased utility these garments tend to provide in terms of pockets and vents. Common materials include high density (600–1000 Denier) ballistic nylon (e.g., Cordura) and Kevlar, or blends of Kevlar, Cordura, and Lycra; and often include waterproof liners made from materials such as Gore-Tex. In both CE marked (meets European Standards) and non-protective garments, localised protection may be provided by armour and airbag systems.

Not all textile clothing is made from synthetic materials. Denim and heavyweight waxed cotton was used for many years before the development of modern materials.

==Boots==


Boots are worn by motorcycle riders and passengers to prevent or reduce harm to their feet and ankles while riding and in the event of a crash. They are designed using materials and seam construction that are impact, abrasion, cut, tear and burst resistant. Tough, strong, moderately flexible boots with stiff soles provide the rider protection from a number of risks. Boots with oil-resistant, rubber-based composite soles give a grip on the pavement and help keep the rider&#x27;s feet on the pegs. Boots may also have energy absorbers and load spreaders on the shin, inside and outside of each ankle. A stiff sole working laterally helps prevent or decrease crash injuries caused by crushing and shear strain.

There is a European standard available for motorcycle boots, and it is a legal requirement in Europe and the UK for these boots to be CE certified. It tests them for resistance to abrasion, penetration by sharp objects and lateral crushing. The label consists of a motorcycle icon, the designation of the test they&#x27;ve passed and then a series of four numbers. The more &#x27;2&#x27;s on the CE label, the more protective the boot. (1 denotes rudimentary protection, while 2 indicates better protection – in tests of resistance against abrasion, cuts and being crushed.)

==Armour==

Armour increases the chances of a motorcyclist surviving an accident. The most common form of armour was high-density foam but viscoelastic material has become more common. It is fitted into the shoulders, elbows, back, hips and knees of motorcycle PPE clothing. Research by Afquir &quot;et al&quot; (2019) suggested that coccyx protection was crucial but often omitted. Separate protectors are also available, typically for the chest and back, which are worn under other items of clothing.

The most widely cited standard for armor is its CE rating: level 1 (lower protection) or level 2 (better impact absorption). The criteria for levels 1 and 2 vary by intended use – back protection, air bag vest or body armor each have different requirements. The CE standards also classify the surface area that armor protects. For example, body armour is classed as type A (limited coverage) or type B (better coverage). And back protectors are classed as either Centre Back (CB) – which offers no protection to the shoulder blades – or Full Back (FB) coverage.

Research has found limitations with these standards. De Rome &quot;et al&quot; (2011) found that motorcycle armour was not associated with less risk of fractures. Work by Albanese &quot;et al&quot; (2017) could explain why: &quot;The allowable transmitted force of EN 1621-1 may be too high to effectively reduce the probability of impact injury.&quot;.

Dr Roderick Woods at Cambridge University led the work on which the CE standard is based. Initially, there were three levels of armour: Level 1 would be tested with an impact of 40 Joules, Level 2 at 50 Joules, and Level 3 at 60 Joules. The mean transmitted force of all impacts would be below 25 kN, and no single impact should exceed 37.5 kN. Two Italian manufacturers – allegedly concerned their armour would not pass the highest standard – successfully lobbied for Level 3 to be removed. It contributed evidence to the assertion that the EU standards for motorcycle PPE have been subject to &quot;regulatory capture&quot; by manufacturers (a claim reiterated with the advent of EN 17092).

==Helmet==
A motorcycle helmet is protective headgear used by motorcycle riders. The primary goal of a motorcycle helmet is to protect the rider&#x27;s head during impact, although many helmets provide additional protection such as a face shield. In many countries the wearing of motorcycle helmets is mandatory.

Helmets are made in two main layers: hard and energy-absorbing. The hard shell spreads an impact over a larger area, while deformation of the liner (often polystyrene foam) absorbs energy so less is transferred to the skull and brain.

There are three main styles: flip-face, open-face and full-face. An open-face helmet, which includes half helmets and three-quarter helmets, will protect everything but the face. Full-face helmets protect the skull, plus providing protection for the lower jaw as well as the face itself. Full-face helmets offer much more protection than open-face helmets.

Several manufacturers have introduced full-face helmets with a flip-up front, combining the protection of a full-face with the ease of communication and donning or doffing that an open-face gives.

Studies have consistently shown that wearing a helmet:
* Reduces injury and increases a rider&#x27;s chance of surviving a crash
* Does not contribute to neck injuries
* Does not impair vision or hearing

As with other protective gear, a brightly colored helmet improves the user&#x27;s visibility.

==Gloves==

Motorcycling gloves are typically gloves made of leather. They may have gauntlets to protect the rider&#x27;s wrists from injury, and help reduce drafts while riding in colder climates. Motorcycling gloves typically have reinforced palms intended to protect the rider from abrasion injuries in case of an accident. Under some jurisdictions, if the manufacturer claims the gloves are protective, then they must display CE marking. European Standard EN 13594:2015 is available for this purpose, with gloves certified to Level 1 or Level 2. The latter provides significantly more protection. For example, knuckle protection is not required for a CE Level 1 rating, but is required to achieve Level 2.

Optional features include additional protection or weatherproofing. For touring gloves, such additional features may include advanced insulating materials and waterproof breathable fabric, although touring gloves may still lack advanced armouring features used in motorcycle racing gloves.

Gloves intended for motorcycle racing typically incorporate pre-curved finger sections and the best available protection, obtained through additional armour incorporated within the glove. Additional protection may involve titanium or carbon panels for knuckles and the joints of the fingers. Furthermore, racing gloves may and often do incorporate additional wrist and other protection panels to protect the heel of the hand, back of the hand and other easily injured parts of the hand. Race gloves - and more premium road gloves - often have the pinky finger attached to the ring finger to reduce the chance of it being over flexed backwards during crashes.

Frequently, scaphoid injuries can occur in road, race and motocross accidents. Knobloch &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) found: &quot;Hyperextension rather than wrist flexion appears as the predominant mechanism of wrist injuries in motocross riders. A more axial impact on the wrist is more likely to produce a radial fracture during the landing phase. Preventive strategies are internal muscular wrist stabilisation using eccentric training and external stabilisation by rigid gloves allowing only limited hyperextension.&quot; Often, gloves designed for road and track riding feature hard plastic scaphoid protectors that claim to reduce fracture risk by encouraging the heel to slide on the road (instead of gripping the road surface, causing hyperextension). Some manufacturers claim stingray leather or SuperFabric layers offer the same protective sliding effect. However, there is a shortage of independent research into the effectiveness of SuperFabric, stingray leather and plastic scaphoid protectors.

== Goggles/glasses ==
Motorcycle goggles or glasses help protect the eyes from dust, wind and debris while riding and typically feature anti-fog treatment and protection against UV rays. For motorcycle sports such as motocross, goggles typically feature a foam rim which seals against the face and layered, tinted lenses to accommodate for varying light conditions. Motocross goggles may also have the ability to use &quot;tear-offs&quot;, which are disposable films that cover the lens and which can be easily torn off while riding, to clear the lens of accumulated mud or other fouling and restore good vision to the rider.

==Testing==

===Europe===
For many years, the most recognised method for evaluating protective motorcycle clothing was the European Standard EN 13595-1:2002. This clothing standard was for professional riders. The standard offered two levels of protection: lower (level 1) or higher (level 2) protection with an emphasis on impact abrasion resistance, seam burst resistance, tear strength and cut resistance.

The standard specifies the use of the Cambridge-type impact abrasion tester. This test involves dropping the clothing material onto an abrasive belt moving at 28 km/h and measuring the time for a hole to form. Dr Roderick Woods (at Cambridge University) used accident damage to clothing from real-life crashes – combined with damage seen in manikins thrown from a moving vehicle – to ensure that the test replicated the real-world damage as close as possible. This test found a relationship between fabric thickness and time to hole for protective denim products.

In 2017, a new European Standard began development, and EN 17092 was created. The standard follows similar testing methods, with abrasion resistance, tear strength and seam strength key factors assessed.

A new class system was introduced to replace the level 1 and 2 rating system. Class AAA garments provide the highest possible requirements, while Class AA and Class A garments have lower standards. The tests vary significantly between them. For example, Class A jackets do not require any abrasion resistance on the back. And neither Class A nor AA trousers consider the buttocks a high-risk zone in their test requirements. Only Class AAA trousers protect a rider&#x27;s backside by treating it as &quot;zone 1&quot; for abrasion resistance.

While the standards for EN 13595 were independently validated, there was no peer-reviewed independent validation for the A, AA and AAA standards in EN 17092; the test settings for the AA rating were lowered from 75kph to 70kph because materials in common use in motorcycle garments could not withstand the 75kph starting point.

Two specialist classes are also available. Class B garments provide abrasion resistance but do not require impact protection to be present. Class C garments are to be worn as part of an ensemble and have no abrasion-resistant qualities. However, Class C garments must have a least one impact protector present. This class would be used for garments such as base layers.

EN 17092 abrasion resistance is carried out on a Darmstadt impact abrasion machine rather than the previous Cambridge abrasion machine. The Darmstadt was developed at a similar time but was not adopted by European Committee for Standardization. It involves dropping the test specimen onto a concrete block and assessing whether the layer closest to the skin forms a hole of 5mm or more. The specimen is held on the outer edge of a rotating arm and is travelling at speeds of up to 707rpm when it hits the surface. As the specimen holder is no longer driven, once dropped, the sample will slide on the concrete surface until it stops due to surface friction between it and the concrete surface. Unlike the Cambridge machine, a slide time in seconds is not given. Therefore, no direct comparison is readily available.

EN 17092 was published in March 2020, with EN 13595 withdrawn in March 2023. The Cambridge abrasion and impact cut test methods remain used for EN 13594 glove and EN 13634 motorcycle boot testing. Also, Australia&#x27;s Motorcycle Clothing Assessment Program (MotoCAP) uses the Cambridge impact abrasion test.

===Australia and New Zealand===

A consortium of government and related organisations across Australia and New Zealand established MotoCAP. Its safety ratings assess how well clothing protects a motorcyclist in a crash (based on impact protection, burst resistance and abrasion resistance). Test results are weighted to emphasise the need for greater security in high-risk areas. Additionally, MotoCAP test results give a breathability score based on the Relative Vapour Permeability Index.

==Psychology==
Research at Brunel University investigated riders’ considerations regarding wearing protective clothing. They found: &quot;Greater intentions, anticipated regret and perceived benefits were significantly associated with increased motorcycle jacket, trousers and boots wear, with habit presence and scooter use significantly associated with increased high-visibility wear. Lower intentions, anticipated regret and risk perceptions, being female, not holding a car licence and urban riding were significantly associated with increased non-PPE wear.&quot;

<text>A Domain Name System blocklist, Domain Name System-based blackhole list, Domain Name System blacklist (DNSBL) or real-time blackhole list (RBL) is a service for operation of mail servers to perform a check via a Domain Name System (DNS) query whether a sending host&#x27;s IP address is blacklisted for email spam. Most mail server software can be configured to check such lists, typically rejecting or flagging messages from such sites.

A DNSBL is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy. Dozens of DNSBLs exist. They use a wide array of criteria for listing and delisting addresses. These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, Internet service providers (ISPs) who willingly host spammers, or those which have sent spam to a honeypot system.

Since the creation of the first DNSBL in 1998, the operation and policies of these lists have frequently been controversial, both in Internet advocacy circles and occasionally in lawsuits. Many email systems operators and users consider DNSBLs a valuable tool to share information about sources of spam, but others including some prominent Internet activists have objected to them as a form of censorship. In addition, a small number of DNSBL operators have been the target of lawsuits filed by spammers seeking to have the lists shut down.

== History ==
The first DNSBL was the Real-time Blackhole List (RBL), created in 1997, at first as a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) feed by Paul Vixie, and then as a DNSBL by Eric Ziegast as part of Vixie&#x27;s Mail Abuse Prevention System (MAPS); Dave Rand at Abovenet was its first subscriber. The very first version of the RBL was not published as a DNSBL, but rather a list of networks transmitted via BGP to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all TCP/IP traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services, such as a website. The inventor of the technique later commonly called a DNSBL was Eric Ziegast while employed at Vixie Enterprises.

The term &quot;blackhole&quot; refers to a networking black hole, an expression for a link on a network that drops incoming traffic instead of forwarding it normally. The intent of the RBL was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam, or in other ways. Before an address would be listed on the RBL, volunteers and MAPS staff would attempt repeatedly to contact the persons responsible for it and get its problems corrected. Such effort was considered very important before black-holing all network traffic, but it also meant that spammers and spam supporting ISPs could delay being put on the RBL for long periods while such discussions went on.

Later, the RBL was also released in a DNSBL form and Paul Vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement RBL support in their clients. These allowed the mail software to query the RBL and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of black-holing all traffic.

Soon after the advent of the RBL, others started developing their own lists with different policies. One of the first was Alan Brown&#x27;s Open Relay Behavior-modification System (ORBS). This used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam. ORBS was controversial at the time because many people felt running an open relay was acceptable, and that scanning the Internet for open mail servers could be abusive.

In 2003, a number of DNSBLs came under denial-of-service attacks (DOS). Since no party has admitted to these attacks nor been discovered responsible, their purpose is a matter of speculation. However, many observers believe the attacks are perpetrated by spammers in order to interfere with the DNSBLs&#x27; operation or hound them into shutting down. In August 2003, the firm Osirusoft, an operator of several DNSBLs including one based on the SPEWS data set, shut down its lists after suffering weeks of near-continuous attack.

Technical specifications for DNSBLs came relatively late in RFC5782.

=== URI DNSBLs ===
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) DNSBL is a DNSBL that lists the domain names and sometimes also IP addresses which are found in the &quot;clickable&quot; links contained in the body of spams, but generally not found inside legitimate messages.

URI DNSBLs were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending IP address and the point where that sending IP address was first listed on major sending-IP-based DNSBLs.

In many cases, such elusive spam contains in their links domain names or IP addresses (collectively referred to as a URIs) where that URI was &quot;already&quot; spotted in previously caught spam and where that URI is not found in non-spam e-mail.

Therefore, when a spam filter extracts all URIs from a message and checks them against a URI DNSBL, then the spam can be blocked even if the sending IP for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending IP DNSBL.

Of the three major URI DNSBLs, the oldest and most popular is SURBL. After SURBL was created, some of the volunteers for SURBL started the second major URI DNSBL, URIBL. In 2008, another long-time SURBL volunteer started another URI DNSBL, ivmURI. The Spamhaus Project provides the Spamhaus Domain Block List (DBL) which they describe as domains &quot;found in spam messages&quot;. The DBL is intended as both a URIBL and RHSBL, to be checked against both domains in a message&#x27;s envelope and headers and domains in URLs in message bodies. Unlike other URIBLs, the DBL only lists domain names, not IP addresses, since Spamhaus provides other lists of IP addresses.

URI DNSBLs are often confused with RHSBLs (Right Hand Side BLs). But they are different. A URI DNSBL lists domain names and IPs found in the body of the message. An RHSBL lists the domain names used in the &quot;from&quot; or &quot;reply-to&quot; e-mail address. RHSBLs are of debatable effectiveness since many spams either use forged &quot;from&quot; addresses or use &quot;from&quot; addresses containing popular freemail domain names, such as @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, or @hotmail.com URI DNSBLs are more widely used than RHSBLs, are very effective, and are used by the majority of spam filters.

== Principle ==
To operate a DNSBL requires three things: a domain to host it under, a nameserver for that domain, and a list of addresses to publish.

It is possible to serve a DNSBL using any general-purpose DNS server software. However this is typically inefficient for zones containing large numbers of addresses, particularly DNSBLs which list entire Classless Inter-Domain Routing netblocks. For the large resource consumption when using software designed as the role of a Domain Name Server, there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a DNS blacklist.

The hard part of operating a DNSBL is populating it with addresses. DNSBLs intended for public use usually have specific, published policies as to what a listing means, and must be operated accordingly to attain or sustain public confidence.

=== DNSBL queries ===
When a mail server receives a connection from a client, and wishes to check that client against a DNSBL (let&#x27;s say, &quot;dnsbl.example.net&quot;), it does more or less the following:

# Take the client&#x27;s IP address—say, &quot;192.168.42.23&quot;—and reverse the order of octets, yielding &quot;23.42.168.192&quot;.
# Append the DNSBL&#x27;s domain name: &quot;23.42.168.192.dnsbl.example.net&quot;.
# Look up this name in the DNS as a domain name (&quot;A&quot; record). This will return either an address, indicating that the client is listed; or an &quot;NXDOMAIN&quot; (&quot;No such domain&quot;) code, indicating that the client is not.
# Optionally, if the client is listed, look up the name as a text record (&quot;TXT&quot; record). Most DNSBLs publish information about why a client is listed as TXT records.

Looking up an address in a DNSBL is thus similar to looking it up in reverse-DNS. The differences are that a DNSBL lookup uses the &quot;A&quot; rather than &quot;PTR&quot; record type, and uses a forward domain (such as &quot;dnsbl.example.net&quot; above) rather than the special reverse domain &quot;in-addr.arpa&quot;.

There is an informal protocol for the addresses returned by DNSBL queries which match. Most DNSBLs return an address in the 127.0.0.0/8 IP loopback network. The address 127.0.0.2 indicates a generic listing. Other addresses in this block may indicate something specific about the listing—that it indicates an open relay, proxy, spammer-owned host, etc. For details see RFC 5782.

=== URI DNSBL ===
A URI DNSBL query (and an RHSBL query) is fairly straightforward. The domain name to query is prepended to the DNS list host as follows:

 example.net.dnslist.example.com

where &quot;dnslist.example.com&quot; is the DNS list host and &quot;example.net&quot; is the queried domain. Generally if an A record is returned the name is listed.

=== DNSBL policies ===
Different DNSBLs have different policies. DNSBL policies differ from one another on three fronts:
* Goals. What does the DNSBL &quot;seek&quot; to list? Is it a list of open-relay mail servers or open proxies—or of IP addresses known to send spam—or perhaps of IP addresses belonging to ISPs that harbor spammers?
* Nomination. How does the DNSBL &quot;discover&quot; addresses to list? Does it use nominations submitted by users? Spam-trap addresses or honeypots?
* Listing lifetime. How long does a listing &quot;last&quot;? Are they automatically expired, or only removed manually? What can the operator of a listed host do to have it delisted?

== Types ==
In addition to the different types of listed entities (IP addresses for traditional DNSBLs, host and domain names for RHSBLs, URIs for URIBLs) there is a wide range of semantic variations between lists as to what a listing means. List maintainers themselves have been divided on the issues of whether their listings should be seen as statements of objective fact or subjective opinion and on how their lists should best be used. As a result, there is no definitive taxonomy for DNSBLs. Some names defined here (e.g. &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;NoBL&quot;) are varieties that are not in widespread use and so the names themselves are not in widespread use, but should be recognized by many spam control specialists.

; Whitelist / Allowlist
: A listing is an affirmative indication of essentially absolute trust
; Blacklist / Blocklist
: A listing is a negative indication of essentially absolute distrust
; Grey list
: Most frequently seen as one word (greylist or greylisting) not involving DNSBLs directly, but using temporary deferral of mail from unfamiliar sources to allow for the development of a public reputation (such as DNSBL listings) or to discourage speed-focused spamming. Occasionally used to refer to actual DNSBLs on which listings denote distinct non-absolute levels and forms of trust or distrust.
; Yellow list
: A listing indicates that the source is known to produce a mixture of spam and non-spam to a degree that makes checking other DNSBLs of any sort useless.
; NoBL list
: A listing indicates that the source is believed to send no spam and should not be subjected to blacklist testing, but is not quite as trusted as a whitelisted source.

== Usage ==
* Most message transfer agents (MTA) can be configured to absolutely block or (less commonly) to accept email based on a DNSBL listing. This is the oldest usage form of DNSBLs. Depending on the specific MTA, there can be subtle distinctions in configuration that make list types such as Yellow and NoBL useful or pointless because of how the MTA handles multiple DNSBLs. A drawback of using the direct DNSBL support in most MTAs is that sources not on any list require checking all of the DNSBLs being used with relatively little utility to caching the negative results. In some cases this can cause a significant slowdown in mail delivery. Using White, Yellow, and NoBL lists to avoid some lookups can be used to alleviate this in some MTAs.
* DNSBLs can be used in rule based spam analysis software like Spamassassin where each DNSBL has its own rule. Each rule has a specific positive or negative weight which is combined with other types of rules to score each message. This allows for the use of rules that act (by whatever criteria are available in the specific software) to &quot;whitelist&quot; mail that would otherwise be rejected due to a DNSBL listing or due to other rules. This can also have the problem of heavy DNS lookup load for no useful results, but it may not delay mail as much because scoring makes it possible for lookups to be done in parallel and asynchronously while the filter is checking the message against the other rules.
* It is possible with some toolsets to blend the binary testing and weighted rule approaches. One way to do this is to first check white lists and accept the message if the source is on a white list, bypassing all other testing mechanisms. A technique developed by Junk Email Filter uses Yellow Lists and NoBL lists to mitigate the false positives that occur routinely when using black lists that are not carefully maintained to avoid them.
* Some DNSBLs have been created for uses other than filtering email for spam, but rather for demonstration, informational, rhetorical, and testing control purposes. Examples include the &quot;No False Negatives List,&quot; &quot;Lucky Sevens List,&quot; &quot;Fibonacci&#x27;s List,&quot; various lists encoding GeoIP information, and random selection lists scaled to match coverage of another list, useful as a control for determining whether that list&#x27;s effects are distinguishable from random rejections.

== Criticism ==
Some end-users and organizations have concerns regarding the concept of DNSBLs or the specifics of how they are created and used. Some of the criticisms include:
* Legitimate emails blocked along with spam from shared mailservers. When an ISP&#x27;s shared mailserver has one or more compromised machines sending spam, it can become listed on a DNSBL. End-users assigned to that same shared mailserver may find their emails blocked by receiving mailservers using such a DNSBL. In May 2016, the SORBS system was blocking the SMTP servers of Telstra Australia, Australia&#x27;s largest internet service provider. This is no surprise as at any one time, there would be thousands of computers connected to this mail server infected by zombie type viruses sending spam. The effect is to cut off all the legitimate emails from the users of the Telstra Australia system.
* Lists of dynamic IP addresses. This type of DNSBL lists IP addresses submitted by ISPs as dynamic and therefore presumably unsuitable to send email directly; the end-user is supposed to use the ISP&#x27;s mailserver for all sending of email. But these lists can also accidentally include static addresses, which may be legitimately used by small-business owners or other end-users to host small email servers.
* Lists that include &quot;spam-support operations&quot;, such as MAPS RBL. A spam-support operation is a site that may not directly send spam, but provides commercial services for spammers, such as hosting of Web sites that are advertised in spam. Refusal to accept mail from spam-support operations is intended as a boycott to encourage such sites to cease doing business with spammers, at the expense of inconveniencing non-spammers who use the same site as spammers.
* Some lists have unclear listing criteria and delisting may not happen automatically nor quickly. A few DNSBL operators will request payment (e.g. uceprotect.net) or donation (e.g. SORBS). Some of the many listing/delisting policies can be found in the Comparison of DNS blacklists article.
* Because lists have varying methods for adding IP addresses and/or URIs, it can be difficult for senders to configure their systems appropriately to avoid becoming listed on a DNSBL. For example, the UCEProtect DNSBL seems to list IP addresses merely once they have validated a recipient address or established a TCP connection, even if no spam message is ever delivered.

Despite the criticisms, few people object to the principle that mail-receiving sites should be able to reject undesired mail systematically. One person who does is John Gilmore, who deliberately operates an open mail relay. Gilmore accuses DNSBL operators of violating antitrust law.

A number of parties, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Peacefire, have raised concerns about some use of DNSBLs by ISPs. One joint statement issued by a group including EFF and Peacefire addressed &quot;stealth blocking&quot;, in which ISPs use DNSBLs or other spam-blocking techniques without informing their clients.

=== Lawsuits ===
Spammers have pursued lawsuits against DNSBL operators on similar grounds:
* In 2003, EMarketersAmerica.org filed a lawsuit against a number of DNSBL operators in a Florida court. Backed by spammer Eddy Marin, the company claimed to be a trade organization for email marketers and that DNSBL operators Spamhaus and SPEWS were engaged in restraint of trade. The suit was eventually dismissed for lack of standing.
* In 2006, a U.S. court ordered Spamhaus to pay $11.7 million in damages to the spammer e360 Insight LLC. The order was a default judgment, as Spamhaus, which is based in the UK, had refused to recognize the court&#x27;s jurisdiction and did not defend itself in the e360 lawsuit. In 2011, his decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

<doc id="153981" wikidata="Q141212" url="?curid=153981" title="Postgraduate education">
<text>Postgraduate education, graduate education, or graduate school consists of academic or professional degrees, certificates, diplomas, or other qualifications usually pursued by post-secondary students who have earned an undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s) degree.

The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries, as well as in different institutions within countries. The term &quot;graduate school&quot; or &quot;grad school&quot; is typically used in North America, while &quot;postgraduate&quot; is more common in the rest of the English-speaking world.

Graduate degrees can include master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees, and other qualifications such as graduate diplomas, certificates and professional degrees. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which can include medical school, law school, business school, and other institutions of specialized fields such as nursing, speech–language pathology, engineering, or architecture. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa.

Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. This research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation. In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training (e.g., MPA, MBA, JD, MD), the degrees may consist solely of coursework, without an original research or thesis component. Graduate students in the humanities, sciences and social sciences often receive funding from their university (e.g., fellowships or scholarships) or a teaching assistant position or other job; in the profession-oriented grad programs, students are less likely to get funding, and the fees are typically much higher.

Although graduate school programs are distinct from undergraduate degree programs, graduate instruction (in the US, Australia, and other countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses. Unlike in undergraduate programs, however, it is less common for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level. At the doctorate programs, though, it is quite common for students to take courses from a wider range of study, for which some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as a &quot;residency&quot;, is typically required to be taken from outside the department and university of the degree-seeking candidate to broaden the research abilities of the student.

==Types of postgraduate qualification==
There are two main types of degrees studied for at the postgraduate level: academic and vocational degrees.

===Degrees===
The term &quot;degree&quot; in this context means the moving from one stage or level to another (from French &quot;degré&quot;, from Latin &quot;dē-&quot; + &quot;gradus&quot;), and first appeared in the 13th century.

====History====

Although systems of higher education date back to ancient India, ancient Greece, ancient Rome and ancient China, the concept of &quot;postgraduate&quot; education depends upon the system of awarding degrees at different levels of study, and can be traced to the workings of European medieval universities, mostly Italian. University studies took six years for a bachelor&#x27;s degree and up to twelve additional years for a master&#x27;s degree or doctorate. The first six years taught the faculty of the arts, which was the study of the seven liberal arts: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music theory, grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The main emphasis was on logic. Once a Bachelor of Arts degree had been obtained, the student could choose one of three faculties—law, medicine, or theology—in which to pursue master&#x27;s or doctor&#x27;s degrees.

The degrees of master (from Latin &quot;magister&quot;) and doctor (from Latin &quot;doctor&quot;) were for some time equivalent, &quot;the former being more in favour at Paris and the universities modeled after it, and the latter at Bologna and its derivative universities. At Oxford and Cambridge a distinction came to be drawn between the Faculties of Law, Medicine, and Theology and the Faculty of Arts in this respect, the title of Doctor being used for the former, and that of Master for the latter.&quot; Because theology was thought to be the highest of the subjects, the doctorate came to be thought of as higher than the master&#x27;s.

The main significance of the higher, postgraduate degrees was that they licensed the holder to teach (&quot;doctor&quot; comes from Latin &quot;docere&quot;, &quot;to teach&quot;).

===Definition===
In most countries, the hierarchy of postgraduate degrees is as follows:

Master&#x27;s degrees. These are sometimes placed in a further hierarchy, starting with degrees such as the Master of Arts (from Latin &quot;Magister artium&quot;; M.A.) and Master of Science (from Latin &quot;Magister scientiae&quot;; M.Sc.) degrees, then the Master of Philosophy degree (from Latin &quot;Magister philosophiae&quot;; M.Phil.), and finally the Master of Letters degree (from Latin &quot;Magister litterarum&quot;; M.Litt.) (all formerly known in France as DEA or DESS before 2005, and nowadays Masters too). In the UK, master&#x27;s degrees may be taught or by research: taught master&#x27;s degrees include the Master of Science and Master of Arts degrees which last one year and are worth 180 CATS credits (equivalent to 90 ECTS European credits), whereas the master&#x27;s degrees by research include the Master of Research degree (M.Res.) which also lasts one year and is worth 180 CATS or 90 ECTS credits (the difference compared to the Master of Science and Master of Arts degrees being that the research is much more extensive) and the Master of Philosophy degree which lasts two years. In Scottish Universities, the Master of Philosophy degree tends to be by research or higher master&#x27;s degree and the Master of Letters degree tends to be the taught or lower master&#x27;s degree. In many fields such as clinical social work, or library science in North America, a master&#x27;s is the terminal degree. Professional degrees such as the Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch.) can last to three and a half years to satisfy professional requirements to be an architect. Professional degrees such as the Master of Business Administration degree (M.B.A.) can last up to two years to satisfy the requirement to become a knowledgeable business leader.

Doctorates. These are often further divided into academic and professional doctorates. An academic doctorate can be awarded as a Doctor of Philosophy degree (from Latin &quot;Doctor philosophiae&quot;; Ph.D. or D.Phil.), a Doctor of Psychology degree (from Latin &quot;Doctor psychologia;&quot; Psy.D.), or as a Doctor of Science degree (from Latin &quot;Doctor scientiae&quot;; D.Sc.). The Doctor of Science degree can also be awarded in specific fields, such as a Doctor of Science in Mathematics degree (from Latin &quot;Doctor scientiarum mathematic arum&quot;; D.Sc.Math.), a Doctor of Agricultural Science degree (from Latin &quot;Doctor scientiarum agrariarum&quot;; D.Sc.Agr.), a Doctor of Business Administration degree (D.B.A.), etc. In some parts of Europe, doctorates are divided into the Doctor of Philosophy degree or &quot;junior doctorate&quot;, and the &quot;higher doctorates&quot; such as the Doctor of Science degree, which is generally awarded to highly distinguished professors. A doctorate is the terminal degree in most fields. In the United States, there is little distinction between a Doctor of Philosophy degree and a Doctor of Science degree. In the UK, Doctor of Philosophy degrees are often equivalent to 540 CATS credits or 270 ECTS European credits, but this is not always the case as the credit structure of doctoral degrees is not officially defined.

In some countries such as Finland and Sweden, there is the degree of Licentiate, which is more advanced than a master&#x27;s degree but less so than a doctorate. Credits required are about half of those required for a doctoral degree. Coursework requirements are the same as for a doctorate, but the extent of original research required is not as high as for doctorate. Medical doctors for example are typically licentiates instead of doctors.

In the UK and countries whose education systems were founded on the British model, such as the US, the master&#x27;s degree was for a long time the only postgraduate degree normally awarded, while in most European countries apart from the UK, the master&#x27;s degree almost disappeared. In the second half of the 19th century, however, US universities began to follow the European model by awarding doctorates, and this practice spread to the UK. Conversely, most European universities now offer master&#x27;s degrees parallelling or replacing their regular system, so as to offer their students better chances to compete in an international market dominated by the American model.

In the UK, an equivalent formation to doctorate is the NVQ 5 or QCF 8.

====Honorary degrees====
Most universities award honorary degrees, usually at the postgraduate level. These are awarded to a wide variety of people, such as artists, musicians, writers, politicians, businesspeople, etc., in recognition of their achievements in their various fields. (Recipients of such degrees do not normally use the associated titles or letters, such as &quot;Dr.&quot;)

===Non-degree qualifications===
Postgraduate education can involve studying for qualifications such as postgraduate certificates and postgraduate diplomas. They are sometimes used as steps on the route to a degree, as part of the training for a specific career, or as a qualification in an area of study too narrow to warrant a full degree course.

==Argentina==

===Admission===
In Argentina, the admission to a Postgraduate program at an Argentine University requires the full completion of any undergraduate course, called in Argentina &quot;carrera de grado&quot; (v.gr. Licenciado, Ingeniero or Lawyer degree). The qualifications of &#x27;Licenciado&#x27;, &#x27;Ingeniero&#x27;, or the equivalent qualification in Law degrees (a graduate from a &quot;carrera de grado&quot;) are similar in content, length and skill-set to a joint first and second cycles in the qualification framework of the Bologna Process (that is, Bachelor and Master qualifications).

===Funding===
While a significant portion of postgraduate students finance their tuition and living costs with teaching or research work at private and state-run institutions, international institutions, such as the Fulbright Program and the Organization of American States (OAS), have been known to grant full scholarships for tuition with apportions for housing.

===Degree requirements===
Upon completion of at least two years&#x27; research and coursework as a postgraduate student, a candidate must demonstrate truthful and original contributions to his or her specific field of knowledge within a frame of academic excellence. The Master and Doctoral candidate&#x27;s work should be presented in a dissertation or thesis prepared under the supervision of a tutor or director, and reviewed by a postgraduate committee. This committee should be composed of examiners external to the program, and at least one of them should also be external to the institution.

==Australia==

===Types of postgraduate degrees===

Programmes are divided into coursework-based and research-based degrees. Coursework programs typically include qualifications such as: 
* Graduate certificate, six-month full-time coursework.
* Graduate diploma, twelve-month full-time coursework.
* Master (of Arts, Science or other discipline). 1 year to 2 years of full-time study for coursework and research master&#x27;s and 3 to 4 years of full-time study for extended master&#x27;s degrees (which can allow the use of the word doctor in their title, such as Doctor of Medicine and Juris Doctor). Research master&#x27;s ends in the submission of a thesis.
* Doctor of Philosophy, 3 to 4 years full-time study. Also ends in the submission of a thesis.

* Higher doctorate, awarded usually ten or more years after the completion of PhD (which is a prerequisite of higher doctorate) after submission of a research portfolio that is of a higher standard than that required for the awarding of a PhD.

===Admission===
Generally, the Australian higher education system follows that of its British counterpart (with some notable exceptions). Entrance is decided by merit, entrance to coursework-based programmes is usually not as strict; most universities usually require a &quot;Credit&quot; average as entry to their taught programmes in a field related to their previous undergraduate. On average, however, a strong &quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Distinction&quot; average is the norm for accepted students. Not all coursework programs require the student to already possess the relevant undergraduate degree, they are intended as &quot;conversion&quot; or professional qualification programs, and merely any relevant undergraduate degree with good grades is required.

Ph.D. entrance requirements in the higher ranked schools typically require a student to have postgraduate research honours or a master&#x27;s degree by research, or a master&#x27;s with a significant research component. Entry requirements depend on the subject studied and the individual university. The minimum duration of a Ph.D. programme is two years, but completing within this time span is unusual, with Ph.D.s usually taking an average of three to four years to be completed.

Most of the confusion with Australian postgraduate programmes occurs with the research-based programmes, particularly scientific programmes. Research degrees generally require candidates to have a minimum of a second-class four-year honours undergraduate degree to be considered for admission to a Ph.D. programme (M.Phil. are an uncommon route). In science, a British first class honours (3 years) is not equivalent to an Australian first class honours (1 year research postgraduate programme that requires a completed undergraduate (pass) degree with a high grade-point average). In scientific research, it is commonly accepted that an Australian postgraduate honours is equivalent to a British master&#x27;s degree (in research). There has been some debate over the acceptance of a three-year honours degree (as in the case of graduates from British universities) as the equivalent entry requirement to graduate research programmes (M.Phil., Ph.D.) in Australian universities. The letters of honours programmes also added to the confusion. For example: B.Sc. (Hons) are the letters gained for postgraduate research honours at the University of Queensland. B.Sc. (Hons) does not indicate that this honours are postgraduate qualification. The difficulty also arises between different universities in Australia—some universities have followed the UK system.

===Professional programs===
There are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or Graduate Entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Example, the Bachelor of Medicine (MBBS) or Bachelor of Dentistry (BDent).

There has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between British, US, and Australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes. The Australian grades are divided into four categories: High Distinction, Distinction, Credit, and Pass (though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems). Assessment and evaluation based on the Australian system is not equivalent to British or US schemes because of the &quot;low-marking&quot; scheme used by Australian universities. For example, a British student who achieves 70+ will receive an A grade, whereas an Australian student with 70+ will receive a Distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme.

===Funding===
The Australian government usually offer full funding (fees and a monthly stipend) to its citizens and permanent residents who are pursuing research-based higher degrees. There are also highly competitive scholarships for international candidates who intend to pursue research-based programmes. Taught-degree scholarships (certain master&#x27;s degrees, Grad. Dip., Grad. Cert., D.Eng., D.B.A.) are almost non-existent for international students. Domestic students have access to tuition subsidy through the Australian Government&#x27;s FEE-Help loan scheme. Some students may be eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), via the HECS-Help scheme, at a substantially lower cost.

===Degree requirements===
Requirements for the successful completion of a taught master&#x27;s programme are that the student pass all the required modules. Some universities require eight taught modules for a one-year programme, twelve modules for a one-and-a-half-year programme, and twelve taught modules plus a thesis or dissertation for a two-year programme. The academic year for an Australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters (eight months of study).

Requirements for research-based programmes vary among universities. Generally, however, a student is not required to take taught modules as part of their candidacy. It is now common that first-year Ph.D. candidates are not regarded as permanent Ph.D. students for fear that they may not be sufficiently prepared to undertake independent research. In such cases, an alternative degree will be awarded for their previous work, usually an M.Phil. or M.Sc. by research.

==Brazil==
===Admission===
In Brazil, a Bachelor&#x27;s, Licenciate or &quot;Technologist&quot; degree is required in order to enter a graduate program, called &quot;pós-graduação&quot;. Generally, in order to be accepted, the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas, as a complement to usual coursework.

===Funding===
The competition for public universities is very large, as they are the most prestigious and respected universities in Brazil. Public universities do not charge fees for undergraduate level/course. Funding, similar to wages, is available but is usually granted by public agencies linked to the university in question (i.e. FAPESP, CAPES, CNPq, etc.), given to the students previously ranked based on internal criteria.

===Degree requirements===
There are two types of postgraduate; &quot;lato sensu&quot; (Latin for &quot;in broad sense&quot;), which generally means a specialization course in one area of study, mostly addressed to professional practice, and &quot;stricto sensu&quot; (Latin for &quot;in narrow sense&quot;), which means a master&#x27;s degree or doctorate, encompassing broader and profound activities of scientific research.

* &quot;Lato sensu&quot; graduate degrees: degrees that represent a specialization in a certain area and take from 1 to 2 years to complete. It can sometimes be used to describe a specialization level between a master&#x27;s degree and an MBA. In that sense, the main difference is that the Lato Sensu courses tend to go deeper into the scientific aspects of the study field, while MBA programs tend to be more focused on the practical and professional aspects, being used more frequently to Business, Management and Administration areas. However, since there are no norms to regulate this, both names are used indiscriminately most of the time.
* &quot;Stricto sensu&quot; graduate degrees: degrees for those who wish to pursue an academic career.
** Masters: 2 years for completion. Usually serves as additional qualification for those seeking a differential on the job market (and maybe later a doctorate), or for those who want to pursue a doctorate. Most doctoral programs in Brazil require a master&#x27;s degree (stricto sensu), meaning that a &quot;lato sensu&quot; degree is usually insufficient to start a doctoral program. 
** Doctorate: 3–4 years for completion. Usually used as a stepping stone for academic life.

==Canada==
In Canada, the schools and faculties of graduate studies are represented by the Canadian Association of Graduate Studies (CAGS) or Association canadienne pour les études supérieures (ACES). The Association brings together 58 Canadian universities with graduate programs, two national graduate student associations, and the three federal research-granting agencies and organizations having an interest in graduate studies. Its mandate is to promote, advance, and foster excellence in graduate education and university research in Canada. In addition to an annual conference, the association prepares briefs on issues related to graduate studies including supervision, funding, and professional development.

===Types of programs===
* Graduate certificates (sometimes called &quot;postgraduate certificates&quot;)
* Master&#x27;s degree (course-based, thesis-based and available in part-time and full-time formats)
* Doctoral degree (available in part-time and full-time formats)

===Admission===
Admission to a graduate certificate program requires a university degree (or in some cases, a diploma with years of related experience). English speaking colleges require proof of English language proficiency such as IELTS. Some colleges may provide English language upgrading to students prior to the start of their graduate certificate program.

Admission to a master&#x27;s (course-based, also called &quot;non-thesis&quot;) program generally requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a related field, with sufficiently high grades usually ranging from B+ and higher (different schools have different letter grade conventions, and this requirement may be significantly higher in some faculties), and recommendations from professors. Admission to a high-quality thesis-type master&#x27;s program generally requires an &quot;honours bachelor&quot; or Canadian &quot;bachelor with honours&quot;, samples of the student&#x27;s writing as well as a research thesis proposal. Some programs require Graduate Record Exams (GRE) in both the general examination and the examination for its specific discipline, with minimum scores for admittance. At English-speaking universities, applicants from countries where English is not the primary language are required to submit scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Nevertheless, some French speaking universities, like HEC Montreal, also require candidates to submit TOEFL score or to pass their own English test.

Admission to a doctoral program typically requires a master&#x27;s degree in a related field, sufficiently high grades, recommendations, samples of writing, a research proposal, and an interview with a prospective supervisor. Requirements are often set higher than those for a master&#x27;s program. In exceptional cases, a student holding an honours BA with sufficiently high grades and proven writing and research abilities may be admitted directly to a Ph.D. program without the requirement to first complete a master&#x27;s. Many Canadian graduate programs allow students who start in a master&#x27;s to &quot;reclassify&quot; into a Ph.D. program after satisfactory performance in the first year, bypassing the master&#x27;s degree.

Students must usually declare their research goal or submit a research proposal upon entering graduate school; in the case of master&#x27;s degrees, there will be some flexibility (that is, one is not held to one&#x27;s research proposal, although major changes, for example from premodern to modern history, are discouraged). In the case of Ph.D.s, the research direction is usually known as it will typically follow the direction of the master&#x27;s research.

Master&#x27;s degrees can be completed in one year but normally take at least two; they typically may not exceed five years. Doctoral degrees require a minimum of two years but frequently take much longer, although not usually exceeding six years.

===Funding===
Graduate students may take out student loans, but instead they often work as teaching or research assistants. Students often agree, as a condition of acceptance to a programme, not to devote more than twelve hours per week to work or outside interests.

Funding is available to first-year masters students whose transcripts reflect exceptionally high grades; this funding is normally given in the second year.

Funding for Ph.D. students comes from a variety of sources, and many universities waive tuition fees for doctoral candidates.

Funding is available in the form of scholarships, bursaries and other awards, both private and public.

===Degree requirements===
Graduate certificates require between eight and sixteen months of study. The length of study depends on the program. Graduate certificates primarily involve coursework. However, some may require a research project or a work placement.

Both master&#x27;s and doctoral programs may be done by coursework or research or a combination of the two, depending on the subject and faculty. Most faculties require both, with the emphasis on research, and with coursework being directly related to the field of research. 

Master&#x27;s and doctoral programs may also be completed on a part-time basis. Part-time graduate programs will usually require that students take one to two courses per semester, and the part-time graduate programs may be offered in online formats, evening formats, or a combination of both. 

Master&#x27;s candidates undertaking research are typically required to complete a thesis comprising some original research and ranging from 70 to 200 pages. Some fields may require candidates to study at least one foreign language if they have not already earned sufficient foreign-language credits. Some faculties require candidates to defend their thesis, but many do not. Those that do not, often have a requirement of taking two additional courses, at minimum, in lieu of preparing a thesis.

Ph.D. candidates undertaking research must typically complete a thesis, or dissertation, consisting of original research representing a significant contribution to their field, and ranging from 200 to 500 pages. Most Ph.D. candidates will be required to sit comprehensive examinations—examinations testing general knowledge in their field of specialization—in their second or third year as a prerequisite to continuing their studies, and must defend their thesis as a final requirement. Some faculties require candidates to earn sufficient credits in a third or fourth foreign language; for example, most candidates in modern Japanese topics must demonstrate ability in English, Japanese, and Mandarin, while candidates in pre-modern Japanese topics must demonstrate ability in English, Japanese, Classical Chinese, and Classical Japanese.

At English-speaking Canadian universities, both master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses may be presented in English or in the language of the subject (German for German literature, for example), but if this is the case an extensive abstract must be also presented in English. , a thesis may be presented in French. One exception to this rule is McGill University, where all work can be submitted in either English or French, unless the purpose of the course of study is acquisition of a language. 

French-speaking universities have varying sets of rules; some (e.g. HEC Montreal) will accept students with little knowledge of French if they can communicate with their supervisors (usually in English).

The Royal Military College of Canada is a bilingual University, and allows a thesis to be in either English or French, but requires the abstract to be in both official languages.

==France==
The &quot;écoles doctorales&quot; (&quot;Doctoral schools&quot;) are educational structures similar in focus to graduate schools, but restricted at PhD level. These schools have the responsibilities of providing students with a structured doctoral training in a disciplinary field. The field of the school is related to the strength of the university: while some have two or three schools (typically &quot;Arts and Humanities&quot; and &quot;Natural and Technological Sciences&quot;), others have more specialized schools (History, Aeronautics, etc.).

A large share of the funding offered to junior researchers is channeled through the &quot;école doctorale&quot;, mainly in the shape of three-years &quot;Doctoral Fellowships&quot; (&quot;contrats doctoraux&quot;). These fellowships are awarded after submitting a biographical information, undergraduate and graduate transcripts where applicable, letters of recommendation, and research proposal, then an oral examination by an Academical Committee.

In most fields, the &quot;école doctorales&quot; will only enroll students which have secured funding for three years, either through a fellowship or provided by their supervisor, laboratory or by the company they are working for (for contracts). Ph.D. students, regardless of their nationality, then have a proper (usually three-years) employment contract, the aforementioned &quot;contrat doctoral&quot; (created in 2009), and are protected by the common labor law. In 2024, the minimum remuneration is . The contract can be extended by six months or a year, but rarely longer. Many Ph.D. students enroll in tutoring programs (&quot;mission d&#x27;enseignement&quot;) and receive additional remuneration from the university.

===Specific context===
Prior to 2004, when the European system of LMD Bologna process was founded, the French equivalent of a Post Graduate degree was called a &quot;Maitrise.&quot;
For historical reasons dating back to the French Revolution of 1789, France has a dual education system, with Grandes Écoles on one side, and universities on the other hand, with the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; . Some Grandes écoles deliver the French diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur, which is ranked as a master&#x27;s degree.

France ranks a professional doctorate in health sciences (i.e. physician, surgeon, pharmacist, dentist, veterinarian diplomas) as equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree in any other discipline, to account for the difficulty gap between getting a medical degree and getting non health related doctoral degrees, the latter requiring original research.

===Admission===
There are 87 public universities in France, and also some private universities, and they are based upon the European education ladder including bachelors, Masters, and Ph.D.s. Students gain each degree though the successful completion of a predetermined number of years in education, gaining credits via the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).
There are over 300 doctoral programs that collaborate with 1200 research laboratories and centers. Each degree has a certain set of national diplomas that are all of equal value, irrespective of where they were issued. There are also other diplomas that are exclusive to France and are very hard to attain.

Admission to a doctoral program requires a master&#x27;s degree, both research-oriented and disciplinary focused. High marks are required (typically a &quot;très bien&quot; honour, equating a &quot;cum laude&quot;), but the acceptance is linked to a decision of the School Academical Board.

==Germany==
The traditional and most common way of obtaining a doctorate in Germany is by doing so individually under supervision of a single professor (&quot;Doktorvater&quot; or &quot;Doktormutter&quot;) without any formal curriculum. During their studies, doctoral students are enrolled at university while often being employed simultaneously either at the university itself, at a research institute or at a company as a researcher.
Working in research during doctoral studies is, however, not a formal requirement.

With the establishment of Graduiertenkollegs funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the German Research Foundation, in the early 1990s, the concept of a graduate school was introduced to the German higher education system. Unlike the American model of graduate schools, only doctoral students participate in a &quot;Graduiertenkolleg&quot;. In contrast to the traditional German model of doctoral studies, a &quot;Graduiertenkolleg&quot; aims to provide young researchers with a structured doctoral training under supervision of a team of professors within an excellent research environment. A &quot;Graduiertenkolleg&quot; typically consists of 20-30 doctoral students, about half of whom are supported by stipends from the DFG or another sponsor. The research programme is usually narrowly defined around a specific topic and has an interdisciplinary aspect. The programme is set up for a specific period of time (up to nine years if funded by the DFG). The official English translation of the term &quot;Graduiertenkolleg&quot; is &quot;Research Training Group&quot;.

In 2006, a different type of graduate school, termed Graduiertenschule (&quot;graduate school&quot;), was established by the DFG as part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative. They are thematically much broader than the focused &quot;Graduiertenkollegs&quot; and consist often of 100-200 doctoral students.

Germany and the Netherlands introduced the Bologna process with a separation between Bachelor and Master programmes in many fields, except for education studies, law and other specially regulated subjects.

==Ireland==
In the Republic of Ireland higher education is operated by the Higher Education Authority.

==Nigeria==
Admission to a postgraduate degree programme in Nigeria requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree with at least a Second Class Lower Division (not less than 2.75/5). Admission to Doctoral programmes requires an Academic master&#x27;s degree with a minimum weighted average of 60% (B average or 4.00/5). In addition to this, applicants may be subjected to written and oral examinations depending on the school. Most universities with high numbers of applicants have more stringent admission processes.

Postgraduate degrees in Nigeria include M.A., M.Sc., M.Ed., M.Eng., LL.M, M.Arch., M.Agric., M.Phil., PhD. The master&#x27;s degree typically take 18–36 months with students undertaking coursework and presenting seminars and a dissertation. The doctoral degree is for a minimum of 36 months and may involve coursework alongside the presentation of seminars and a research thesis. Award of postgraduate degrees requires a defence of the completed research before a panel of examiners comprising external and internal examiners, Head of Department, Departmental Postgraduate Coordinator, Representative(s) of Faculty and Postgraduate School, and any other member of staff with a PhD in the department/faculty.

==United Kingdom==
The term &quot;graduate school&quot; is used more widely by North American universities than by those in the UK. However, in addition to universities set up solely for postgraduate studies such as Cranfield University, numerous universities in the UK have formally launched &#x27;Graduate Schools&#x27;, including the University of Birmingham, Durham University, Keele University, the University of Nottingham, Bournemouth University, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast and the University of London, which includes graduate schools at King&#x27;s College London, Royal Holloway and University College London. They often coordinate the supervision and training of candidates for research master&#x27;s programmes and for doctorates.

===Admission===
Admission to undertake a research degree in the UK typically requires a strong bachelor&#x27;s degree or Scottish M.A. (at least lower second, but usually an upper second or first class). In some institutions, doctoral candidates are initially admitted to a Masters in Research Philosophy (M.Phil. or M.Res.), then later transfer to a Ph.D./D.Phil. if they can show satisfactory progress in their first 8–12 months of study. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Education (Ed.D) are typically required to hold a good bachelor&#x27;s degree as well as an appropriate master&#x27;s degree before being admitted.

===Funding===
Funding for postgraduate study in the UK is awarded competitively, and usually is disseminated by institution (in the form of a certain allocation of studentships for a given year) rather than directly to individuals. There are a number of scholarships for master&#x27;s courses, but these are relatively rare and dependent on the course and class of undergraduate degree obtained (usually requiring at least a lower second). Most master&#x27;s students are self-funded.

Funding is available for some Ph.D./D.Phil. courses. As at the master&#x27;s level, there is more funding available to those in the sciences than in other disciplines. Such funding generally comes from Research Councils such as the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Medical Research Council (MRC) and others. Masters students may also have the option of a Postgraduate loan introduced by the UK Government in 2016.
For overseas students, most major funding applications are due as early as twelve months or more before the intended graduate course will begin. This funding is also often highly competitive. The most widely available, and thus important, award for overseas students is the Overseas Research Student (ORS) Award, which pays the difference in university fees between an overseas student and a British or EU resident. However, a student can only apply for one university for the ORS Award, often before they know whether they have been accepted. As of the 2009/2010 academic year, the HEFCE has cancelled the Overseas Research Student Award scheme for English and Welsh universities. The state of the scheme for Scottish and Northern Irish universities is currently unclear.

Full-time students (of any type) are not normally eligible for state benefits, including during vacation time.

==United States==

===Admission===
While most graduate programs will have a similar list of general admission requirements, the importance placed on each type of requirement can vary drastically between graduate schools, departments within schools, and even programs within departments. The best way to determine how a graduate program will weigh admission materials is to ask the person in charge of graduate admissions at the particular program being applied to.
Admission to graduate school requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree. High grades in one&#x27;s field of study are important—grades outside the field less so. Traditionally in the past, the Graduate Record Examination standardized test was required by almost all graduate schools, however, programs in multiple disciplines are removing the GRE requirement for their admission process. Some programs require other additional standardized tests (such as the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Subject Tests) to apply to their institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRE exam moved to an online format. This led some programs to waive GRE requirements temporarily or permanently, arguing that the new format was unfair or too difficult for test-takers. In addition, good letters of recommendation from undergraduate instructors are often essential, as strong recommendation letters from mentors or supervisors of undergraduate research experience provide evidence that the applicant can perform research and can handle the rigors of a graduate school education.

Within the sciences and some social sciences, previous research experience may be important. By contrast, within most humanities disciplines, an example of academic writing normally suffices. Many universities require a personal statement (sometimes called statement of purpose or letter of intent), which may include indications of the intended area(s) of research. The amount of detail in this statement is and whether it is possible to change one&#x27;s focus of research depends strongly on the discipline and department to which the student is applying.

Some schools set minimum GPAs and test scores below which they will not accept any applicants; this reduces the time spent reviewing applications. On the other hand, many other institutions often explicitly state that they do not use any sort of cut-offs in terms of GPA or the GRE scores. Instead, they claim to consider many factors, including past research achievements, the compatibility between the applicant&#x27;s research interest and that of the faculty, the statement of purpose and the letters of reference, as stated above. Some programs also require professors to act as sponsors. Finally, applicants from non-English speaking countries often must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).

At most institutions, decisions regarding admission are not made by the institution itself but the department to which the student is applying. Some departments may require interviews before making a decision to accept an applicant. Most universities adhere to the Council of Graduate Schools&#x27; Resolution Regarding Graduate Scholars, Fellows, Trainees, and Assistants, which gives applicants until April 15 to accept or reject offers that contain financial support.

===Non-degree seeking===
In addition to traditional &quot;degree-seeking&quot; applications for admission, many schools allow students to apply as &quot;non-degree-seeking&quot;. Admission to the non-degree-seeking category is usually restricted primarily to those who may benefit professionally from additional study at the graduate level. For example, current elementary, middle, and high school teachers wishing to gain re-certification credit most commonly apply as non-degree-seeking students.

===Degree requirements===
Graduate students often declare their intended degree (master&#x27;s or doctorate) in their applications. In some cases, master&#x27;s programs allow successful students to continue toward the doctorate degree. Additionally, doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy but not filed a dissertation (&quot;ABD&quot;, for &quot;all but dissertation&quot;) often receive master&#x27;s degrees and an additional master&#x27;s called a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or a Candidate of Philosophy (C.Phil.) degree. The master&#x27;s component of a doctorate program often requires one or two years.

Many graduate programs require students to pass one or several examinations in order to demonstrate their competence as scholars. In some departments, a comprehensive examination is often required in the first year of doctoral study, and is designed to test a student&#x27;s background undergraduate-level knowledge. Examinations of this type are more common in the sciences and some social sciences but relatively unknown in most humanities disciplines.

Most graduate students perform teaching duties, often serving as graders and tutors. In some departments, they can be promoted to lecturer status, a position that comes with more responsibility.

Doctoral students generally spend roughly their first two to three years taking coursework and begin research by their second year if not before. Many master&#x27;s and all specialist students will perform research culminating in a paper, presentation, and defense of their research. This is called the master&#x27;s thesis (or, for Educational Specialist students, the specialist paper). However, many US master&#x27;s degree programs do not require a master&#x27;s thesis, focusing instead primarily on coursework or on &quot;practicals&quot; or &quot;workshops&quot;. Some students complete a final culminating project or &quot;capstone&quot; rather than a thesis. Such &quot;real-world&quot; experience may typically require a candidate work on a project alone or in a team as a consultant, or consultants, for an outside entity approved or selected by the academic institution and under faculty supervision.

In the second and third years of study, doctoral programs often require students to pass more examinations. Programs often require a Qualifying Examination (&quot;Quals&quot;), a Ph.D. Candidacy Examination (&quot;Candidacy&quot;), or a General Examination (&quot;Generals&quot;) designed to test the students&#x27; grasp of a broad sample of their discipline, or one or several Special Field Examinations (&quot;Specials&quot;) which test students in their narrower selected areas of specialty within the discipline. If these examinations are held orally, they may be known colloquially as &quot;orals.&quot; For some social science and many humanities disciplines, where graduate students may or may not have studied the discipline at the undergraduate level, these exams will be the first set, and be based either on graduate coursework or specific preparatory reading (sometimes up to a year&#x27;s work in reading).

In all cases, comprehensive exams normally must be passed to be allowed to proceed on to the dissertation. Passing such examinations allows the student to begin doctoral research, and rise to the status of a doctoral candidate, while failing usually results in the student leaving the program or re-taking the test after some time has passed (usually a semester or a year). Some schools have an intermediate category, passing at the master&#x27;s level, which allows the student to leave with a master&#x27;s without having completed a master&#x27;s thesis.

The doctoral candidate primarily performs his or her research over the course of three to eight years. In total, the typical doctoral degree takes between four and eight years from entering the program to completion, though this time varies depending upon the department, dissertation topic, and many other factors. For example, astronomy degrees take five to six years on average, but observational astronomy degrees take six to seven due to limiting factors of weather, while theoretical astronomy degrees take five. In some disciplines, doctoral programs can average seven to ten years. Archaeology, which requires long periods of research, tends towards the longer end of this spectrum. The increase in length of the degree is a matter of great concern for both students and universities, though there is much disagreement on potential solutions to this problem.

Traditionally, doctoral programs were only intended to last three to four years and, in some disciplines (primarily the natural sciences), with a helpful advisor, and a light teaching load, it is possible for the degree to be completed in that amount of time. However, increasingly many disciplines, including most humanities, set their requirements for coursework, languages and the expected extent of thesis research by the assumption that students will take five years minimum or six to seven years on average; competition for jobs within these fields also raises expectations on the length and quality of theses considerably.

Though there is substantial variation among universities, departments, and individuals, humanities and social science doctorates on average take somewhat longer to complete than natural science doctorates. These differences are due to the differing nature of research between the humanities and some social sciences and the natural sciences and to the differing expectations of the discipline in coursework, languages, and length of dissertation. However, time required to complete a doctorate also varies according to the candidate&#x27;s abilities and choice of research. Some students may also choose to remain in a program if they fail to win an academic position, particularly in disciplines with a tight job market; by remaining a student, they can retain access to libraries and university facilities, while also retaining an academic affiliation, which can be essential for conferences and job-searches.

After the doctorate degree, a second training period is available for students in fields such as life sciences, called a postdoctoral fellowship.

===Funding===
In general, there is less funding available to students admitted to master&#x27;s degrees than for students admitted to Ph.D. or other doctoral degrees. Many departments, especially those in which students have research or teaching responsibilities, offer tuition-forgiveness and a stipend that pays for most expenses. At some elite universities, there may be a minimum stipend established for all Ph.D. students, as well as a tuition waiver. The terms of these stipends vary greatly, and may consist of a scholarship or fellowship, followed by teaching responsibilities. At many elite universities, these stipends have been increasing, in response both to student pressure and, especially, to competition among the elite universities for graduate students.

In some fields, research positions are more coveted than teaching positions because student researchers are typically paid to work on the dissertation they are required to complete anyway, while teaching is generally considered a distraction from one&#x27;s work. Research positions are more typical of science disciplines; they are relatively uncommon in humanities disciplines, and where they exist, rarely allow the student to work on their own research. Science PhD students can apply for individual NRSA fellowships from the NIH or fellowships from private foundations. US universities often also offer competitive support from NIH-funded training programs. One example is the Biotechnology Training Program – University of Virginia. Departments often have funds for limited discretionary funding to supplement minor expenses such as research trips and travel to conferences.

A few students can attain funding through dissertation improvement grants funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), or through similar programs in other agencies. Many students are also funded as lab researchers by faculty who have been funded by private foundations or by the NSF, National Institutes of Health (NIH), or federal &quot;mission agencies&quot; such as the Department of Defense or the Environmental Protection Agency. The natural sciences are typically well funded, so that most students can attain either outside or institutional funding, but in the humanities, not all do. Some humanities students borrow money during their coursework, then take full-time jobs while completing their dissertations. Students in the social sciences are less well funded than are students in the natural and physical sciences, but often have more funding opportunities than students in the humanities, particularly as science funders begin to see the value of social science research.

Funding differs greatly by departments and universities; some universities give five years of full funding to all Ph.D. students, though often with a teaching requirement attached; other universities do not. However, because of the teaching requirements, which can be in the research years of the Ph.D., even the best funded universities often do not have funding for humanities or social science students who need to do research elsewhere, whether in the United States or overseas. Such students may find funding through outside funders such as private foundations, such as the German Marshall Fund or the Social Science Research Council (SSRC).

Foreign students are typically funded the same way as domestic (US) students, although federally subsidized student and parent loans and work-study assistance are generally limited to U.S. citizens and nationals, permanent residents, and approved refugees. Moreover, some funding sources (such as many NSF fellowships) may only be awarded to domestic students. International students often have unique financial difficulties such as high costs to visit their families back home, support of a family not allowed to work due to immigration laws, tuition that is expensive by world standards, and large fees: visa fees by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and surveillance fees under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program of the United States Department of Homeland Security.

===Graduate employee unions===
At many universities, graduate students are employed by their university to teach classes or do research. While all graduate employees are graduate students, many graduate students are not employees. MBA students, for example, usually pay tuition and do not have paid teaching or research positions. In many countries graduate employees have collectively organized labor unions in order to bargain a contract with their university. 

In the United States there are many graduate employee unions at public universities. The Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions lists 25 recognized unions at public universities on its website. Private universities, however, are covered under the National Labor Relations Act rather than state labor laws and until 2001 there were no recognized unions at private universities.

Many graduate students see themselves as akin to junior faculty, but with significantly lower pay. Many graduate students feel that teaching takes time that would better be spent on research, and many point out that there is a vicious circle in the academic labor economy. Institutions that rely on cheap graduate student labor have no need to create expensive professorships, so graduate students who have taught extensively in graduate school can find it immensely difficult to get a teaching job when they have obtained their degree. Many institutions depend heavily on graduate student teaching: a 2003 report by agitators for a graduate student union at Yale, for instance, claims that &quot;70% of undergraduate teaching contact hours at Yale are performed by transient teachers: graduate teachers, adjunct instructors, and other teachers not on the tenure track.&quot; The state of Michigan leads in terms of progressive policy regarding graduate student unions with five universities recognizing graduate employee unions: Central Michigan University, Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, and Western Michigan University.

The United Auto Workers (under the slogan &quot;Uniting Academic Workers&quot;) and the American Federation of Teachers are two international unions that represent graduate employees. Private universities&#x27; administrations often oppose their graduate students when they try to form unions, arguing that students should be exempt from labor laws intended for &quot;employees&quot;. In some cases, unionization movements have met with enough student opposition to fail. At the schools where graduate employees are unionized, which positions are unionized vary. Sometimes only one set of employees will unionize (e.g. teaching assistants, residential directors); at other times, most or all will. Typically, fellowship recipients, usually not employed by their university, do not participate.

When negotiations fail, graduate employee unions sometimes go on strike. While graduate student unions can use the same types of strikes that other unions do, they have also made use of teach-ins, work-ins, marches, rallies, and &quot;grade strikes&quot;. In a grade strike, graduate students refuse to grade exams and papers and, if the strike lasts until the end of the academic term, also refuse to turn in final grades. Another form of job action is known as &quot;work-to-rule&quot;, in which graduate student instructors work exactly as many hours as they are paid for and no more.

They are often worn to embellish, enhance, or distinguish the wearer, and to define cultural, social, or religious status within a specific community. When worn to show economic status, the items are often either rare or prohibitively expensive to others. Adornments are usually colourful, and worn to attract attention.

They have a long history, around the world, from feathers or bone, to modern accessories, such as jewellery. Items of adornment are also used by warriors, and by other members of the military to show rank or achievement.

==Items of adornment==
These include cosmetics, jewellery, clothing accessories, facial hair, fingernail modification, piercing, lip plates, tattooing, braiding, and headgear.

==Cultures, subcultures, and institutions==
Groups who practice adornment include the yakuza, military, religious institutions, tribal groups, and the punk culture.
Items of adornment can tell us about a person&#x27;s rank, social status, gender role, area of origin, etc. An example would be the beaded jewelry worn by the Maasai tribe, which is very specific to them and some related tribes.

In Islamic culture, adornments have included caps such as the kufi and taqiyah for men, and the hijab for women.

<text>Jennie Kidd Trout (born Gowanlock; April 21, 1841 – November 10, 1921) was the first woman in Canada to become a licensed medical doctor, on March 11, 1875. Trout was the only woman in Canada licensed to practice medicine until July 1880, when Emily Stowe completed the official qualifications.

== Biography ==
Born in Wooden Mills, Kelso, Scotland, Jennie (whose name is variously spelled &#x27;Jenny&#x27;) moved with her parents to Canada in 1847, settling near Stratford, Ontario. Trout had taken a course in teaching after graduation, and had taught until her marriage to Edward Trout. She married Trout in 1865 and thereafter moved to Toronto, where Edward ran a newspaper.

Motivated by her own chronic illnesses, she decided on a medical career, passing her matriculation exam in 1871 and studying medicine at the University of Toronto. Trout and Emily Jennings Stowe were together the first women admitted to the Toronto School of Medicine, by special arrangement. Stowe, however, refused to sit her exams in protest of the school&#x27;s demeaning treatment of the two women. Trout later transferred to the Woman&#x27;s Medical College of Pennsylvania, where she earned her M.D. on March 11, 1875 and became the first licensed female physician in Canada.

Trout then opened the Therapeutic and Electrical Institute in Toronto, which specialized in treatments for women involving &quot;galvanic baths or electricity.&quot; For six years, she also ran a free dispensary for the poor at the same location. The Institute was quite successful, later opening branches in Brantford and Hamilton, Ontario.

Due to poor health, Trout retired in 1882 to Palma Sola, Florida. She was later instrumental in the establishment of a medical school for women at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston. Her family travelled extensively between Florida and Ontario, and later moved to Los Angeles, California, where she died in 1921.

In 1991, Canada Post issued a postage stamp in her honour to commemorate her as the first woman licensed to practise medicine in Canada.

On April 21, 2018, Google celebrated her 177th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="153990" wikidata="Q191034" url="?curid=153990" title="Port wine">
<text>Port wine (, ; ), or simply port, is a Portuguese fortified wine produced in the Douro Valley of northern Portugal. It is typically a sweet red wine, often served with dessert, although it also comes in dry, semi-dry, and white varieties.

Other port-style fortified wines are produced outside Portugalin Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, India, Italy, South Africa, Spain, and the United Statesbut under the European Union Protected Designation of Origin guidelines, only wines from Portugal are allowed to be labelled &quot;port&quot;.

==Region and production==
Port is produced from grapes grown and processed in the demarcated Douro region. The wine produced is then fortified by the addition of a neutral grape spirit known as aguardente to stop the fermentation, leaving residual sugar in the wine, and to boost the alcohol content. The fortification spirit is sometimes referred to as brandy, but it bears little resemblance to commercial brandies. The wine is then stored and aged, often in barrels stored in a lodge (meaning &quot;cellar&quot;) as is the case in Vila Nova de Gaia, before being bottled. The wine received its name, &quot;port&quot;, in the latter half of the 17th century from the seaport city of Porto at the mouth of the Douro River, where much of the product was brought to market or for export to other countries in Europe. The Douro valley where port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region, and the name &quot;Douro&quot; thus an official appellation, in 1756, making it the third oldest wine after Chianti (1716) and Tokaj (1730).

The reaches of the valley of the Douro River in northern Portugal have a microclimate that is optimal for cultivation of olives, almonds, and especially grapes important for making port wine. The region around Pinhão and São João da Pesqueira is considered to be the centre of port production, and is known for its picturesque &quot;quintas&quot; – estates clinging on to almost vertical slopes dropping down to the river.

===Wine regions===
The demarcation of the Douro River Valley includes a broad swath of land of pre-Cambrian schist and granite. Beginning around the village of Barqueiros (about upstream from Porto), the valley extends eastward almost to the Spanish border. The region is protected from the influences of the Atlantic Ocean by the Serra do Marão mountains. The area is subdivided into three official zones: the Baixo (lower) Corgo, the Cima (higher) Corgo, and the Douro Superior.
* Baixo Corgo – The westernmost zone located downstream from the river Corgo, centred on the municipality of Peso da Régua. This region is the wettest port production zone, receiving an annual average of of precipitation and it has the coolest average temperature of the three zones. The grapes grown here are used mainly for the production of inexpensive ruby and tawny ports.
* Cima Corgo – Located upstream from the Baixo Corgo, this region is centred on the town of Pinhão (municipality of Alijó). The summertime average temperature of the region is a few degrees higher, and annual rainfall is about . The grapes grown in this zone are considered of higher quality, being used in bottlings of Vintage, Reserve, aged Tawny, and Late Bottled Vintage Ports.
* Douro Superior – The easternmost zone, extending almost to the Spanish border. This is the least cultivated region of Douro, due in part to the difficulties of navigating the river past the rapids of Cachão da Valeira. This is the driest and warmest region of the Douro. The overall terrain is relatively flat, with the potential for mechanization.

===Grapes===


Over a hundred varieties of grapes (&quot;castas&quot;) are sanctioned for port production, although only five (Tinta Barroca, Tinto Cão, Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), Touriga Francesa, and Touriga Nacional) are widely cultivated and used. Touriga Nacional is widely considered the most desirable port grape but the difficulty in growing it, and the small yields cause Touriga Francesa to be the most widely planted grape. White ports are produced the same way as red ports, except that they use white grapes – Donzelinho Branco, Esgana-Cão, Folgasão, Gouveio, Malvasia Fina, Rabigato and Viosinho. While a few shippers have experimented with Ports produced from a single variety of grapes, all Ports commercially available are from a blend of different grapes. Since the Phylloxera crisis, most vines are grown on grafted rootstock, with the notable exception of the Nacional area of Quinta do Noval, which, since being planted in 1925, has produced some of the most expensive vintage ports.

Grapes grown for port are generally characterized by their small, dense fruit which produces concentrated and long-lasting flavours, suitable for long aging. While the grapes used to produce port made in Portugal are strictly regulated by the Instituto do Vinho do Porto, wines from outside this region that describe themselves as port may be made from other varieties.

===Sales===
In 2013, there were 8.7 million cases of port sold, 3.6% less than the previous year, at a value of $499 million. Port sales have been declining since 2005 and in 2014 were down 16% from that year. In 2023 about 7.2 million cases were sold, with a value of €364 million. Declining sales are attributed by some to increasing prices, due to the increased cost of alcohol used in the production process. Declining sales have also been attributed to the global rise in alcohol levels of table wines. As of 2014, the leading brand in Portugal is Cálem, which sells 2.6 million bottles annually.

===Transport===

Port is produced from grapes grown in the Douro valley. Until 1986 it could only be exported from Portugal from Vila Nova de Gaia near Porto, Portugal&#x27;s second-largest city. Traditionally, the wine was taken downriver in flat-bottom boats called &#x27;barcos rabelos&#x27;, to be processed and stored. In the 1950s and 1960s, several hydroelectric power dams were built along the river, ending this traditional conveyance. Currently, the wine is transported from the vineyards by tanker trucks and the &quot;barcos rabelos&quot; are only used for racing and other displays.

==Properties==
Port wine is typically richer, sweeter, heavier, and higher in alcohol content than unfortified wines. This is caused by the addition of distilled grape spirits that fortify the wine, but also halt fermentation before all the sugar is converted to alcohol, and results in a wine that is usually 19% to 20% alcohol.

Port is commonly served after meals as a dessert wine in English-speaking countries, often with cheese, nuts, or chocolate; white and tawny ports are often served as an apéritif. In continental Europe, all types of ports are frequently consumed as apéritifs.

==Styles==
Port from Portugal comes in several styles, which can be divided into two broad categories: wines matured in sealed glass bottles, and wines that have matured in wooden barrels.

The former, without exposure to air, experience what is known as &quot;reductive&quot; ageing. This process leads to the wine losing its color very slowly and produces a wine that is smoother on the palate and less tannic.

The latter, being matured in wooden barrels, whose permeability allows a small amount of exposure to oxygen, experience what is known as &quot;oxidative&quot; aging. They too lose color, but at a faster pace. They also lose volume to evaporation (angel&#x27;s share), leaving behind a wine that is slightly more viscous.

The IVDP (&quot;Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e Porto&quot;) further divides ports into two categories: normal ports (standard ruby, three-year-old tawny, and white) and &quot;Categorias Especiais&quot;, special categories, which include everything else.

===Ruby===
The most common type, ruby port is stored in tanks of concrete or stainless steel after fermentation, to prevent oxidative aging and preserve its bright red color and full-bodied fruitiness. The wine is usually blended to match the style of the brand to which it is to be sold. The wine is fined and cold filtered before bottling and does not generally improve with age, although premium rubies are aged in wood from four to six years.

====Reserve====
Reserve ruby is a premium ruby port approved by the IVDP&#x27;s tasting panel, the . In 2002 the IVDP prohibited the use of the term &quot;vintage character&quot;, as reserve ruby port had neither a single vintage (usually being a blend of several vintages of the ruby) nor the typical character of vintage port.

====Rose====
Rose port is a very recent variation on the market, first released in 2008 by Poças and by Croft, part of the Taylor Fladgate Partnership. It is technically a ruby port, but fermented in a similar manner to a rosé wine, with limited exposure to the grape skins, thus creating the rose color.

===Tawny===
Tawny ports are wines usually made from red grapes that are aged in wooden barrels exposing them to gradual oxidation and evaporation. As a result of this oxidation, they mellow to a golden-brown color. The exposure to oxygen imparts &quot;nutty&quot; flavours to the wine, which is blended to match the house style. They are sweet or medium dry and typically consumed as a dessert wine, but can also pair with a main course.

When a port is described as tawny, without an indication of age, it is a basic blend of wood-aged port that has spent time in wooden barrels, typically at least three years.

Reserve tawny port (produced by Borges, Calem, Croft, Cruz, Graham, Kopke, and other houses) has been aged about seven years.

Above this are tawny with an indication of age, which represent a blend of several vintages. The target age profile, in years in wood, is stated on the label, usually 10, 20, 30, or 40 years. These ports are produced by most houses.

It is also possible to produce an aged white port in this manner, with some shippers now marketing aged white ports.

In some places, such as Canada and Australia, &#x27;tawny&#x27; may also be used to describe any port-style wine that is not produced in Portugal, in accordance with an agreement with the EU.

====Colheita====
Colheita port is a single-vintage tawny port aged for at least seven years, with the vintage year on the bottle instead of a category of age (10, 20, etc.). Colheita port should not be confused with a vintage port: a vintage port will spend only about 18 months in barrels after harvest and will continue to mature in bottles, but a Colheita may have spent 20 or more years in wooden barrels before being bottled and sold. White Colheitas have also been produced.

===Garrafeira===

Unusual and rare, vintage-dated Garrafeira combines the oxidative maturation of years in wood with further reductive maturation in large glass demijohns. It is required by the IVDP that wines spend some time in wood, usually between three and six years, followed by at least a further eight years in glass, before bottling. In practice, the times spent in glass are much longer. The style is associated with the company Niepoort, although others do exist. Their dark green demijohns, known as bon-bons, hold approximately each. Some connoisseurs describe Garrafeira as having a slight taste of bacon, the reason being that, during the second phase of maturation, certain oils may precipitate, causing a film to form across the surface of the glass.

Confusingly, the word Garrafeira may also be found on some very old tawny labels, where the contents of the bottle are of exceptional age.

===White port===
White port is made from white grapes, such as &quot;Malvasia Fina&quot;, &quot;Donzelinho&quot;, &quot;Gouveio&quot;, &quot;Codega&quot; and &quot;Rabigato&quot;, Taylor introduced Chip Dry, a new style of white apéritif Port, in 1934. Made from traditional white grape varieties, it is fermented for longer than usual to give it a crisp dry finish.

===Late bottled vintage===
Late bottled vintage (often referred to simply as LBV) was originally wine that had been destined for bottling as vintage port, but because of lack of demand was left in the barrel for longer than had been planned. Over time it has become two distinct styles of wine, both of them bottled between four and six years after the vintage, but one style is fined and filtered before bottling, while the other is not.

The accidental origin of late bottled vintage has led to more than one company claiming its invention. The earliest known reference to a style of port with this name in a merchant&#x27;s list is to be found in The Wine Society&#x27;s catalogue from 1964, which includes Fonseca&#x27;s Quinta Milieu 1958, bottled in the UK, also in 1964. By the 1962 vintage, LBV was being produced in Portugal and bottled as LBV.

LBV is intended to provide some of the experience of drinking a vintage port but without the need for lengthy bottle ageing. To a limited extent, it succeeds, as the extra years of oxidative ageing in the barrel does mature the wine more quickly.

====Unfiltered====
Unfiltered LBVs are mostly bottled with conventional driven corks and need to be decanted. After decanting they should be consumed within a few days. Recent bottlings are identified by the label &quot;unfiltered&quot;, &quot;bottle matured&quot;, or both. Since the 2002 regulations, bottles that carry the words &quot;bottle matured&quot; must have enjoyed at least three years of bottle maturation before release. Before 2002 this style was often marketed as &quot;traditional&quot;, a description that is no longer permitted. Unfiltered LBV will usually be improved by extra years in the bottle. It can age as long as vintage ports and are very difficult to identify as LBVs when inserted into blind tastings of vintage ports.

====Filtered====
The filtered wine has the advantage of being ready to drink without decanting and is usually bottled in a stoppered bottle that can be easily resealed. However, many wine experts feel that this convenience comes at a price and believe that the filtration process strips out much of the character of the wine.

Typically ready to drink when released, filtered LBV ports tend to be lighter-bodied than vintage ports. Filtered LBVs can improve with age, but only to a limited degree.

===Crusted===
Crusted port is usually a blend of several vintages. Unlike vintage port, which has to be sourced from grapes from a single vintage, crusted port affords the port blender the opportunity to make best use of the varying characteristics of different vintages.

Crusted port is bottled unfiltered and sealed with a driven cork. Like vintage port, it needs to be decanted before drinking.

===Vintage port===
Vintage ports may be aged in barrels or stainless steel for a maximum of two and a half years before bottling, and generally require another 10 to 40 years of aging in the bottle before reaching what is considered a proper drinking age. Since they are potentially aged in a cask for only a short time, they retain their dark ruby color and fresh fruit flavours. Particularly fine vintage ports can continue to gain complexity for many decades after they were bottled. It is not uncommon for 19th-century bottles to still be in perfect condition for consumption. The oldest known vintage port still available as of 2018 from a shipper is the 1815 Ferreira. A tasting in 1990 described it as having an &quot;intensely spicy aroma – cinnamon, pepper, and ginger – hints of exotic woods, iodine, and wax&quot;.

Vintage port is made entirely from the grapes of a declared vintage year. While it is by far the most renowned type of port, from a volume and revenue standpoint, vintage port accounts for only about two percent of overall port production. Not every year is declared a vintage in the Douro. The decision on whether to declare a vintage is made early in the second year following the harvest. The decision to declare a vintage is made by each individual port house often referred to as a &quot;shipper&quot;.

Much of the complex character of aged vintage port comes from the continued slow decomposition of grape solids in each bottle. These solids are undesirable when the port is consumed, and thus vintage port typically requires a period of settling before decanting and pouring.

====Single quinta vintage port====
Single quinta vintage ports are wines that originate from a single estate, unlike the standard bottlings of the port wine houses which can be sourced from a number of quintas. Single quinta bottlings are used in two ways by producers. Most of the large port wine houses have a single quinta bottling which is only produced in some years when the regular vintage port of the house is not declared. In those years, wine from their best quinta is still bottled under a vintage designation, rather than being used for simpler port qualities.

==Vintages==
The term vintage has a distinct meaning in the context of vintage port. While vintage is simply the year in which a wine is made, most producers of vintage port restrict their production of year-labelled bottlings to only the best years, a few per decade. Contrast with second wines, where (primarily) Bordeaux producers release a year-labelled top wine almost every year, but also lesser quality wines in some years.

If a port house decides that its wine is of a quality sufficient for a vintage, samples are sent to the IVDP for approval and the house declares the vintage. In very good years, almost all the port houses will declare their wines.

In intermediate years, the producers of blended vintage ports will not declare their flagship port but may declare the vintage of a single quinta, e.g., the 1996 Dow&#x27;s Quinta do Bomfim and Taylor&#x27;s Quinta de Vargellas. Some houses declare their wines in all but the worst years: Quinta do Vesuvio has declared a vintage every year with the exceptions of 1993, 2002, and 2014.

Improved wine-making technologies and better weather forecasts during the harvest have increased the number of years in which a vintage can be declared. Although there have been years when only one or two wines have been declared, it has been over thirty years since there was a year with no declarations at all.

2016 was declared a vintage year by most producers, as was 2011. The quality of the grape harvest was attributed to ideal rainfall and temperature. Other recent widely declared vintage years were 2007, 2003, 2000, 1997 and 1994.

==History and tradition==
The wine-producing Douro region is the third oldest protected wine region in the world after Chianti, in 1716, and Tokaj, in 1730.

In 1756, during the rule of the Marquis of Pombal, the Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro (C.G.A.V.A.D., also known as the General Company of Viticulture of the Upper Douro or Douro Wine Company), was founded to guarantee the quality of the product and fair pricing to the end consumer. The C.G.A.V.A.D. was also in charge of regulating which port wine would be for export or internal consumption and managing the protected geographic indication.

In 1678, a Liverpool wine merchant sent two new representatives to Viana do Castelo, north of Oporto, to learn the wine trade. While on a vacation in the Douro, the two gentlemen visited the Abbot of Lamego, who treated them to a &quot;very agreeable, sweetish and extremely smooth&quot; wine, which had been fortified with a distilled spirit. The two Englishmen were so pleased with the product that they purchased the abbot&#x27;s entire lot and shipped it home.

Port became very popular in England after the Methuen Treaty of 1703, when merchants were permitted to import it at a low duty, while war with France deprived English wine drinkers of French wine. British importers could be credited for recognising that a smooth, already fortified wine that would appeal to English palates would survive the trip to London.

The continued British involvement in the port trade can be seen in the names of many port shippers and brands: Broadbent, Cockburn, Croft, Dow, Gould Campbell, Graham, Osborne, Offley, Sandeman, Taylor, and Warre being amongst the best known. Shippers of Dutch and German origin are also prominent, such as Niepoort and Burmester. The British involvement grew so strong that they formed a trade association that became a gentlemen&#x27;s club. A few port shippers and producers were also established by native Portuguese families: Ferreira and Quinta do Crasto are among the best. Both Ferreira and Quinta do Crasto can be credited for pioneering the Douro as a table-wine-producing region, Ferreira making Barca Velha since 1952 and Quinta do Crasto becoming the second producer of note, starting in the early 1990s.

==Storing and serving==
Port, like other wine, should be stored in a cool but not cold, dark location (as light can damage the port), at a steady temperature (such as a cellar), with the bottle laid on its side if it has a cork, or standing up if it is stoppered. With the exception of white port, which can be served chilled, the port should be served at between . Tawny port may also be served slightly cooler.

Port wines that are unfiltered (such as vintage ports, crusted ports, and some LBVs) form a sediment (or crust) in the bottle and require decanting. This process also allows the port to breathe (allowing the wine to mix with oxygen).

A traditional method of opening a vintage port is with port tongs. The tongs are heated over a flame and applied to the bottle&#x27;s neck. The bottleneck is cooled with cold water, causing a clean break. This avoids the use of a corkscrew on an older cork, which would otherwise break apart and crumble into the wine.

Once opened, a port generally lasts longer than unfortified wine, but it is still best consumed within a short period of time. Tawny, ruby, and LBV ports may keep for several months once opened; because they are aged longer in barrels, these ports have already been exposed to some degree of oxidation. Old Vintage ports are best consumed within several days of opening, but young Vintage Ports can be kept open for several weeks, if not months when very young.

Tradition in the United Kingdom calls for the port being served at a formal dinner to be passed to the left (&quot;pass the port to port&quot;) and for the bottle or decanter not to touch the table on its way around, though some cultures reject this tradition. If a diner fails to pass the port, others at the table may ask &quot;Do you know the Bishop of Norwich?&quot;the question acts as a reminder to pass the port, for those who know the story, and an opportunity to tell the story to those who have not heard it.

==Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto==

The Port and Douro Wines Institute is an official body belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture of Portugal and is a key institution in promoting the industry and knowledge of making port wine. It was previously known as the Instituto do Vinho do Porto.

==Port houses==
Producers of port wine are often called &quot;shippers&quot;. In the early history of the port wine trade, many of the most powerful shipping families were British (English and Scottish) and Irish; this history can still be seen in the names of many of the most famous port wines, such as Dow’s, Graham&#x27;s,Sandeman, Churchill&#x27;s,Cockburn&#x27;s and Taylor’s. Over the years Portuguese, as well as Dutch and German-owned shippers have also become prevalent in the port industry.

Porto, a World Heritage Site, is home to many famous port houses located near the Douro River, making the shipping of port wine easy. Some of these port houses are private, while others are open to public tours and visits.

==As a historical remedy for illness==
Port has been used in the past as a healing agent in earlier remedies. The British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was given port for gout as a boy. He began at the age of 14 (1773) with a bottle a day according to J. Ehrman (1969), &quot;The Younger Pitt&quot;. Heavy alcohol consumption is known to exacerbate gout.

A recurring theme in the novels of Anthony Trollope is the partiality of respectable elderly ladies for port, which they excuse on the grounds that it is &quot;medicinal&quot;.

==Chemistry==
Aged port wine contains a family of bluish phenolic pigments called portosins (vinylpyranoanthocyanins) and oxovitisin A, an oxovitisin, a type of pyranoanthocyanin with a 2-pyrone component.

<text>The University of Bath is a public research university in Bath, England. It received its royal charter in 1966, along with a number of other institutions following the Robbins Report. Like the University of Bristol and University of the West of England, Bath can trace its roots to the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College, established in Bristol as a school in 1595 by the Society of Merchant Venturers. The university&#x27;s main campus is located on Claverton Down, a site overlooking the UNESCO World Heritage city of Bath, and was purpose-built, constructed from 1964 in the modernist style of the times.

In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, 40% of Bath&#x27;s submitted research activity achieved the highest possible classification of 4*, defined as world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour. 92% was graded 4*/3*, defined as world-leading/internationally excellent. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £390.5 million of which £49.2 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £308.1 million.

The university is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Association of MBAs, the European Quality Improvement System, the European University Association, Universities UK and GW4.

== History ==
The University of Bath can trace its roots to the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College (whose alumni include the physicists Paul Dirac and Peter Higgs), an institution founded as a school in 1595 and a technical school established in Bristol in 1856 which became part of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1885. Meanwhile, in the neighbouring city of Bath, a pharmaceutical school, the Bath School of Pharmacy, was founded in 1907. This became part of the Technical College in 1929.

The college came under the control of the Bristol Education Authority in 1949; it was renamed then the Bristol College of Technology, and in 1960 the Bristol College of Science and Technology, when it became one of ten technical colleges under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education. The college was mainly housed in the former Muller&#x27;s Orphanage at Ashley Down in Bristol, which still houses part of the City of Bristol College whilst the remainder has been converted into residential housing.

===University status===
In 1963, the Robbins Committee report paved the way for the college (along with a number of other institutions) to assume university status as &quot;Bath University of Technology&quot;.

Although the grounds of Kings Weston House, in Bristol, were briefly considered — which then, and until 1969, accommodated the college&#x27;s School of Architecture and Building Engineering — the City of Bristol was unable to offer the expanding college an appropriately sized single site. Following discussions between the College Principal and the Director of Education in Bath, an agreement was reached to provide the college with a new home in Claverton Down, Bath, on a greenfield site, purchased through a compulsory purchase order from the Candy family of Norwood Farm, overlooking the city.

Construction of the purpose-built campus began in 1964, with the first building, now known as 4 South, completed in 1965, and the royal charter was granted on 25 October 1966. In November 1966, the first degree ceremony took place at the Assembly Rooms in Bath. Over the subsequent decade, new buildings were added as the campus took shape.

In the mid-19th century, there were plans to build a college on the site.

The university logo features the so-called Gorgon&#x27;s head which is taken, via the university&#x27;s coat of arms, from a Roman sculpture found within the city. The university pays a peppercorn a year to the city for rent of a parcel of land.

Until 30 October 2012, it was also a member of the 1994 Group.

A report by the Higher Education Funding Council for England into governance at the university was published on 20 November 2017.

===Glynis Breakwell remuneration===
In November 2017, frustration with the governance of the university grew, especially concerning the Vice Chancellor, Glynis Breakwell&#x27;s remuneration. The HEFCE carried out an enquiry and recommended 13 changes to the governance of the university. In November 2017, Breakwell&#x27;s salary rose by 3.9% (£17,589) to over £468,000 and she was reported as the highest paid Vice Chancellor in the country.
The university and College Union had an &quot;emergency meeting&quot; of all staff to discuss the issue and the students&#x27; union organised a vote of no confidence involving all undergraduate and postgraduate students.

By August 2017, four MPs had resigned from the advisory board at the University of Bath in protest against the vice-chancellor&#x27;s pay package. In November 2017 Breakwell agreed to retire, taking a sabbatical on full pay from September 2018 until retirement in February 2019 when a £31,000 car loan to her would be written off. In January 2018 the University Court voted for her immediate departure and demanding the chair the governing council and remuneration committee should step down, though this decision could not override the existing contractual agreement with Breakwell.

On 5 March 2018, at 13:30, a group of 10 Bath students supporting the UCU strike action occupied the vice chancellor&#x27;s suite in protest of the university&#x27;s support for UUK&#x27;s proposed pension reforms. The occupation was endorsed by Bath MP Wera Hobhouse. The university was criticised for its initial response to the protesters, blocking the entrance to the only freely accessible toilets in the occupied area for the first 21 hours of the occupation. The university&#x27;s response was criticised by local councillor Joe Rayment, alumnus Marcus Sedgwick, NUS Black Students&#x27; officer, and prompted the resignation of an external examiner.

In September 2018, it was announced that Ian H. White would take over from Glynis Breakwell as Vice-Chancellor in April 2019.

==Campus and facilities==


===Main campus===
The university&#x27;s main campus is located on Claverton Down, approximately 1.5 miles from the centre of Bath. The site is compact; it is possible to walk from one end to the other in fifteen minutes. The design involved the separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, with road traffic on the ground floors and pedestrians on a raised central thoroughfare, known as the Parade. Buildings would line the parade and student residences built on tower blocks rise from the central thoroughfare. Such plans were mostly followed.

At the centre of the campus is the Library, a facility open round the clock offering computing services, information and research assistance as well as books and journals. A number of outlets are housed around the parade, including restaurants, bars and fast-food cafés and two small supermarkets, as well as academic blocks. Building names are based on their location and distance vis-à-vis the library (e.g. 1 East, 2 East). Odd-numbered buildings are on the same side of the parade as the Library, and even-numbered buildings are on the opposite side.

Buildings along the east–west axis are mostly directly accessible from the parade, which is generally considered to be &quot;level two&quot;, but later additions, such as 7 West, 9 West, 3 West North and 8 East, follow the rule less strictly. 7 West is generally accessible only via 5 West or 9 West, and 3 West North, 9 West and 8 East have entrances at ground level at varying distances from the main parade. Buildings on the south of the campus, 1 South to 4 South, are accessible via roads and pedestrian walkways by the university lake and gardens.

Buildings, as in many of the so-called plate glass universities, were constructed in a functional modernist style using concrete, although such designs were later derided for lacking the charm of the Victorian red-brick universities or the ancient and medieval ones. In Bath, there is a particular contrast between the concrete campus and the Georgian style architecture of the World Heritage City of Bath.

The eastern part of the campus is dominated by the Sports Training Village, built in 1992 and enhanced in 2003 with an extension.

The northern perimeter of the university is bounded by student residences Brendon Court, Eastwood, Marlborough Court, Solsbury Court, Norwood House, Osborne House, Polden Court, The Quads, Westwood, and Woodland Court. The original plan for students to be housed in tower blocks above the parade continues with the small number of rooms (110) in Norwood House. However, the second tower block, Wessex House, now hosts offices rather than residences.

The university also owns buildings in the city of Bath, mostly student accommodation dotted around town, including Canal Wharf, Carpenter House, Clevelands Building, John Wood Building and John Wood Court, Pulteney Court and Thornbank Gardens.

There is also an Innovation Centre that provides work space, practical support and expertise to local technology enterprises and entrepreneurial companies that emerge from the university&#x27;s student and academic research base

Two new buildings were opened in 2017. The Virgil Building, adapted from a former police station, offers a hub and support for students and staff in the centre of Bath, including professional, counselling and careers services, Joblink, a skills centre and learning commons. The university also opened a centre at 83 Pall Mall in central London, with a stated aim of building partnerships and engaging with business, politics and Bath&#x27;s alumni community in the UK&#x27;s capital.

Over several years, the grounds have received recognition for their outstanding beauty with awards from Bath in Bloom.

===Campus developments===
The university continually upgrades its Claverton Down campus with new teaching blocks. A proposal to move the boundary of the green belt away to the edge of the campus to facilitate further development was agreed in October 2007 by the local council following a public inquiry, although the boundary of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty still crosses the site. In July 2005, building 3 West North (officially opened on 27 October) was completed. The deconstruction of the asbestos-contaminated 4 West was completed in mid-2005 and the 4 West building opened in April 2010, providing additional teaching and office space.

===University of Bath in Swindon===
The university opened a second site, Oakfield Campus, in 2000 on Marlowe Road Swindon, on a site leased from the council. Formerly &quot;Oakfield School&quot;, the site was jointly funded by the university and Swindon Council. Officially The University of Bath in Swindon, the campus offered undergraduate courses in childhood studies and social work.
The campus was closed in the summer of 2008.

Under the Gateway Project, the university had planned to build a major new campus next to the Great Western Hospital and the Coate Water nature reserve. The project had met opposition from environmentalists and locals but had met with Government approval. The university withdrew from the project in March 2007 citing &quot;prevailing planning and funding conditions&quot;.

<text>Octave Henri Marie Mirbeau (; 16 February 1848 – 16 February 1917) was a French novelist, art critic, travel writer, pamphleteer, journalist and playwright, who achieved celebrity in Europe and great success among the public, whilst still appealing to the literary and artistic avant-garde with highly transgressive novels that explored violence, abuse and psychological detachment. His work has been translated into 30 languages.

==Biography==

===Aesthetic and political struggles===

The grandson of Norman notaries and the son of a doctor, Mirbeau spent his childhood in a village in Normandy, Rémalard, pursuing secondary studies at a Jesuit college in Vannes, which expelled him at the age of fifteen. Two years after the traumatic experience of the 1870 war, he was tempted by a call from the Bonapartist leader Dugué de la Fauconnerie, who hired him as private secretary and introduced him to &quot;L&#x27;Ordre de Paris&quot;.

After his debut in journalism in the service of the Bonapartists, and his debut in literature when he worked as a ghostwriter, Mirbeau began to publish under his own name. Thereafter, he wrote in order to express his own ethical principles and aesthetic values. A supporter of the anarchist cause (cf. &quot;La Grève des électeurs&quot;) and fervent supporter of Alfred Dreyfus, Mirbeau embodied the intellectual who involved himself in civic issues. Independent of all parties, Mirbeau believed that one&#x27;s primary duty was to remain lucid.

As an art critic, he campaigned on behalf of the &quot;great gods nearest to his heart&quot;: he sang the praises of Auguste Rodin, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Félicien Rops Auguste Renoir, Félix Vallotton, and Pierre Bonnard, and was an early advocate of Vincent van Gogh, Camille Claudel, Aristide Maillol, and Maurice Utrillo (cf. his &quot;Combats esthétiques&quot;, 1993).

As a literary critic and early member of Académie Goncourt, he &#x27;discovered&#x27; Maurice Maeterlinck and Marguerite Audoux and admired Remy de Gourmont, Marcel Schwob, Léon Bloy, Georges Rodenbach, Alfred Jarry, Charles-Louis Philippe, , Valery Larbaud and Léon Werth (cf. his &quot;Combats littéraires&quot;, 2006).

===Mirbeau&#x27;s novels===

====Autobiographical novels====

Mirbeau ghostwrote ten novels, including three for the Swiss writer Dora Melegari. He made his own literary debut with &quot;Le Calvaire&quot; (&quot;Calvary&quot;, 1886), in which writing allowed him to overcome the traumatic effects of his devastating liaison with the ill-reputed Judith Vinmer (1858-1951), renamed Juliette Roux in the novel.

In 1888, Mirbeau published &quot;L&#x27;Abbé Jules&quot; (&quot;Abbé Jules&quot;), the first pre-Freudian novel written under the influence of Dostoyevsky to appear in French literature; the text featured two main characters: l&#x27;abbé Jules and Father Pamphile. In &quot;Sébastien Roch&quot; (1890) (English translation: &quot;Sébastien Roch&quot;, 2000), Mirbeau purged the traumatic effects of his experience as a student at a Jesuits school in Vannes. In the novel, the 13-year-old Sébastien is sexually abused by a priest at the school and the abuse destroys his life.

====Crisis of the novel====
Mirbeau then underwent a grave existential and literary crisis, yet during this time, he still published in serial form a pre-existentialist novel about the artist&#x27;s fate, &quot;Dans le ciel&quot; (&quot;In the Sky&quot;), introducing the figure of a painter (Lucien), directly modeled on Van Gogh. In the aftermath of the Dreyfus Affair — which exacerbated Mirbeau&#x27;s pessimism — he published two novels judged to be scandalous by self-styled paragons of virtue: &quot;Le Jardin des supplices&quot; &quot;(Torture Garden&quot; (1899) and &quot;Le Journal d&#x27;une femme de chambre&quot; (&quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot;) (1900), then &quot;Les Vingt et un Jours d&#x27;un neurasthénique&quot; (The twenty one days of a neurasthenic person) (1901). In the process of writing these works, Mirbeau unsettled traditional novelistic conventions, exercising collage techniques, transgressing codes of verisimilitude and fictional credibility, and defying the hypocritical rules of propriety.

====Death of the novel====
In his last two novels, &quot;La 628-E8&quot; (1907) – including &quot;La Mort de Balzac&quot; – and &quot;Dingo&quot; (1913), he strayed ever further from realism, giving free rein to clinical fantasy elements and casting his cat and his own dog as heroes. These last Mirbeau stories show a complete break with the conventions of realist fiction, also signifying a breakdown of reality.

===Mirbeau&#x27;s theatre===
In the theatre, Mirbeau made his first steps with a proletarian drama and modern tragedy, &quot;Les Mauvais bergers&quot; (&quot;The Bad Shepherds&quot;, 1897). Then he experienced worldwide acclaim with &quot;Les affaires sont les affaires&quot; (&quot;Business is business&quot;, 1903) — his classical comedy of manners and characters in the tradition of Molière. Here Mirbeau featured the character of Isidore Lechat, predecessor of the modern master of business intrigue, a product of the new world, a figure who makes money from everything and spreads his tentacles out over the world.

In 1908 — at the end of a long legal and media battle
— Mirbeau saw his play &quot;Le Foyer&quot; (&quot;Home&quot;) performed by the Comédie-Française. In this work, he broached a new taboo subject, the economic and sexual exploitation of adolescents in a home that pretended to be a charitable one.
He also wrote six one act plays, published under the title of &quot;Farces et moralités&quot; (1904), among them being &quot;L&#x27;Épidémie&quot; (&quot;Epidemics&quot;, 1898). Here, Mirbeau can be seen as anticipating the theatre of Bertolt Brecht, Marcel Aymé, Harold Pinter, and Eugène Ionesco. He calls language itself into question, demystifying law, ridiculing the discourse of politicians, and making fun of the language of love (&quot;Les Amants&quot;, &quot;The Lovers&quot;, 1901).

===Posthumous fame===
There has been no interruption in the publication of Mirbeau&#x27;s works. Yet his immense literary production has largely been known through only three works, and he was considered as literally and politically incorrect.

But, more recently, Mirbeau has been rediscovered and presented in a new light. A fuller appreciation of the role he played in the political, literary, and artistic world of la Belle Époque is emerging.

Mirbeau lies buried in the Passy Cemetery, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.

<doc id="153998" wikidata="Q475966" url="?curid=153998" title="Low-voltage differential signaling">
<text>Low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS), also known as TIA/EIA-644, is a technical standard that specifies electrical characteristics of a differential, serial signaling standard. LVDS operates at low power and can run at very high speeds using inexpensive twisted-pair copper cables. LVDS is a physical layer specification only; many data communication standards and applications use it and add a data link layer as defined in the OSI model on top of it.

LVDS was introduced in 1994, and has become popular in products such as LCD-TVs, in-car entertainment systems, industrial cameras and machine vision, notebook and tablet computers, and communications systems. The typical applications are high-speed video, graphics, video camera data transfers, and general purpose computer buses.

Early on, the notebook computer and LCD display vendors commonly used the term LVDS instead of FPD-Link when referring to their protocol, and the term &quot;LVDS&quot; has mistakenly become synonymous with &quot;Flat Panel Display Link&quot; in the video-display engineering vocabulary.

==Differential vs. single-ended signaling==
LVDS is a differential signaling system, meaning that it transmits information as the difference between the voltages on a pair of wires; the two wire voltages are compared at the receiver. In a typical implementation, the transmitter injects a constant current of 3.5 mA into the wires, with the direction of current determining the digital logic level. The current passes through a termination resistor of about 100 to 120 ohms (matched to the cable&#x27;s characteristic impedance to reduce reflections) at the receiving end, and then returns in the opposite direction via the other wire. From Ohm&#x27;s law, the voltage difference across the resistor is therefore about 350 mV. The receiver senses the polarity of this voltage to determine the logic level.

As long as there is tight electric- and magnetic-field coupling between the two wires, LVDS reduces the generation of electromagnetic noise. This noise reduction is due to the equal and opposite current flow in the two wires creating equal and opposite electromagnetic fields that tend to cancel each other. In addition, the tightly coupled transmission wires will reduce susceptibility to electromagnetic noise interference because the noise will equally affect each wire and appear as a common-mode noise. The LVDS receiver is unaffected by common-mode noise because it senses the differential voltage, where the common-mode noise impacts both pairs equally, resulting in no relative voltage difference between them.

The fact that the LVDS transmitter consumes a constant current also places much less demand on the power supply decoupling and thus produces less interference in the power and ground lines of the transmitting circuit. This reduces or eliminates phenomena such as ground bounce which are typically seen in terminated single-ended transmission lines where high and low logic levels consume different currents, or in non-terminated transmission lines where a current appears abruptly during switching.

The low common-mode voltage (the average of the voltages on the two wires) of about 1.2 V allows using LVDS with a wide range of integrated circuits with power supply voltages down to 2.5 V or lower. In addition, there are variations of LVDS that use a lower common mode voltage. One example is sub-LVDS (introduced by Nokia in 2004) that uses 0.9 V typical common mode voltage. Another is Scalable Low Voltage Signaling for 400 mV (SLVS-400) specified in JEDEC JESD8-13 October 2001 where the power supply can be as low as 800 mV and common mode voltage is about 400 mV.

The low differential voltage, about 350 mV, causes LVDS to consume very little power compared to other signaling technologies. At 2.5 V supply voltage the power to drive 3.5 mA becomes 8.75 mW, compared to the 90 mW dissipated by the load resistor for an RS-422 signal.

LVDS is not the only low-power differential signaling system in use, others include the Fairchild Current Transfer Logic serial I/O.

==Applications==

In 1994, National Semiconductor introduced LVDS, which later became a de facto standard for high-speed data transfer.
LVDS became popular in the mid 1990s. Before that, computer monitor resolutions were not large enough to need such fast data rates for graphics and video. However, in 1992 Apple Computer needed a method to transfer multiple streams of digital video without overloading the existing NuBus on the backplane. Apple and National Semiconductor (NSC) created QuickRing, which was the first integrated circuit using LVDS. QuickRing was a high speed auxiliary bus for video data to bypass the NuBus in Macintosh computers. The multimedia and supercomputer applications continued to expand because both needed to move large amounts of data over links several meters long (from a disk drive to a workstation for instance).

The first commercially successful application for LVDS was in notebook computers transmitting video data from graphics processing units to the flat panel displays using the Flat Panel Display Link by National Semiconductor. The first FPD-Link chipset reduced a 21-bit wide video interface plus the clock down to only 4 differential pairs (8 wires), which enabled it to easily fit through the hinge between the display and the notebook and take advantage of LVDS&#x27;s low-noise characteristics and fast data rate. FPD-Link became the de facto open standard for this notebook application in the late 1990s and was the dominant display interface in notebook and tablet computers until the early 2010s when it was succeeded by Embedded DisplayPort (eDP).
The applications for LVDS expanded to flat panel displays for consumer TVs as screen resolutions and color depths increased. To serve this application, FPD-Link chipsets continued to increase the data-rate and the number of parallel LVDS channels to meet the internal TV requirement for transferring video data from the main video processor to the display-panel&#x27;s timing controller. FPD-Link (commonly called LVDS) once was the de facto standard for this internal TV interconnect but has since been usurped by modernized, more efficient interfaces such as MIPI DSI and eDP.

The next target application was transferring video streams through an external cable connection between a desktop computer and display, or a DVD player and a TV. NSC introduced higher performance follow-ons to FPD-Link called the LVDS Display Interface (LDI) and OpenLDI standards. These standards allow a maximum pixel clock of 112 MHz, which suffices for a display resolution of 1400 × 1050 (SXGA+) at 60 Hz refresh. A dual link can boost the maximum display resolution to 2048 × 1536 (QXGA) at 60 Hz. FPD-Link works with cable lengths up to about 5 m, and LDI extends this to about 10 m. However, Digital Visual Interface (DVI) using TMDS over CML signals won the standards competition and became the standard for externally connecting desktop computers to monitors, and HDMI eventually became the standard for connecting digital video sources such as DVD players to flat panel displays in consumer applications.

Another successful LVDS application is Camera Link, which is a serial communication protocol designed for computer vision applications and based on the NSC chipset called Channel Link that uses LVDS. Camera Link standardizes video interfaces for scientific and industrial products including cameras, cables, and frame grabbers. The Automated Imaging Association (AIA) maintains and administers the standard because it is the industry&#x27;s global machine vision trade group.

More examples of LVDS used in computer buses are HyperTransport and FireWire, both of which trace their development back to the post-Futurebus work, which also led to SCI. In addition, LVDS is the physical layer signaling in SCSI standards (Ultra-2 SCSI and later) to allow higher data rates and longer cable lengths. Serial ATA (SATA), RapidIO, and SpaceWire use LVDS to allow high speed data transfer.

Intel and AMD published a press release in December 2010 stating they would no longer support the LVDS LCD-panel interface in their product lines by 2013. They are promoting Embedded DisplayPort and Internal DisplayPort as their preferred solution. However, the LVDS LCD-panel interface has proven to be the lowest cost method for moving streaming video from a video processing unit to a LCD-panel timing controller within a TV or notebook, and in February 2018 LCD TV and notebook manufacturers continue to introduce new products using the LVDS interface.

LVDS was originally introduced as a 3.3 V standard. Scalable low voltage signaling (SLVS) has a lower common-mode voltage of 200 mV and a reduced p-p swing, but is otherwise the same as LVDS.

==Comparing serial and parallel data transmission==
LVDS works in both parallel and serial data transmission. In parallel transmissions multiple data differential pairs carry several signals at once including a clock signal to synchronize the data. In serial communications, multiple single-ended signals are serialized into a single differential pair with a data rate equal to that of all the combined single-ended channels. For example, a 7-bit wide parallel bus serialized into a single pair that will operate at 7 times the data rate of one single-ended channel. The devices for converting between serial and parallel data are the serializer and deserializer, abbreviated to SerDes when the two devices are contained in one integrated circuit.

As an example, FPD-Link actually uses LVDS in a combination of serialized and parallel communications. The original FPD-Link designed for 18-bit RGB video has 3 parallel data pairs and a clock pair, so this is a parallel communication scheme. However, each of the 3 pairs transfers 7 serialized bits during each clock cycle. So the FPD-Link parallel pairs are carrying serialized data, but use a parallel clock to recover and synchronize the data.

Serial data communications can also embed the clock within the serial data stream. This eliminates the need for a parallel clock to synchronize the data. There are multiple methods for embedding a clock into a data stream. One method is inserting 2 extra bits into the data stream as a start-bit and stop-bit to guarantee bit transitions at regular intervals to mimic a clock signal. Another method is 8b/10b encoding.

==LVDS transmission with 8b/10b encoding==
LVDS does not specify a bit encoding scheme because it is a physical layer standard only. LVDS accommodates any user-specified encoding scheme for sending and receiving data across an LVDS link, including 8b/10b encoded data. An 8b/10b encoding scheme embeds the clock signal information and has the added benefit of DC balance. DC balance is necessary for AC-coupled transmission paths (such as capacitive or transformer-coupled paths). There are also DC-balance encoding methods for the start bit/stop bit embedded clock, which usually include a data scrambling technique. The key point in LVDS is the physical layer signaling to transport bits across wires. It is compatible with almost all data encoding and clock embedding techniques.

==LVDS for very high data-throughput applications==
When a single differential pair of serial data is not fast enough there are techniques for grouping serial data channels in parallel and adding a parallel clock channel for synchronization. This is the technique used by FPD-Link. Other examples of parallel LVDS using multiple LVDS pairs and a parallel clock to synchronize are Channel Link and HyperTransport.

There is also the technique to increase the data throughput by grouping multiple LVDS-with-embedded-clock data channels together. However, this is not parallel LVDS because there is no parallel clock and each channel has its own clock information. An example of this technique is PCI Express where 2, 4, or 8 8b/10b encoded serial channels carry application data from source to destination. In this case the destination must employ a data synchronization method to align the multiple serial data channels.

==Multipoint LVDS==
The original LVDS standard only envisioned driving a digital signal from one transmitter to one receiver in a point-to-point topology. However, engineers using the first LVDS products soon wanted to drive multiple receivers with a single transmitter in a multipoint topology. As a result, NSC invented Bus LVDS (BLVDS) as the first variation of LVDS designed to drive multiple LVDS receivers. It uses termination resistors at each end of the differential transmission line to maintain the signal integrity. Double termination is necessary because it is possible to have one or more transmitters in the center of the bus driving signals toward receivers in both directions. The difference from standard LVDS transmitters was increasing the current output in order to drive the multiple termination resistors. In addition, the transmitters need to tolerate the possibility of other transmitters simultaneously driving the same bus.
Point-to-point LVDS typically operates at 3.5 mA. Multi-point LVDS or bus LVDS (B-LVDS) can operate up to 12 mA.

Bus LVDS and LVDM (Low-Voltage Differential Multipoint) (by TI) are &quot;de facto&quot; multipoint LVDS standards.

Multipoint LVDS (MLVDS or M-LVDS) is the TIA standard (TIA-899). The AdvancedTCA standard specified MLVDS for clock distribution across the backplane to each of the computing module boards in the system.

MLVDS has two types of receivers. Type-1 is compatible with LVDS and uses a +/− 50 mV threshold. Type-2 receivers allow Wired-Or signaling with M-LVDS devices. For M-LVDS:

==SCI-LVDS==
The present form of LVDS was preceded by an earlier standard initiated in Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI). SCI-LVDS was a subset of the SCI family of standards and specified in the IEEE 1596.3 1995 standard. The SCI committee designed LVDS for interconnecting multiprocessing systems with a high-speed low-power interface to replace positive emitter-coupled logic (PECL).

==Standards==
The ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A (published in 2001) standard defines LVDS. This standard originally recommended a maximum data rate of 655 Mbit/s over twisted-pair copper wire, but data rates from 1 to 3 Gbit/s are common today on high-quality transmission mediums.
Today, technologies for broadband digital video signal transmission such as LVDS are also used in vehicles, in which the signal transmitted as a differential signal helps for EMC reasons. However, high-quality shielded twisted-pair cables must be used together with elaborate connector systems for cabling. An alternative is the use of coaxial cables. Studies have shown that it is possible in spite of the simplified transfer medium dominate both emission and immunity in the high frequency range. Future high-speed video connections can be smaller, lighter, and cheaper to realize.

Serial video transmission technologies are widely used in the automobile for linking cameras, displays, and control devices. The uncompressed video data has some advantages for certain applications. Serial communication protocols now allow the transfer of data rates in the range of 3 to 4 Gbit/s and thus the control of displays with up to full HD resolution. The integration of the serializer and deserializer components in the control unit due to low demands on additional hardware and software simple and inexpensive. In contrast, require bus solutions for video transmission connection to a corresponding network controller and, if necessary resources for data compression. Since for many applications a full function network is not required throughout the video architecture and for some compounds, data compression is not feasible due to image quality loss and additional latency, bus-oriented video transmission technologies are currently only partially attractive.

<doc id="154001" wikidata="Q1463560" url="?curid=154001" title="Moshing">
<text>Moshing (also known as slam dancing or simply slamming) is an extreme style of dancing in which participants push or slam into each other. Taking place in an area called the mosh pit (or simply the pit), it is typically performed to aggressive styles of live music such as punk rock and heavy metal.

The dance style originated in the southern California hardcore punk scene, particularly Huntington Beach and Long Beach around 1978. Through the 1980s it spread to the hardcore scenes of Washington, D.C., Boston and New York where it developed local variants. In New York, the crossover between the city&#x27;s hardcore scene and its metal scene led to moshing incorporating itself into metal beginning around 1985. In the 1990s, the success of grunge music led to moshing entering mainstream understanding and soon being incorporated into genres like electronic dance music and hip hop.

Due to its violence, moshing has been subject to controversy, with a number of concert venues banning the practice, and some musicians being arrested for encouraging it and concertgoers for participating.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;mosh&quot; originates from the word &quot;mash&quot;. While performing their song &quot;Banned in D.C.&quot; in either 1979 or 1980, H.R., vocalist of Washington D.C. hardcore band the Bad Brains, shouted &quot;mash it - mash down Babylon!&quot; Because of his faux Jamaican accent, some audience members heard this as &quot;mosh it - mosh down Babylon&quot;. Beginning around 1983, metalheads began to refer to the slower sections of hardcore songs as &quot;mosh parts&quot;, while hardcore musicians had called them &quot;skank parts&quot;. Once Stormtroopers of Death released their debut album &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; in 1985, which included the track &quot;Milano Mosh&quot;, the term began being applied to the style of dance. The term was then further popularised by Anthrax&#x27;s 1987 song &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot;.

==History==
===Origins and early developments (1970s–1980s)===

The direct predecessor to moshing was the pogo, a style of dance done in the 1970s English punk rock scene, in which crowds members would jump up and down while holding their arms beside them. According to The Filth and the Fury, it was invented by Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious in 1976.

As a prominent punk rock scene in Southern California began to form in the late 1970s and early 1980s with early hardcore punk groups like Fear and Black Flag, moshing as it is understood today began to develop, originally termed &quot;slam dancing&quot;. Participants in slam dancing at this time modified the pogo by bringing additional physical contact to those around them by pushing and running, as well introducing the idea of a recognised area where it takes place called a &quot;pit&quot;. According to Steven Blush&#x27;s book &quot;American Hardcore: A Tribal History&quot; (2001), there is a common belief amongst those involved in this scene that the dance was invented by former US marine Mike Marine in 1978. His specific style, involving &quot;strutting around in a circle, swinging your arms and hitting everyone within reach&quot;, would go on to be termed &quot;the Huntington Beach Strut&quot;. &quot;The Orange County Register&quot; writer Tom Berg credited, Costa Mesa venue, the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest (1976–1981) as the &quot;birthplace of slam dancing&quot;. Examples of this early moshing were featured in the documentaries &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Urban Struggle&quot;, &quot;the Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, and &quot;American Hardcore&quot;. Fear&#x27;s 1981 musical performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; also helped to expose moshing to a much wider audience.

By 1981, slam dancing had become the predominant style of crowd interaction in the southern California scene, as Huntington Beach and Long Beach became the scene&#x27;s heart. Washington, D.C. band the Teen Idles toured California in August 1980, where they were first exposed to slam dancing. Upon returning home, they introduced the practice to the Washington, D.C., hardcore scene. That particular scene took a more chaotic approach to slam dancing and saw an increase in stage diving, whereas in the Boston hardcore scene slam dancing became violent and incorporated punching below the neck, developing a style called the &quot;Boston thrash&quot; or &quot;punching penguins&quot;. Another development in the Boston scene was &quot;pig piles&quot; in which one person was pushed to the ground and others would begin to pile on top of them. This originated during a D.O.A. set, which was initiated by SSD guitarist Al Barile. The New York hardcore scene of the mid-1980s, modified this early slam dancing into an additional, more violent style. In their distinction, participants may stay in one position on their own or collide with others, while executing a more exaggerated version of the arm and leg swinging of California slam dancing.

As fans of heavy metal music began to attend New York hardcore performances, they developed their own style of dancing based on New York hardcore&#x27;s style of slam dancing. It was this group, particularly Scott Ian and Billy Milano who popularised the word &quot;moshing&quot;. Ian and Milano&#x27;s band Stormtroopers of Death released their debut album &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; in 1985, which included the track &quot;Milano Mosh&quot;. This led to the term being applied to the style of dance. The same year, moshing began to incorporate itself into live performances by heavy metal bands, with one early example being during Anthrax&#x27;s 1985 set at the Ritz.

===Mainstream crossover (1990s–present)===

Moshing entered mainstream consciousness with the rise of grunge in the early 1990s. Grunge becoming the dominant force in rock music, brought with it aspects of genres like hardcore, punk and ska, and in turn, pop culture became aware of the mosh pit. This was exacerbated by the success of Lollapalooza, which began in 1991 as a touring festival. In his book &quot;Festivals: A Music Lover&#x27;s Guide to the Festivals You Need To Know&quot;, writer Oliver Keens stated that &quot;Lollapalooza&#x27;s greatest impact was to expose Middle America to the joys of stage-diving and moshing...You can see Lollapalooza&#x27;s legacy in the way mosh pits have become an integral part of youth culture; beyond rock and metal&quot;. By 1992, the practice had become so common that concertgoers began to mosh to non-aggressive rock bands like the Cranberries.

Moshing slowly entered hip hop during live performances by the Beastie Boys, who began as a hardcore punk band before adopting the hip hop style they became known for. During Public Enemy and Ice-T&#x27;s European tour in the late 1980s, the artists witnessed moshing during their performances, which was still not commonplace during hip hop concerts. The 1991 collaboration song &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; by thrash metal band Anthrax and hip hop group Public Enemy led to a number of mixed genre tours, which brought metal&#x27;s moshing to the attention of hip hop fans. This was solidified as a part of hip hop by Onyx&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Slam&quot;, a song which alluded to slam dancing and had a music video featuring moshing. Following the video&#x27;s release, pits became increasingly common during performances by hip hop artists including Busta Rhymes, M.O.P. and the Wu-Tang Clan.

Moshing has been present during electronic dance music performance since at least 1996, with the Prodigy&#x27;s performance at Endfest. By 1999, moshing had become commonplace during techno performances, especially hardcore techno. At late 1990s parties such as New York&#x27;s H-Bomb, Milwaukee&#x27;s Afternoon Delight and Los Angeles&#x27; Twilight, attendees inverted the intellectualism and PLUR credo which permeated electronic music genres, like intelligent dance music, earlier in the decade, by incorporating crowd participation acts similar to those found at hardcore punk, metal and goth performances. In the 2010s, the success of Skrillex and his &quot;DJ as rock star&quot; attitude brought moshing into mainstream dance music.

The 2010s saw the rise of a number of hip hop artists who used an &quot;anarchic energy&quot;, which some critics at the time compared to that of punk. These artists, notably A$AP Mob, Odd Future and Danny Brown, revived moshing in mainstream hip hop, which led to pits becoming a staple of performances in the genre. Amongst this era, Travis Scott&#x27;s performances became particularly notable for their violent combination of moshing and crowd surfing, which he called &quot;raging&quot;. Scott was arrested in 2015 and 2017 for inciting riots after encouraging these actions, with the latter event leading to an attendee being partially paralyzed. However, the most infamous example of this at his concerts was the 2021 Astroworld Festival crowd crush, which left 25 hospitalized and 10 dead.

== Variations ==
*The Huntington Beach strut or simply the HB Strut is the original style of slam dancing which was popular the Southern California hardcore in the late 1970s and 1980s. It involves &quot;strutting around in a circle, swinging your arms and hitting everyone within reach&quot;.

*The Boston thrash or punching penguins is Boston&#x27;s more violent development upon the Huntington Beach strut, which incorporates punching below the neck.

*A pig pile is a style moshing popular amongst the Boston hardcore scene in the 1980s. It involved one person being pushed to the ground and others beginning to pile on top of them.

*Wrecking is a style of moshing that is prevalent in the psychobilly scene. It involves standing in one spot with arms flailing in order to make contact with those around. The practice was originated by fans of the Meteors and named in reference to the band&#x27;s fanbase being called the &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. Found Meteors drummer Mark Robertson specifically cited wrecking as beginning with Adam and the Ants, when they become involved in the psychobilly scene.

*A circle pit is a form of moshing in which participants run in a circular motion around the edges of the pit, often leaving an open space in the centre.

*A wall of death is a form of moshing which sees the audience divide down the middle into two halves either side of the venue, before each side runs towards the other, slamming the two sides together. According to Noisecreep, the consensus is that it was invented by American hardcore punk band Sick of it All. However, the band&#x27;s vocalist Lou Koller has stated that he merely revived the practice in 1996, as he often saw a similar act performed in the 1980s New York hardcore scene. Loudwire senior writer Graham Hartmann referred to it as &quot;Perhaps the most bad ass and dangerous ritual you can experience in a mosh pit&quot;. Venues will often ask bands not to organize the Wall of Death themselves due to the inherent risk involved and liability.

*Hardcore dancing is a term that covers multiple style of moshing including windmilling two stepping, floorpunching, picking up pennies, axehandling, bucking, and wheelbarrowing. The practice began in New York City in the 1980s.
**A two step is a style of hardcore dancing done during mid-tempo sections of songs. It is a running–in–place motion in which legs are crossed over one another while the opposite arm punches downwards. It descends directly from skanking.

*Crowd killing is when a mosher moshes against the crowd around the sides of the pit. According to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; writer Amanda van Poznak it is generally looked down upon.

*Hip hop pits are generally less violent than those in hardcore, instead consisting of &quot;a mass of people enthusiastically nudg[ing] each other while jumping in unison&quot;.
*Slingshot when a person bends down in the audience of a show and another person runs at them grabs the persons foot and flings them into the crowd, this often leads to crowd surfing. It can be dangerous to be flung as well as dangerous for bystanders as they could be hit by the flung person.

== Physical properties of emergent behavior ==
Researchers from Cornell University studied the emergent behavior of crowds at mosh pits by analyzing online videos, finding similarities with models of 2-D gases in equilibrium. Simulating the crowds with computer models, they found out that a simulation dominated by flocking parameters produced highly ordered behavior, forming vortices like those seen in the videos.

==Opposition, criticism and controversy==
While moshing is seen by some as a form of positive fan feedback or expression of enjoyment, it has also drawn criticism over dangerous excesses in its violence. Injuries and even deaths have been reported in the crush of mosh pits.

The American post-hardcore band Fugazi opposed slamdancing at their live shows. Members of Fugazi were reported to single out and confront specific members of the audience, politely asking them to stop hurting other audience members, or hauling them on stage to apologize on the microphone.

Consolidated, an industrial dance group of the 1990s, stood against moshing. On their third album, &quot;Play More Music&quot;, they included the song &quot;The Men&#x27;s Movement&quot;, which proclaimed the inappropriate nature of slamdancing. The song consisted of audio recordings during concerts from the audience and members of Consolidated, arguing about moshing.
In the 1990s, the Smashing Pumpkins took a stance against moshing, following two incidents which resulted in fatalities. At a 1996 Pumpkins concert in Dublin, Ireland, 17-year-old Bernadette O&#x27;Brien was crushed by moshing crowd members and later died in the hospital, despite warnings from the band that people were getting hurt. At another concert, singer Billy Corgan said to the audience:
Another fan died at a Smashing Pumpkins concert in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on September 24, 2007. The 20-year-old man was dragged out of the mosh pit, unconscious, to be pronounced dead at a hospital after first-aid specialists attempted to save him.

Reel Big Fish&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Why Do They Rock So Hard?&quot; included their mosh-criticizing song &quot;Thank You for Not Moshing&quot;, which contained lyrics that suggested that at least some individuals in the mosh pit were simply bullies who were finding conformity in the violence.

Mike Portnoy, founder and drummer of Dream Theater, and Avenged Sevenfold where he briefly filled in after the death of The Rev, criticized moshing in an interview published on his website:
Sixteen-year-old Jessica Michalik was an Australian girl who died as a result of asphyxiation after being crushed in a mosh pit during the 2001 Big Day Out festival during a performance by nu metal band Limp Bizkit. At that same festival, post-hardcore band At the Drive-In ended their set early after only three songs due to the audience&#x27;s moshing.

Joey DeMaio of American heavy metal band Manowar has been known to temporarily stop concerts upon seeing moshing and crowd surfing, claiming it is dangerous to other fans.

Former Slipknot percussionist Chris Fehn spoke about the state of audience interaction following the onstage incident and subsequent legal issues involving Lamb of God’s Randy Blythe, who was eventually found not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in the death of a concertgoer, despite being held &quot;morally responsible&quot;. Fehn briefly addressed the Blythe situation, stating &quot;I think, especially in America, moshing has turned into a form of bullying. The big guy stands in the middle and just trucks any small kid that comes near him. They don’t mosh properly anymore. It sucks because that’s not what it’s about. Those guys need to be kicked out. A proper mosh pit is a great way to be as a group and dance, and just do your thing.&quot;

<text>William Ralph Wright (born January 20, 1960) is an American video game designer and co-founder of the game development company Maxis, which later became part of Electronic Arts. In April 2009, he left EA to run Stupid Fun Club Camp, an entertainment think tank in which Wright and EA are principal shareholders.

The first computer game Wright designed was &quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; in 1984, but it was &quot;SimCity&quot; that brought him to prominence. The game was published by Maxis, which Wright co-formed with Jeff Braun. Wright continued to innovate on the game&#x27;s central theme of simulation with numerous other titles including &quot;SimEarth&quot; and &quot;SimAnt&quot;.

Wright has earned many awards for his work in game design. He is best known for being the original designer of &quot;The Sims&quot; series, of which Maxis developed the first entry in 2000. The game spawned multiple sequels, including &quot;The Sims 2&quot;, &quot;The Sims 3&quot;, &quot;The Sims 4&quot; and their expansion packs. His latest work, &quot;Spore&quot;, released in September 2008 and features gameplay based upon the model of evolution and scientific advancement. The game sold 406,000 copies within three weeks of its release.

In 2007, he became the first game designer to receive the BAFTA Fellowship, which had previously only been presented to those in the film and television industries.

==Early life and education==
The son of a plastics engineer and an actress, Wright was born on January 20, 1960, in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended a Montessori school until the age of nine. When his father died of leukemia the same year, Wright moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana with his mother and his younger sister. He graduated from the Baton Rouge Episcopal High School at the age of 16.

Wright&#x27;s interest in game design began in childhood with the Chinese strategy board game Go. In his own words, the game has a &quot;simple set of rules&quot; yet &quot;the strategies in it are so complex&quot; and he was &quot;fascinated with the idea that complexity can come out of such simplicity.&quot; As a teenager, Wright enjoyed playing board wargames such as &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot;.

After graduating high school, Wright studied architecture at Louisiana State University for two years. He then transferred to Louisiana Tech where he switched to mechanical engineering, with a particular interest in robotics, space exploration, military history, and language arts. Two years later, in the fall of 1980, he transferred again to The New School in New York City. During this time, he lived in an apartment in Greenwich Village, and spent his free time &quot;searching for spare parts in local electronics surplus stores.&quot;

While living in New York City, he purchased an Apple II+ and taught himself Applesoft BASIC, Pascal, and assembly language in order to implement Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. After one year at the New School, Wright concluded five years of collegiate study without a degree and returned to Baton Rouge.

==Career==
While other game designers such as Bill Budge and Nasir Gebelli were producing Apple video games, Wright decided to develop for the newer Commodore 64. His first game was the helicopter action game &quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; (1984). The gameplay involves the player flying over islands while dropping bombs.

Wright found that he had more fun creating the islands with his level editor for &quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; than he had actually playing the game. He created a new game based on this idea that would later evolve into &quot;SimCity&quot;, but he had trouble finding a publisher. The structuralist dynamics of the game were in part inspired by the work of two architectural and urban theorists, Christopher Alexander and Jay Forrester.


In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, Wright expressed his belief that computers extend the imagination, and posits the emergence of the &quot;metabrain&quot;, stating:


===Game design===
In 1986, Wright met Jeff Braun— an investor interested in entering the computer game industry— at what Wright has called &quot;the world&#x27;s most important pizza party.&quot; Together they formed Maxis the following year in Orinda, California. &quot;SimCity&quot; (1989) was a hit and has been credited as one of the most influential computer games ever made. Wright himself has been widely featured in several computer magazines—particularly &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, which has listed Wright in its annual &#x27;Game Gods&#x27; feature, alongside such notables as Roberta Williams and Peter Molyneux.

Following the success of &quot;SimCity&quot;, Wright designed &quot;SimEarth&quot; (1990) and &quot;SimAnt&quot; (1991). He co-designed &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (1993) with Fred Haslam and, in the meantime, Maxis produced other &quot;Sim&quot; games. Wright&#x27;s next game was &quot;SimCopter&quot; (1996). Although none of these games were as successful as &quot;SimCity&quot;, they further cemented Wright&#x27;s reputation as a designer of &quot;software toys&quot;—games that cannot be won or lost, but played indefinitely. In 1992, Wright moved to Walnut Creek, California.

Wright is known for his great interest in complex adaptive systems, with most of his games having been based around them or books that describe them, e.g. &quot;SimAnt&quot;: E.O. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Ants;&quot; &quot;SimEarth&quot;: James Lovelock&#x27;s &quot;Gaia Theory&quot;; &quot;SimCity&quot;: Jay Forrester&#x27;s &quot;Urban Dynamics&quot; and &quot;World Dynamics&quot;; &quot;Spore&quot;: &quot;Drake&#x27;s Equation&quot; and &quot;Powers of Ten&quot;. Wright&#x27;s role in the development of concepts from simulations to games is to empower the players by creating what he dubs &quot;possibility spaces&quot;, or simple rules which combine with game elements to form complex designs. All games that Wright had a hand in designing adhere to these design principles.

Maxis went public in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997.

After losing his home in the Oakland firestorm of 1991, Wright was inspired to turn the experience of rebuilding his life into a game. He began developing an idea of a virtual doll house, similar to &quot;SimCity&quot; but with focus on individual people. This idea would evolve into &quot;The Sims&quot;, which was based on Wright&#x27;s firsthand experience rebuilding and furnishing his home. The game was originally conceived of as an architectural design game called &quot;Home Tactics&quot;, though Wright&#x27;s idea changed when someone suggested the home should be rated on the quality-of-life experience by virtual homeowners. Themes such as carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping are common throughout the game.

The board at Maxis was not interested in the idea, but Wright found an unlikely publisher in Electronic Arts, who was impressed by Wright&#x27;s work on SimCity and saw potential for the &quot;Sim&quot; franchise. EA published &quot;The Sims&quot; in February 2000 and it became Wright&#x27;s biggest success at the time. It eventually surpassed &quot;Myst&quot; as the best-selling computer game of all time and spawned numerous expansion packs and spin-offs. He designed a massively multiplayer version of the game called &quot;The Sims Online&quot;, which was not as popular as the original. By November 2006, the &quot;Sims&quot; franchise had earned EA more than a billion dollars.

In a presentation at the Game Developers Conference on March 11, 2005, Wright announced his latest game &quot;Spore&quot;. He used the current work on this game to demonstrate methods that can be used to reduce the amount of content that needs to be created by the game developers. Wright hopes to inspire others to take risks in game creation.

As for his theories on interactive design, Wright has said:

Wright has said that he believes that simulations, as games, can be used to improve education by teaching children how to learn. In his own words:


===Post-Maxis career===
After building his reputation as one of the most important game designers in the world, Wright left Maxis in 2009. His first post-EA venture was the Stupid Fun Club startup company and experimental entertainment development studio, with a focus on &quot;video games, online environments, storytelling media, and fine home care products&quot;, as well as toys.

In October 2010, Current TV announced that Will Wright and his team from Stupid Fun Club will produce a new show for the network. The program, entitled &quot;Bar Karma&quot;, began airing in February 2011, and featured scenes and twists pitched by an online community, using an online story creator tool designed by Wright. Stupid Fun Club ran for four years before closing down, with much of the team following Wright to found the social media app and graphic novel builder Thred.

In October 2011, Will Wright became a member of the board of directors of Linden Lab, the creators of &quot;Second Life&quot;.

At the Game Developers Conference in March 2018, Will Wright announced a new project, the upcoming mobile game &quot;Proxi&quot;.

At GalaVerse on December 11, 2021, Wright announced a new project, in partnership with Gala Games, called &quot;VoxVerse&quot;. Wright said &quot;VoxVerse&quot; will be a blockchain game, where players will be able to create areas to explore and interact with and share these with other players of the game, incentivizing creators through the ability to trade or sell their works as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using cryptocurrency. Wright stated that the use of blockchain and NFTs are mechanisms needed to support the vision he has, but has no interest in selling NFTs directly to players as other blockchain games or NFT schemes have had done in the past. He likened it to early players in &quot;The Sims&quot; that found ways to modify the game to include their own creation. The game is being developed by Gallium Games, a studio he co-founded with Lauren Elliott, and being created in the Unity engine.

===Awards===
Wright was given a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001. In 2002, he became the fifth person to be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences&#x27; Hall of Fame. Until 2006, he was the only person to have been honored this way by both of these industry organizations. In 2007 the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded him a fellowship, the first given to a game designer.

He has been called one of the most important people in gaming, technology, and entertainment by publications such as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, &quot;Discover&quot; and GameSpy. Wright was also awarded the &quot;PC Magazine&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2005. Later that year, Wright earned the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service awarded by the Georgia Institute of Technology. He delivered a forward looking acceptance speech entitled &quot;Stealth Communities&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wright lives in Oakland, California. He is an atheist. In 1984, he married artist Joell Jones, with whom he had a daughter named Cassidy in 1986. The family lost their home and most records of Wright&#x27;s early career in the Oakland firestorm of 1991. Wright and Jones separated in 2008. He has since married Anya Zavarzina.

Wright is on the board of trustees of the X Prize Foundation, a non-profit organization that designs and hosts public competitions intended to encourage technological development to benefit humanity. Amid the 2008 United States presidential election, Wright donated to the campaigns of Rudy Giuliani and later John McCain.

===Hobbies===
In 1980, along with co-driver and race organizer Rick Doherty, Wright participated in the U.S. Express, a cross-country race that was the successor to The Cannonball Run. Wright and Doherty drove a specially outfitted Mazda RX-7 from Brooklyn, New York to Santa Monica, California in 33:39, winning the illegal race. Wright only competed once in the race, which continued until 1983.

Since 2003, in his spare time, Wright has collected leftovers from the Soviet space program, &quot;including a hatch from a space shuttle, a seat from a Soyuz ... control panels from the Mir&quot;, and the control console of the Soyuz 23, as well as dolls, dice, and fossils.

Wright used to build competitive robots for &quot;BattleBots&quot; with his daughter, but no longer does. , Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left over from his &quot;BattleBots&quot; days strewn about the garage of his home. Following his work in &quot;BattleBots&quot;, he has taken steps into the field of human-robot interactions:

Wright was a former &quot;Robot Wars&quot; champion in the Stupid Fun Club, a Berkeley-based robotics workshop. &quot;Kitty Puff Puff&quot;, one of Wright&#x27;s bots designed with the help of his daughter Cassidy, fought against its opponents by sticking a roll of tape onto its armature and circling around them, encapsulating them and denying them movement. The technique, &quot;cocooning&quot;, was eventually banned.

<doc id="154005" wikidata="Q281812" url="?curid=154005" title="Moïse Kisling">
<text>Moïse Kisling (born Mojżesz Kisling; 22 January 1891 – 29 April 1953) was a Polish-born French painter. Born in Kraków, then part of Austria-Hungary, to Jewish parents, Kisling studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. He left for Paris in 1910 at the age of 19. After moving to Montmartre, Kisling became a member of the Parisian avant-garde known also as the School of Paris, and developed close professional relationships with painters Amedeo Modigliani and Jules Pascin, among others. Kisling gained recognition for portraying the female form and completed numerous nudes and portraits during his career.

He became a French national in 1924, after serving and being wounded with the French Foreign Legion in World War I. In 1940, despite being 49, Kisling rejoined the army for World War II but moved to the United States following the French Army&#x27;s surrender and the impending threat to Jews in occupied France. In the U.S., he exhibited his works in New York City and Washington and settled in Southern California. After World War II and the defeat of Nazi Germany, Kisling returned to France. He lived his later years continuing his artwork until his death in 1953, after a brief illness.

His works are held by museums globally, including the Harvard Art Museums, British Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among other institutions. The Musée du Petit Palais in Geneva holds a significant collection of Kisling&#x27;s paintings.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kraków, Austria-Hungary on 22 January 1891 to Jewish Parents. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow with Jozef Pankiewicz. His teachers encouraged the young man to go to Paris, France, considered the international center for artistic creativity in the early 20th century. In 1910, Kisling moved to Montmartre in Paris initially living on Rue des Beaux-Arts, and a few years later to Montparnasse.

At the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered for service in the French Foreign Legion. He was seriously wounded in 1916 in the Battle of the Somme. He married Renée Kisling (née Gros) in 1916, and together they had two sons, Jean (1922) and Guy Kisling (1922). He acquired French nationality by naturalization in 1924.

==Career==

Kisling lived and worked in Montparnasse and as part of its renowned artistic community, he joined an émigré community of Americans, British and Eastern European artists. Most of the French kept to themselves, although the artistic community was international. In 1911–1912 he spent nearly a year at Céret, and by 1913, he had moved to Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, where he lived briefly.

Eventually around 1913, he took a home residence and art studio on 3 Rue Joseph-Bara in Montparnasse, however he spent a lot of his time in Southern France in the 1920s. Kisling maintained the Paris residence and studio on Rue Joseph-Bara through World War II, and upon his return after the war it had been ransacked. The artists Jules Pascin, Léopold Zborowski, and later Amedeo Modigliani lived in the same building.

He became close friends with many of his contemporaries, including Amedeo Modigliani, who painted a portrait of him in 1916 (in the collection of the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris). His style in painting landscapes is similar to that of Marc Chagall. A master at depicting the female body, his surreal nudes and portraits earned him the widest acclaim.

Kisling volunteered for army service again in 1940 during World War II, although he was 49. When the French Army was discharged after the surrender to the Germans, Kisling emigrated to the United States. He rightly feared for his safety as a Jew in occupied France. He exhibited in New York City and Washington. He settled in Southern California, and had his first art exhibition there in 1942. The Kisling family lived next door to Aldous Huxley and his family in Southern California, where they remained until 1946.

Under the Vichy government, certain critics suggested too many foreigners, especially Jews, were diminishing French traditions. Their comments were part of a rise in anti-Semitism during the German occupation, resulting in French cooperation in the deportation and deaths of tens of thousands of foreign and French Jews in concentration camps. Kisling returned to France after the war and defeat of Germany.

== Death and legacy ==
Moïse Kisling died at his house in Bandol, Var, Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, France on 29 April 1953. He had been ill with stomach issues for ten days, prior to his death. His work is in various public museum collections, including at the Harvard Art Museums, British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tokyo Fuji Art Museum, the Israel Museum, Ikeda 20 Seiki Museum, amongst others. A large collection of Kisling&#x27;s works is held by the Musée du Petit Palais in Geneva, Switzerland.

<doc id="154015" wikidata="Q216702" url="?curid=154015" title="Great Game">
<text>The Great Game was a rivalry between the 19th-century British and Russian empires over influence in Central Asia, primarily in Afghanistan, Persia, and Tibet. The two colonial empires used military interventions and diplomatic negotiations to acquire and redefine territories in Central and South Asia. Russia conquered Turkestan, and Britain expanded and set the borders of British India. By the early 20th century, a line of independent states, tribes, and monarchies from the shore of the Caspian Sea to the Eastern Himalayas were made into protectorates and territories of the two empires.

Though the Great Game was marked by distrust, diplomatic intrigue, and regional wars, it never erupted into a full-scale war directly between Russian and British colonial forces. However, the two nations battled in the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, which affected the Great Game. The Russian and British Empires also cooperated numerous times during the Great Game, including many treaties and the Afghan Boundary Commission.

Britain feared Russia&#x27;s southward expansion would threaten India, while Russia feared the expansion of British interests into Central Asia. As a result, Britain made it a high priority to protect all approaches to India, while Russia continued its military conquest of Central Asia. Aware of the importance of India to the British, Russian efforts in the region often had the aim of extorting concessions from them in Europe, but after 1801, they had no serious intention of directly attacking India. Russian war plans for India that were proposed but never materialised included the Duhamel and Khrulev plans of the Crimean War (1853–1856).

Russia and Britain&#x27;s 19th-century rivalry in Asia began with the planned Indian March of Paul and Russian invasions of Iran in 1804–1813 and 1826–1828, shuffling Persia into a competition between colonial powers. According to one major view, the Great Game started on 12 January 1830, when Lord Ellenborough, the president of the Board of Control for India, tasked Lord Bentinck, the governor-general, with establishing a trade route to the Emirate of Bukhara. Britain aimed to create a protectorate in Afghanistan, and support the Ottoman Empire, Persia, Khiva, and Bukhara as buffer states against Russian expansion. This would protect India and key British sea trade routes by blocking Russia from gaining a port on the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean. As Russian and British spheres of influence expanded and competed, Russia proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone.

Traditionally, the Great Game came to a close between 1895 and 1907. In September 1895, London and Saint Petersburg signed the Pamir Boundary Commission protocols, when the border between Afghanistan and the Russian Empire was defined using diplomatic methods. In August 1907, the Anglo-Russian Convention created an alliance between Britain and Russia, and formally delineated control in Afghanistan, Persia, and Tibet.

==Name==

The phrase &quot;the Great Game&quot; was used well before the 19th century and was associated with games of risk, such as cards and dice. The French equivalent dates back to at least 1585 and is associated with meanings of risk, chance and deception.

The term &quot;Great Game&quot; was coined in 1840 by a British intelligence officer Captain Arthur Conolly (1807–1842). Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1901 novel &quot;Kim&quot; popularized the term, increasing its association with great power rivalry. It became even more popular after the 1979 advent of the Soviet–Afghan War.

In the historical sense, the term dates from the mid-19th century. Captain Conolly had been appointed as a political officer. A similar term, the &quot;Tournament of Shadows&quot; was reportedly used by Russian diplomat Karl Nesselrode. In July 1840, in correspondence to Major Henry Rawlinson who had been recently appointed as the new political agent in Kandahar, Conolly wrote, &quot;You&#x27;ve a great game, a noble game, before you.&quot; Conolly believed that Rawlinson&#x27;s new post gave him the opportunity to advance humanitarianism in Afghanistan, and summed up his hopes:If the British Government would only play the grand game – help Russia cordially to all that she has a right to expect – shake hands with Persia – get her all possible amends from Oosbegs – force the Bukhara Amir to be just to us, the Afghans, and other Oosbeg states, and his own kingdom – but why go on; you know my, at any rate in &quot;one&quot; sense, &quot;enlarged&quot; views. The expediency, nay the necessity of them will be seen, and we shall play the noble part that the first Christian nation of the world ought to fill. It was introduced into the mainstream by the British novelist Rudyard Kipling in his novel &quot;Kim&quot; (1901). It was first used academically by Professor H.W.C. Davis in a presentation titled &quot;The Great Game in Asia (1800–1844)&quot; on 10 November 1926. The use of the term &quot;The Great Game&quot; to describe Anglo-Russian rivalry in Central Asia became common only after the Second World War.
==First signs of possible India invasion==

At the start of the 19th century, the Indian subcontinent was ruled in part by independent princely states and in part by the company rule of the British East India Company. During the 19th century, a political and diplomatic confrontation developed between Britain and Russia over Afghanistan which would become known as The Great Game. Russia&#x27;s foreign policy was driven by the perspective that Britain would develop and control commercial and military inroads into Central Asia, and Britain&#x27;s foreign policy was based on expectations of Russia adding the &quot;jewel in the crown&quot;, India, to the vast empire that Russia was building in Asia. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires. If Russia were to gain control of the Emirate of Afghanistan, it might then be used as a staging post for a Russian invasion of India, was the British line of thinking.

Napoleon had proposed a joint Franco-Russian invasion of India to tsar Paul I of Russia. Expecting a future action by the British against Russia and her allies in Europe, Paul decided in 1801 to make the first move towards where he believed the British Empire was weakest (Indian March of Paul). He wrote to the Ataman of the Don Cossacks Troops, Cavalry General Vasily Petrovich Orlov, directing him to march to Orenburg, conquer the Central Asian Khanates, and from there invade India. Paul was assassinated in the same year, and the invasion was terminated.

Historian Peter Hopkirk wrote that Tsar Paul had not been able to obtain a detailed map of India until the Cossacks&#x27; departure from Orenburg. He quotes the Tsar as instructing Orlov: &quot;My maps only go as far as Khiva and the River Oxus. Beyond these points it is your affair to gain information about the possessions of the English, and the condition of the native population subject to their rule&quot;. The British public learned about the incident years later, but it firmly imprinted on the popular consciousness, contributing to feelings of mutual suspicion and distrust associated with the Great Game. Hugh Seton-Watson observed that &quot;the grotesque plan had no military significance, but at least showed its author&#x27;s state of mind&quot;. Hopkirk remarked that &quot;no serious thought or study has been given to this wild adventure&quot;.

Napoleon tried to persuade Paul&#x27;s son, Tsar Alexander I of Russia, to invade India; however Alexander resisted. In 1807, Napoleon dispatched General Claude Matthieu, Count Gardane on a French military mission to Persia, with the intention of persuading Russia to invade India. In response, Britain sent its own diplomatic missions in 1808, with military advisers, to Persia and Afghanistan under the capable Mountstuart Elphinstone, averting the possible French and Russian threat to India. However, Britain was left with concerns about being able to defend its colony on the subcontinent. At the time, Russia also went to war with Qajar Iran and invaded the Persian Caucasus from 1804-1813, adding to Britain&#x27;s fears, while Russia was distracted mainly by the Napoleonic Wars.

In 1810, British Lieutenant Henry Pottinger and Captain Charles Christie undertook an expedition from Nushki (Balochistan) to Isfahan (Central Persia) disguised as Muslims. The expedition was funded by the East India Company and was to map and research the regions of &quot;Beloochistan&quot; (Balochistan) and Persia because of concerns about India being invaded by French forces from that direction. After the disastrous French invasion of Russia in 1812 and the collapse of the French army, the threat of a French invasion through Persia was removed.

The shah of Iran, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar would become part of diplomatic intrigues about India. He first received limited British support in 1801 that was canceled after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Persia in 1804. Fath-Ali then lent a promise to Napoleon in 1807 to theoretically invade British India in exchange for French military assistance (Gardane&#x27;s mission) which fell through despite the Treaty of Finckenstein. When France allied with Russia at Tilsit in 1807, as Russia was still invading Iran, Fath-Ali Shah turned toward British diplomacy and alliance in 1809. The shah was also able to use a rivalry between the East India Company and the British Foreign Office, to garner more British aid. In the 1809 preliminary Treaty of Tehran, Persia agreed to stop any European or foreign army passing to India, while the British agreed to send a mission to train sixteen thousand Persian soldiers and, if Qajar Persia was invaded by a European state, pay a £100,000 subsidy to Persia, while attempting to mediate if at peace with Persia&#x27;s enemy. Nevertheless, Russia would end up defeating Iran a few years later, with Britain mediating the treaty.

The Russo-Persian Wars began to coalesce into a point of tension between the British and Russian empires, particularly following the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, which gave the Russian Empire the theoretical right to intervene in Persia at any time, a humiliation of Persia. Fath-Ali Shah sought to counterbalance Russia by increasing the ties between the Qajars and Britain; the British offered military and financial assistance to the shah, supporting Iran as a buffer between Russia and India. The Russian invasion of Iran in 1826-1828 led to a Russian victory, weakening Qajar Iran which retained only minimal influence and power. This fully placed Persia into another colonial contest between Russia and Britain.

The Great Game is said to have begun on 12 January 1830 when Lord Ellenborough, the president of the Board of Control for India tasked Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, to establish a new trade route to Bukhara.

Following the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the Treaty of Adrianople (1829), Britain expected that Persia and the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) would be forced to become protectorates of Russia. This would change Britain&#x27;s perception of the world, and its response was The Great Game. Britain had no intention of getting involved in the Middle East, but it did envision a series of buffer states between the British and Russian Empires that included Turkey, Persia, plus the Khanate of Khiva and the Khanate of Bukhara that would grow from future trade. Behind these buffer states would be their protected states stretching from the Persian Gulf to India and up into the Emirate of Afghanistan, with British sea-power protecting trade sea-lanes. Access to Afghanistan was to be through developing trade routes along the Indus and Sutlej rivers using steam-powered boats, and therefore access through the Sind and Punjab regions would be required. Persia would have to give up its claim on Herat in Afghanistan. Afghanistan would need to be transformed from a group of warring principalities into one state ruled by an ally whose foreign relations would be conducted on his behalf by the Governor-General and the Foreign Office. The Great Game meant closer ties between Britain and the states along her northwest frontier.

Britain believed that it was the world&#x27;s first free society and the most industrially advanced country, and therefore that it had a duty to use its iron, steam power, and cotton goods to take over Central Asia and develop it. British goods were to be followed by British values and the respect for private property. With pay for work and security in place, nomads would settle and become tribal herdsman surrounding oasis cities. These were to develop into modern states with agreed borders, as in the European model. Therefore, lines needed to be agreed and drawn on maps. Morgan says that two proud and expanding empires approached each other, without any agreed frontier, from opposite directions over a &quot;backward, uncivilized and undeveloped region.&quot;Here we are, just as we were, snarling at each other, hating each other, but neither wishing for war. – Lord Palmerston (1835)American historian David Fromkin argues that by the mid-19th century the British had developed at least nine reasons to expect a major war with Russia unless Russian expansion in Asia could be stopped:

# Expansion would upset the balance of power by making Russia too powerful.
# Sooner or later Russia will invade India.
# Russian success would encourage anti-colonial elements in India to revolt.
# It would undermine the old Islamic regimes of central Asia leading to a frantic war among the powers for shares of the spoils.
# It would add power and prestige to the Russian regime that was the great enemy of political freedom.
# The British people hated and feared Russia and demanded a pushing back.
# It could disrupt the established British trade with Asia.
# It would strengthen protectionism and thereby undermine the free trading ideal that Britain was committed to.
# When Russia reached the Indian Ocean it could threaten the naval communications that held the British Empire together.
# By the late 19th century London added the argument that Russian success against the Ottoman Empire would seriously embarrass Britain&#x27;s reputation for diplomatic prowess.
# And finally petroleum deposits in central Asia were discovered in the early 20th century. This oil was essential to the modernization of the Royal Navy, and to build Britain&#x27;s economy.

In the early 1880s Russia failed to float a nine 9 million loan on the European markets for its strategic geopolitical enterprises, driving severe budget cuts by the Minister of Finance. For the construction of the Russo-Indian railway however, an operation supervised by renowned engineer General Mikhail Annenkov, funding had been freely furnished.

The Tsar also entered into agreements about delivery of munition for its fortresses at an estimated value of one million sterling, with German steel magnate Alfred Krupp, being the arms manufacturer for the German Empire.

===Russia&#x27;s perspective===

In 1557, Bokhara and Khiva sent ambassadors to Ivan IV seeking permission to trade in Russia. Russia had an interest in establishing a trade route from Moscow to India. From then until the mid-19th century, Russian ambassadors to the region spent much of their time trying to free Russians who had been taken as slaves by the khanates. Russia would later expand across Siberia to the Far East, where it reached the Pacific port that would become known as Vladivostok by 1859. This eastward expansion was of no concern to the British Foreign Office because this area did not lie across any British trade routes or destinations, and therefore was of no interest to Britain.

Beginning in the 1820s, Russian troops would begin to advance southward from Siberia in search of secure boundaries and reliable neighbors. This advance would not cease until Russia&#x27;s frontiers and her sphere of influence were firm in the Central Asia, and this would include Bokhara and Khiva. Between 1824 and 1854, Russia occupied the entire Kazakh Khanate (modern-day Kazakhstan). This raised Russo-Khivan tensions in addition to Khiva&#x27;s legal discrimination of Russian merchants who were just beginning to penetrate Central Asia, and the ongoing issue of Russian slaves. Russia launched an attack in 1839–1840 but it failed to reach Khiva because of the tough terrain and weather. However, the khan of Khiva feared a further Russian assault and released a number of Russian slaves.

During the 1840s and 1850s, Russia&#x27;s aims in Central Asia were for Bukhara and Khiva to refrain from hostile actions against Russia, cease possession of Russian slaves and the granting of asylum to Kazakhs fleeing from Russian justice. Khiva must cease her attacks on caravans along the Syr Darya. Russian merchants must be allowed to trade on the same terms as native merchants in Bukhara and Khiva. The khanates must guarantee the safety of the persons and property of Russian merchants, levy no excessive duties, permit unhampered transit of goods and caravans across Central Asia into neighboring states and allow Russian commercial agents to reside in Bukhara and Khiva, and free navigation on the Amu Darya river for Russian ships. None of these aims was realised. Russia&#x27;s borders remained insecure and in addition there was growing British influence in the region.

In 1869, when British diplomat Clarendon proposed the Amu Darya river as the basis for a neutral zone between British and Russian spheres of influence, Alexander Gorchakov proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone. Russia feared the influence that a Muslim power with British support might have on the other khanates in the region.

The Russian Empire sought to expand its access to strategic coastlines such as the Black Sea, Persian Gulf, and the Pacific. Russian war plans against British India were developed during the Crimean War, presented to the Tsar in 1854 and 1855. These were the Duhamel plan and Khrulev plan. According to historian Evgeny Sergeev, the Great Game represented a great power competition that did not initiate only with Russia&#x27;s defeat in the Crimean War in 1856, but was already well underway and was only intensified thereafter. Expansion into Central Asia was closely connected with ambitions in India. Historian Alexandre Andreyev argued that the rapid advance of the Russian Empire in Central Asia, while mainly serving to extend the southern frontier, was aimed to keep British eyes off of the January uprising in Poland. Andreyev states that, as late as 1909, strategists of the Russian Empire sought to use Afghanistan to &quot;threaten India... to exert influence on Britain&quot;, quoting Andrei Snesarev. According to diplomatic historian Barbara Jelavich, it was logistically not possible for the Russian Empire to invade India and was not seriously considered, however the Tsars understood that making invasion plans threatening the &quot;jewel&quot; of Britain&#x27;s empire was a way to extract more favorable outcomes in Europe.

Similarly to the British Empire, the Russian Empire saw themselves as a &quot;civilizing power&quot; expanding a purely humanitarian mission among the Turcomans into what they perceived a &quot;semi-barbarous&quot; region, reflecting the ideology of the time.

== Early explorations and accounts ==
=== East India Company ===
In 1782, George Forster, a civil servant of the East India Company, undertook a journey that began in Calcutta, Bengal and passed through Kashmir, Afghanistan, Herat, Khorassan, Mazanderan, crossed the Caspian Sea by ship, and then travelled to Baku, Astrakhan, Moscow, St Petersburg and then by ship to London. Forster&#x27;s detailed description of the journey was published in 1798.

William Moorcroft was an explorer, doctor, veterinary surgeon, and Superintendent of the East India Company&#x27;s horse stud. He had an interest in expanding trade in Central Asia, where he thought the Russian traders were already active. In 1820, Moorcroft, George Trebeck and George Guthrie left India for Bukhara to buy Turkoman horses and reached Bukhara in 1825. However, all three died of fever on the return journey. His travels were published in 1841. Charles Masson, formerly of the East India Company, resided in Baluchistan, Afghanistan and the Punjab between 1826 and 1838 and published his travels. In September 1829, Lieutenant Arthur Conolly of the East India Company travelled from St. Petersburg, Russia to the Caspian desert, to Kir (northern Iran), was detained in Astrabad (northern Iran) as a Russian spy, then travelled with a caravan of pilgrims to Meshed, marched with the Afghan army from there to Herat, then traveled to Kandahar, to Quetta, then across the Indian desert to the British frontier in January 1831. He published his travels in 1834. However, after 1830, Britain&#x27;s commercial and diplomatic interest to the north-west would eventually become formidable. In 1831, Captain Alexander Burnes and Colonel Henry Pottinger&#x27;s surveys of the Indus river would prepare the way for a future assault on the Sind to clear a path towards Central Asia. Burnes embarked on a dangerous 12-month journey beginning in 1831 into Afghanistan and through the Hindu Kush to Bukhara, returning in 1832. Burnes, a Christian travelling through a Muslim country was one of the first to study Afghanistan for British Intelligence and upon his return, he published his book, &quot;Travels To Bukhara&quot;, which became an overnight success in 1834. Between 1832 and 1834, Britain attempted to negotiate trade agreements with Ranjit Singh, ruler of the Sikh empire, and the Amirs of Sindh. However, these attempts were unsuccessful.

====Afghanistan and Central Asia====
In 1835, Lord Auckland was appointed Governor-General, and replaced Bentinck who had pursued a non-intervention policy. The India Board instructed Auckland:to watch more closely than has hitherto been attempted the progress of events in Afghanistan, and to counteract the progress of Russian influence...The mode of dealing with this very important question, whether by dispatching a confidential agent to Dost Mohammed of Kabul merely to watch the progress of events, or to enter into relations with this Chief, either of a political or merely in the first instance of a commercial character, we confide in your discretion as well as the adoption of any other measures that may appear to you desirable to counteract Russian influence in that quarter, should you be satisfied...that the time has arrived at which it would be right for you to interfere decidedly in the affairs of Afghanistan. Such an interference would doubtless be requisite, either to prevent the extension of Persian dominion in that quarter or to raise a timely barrier against the impending encroachments of Russian influence.In that year, Lieutenant John Wood of the Indian Navy commanded the first steamboat to paddle up the Indus River and surveyed the river as he went. In 1838, he led an expedition that found one of the River Oxus&#x27; sources in central Asia. He published his travels in 1872. In 1837, the Russian envoy Captain Jan Vitkevitch visited Kabul, and the British believed that it was to facilitate some form of diplomatic or military presence in Afghanistan. While in Kabul, he dined with the British envoy, Captain Alexander Burnes, who reported negatively on Russia&#x27;s intentions. Russia feared British inroads on their commerce in Central Asia, as well as the influence that a Muslim power with British support might have on the other khanates. In 1837, Russian troops occupied the island of Ashuradeh in the Gorgan Bay of the southern Caspian Sea. However, from 1837 to 1857 the Russian Empire lent their support to the Shah.

In 1838, Colonel Charles Stoddart of the East India Company arrived in the Emirate of Bukhara to arrange an alliance with Nasrullah Khan. Nasrullah Khan had Stoddart imprisoned in a vermin-infested dungeon because he had not bowed nor brought gifts. In 1841, Captain Arthur Conolly arrived to try to secure Stoddart&#x27;s release. He was also imprisoned and on 17 June 1842 both men were beheaded. On hearing of the execution of the two British officers, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia would no longer receive Bukhara&#x27;s gifts or emissaries, and its ambassador was turned back at Orenburg with a message that the Emperor would no longer have anything to do with the Emir of Bukhara. After its two representatives were executed in Bukhara, Britain actively discouraged officers from traveling in Turkestan.

During 1838, there were rumors in London of a coming Russian move towards Khiva. Additionally, Persia intended to annex Herat to make up for territory it had lost in the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), however the allegiance of Herat to Afghanistan was crucial to the British strategy. The Siege of Herat began in November 1837, when the new Shah of Persia, Mohammed Mirza, arrived before Herat. His intention was to take Herat then move on to Kandahar. With him was the Russian Envoy Count Simonich, seconded Russian officers and a regiment of Russian deserters under the Polish general Berowski. Eldred Pottinger, an officer of the Bengal Artillery, who had earlier entered Herat in disguise, stiffened the defences and despite the presence of Russian advisers the siege lasted eight months. Britain threatened to take military action and Persia withdrew in September.

In October 1838, Auckland issued the &quot;Simla Manifesto&quot;, a piece of propaganda designed to blacken the reputation of Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan) and which claimed that Dost Mohammad:openly threatened...to call in every foreign aid that he could command...we could never hope that the tranquility of our neighborhood could be secured...the Governor-General confidently hopes that the Shah will speedily be replaced on his throne...the independence and integrity of Afghanistan restored, the British army will be withdrawn.

== First Anglo-Afghan War ==
British influence was to be extended into Afghanistan and it was to become a buffer state. The intention to invade was clear, and when a copy of the Manifesto reached London there was no objection.

In 1838, the British marched into Afghanistan and deposed Dost Mohammad Khan. After a period of resistance, Dost Mohammad surrendered despite his victories. The British sent him into exile in India and replaced him with the previous ruler, Shah Shuja, who shared their more progressive vision for the people of the region. Shah Shuja ul-Mulk had ascended the throne in 1803 and had signed a mutual defence agreement with the British in 1809 against a possible Franco-Russian invasion of India via Afghanistan. In the same year he was deposed and imprisoned by his half-brother, Mahmud Shah Durrani. There were a number of Amirs of Afghanistan until Dost Mohammad Khan gained power in 1826. Shah Shuja was not popular with the Afghans and tensions grew, leading to the killing of the British envoy, Captain Alexander Burnes, in 1841. By January 1842, the Afghans were in full revolt. With a weakening of military discipline, the British decided to withdraw from Kabul. The Kabul garrison of 4,500 troops and 12,000 camp followers left Kabul for Jalalabad that was 80 miles and 5 days march away. They were attacked by 30,000 Afghans. Six British officers escaped on horseback but only one, the wounded Dr William Brydon riding on a wounded horse, made it to Jalalabad. Over one hundred of the British and 2,000 sepoys and camp followers were taken hostage and the rest killed. So perished the &quot;Army of the Indus&quot;. In April, a punitive expedition was dispatched and recaptured Kabul and freed the captives in September. The new Governor-General, Lord Ellenborough, decided to withdraw all British garrisons from Afghanistan and Dost Mohammad Khan was freed in India to return to the throne. Dost Mohammad is reported to have said:I have been struck by the magnitude of your resources, your ships, your arsenals, but what I cannot understand is why the rulers of so vast and flourishing an empire should have gone across the Indus to deprive me of my poor and barren country.

=== Khiva (1839) ===
In 1839, acting Captain James Abbott of the Bengal Artillery undertook a mission to the Khanate of Khiva in an attempt to negotiate the release of Russian slaves that would deny the Russians a pretext for invading Khiva. If war had already broken out, Abbot was instructed to attempt to negotiate a settlement. The attempted Russian assault on Khiva may have been in response to Britain&#x27;s &quot;forward policy&quot; on Afghanistan, however it failed to reach Khiva due to the severe winter conditions. Of the 5,000 men who had left Orenburg, only 4,000 returned. Abbott was hampered by a lack of understanding of Khivan language and culture, and the attempt to release Russian slaves was unsuccessful. He did agree with the Khivan ruler, Allah Quli Khan, to establishing a British agent to Khiva and to mediate between Khiva and Russia. Abbott set off from Khiva in 1840 towards Russia to commence negotiations, which he did on his own initiative and it was not authorised by his superiors. His caravan was attacked by Khazakhs and he was wounded in the hand and taken hostage, however he and his party were released because they feared retribution. He reached Saint Petersburg but the attempt at mediation failed. His bravery was recognized through promotion to full Captain. In the same year, Lieutenant Richmond Shakespear of the Bengal Artillery was successful in negotiating the release of 416 Russian captives, whom he escorted into Russia. He was knighted for this undertaking.

== Anglo-Sikh Wars ==

In 1843, Britain annexed the Sind. The First Anglo-Sikh War was fought between the Sikh Empire and the East India Company in 1845–1846, resulting in the partial subjugation of the Sikh kingdom. The Second Anglo-Sikh War was fought in 1848–1849, resulting in subjugation of the remainder of the Sikh Empire, and the annexation of the Punjab Province and what subsequently became the North-West Frontier Province.

== Anglo-Persian War ==


In 1856, Persia commenced an assault on Herat and the British Home Government declared war on Persia. The Anglo-Persian War was conducted under Major General Sir James Outram until 1857, when Persia and Britain both withdrew and Persia signed a treaty renouncing its claim on Herat.

== Further expansion ==

=== Under the British Crown ===
Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the East India Company&#x27;s remaining powers were transferred to the British Crown in the person of Queen Victoria (who in 1876 was proclaimed Empress of India). As a state, the British Raj functioned as the guardian of a system of connected markets maintained by military power, business legislation and monetary management. The Government of India Act 1858 saw the India Office of the British government assume the administration of British India through a Viceroy appointed by the Crown.

In 1863 Sultan Ahmad Khan of Herat, who was placed into power by Persia and issued coinage on behalf of the Shah, attacked the disputed town of Farrah. Farrah had been under Dost Mohammad Khan&#x27;s control since 1856, and he responded by sending his army to defeat Herat and reunited it with Afghanistan.

=== Under Alexander II of Russia ===

The Crimean War had ended in 1856 with Russia&#x27;s defeat by an alliance of Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire. The new and wary Alexander II of Russia waited some years so as not to antagonize the British, then Russia expanded into Central Asia in two campaigns. In 1864, a circular was sent to the consular officers abroad by Gorchakov, the Russian Chancellor, patiently explaining the reasons for expansion centering on the doctrines of necessity, power and spread of civilisation. Gorchakov went to great lengths to explain that Russia&#x27;s intentions were meant not to antagonize the British but to bring civilised behavior and protect the traditional trade routes through the region. The first campaign started from Orenburg and proceeded in the direction of Kabul in Afghanistan. Russia occupied Chimkent in 1864, Tashkent in 1865, Khokhand and Bukhara in 1866, and Samarkand in 1868. Russia&#x27;s influence now extended to outlying regions of Afghan Turkestan. The second campaign started from the Caspian Sea and was in the direction of Herat, near the Persian frontier. Khiva was occupied in 1873. Russian forces also seized Krasnovodsk (now in Turkmenistan) in 1869. Notable Russian generals included Konstantin Kaufman, Mikhail Skobelev, and Mikhail Chernyayev.

From 1869 to 1872, Mir Mahmud Shar was able to gain control of the Khanate of Badakhshan with the help of Afghanistan&#x27;s new ruler, Amir Sher Ali Khan, and by 1873 Afghanistan governed Badakhshan.

== Tibet and Inner Asia ==

British-Russian competition also existed in Tibet and &quot;Inner Asia&quot;. Strategists of the Russian Empire sought to create a springboard to surround the Qing dynasty in Inner Asia as well as a second front against British India from the northeast direction.

Britain had been exploring territories north of India by recruiting &quot;Pundits&quot;, native Indian explorers, among them Nain Singh, who reached Lhasa, Tibet, in 1866. He and his cousin Kishen Singh continued to travel around Tibet and surrounding regions for many years. The publications of the Royal Geographical Society in 1869 made the arrival of British Pundits at Lhasa known in Russia. The Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky felt there was a British threat to Russian ambitions in Inner Asia, and set out on a series of 1870s expeditions. Although he failed to reach Tibet&#x27;s capital at Lhasa, he travelled extensively in Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Przhevalsky&#x27;s expeditions became famous and increased interest in European expansion into Asia among the Russian press, aristocracy and academia. In the 1880s, Przhevalsky advocated for the &quot;forcible annexation of western China, Mongolia, and Tibet, and their colonization by Cossacks&quot;, although the plan received some pushback from Tsar Alexander III who favoured influence rather than an invasion.

Historian argues that Tibet was a major territorial focus of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, and was connected to the Great Game. Andreyev mentions that in 1893, Tsar Alexander III financed an adventurist project by a Tibetan medicine practitioner, Piotr Aleksandrovich Badmaev, which aimed to annex Mongolia, Tibet, and China to the Russian Empire. Although not very successful, various agents were sent out to conduct espionage in Tibet in regards to British influence, investigate trade and attempted to foment rebellion in Mongolia against the Qing dynasty. In the late 19th century, Britain strategically supported the Qing Dynasty&#x27;s protectorates against the Russian Empire. According to Andreyev, &quot;in the days of the Great Game, Mongolia was an object of imperialist encroachment by Russia, as Tibet was for the British.&quot;&quot;

Britain feared increased Russian influence in Tibet, due to contacts between the Russia-born Buryat Agvan Dorzhiev and the 13th Dalai Lama. Agvan Dorzhiev claimed that Russia was a powerful Buddhist country that would ally with Tibet against China or Britain. In response, Britain sought to increase its own influence in Tibet as a buffer for British India. British forces, led by Sir Francis Younghusband, invaded the country with the Curzon expedition in 1904 and made a treaty with the Tibetans, the 1904 Lhasa Convention.

According to Robert Irwin, who considers a smaller, espionage-focused interpretation of the Great Game, Tibet was indeed connected to the Great Game, but &quot;the truth is that, in the period concerned, British ruling circles didn&#x27;t own so much as a sweetshop in Tibet.&quot; Specifically, he notes that the commercial trade that followed the Younghusband expedition was negligible compared to the cost of the expedition.

Pradip Phanjoubam states that the Anglo-Russian rivalry in Tibet ultimately had implications for Northeast India as well, culminating in the Simla Convention. Phanjoubam argues that Britain overreacted to Russian interest in Tibet, if perhaps understandably due to the presence of Dorzhiev. A constantly shifting British policy on China from pro- to anti-Qing protectorates by Britain, as well as the shift from opposition to Russia to the 1907 Convention, led the Qing Dynasty to decide on a forward policy in the Himalayas. If it were not for the Xinhai Revolution, India would have been more threatened than it was. Nonetheless, &quot;On the chessboard of the Great Game in far off places as Mongolia, Afghanistan and Persia was thus determined the fate of British Tibet policy, and therefore, the shadow of the Great Game too came to fall on the future of India&#x27;s Northeast.&quot;

In its Meiji period, the Empire of Japan would observe the Great Game and participate indirectly through diplomacy and espionage. For example, Japan hosted Abdurreshid Ibrahim, a pan-Muslim opponent of Russian and British expansion. Japanese interest in the region as well as enmity with Russia led to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and an attempted Ottoman-Japanese alliance. Nishi Tokujirō made some of Japan&#x27;s first official diplomatic interactions in Central Asia and observed Russian colonial policy during the early Meiji period, while during the end of the period, Colonel Fukushima Yasumasa managed Japan&#x27;s Central Asia policy during its contest with Russia. Later, the Russo-Japanese War also changed and weakened Russian designs in Xinjiang. According to researcher Jin Noda, Japanese intelligence activities occurred &quot;against a backdrop of acute Russian and British interest in the geopolitical fate of Xinjiang, Tibet, and Russian Turkestan&quot;.

Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim also acted as a tsarist agent during the Great Game, leading an expedition through Tibet, Xinjiang, and Gansu on the way to Beijing. The Russian General Staff wanted on-the-ground intelligence about reforms and activities by the Qing dynasty, as well as the military feasibility of invading Western China: a possible move in their struggle with Britain for control of inner Asia. In a report to the Russian General Staff, Mannerheim also argued in favor of a Russian invasion of Xinjiang. Disguised as an ethnographic collector, Mannerheim joined the French archeologist Paul Pelliot&#x27;s expedition at Samarkand in modern Uzbekistan. They started from the terminus of the Trans-Caspian Railway in Andijan in July 1906, but Mannerheim quarreled with Pelliot, so he made the greater part of the expedition on his own. Mannerheim met the 13th Dalai Lama of Tibet and acted as an envoy of Russia.

== Persia ==

Various authors connect British-Russian competition in Iran to the Great Game as well. This competition continued until the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 after which the British and Russian Empires largely moved together in their overtures for imperial influence in the region until the Bolshevik Revolution.

The Great Game in Iran took the form of military conquests, diplomatic intrigues, and the competition of trade goods. Russian colonists arrived in northern Iran, settling the region around Astarabad. Although Britain had a reputation for industrialization and international trade boosted by its colony of India, Russian authors saw the Russian Empire as competing directly with Britain for trade in Iran and other bordering markets. Russian travelogues written between the 1870s and the turn of the 1900s seem to imply that Russian commerce had become dominant in the northern and western portions of Iran that would be officially delineated to Russia by Britain in 1907. Russia had also acquired concessions such as a monopoly on the lucrative caviar in the southern Caspian Sea, which lasted until after the First World War.

After the 1828 Treaty of Turkmanchay, Russia received territorial domination in Iran. With the Romanovs shifting to a policy of &#x27;informal support&#x27; for the weakened Qajar dynasty—continuing to place pressure with advances in the largely nomadic Turkestan, a crucial frontier territory of the Qajars – this Russian domination of Persia continued for nearly a century. The Persian monarchy became more of a symbolic concept in which Russian diplomats were themselves powerbrokers in Iran and the monarchy was dependent on British and Russian loans for funds. In 1879, the establishment of the Cossack Brigade by Russian officers gave the Russian Empire influence over the modernization of the Qajar army. This influence was especially pronounced because the Persian monarchy&#x27;s legitimacy was predicated on an image of military prowess, first Turkic and then European-influenced. By the 1890s, Russian tutors, doctors and officers were prominent at the Shah&#x27;s court, influencing policy personally. Russia and Britain had competing investments in the industrialisation of Iran including roads and telegraph lines, as a way to profit and extend their influence. However, until 1907 the Great Game rivalry was so pronounced that mutual British and Russian demands to the Shah to exclude the other, blocked all railroad construction at the end of the 19th century. In 1907 the British and Russian Empires came to a mutual agreement, which provided a zone of influence in southeastern Iran to Britain and northern Iran to Russia.

Tsar Nicholas II would be a staunch supporter of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar against the revolutionaries, in a large scale intervention that involved both regular Russian troops and the Persian Cossacks. Failing to fully suppress the Persian Constitutional Revolution or keep Muhammad Ali Shah in power, the constitutional reforms were put in place against Russia&#x27;s wishes, though the Cossack Brigade remained a major factor. An Iranian former Cossack, Reza Shah, would establish the Pahlavi dynasty.

== Second Anglo-Afghan War ==

In 1878, Russia sent troops on an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, tried unsuccessfully to keep them from entering Afghanistan, the Russians arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878. As a reaction, on 14 August the British demanded that Sher Ali also accept a British mission. The Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under Neville Bowles Chamberlain but also threatened to stop it if it attempted to enter his country. Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of British India, ordered an envoy to set out on a diplomatic mission for Kabul in September 1878. The mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo–Afghan War. In November 1878, 40,000 men led by the British Raj, invaded Afghanistan from British India. Warfare had been settled for a while through diplomatic negotiations in 1879, in 1880 however the fighting was reignited after a British envoy on a mission to Kabul was massacred.

==Diplomacy==

===Agreement Between Great Britain and Russia 1873===
On 21 January 1873, Great Britain and Russia signed an agreement that stipulated that the eastern Badakhshan area as well as the Wakhan Corridor to Lake Sariqol were Afghan territory, the northern Afghan boundary was the Amu Darya (Oxus River) as far west as Khwaja Salar (near Khamyab), and a joint Russian-British commission would define the boundary from the Amu Darya to the Persian border on the Hari (Harirud) River. However, no boundary west of the Amu Darya was defined until 1885. The agreement was regarded as having defined the British and Russian spheres of influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia, gave the two sides the legitimacy to advance within their designated zones, created cordial relations between the two rival European powers, and raised the new problem of defining what were the frontiers of Afghanistan, Russia and China in the upper Oxus region in the Pamir mountains. The agreement was negotiated by Russian diplomat Prince Alexander Gorchakov, the lands of Badakhshan and Wakhan were accepted by Russia as part of Afghanistan, Russia accepted all of Britain&#x27;s proposals on Afghanistan&#x27;s northern borders and expected that Britain would keep Afghanistan from committing any aggression. However, this set in motion Russia&#x27;s annexation of the Khanate of Khiva in the same year. Badakhshan would later be divided between Afghanistan and Russian-controlled Bukhara by the Pamir Boundary Commission in 1895.

=== Treaty of Gandamak, 1879 ===
After the British Siege of Kabul, warfare was settled diplomatically by the Treaty of Gandamak of 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission to Kabul, but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited. The second phase ended in September 1880 when the British defeated Ayub Khan outside Kandahar. A new Emir, Abdul Rahman Khan who was known to be a Russian ally and an opponent of the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain most of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire. The British were aware that Amir Abdur Rahman Khan had the support of the Afghans to continue fighting and he did not allow a British resident to stay in Kabul which was a British objective that caused the start of the conflict. In return, he accepted British control of Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign policies while maintaining internal sovereignty and to cede to the British a number of its southern frontier areas, including the districts of Pishin, Sibi, Harnai, and Thal Chotiali.

In 1881, Russian forces however took Geok Tepe and in 1884 they occupied Merv. As the Russian forces were close to Herat, the British and Russian governments formed a joint Anglo-Russian diplomatic Afghan Boundary Commission in the same year to define the borders between the Russian Empire and northern Afghanistan.

In 1885, a Russian force annexed the Panjdeh district north of Herat province and its fort in what has been called the Panjdeh incident. The Afghans claimed that the people of the district had always paid tribute to Afghanistan, and the Russians argued that this district was part of the Khanates of Khiva and Merv which they had annexed earlier. The Afghan Boundary Commission was supposed to have settled the dispute, however the battle occurred before its arrival. The Afghan force of 500 was overwhelmed by superior Russian numbers. Britain did not aid Afghanistan as was required by the Treaty of Gandamak, leading the Amir to conclude that he could not rely on the British in the face of Russian aggression.

German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck saw how important the Great Game had become for Russia and Britain. Germany had no direct stakes, however its dominance of Europe was enhanced when Russian troops were based as far away from Germany as possible. Over two decades, 1871–1890, he maneuvered to help the British, hoping to force the Russians to commit more soldiers to Asia. However, Bismarck through the Three Emperors&#x27; League also aided Russia, by pressuring the Ottoman Empire to block the Bosporus from British naval access, compelling an Anglo-Russian negotiation regarding Afghanistan.

===Protocol Between Great Britain and Russia 1885===


On 10 September 1885, the Delimitation Protocol Between Great Britain and Russia was signed in London. The protocol defined the boundary from the Oxus to the Harirud and was later followed by 19 additional protocols providing further detail between 1885 and 1888. The Afghan Boundary Commission agreed that Russia would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance, but retain Panjdeh. The agreement delineated a permanent northern Afghan frontier at the Amu Darya, with the loss of a large amount of territory, especially around Panjdeh.

This left the border east of Lake Zorkul in the Wakhan region to be defined. This territory was claimed by China, Russia and Afghanistan. In the 1880s, the Afghans had advanced north of the lake to the Alichur Pamir. In 1891, Russia sent a military force to this area and its commander, Yanov, ordered the British Captain Francis Younghusband to leave Bozai Gumbaz in the Little Pamir. The Russians claimed that because they had annexed the Khanate of Kokand they had a claim over the Pamirs. Afghanistan claimed that the region never paid tribute to Kokand and was independent, so having annexed it the region was theirs. The British claimed that this was a breach of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1873. Unfortunately for Britain, the Indian government pointed out that Bozai Gumbaz was not included in the Agreement and so it was in an undefined zone. Bozai Gumbaz had not appeared on the Russian map as being in Wakhan. Additionally, the British became aware that Younghusband had mistakenly entered Russian territory near Kara Kul and could have been arrested by the administrator there. Yanov offered a verbal apology if he had mistakenly entered the Wakhan territory, and the Russian government proposed a joint survey to agree on a border.

In 1892, the British sent Charles Murray, 7th Earl of Dunmore to the Pamirs to investigate. Britain was concerned that Russia would take advantage of Chinese weakness in policing the area to gain territory. Murray was engaged in some form of diplomacy or espionage but the matter is not clear, and in 1893 reached agreement with Russia to demarcate the rest of the border, a process completed in 1895.

===Agreement Between Great Britain and Afghanistan 1893===
On 12 November 1893, the Agreement Between Great Britain and Afghanistan was signed in Kabul. The Agreement reconfirmed the 1873 Agreement, required Afghanistan to withdraw from the territory north of the Amu Darya that it had occupied in 1884, and called for delimitation of the boundary east of Lake Sari.

When Mortimer Durand, Secretary for State of India was appointed administrator of the Gilgit Agency (now part of the Gilgit-Baltistan of Pakistan), he opened up the region by building roads, telegraph, and mail systems while maintaining a dialogue with the Mir of Gilgit. He intended to improve the road from Kashmir through the princely states of Hunza and Nagar and up to the frontier with Russia. The Mirs of Nagar and Hunza saw this as a threat to their natural advantage of remoteness. In 1890, Durand reinforced Chalt Fort that was near the border due to the rumor that Nagar and Hunza fighters were about to attack it, and continued redeveloping the road up to the fort. In May 1891, Nagar and Hunza sent a warning to Durand not to continue work on the road to the fort and to vacate the fort, which was on the Gilgit side of the border, else they would regard it as an act of war. Durand reinforced the fort and accelerated the road construction to it, causing Nagar and Hunza to see this as an escalation and so they stopped mail from the British Resident in Chinese Turkmenistan through their territory. British India regarded this as a breach of their 1889 agreement with Hunza, and after an ultimatum was issued and ignored they initiated the Anglo-Brusho Campaign of 1891. Hunza and Nagar came under a British protectorate in 1893.

===Exchange of Notes Between Great Britain and Russia 1895===
On 11 March 1895, there was an Exchange of Notes Between Great Britain and Russia. The notes defined British and Russian spheres of influence east of Lake Sari-Qul by defining the northern boundary of the Wakhan Corridor east of the lake. This boundary was subsequently demarcated by a mixed commission. The Great Game is proposed to have ended on 10 September 1895 with the signing of the Pamir Boundary Commission protocols, when the border between Afghanistan and the Russian empire was defined. The Pamir Boundary Commission was conducted by Major-General Gerard who met with a Russian deputation under General Povalo-Shveikovsky in the remote Pamir region in 1895, who were charged with demarcating the boundary between Russian and British spheres of interest from Lake Victoria eastwards to the Chinese border. The report of the Commission proved the absolute impracticality of any Russian invasion of India through the Pamir mountains. The result was that Afghanistan became a buffer state between the two powers.

It was agreed that the Amu Darya river would form the border between Afghanistan and the Russian Empire. The agreements also resulted in the Russian Empire losing control of most Afghan territory it conquered, with the exception of Panjdeh. The Pamir Mountains were demarcated as a border line between the Russian Empire and Afghanistan as well. The Taghdumbash would be the subject of a later Afghan-China agreement. To conclude their agreement, one peak was named Mount Concord. In exchange for a British agreement to use the term &quot;Nicholas Range&quot; in honor of the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia on official maps, the Russians agreed to refer to Lake Zorkul as &quot;Lake Victoria&quot; in honour of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

The Russians had gained all of the lands north of the Amu Darya which included the land claimed by the Khanate of Khiva, including the approaches to Herat, and all of the land claimed by the Khanate of Khoqand, including the Pamir plateau. To ensure a complete separation, this new Afghan state was given an odd eastern appendage known as the Wakhan Corridor. &quot;In setting these boundaries, the final act of the tense game played out by the British and Russian governments came to a close.&quot;

=== Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 ===

In the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, the Russian Empire and British Empire officially ended their rivalry to focus on opposing the German Empire. In the Convention of 1907, Russia recognized Afghanistan and southern Iran as part of the British sphere of influence, while Britain recognized Central Asia and northern Iran as part of the Russian sphere of influence. Both parties recognized Tibet as a neutral territory, except Russia had special privileges in negotiating with the Dalai Lama, and Britain had special privileges in Tibetan commercial deals.

For a time, the British and Russian Empires moved together against potential German entrance into the Great Game, and against a constitutional movement in Iran that threatened to dispel the two-way sphere of influence. Russia had earlier established the Persian Cossack Brigade in 1879, a force which was led by Russian officers and served as a vehicle for Russian influence in Iran.

In 1908, the Persian Constitutional Revolution sought to establish a Western-oriented, democratic civil society in Iran, with an elected Majilis, a relatively free press and other reforms. Seeking to resolve financial problems of the Qajar dynasty such as heavy debts to Imperial Russia and Britain, the Majilis recruited the American financial expert, Morgan Schuster, who later wrote the book &quot;The Strangling of Persia&quot; condemning Britain and Russia.

The Russian Empire intervened in the Persian Constitutional Revolution to support the Shah and abolish the constitution. The Cossacks bombarded the Majilis in June 1908 and occupied Tehran. Additional brigades of the Russian Army were also deployed to assist the Shah and occupied Tabriz after April 1909. Nonetheless, the constitutionalists were able to retake the capital and were initially victorious with the Triumph of Tehran in July 1909, and dispelled Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar, who was exiled and took refuge with the Russians. When a new ruler, Ahmad Shah Qajar, took power he found it difficult to completely reverse the constitutional reforms, yet the Qajar state was weakened by the upheaval and the Qajar court dependent on foreign powers. Meanwhile, Britain and Russia aligned to oust Shuster from Iran by an ultimatum in 1911 which was unanimously rejected by the Majilis. British and Russian officials coordinated as the Russian army, still present in Persia, invaded the capital again and suspended the parliament. The Tsar ordered the troops in Tabriz &quot;to act harshly and quickly&quot;, while purges were ordered, leading to many executions of prominent revolutionaries. The British Ambassador, George Head Barclay reportedly disapproved of this &quot;reign of terror&quot;, though would soon pressure Persian ministers to officialize the Anglo-Russian partition of Iran. By June 1914, Russia established near-total control over its northern zone, while Britain had established influence over Baluch and Bakhtiari autonomous tribal leaders in the southeastern zone. Qajar Iran would become a battleground between Russian, Ottoman, and British forces in the Persian campaign of World War I.
== Historiographical dating ==

Historians do not agree on dating the beginning or end of the Great Game. Konstantin Penzev believes that the Great Game commenced with Russia&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Persian War (1804–13) and the signing of the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 or the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. Edward Ingram believes that it began between 1832 and 1834 as an attempt to negotiate trade deals with Ranjit Singh and the Amirs of Sind. Hopkirk views &quot;unofficial&quot; British support for Circassian anti-Russian fighters in the Caucasus ( 1836 – involving David Urquhart and (for example) the &quot;Vixen&quot; affair – in the context of the Great Game. Sergeev believes that the Great Game started in the aftermath of the Caucasus War (1828–59) and intensified with the Crimean War (1853–56). Edward Ingram proposes that The Great Game was over at the end of the First Anglo-Afghanistan war in 1842 with the British withdrawal from Afghanistan.

British fears ended in 1907 and the Great Game came to a close in 1907 when Britain and Russia became military allies (with France). They made three Anglo-Russian agreements which delineated spheres of interest between British India and Russian Central Asia in the borderland areas of Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet. However historian Elena Andreeva sets the endpoint with the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and the temporary end of Russia&#x27;s interest in Persia. Konstantin Penzev has stated, echoing Kipling&#x27;s fictional summary (&quot;When everyone is dead, the Great Game is finished. Not before.&quot;), that unofficially the Great Game in Central Asia will never end.

=== Soviet Great Game ===
According to German historian David X. Noack, the Great Game resumed from 1919 to 1933 as a conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union, with the Weimar Republic and Japan as additional players. Noack calls it a &quot;Second Tournament of Shadows&quot; over the territory composing the border of British India, China, the Soviet Union and Japanese Manchuria. To Britain, the Germans initially appeared to be a secret Soviet ally. In 1933–1934 it &quot;ended with Mongolia, Soviet Central Asia, Tannu-Tuva and Xinjiang isolated from non-Soviet influence.&quot; Authors Andrei Znamenski and Alexandre Andreyev also describe the continuation of elements of the Great Game by the Soviet Union until the 1930s, focused on secret diplomacy and espionage in Tibet and Mongolia.

==Historiographical interpretations of the Great Game==

===Allegation that &quot;Britain had lost the Great Game by 1842&quot;===
Edward Ingram proposes that Britain lost the Great Game. &quot;The Great Game was an aspect of British history rather than international relations: the phrase describes what the British were doing, not the actions of Russians and Chinese.&quot; The Great Game was an attempt made in the 1830s by the British to impose their view on the world. If Khiva and Bukhara were to become buffer states, then trade routes to Afghanistan, as a protectorate, along the Indus and Sutlej rivers would be necessary and therefore access through the Sind and Punjab regions would be required. The Great Game began between 1832 and 1834 as an attempt to negotiate trade deals with Ranjit Singh and the Amirs of Sind, and the &quot;first interruption of this magnificent British daydream was caused by the determination of the Amirs of Sind to be left alone.&quot; Its failure occurred at the end of the First Anglo-Afghanistan war in 1842 with the British withdrawal from Afghanistan. The failure to turn Afghanistan into a client state meant that The Great Game could not be won.

Nonetheless, Britain would win a decisive victory in the Second Anglo-Afghan War which occurred between 1878 and 1880. The victory also strengthened Britain&#x27;s influence in Afghanistan, which had become a British protectorate.

In 1889, Lord Curzon, who later became Viceroy of India (1899-1905), wrote a book on the strategic balance between the Russian and British Empires, as well as his travels on the Trans-Caspian railway.

In that book, &quot;Russia in Central Asia in 1889 &amp; the Anglo-Russian Question&quot;, he commented:

Our relations with Afghanistan in the forty years between 1838 and 1878 were successively those of blundering interference and of unmasterly inactivity.However, he also portrayed the great game as a then-ongoing and future event in 1889, stating:...the Transcaspian conquests of the Czar have brought about, and the seal upon which has been set by the completion of the new railway. The power of menace, which the ability to take Herat involves, has passed from English to Russian hands; the Russian seizure of Herat is now a matter not so much of war as of time; and that the Russians will thus, without an effort, win the first hand in the great game that is destined to be played for the empire of the East.Russia remained a focus for Curzon through and after his time as Viceroy of India.

===&quot;The British colluded with the Russians over Central Asia&quot;===
In the 1850s, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels accused MP and PM Lord Palmerston of colluding with Russia during the Crimean War. At the time, Marx alleged that Palmerston weakened Britain&#x27;s defense of the Ottoman Empire. Although this view was not otherwise widespread, the same accusation was levied by David Urquhart (1805-1877).

Mail communications between London and Calcutta could take as long as three months either way. Long-distance telegraph lines were built across Russia in the 1850s. In 1870, the Indo-European Telegraph Line was completed and it provided a communication link between London and Calcutta after passing through Russia. For the first time, the India Office within the British Foreign Office could telegraph its orders and have them acted on in a timely manner. The Government in Westminster now had complete control over foreign policy in India and the Governor-General of India lost the discretion that he once enjoyed.

In 1868, Russia moved against Bukhara and occupied Samarkand. Prince Gorchakov wrote in the &quot;Gorchakov Memorandum of 1874&quot; that the Russian Ambassador to Britain offered an explanation that satisfied Clarendon, the British Foreign Secretary. Clarendon replied that the rapid advance of Russian troops neither alarmed nor surprised the British Government, however it did the British public and the Indian Government. Clarendon proposed a neutral zone between Britain and Russia in the region, a view that was shared by the Russian Government. This led to a confidential meeting in Wiesbaden between Clarendon and Count Brunow, the Russian Imperial Secretary.

After the signing of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1873 that was followed by Russia&#x27;s occupation of Khiva, Gorchakov wrote in the &quot;Gorchakov Memorandum of 1874&quot; that &quot;Although ... the Khanate of Khiva remained entirely in our sphere of action, we thought we would make an act of courtesy of not adopting any decisive measure against Khiva before having informed Britain of it.&quot; In November 1874, Lord Augustus Loftus, British ambassador to Russia called on Russia&#x27;s V. Westmann, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and told him that &quot;The advance of Russia in Central Asia of late years was a subject of watchful interest, although it was not one of either jealousy or fear to the Government of India.&quot;

In December 1874, long before Russia annexed Merv in 1884, Northbrook, the Viceroy of India, wrote to Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, that he accepted an eventual Russian annexation of Merv. In the following year he wrote to Rawlinson, a member of the Council of India, &quot;Our engagement with Russia with respect to the frontier of Afghanistan precludes us from promoting the incorporation of the Turkomans of Merv in the territories subject to the Ameer of Kabul&quot;. Northbrook would not accept any extension of Persia towards Merv. It has been proposed that from Sher Ali&#x27;s (Afghanistan&#x27;s) point of view, prior to the invasion of Afghanistan by Britain in the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878, that there was evidence of the beginnings of a growing understanding between Britain and Russia to divide Central Asia between themselves.

Britain and Russia officially ended their dispute with the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, and afterward cooperated to enforce its provisions on Qajar Iran, while covert rivalry continued.

== Effect of the Great Game on contemporary political boundaries ==

=== On India ===
Narendra Singh Sarila, aide-de-camp to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, in 1948 describes in his book &quot;The Shadow of the Great Game&quot; that based on his research in The Oriental and India Collection of British Library that the partition of India was partially connected to the Great Game between Britain and the USSR. He stated the following in his book:Once the British realized that the Indian nationalists who would rule India after its independence would deny them military cooperation under a British Commonwealth defence umbrella, they settled for those willing to do so by using religion for the purpose. Their problem could be solved if Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League Party, would succeed in his plan to detach the northwest of India abutting Iran, Afghanistan and Sinkiang and establish a separate state there – Pakistan.

Lawyer and mediator in Supreme Court of India, Aman M. Hingorani in his book &quot;Unravelling the Kashmir Knot&quot; that Winston Churchill directed War Cabinet to assess &#x27;the long-term policy required to safeguard the strategic interests of the British Empire in India and the Indian Ocean&#x27;, the report in respect of which was submitted on 19 May 1945. He states in the book:The report emphasized that &#x27;Britain must retain its military connection with the subcontinent so as to ward off the Soviet Union&#x27;s threat to the area&#x27;, citing four reasons for the &#x27;strategic importance of India to Britain&#x27;—India&#x27;s &#x27;value as a base from which forces could be suitably deployed within the Indian Ocean area, in the Middle East and the Far East&#x27;; it serving as &#x27;a transit point for air and sea communications&#x27;; it being &#x27;a large reserve of manpower of good fighting quality&#x27;; and the strategic importance of the northwest region to threaten the Soviet Union.

== The Great Game as a legend ==

=== Mythologized aspects of the Great Game ===
A. Vescovi argued that Kipling&#x27;s use of the term was entirely fictional, &quot;...because the Great Game as it is described in the novel never existed; it is almost entirely Kipling&#x27;s invention. At the time when the story is set (i.e. in the late Eighties), Britain did not have an intelligence service, nor an Ethnographical Department; there was only a governmental task force called &#x27;Survey of India&#x27; that was entrusted with the task of charting all India in response to a typically English anxiety of control.&quot;

According to military history scholar Matt Salyer, the &quot;Great Game&quot; as a British strategy was a fiction, but the &quot;Great Game&quot; as a vague descriptor of various actions of multiple empires, &quot;as far back as the Seven Years&#x27; War&quot; is accurate. He writes that &quot;the &#x27;legend of the Great Game&#x27; emerged as a distinct historiographical lens after the Second World War.&quot; However, he says, &quot;That does not mean that historians who describe trajectories of British Imperial statecraft in terms of &#x27;the Great Game&#x27; are wrong.&quot;

Two authors, Gerald Morgan and Malcolm Yapp, have proposed that The Great Game was a legend and that the British Raj did not have the capacity to conduct such an undertaking. An examination of the archives of the various departments of the Raj showed no evidence of a British intelligence network in Central Asia. At best, efforts to obtain information on Russian moves in Central Asia were rare, &quot;ad hoc&quot; adventures and at worst intrigues resembling the adventures in &quot;Kim&quot; were baseless rumours, and that such rumours &quot;were always common currency in Central Asia and they applied as much to Russia as to Britain&quot;. After two British representatives were executed in Bukhara in 1842, Britain actively discouraged officers from traveling in Turkestan.

Gerald Morgan also proposed that Russia never had the will nor ability to move on India, nor India the capability to move on Central Asia. Russia did not want Afghanistan, considering their initial failure to take Khiva and the British debacle in the First Anglo-Afghan War. To invade Afghanistan they would first require a forward base in Khorasan, Persia. St. Petersburg had decided by then that a forward policy in the region had failed but one of non-intervention appeared to work.

Sneh Manajan wrote that the Russian military advances in Central Asia were advocated and executed only by irresponsible Russians or enthusiastic governors of the frontier provinces. Robert Middleton suggested that The Great Game was all a figment of the over-excited imaginations of a few jingoist politicians, military officers and journalists on both sides. The use of the term The Great Game to describe Anglo-Russian rivalry in Central Asia became common only after the Second World War. It was rarely used before that period. Malcolm Yapp proposed that some Britons had used the term &quot;The Great Game&quot; in the late 19th century to describe several different things in relation to its interests in Asia, but the primary concern of British authorities in India was the control of the indigenous population and not preventing a Russian invasion.

Robert Irwin argues the Great Game was certainly perceived by both British and Russian adventurers at the time, but was played up by more expansionist factions for power politics in Europe. Irwin states that &quot;Prince Ukhtomsky might rail against the corrupting effects of British rule over India and declare that there could be no frontiers for the Russians in Asia, but Russian policy was usually decided by saner heads. Canny statesmen such as Witte sanctioned the despatch of diplomatic missions, explorers and spies into Afghanistan and Tibet, but they did so to extort concessions from the British in Europe. Whitehall, on the other hand, was reluctant to have its foreign policy in Europe dictated to by the Raj.&quot;

According to historian Patrikeeff, the concept of the Great Game was also applied, possibly inaccurately, to Northeast Asia to describe Russia and Japan&#x27;s contest over Manchuria – which took the form of the Russian invasion of Manchuria, Russo-Japanese War, and part of the Russian Civil War – and perhaps had similar ideological underpinnings to start with. However, unlike the British-Russian Great Game in South and West Asia, where clear-cut spheres of influence were established, Patrikeeff says that this supposed Great Game in Northeast Asia ignored that economic dominance did not follow political (with Japan&#x27;s victory in Manchuria not fully ousting the Russian concessions such as the CER) and that centuries-old distinct traditions such as the Qing legacy there led to key differences. Nonetheless, ancient and even mythic appeals to legitimacy were used by exiled supporters of empire, such as Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg&#x27;s attempt at reviving a &#x27;new Mongolian khanate&#x27;. Whereas the Great Game between Russia and Britain was codifying imperial spheres of influence at their frontiers, the supposed Great Game between Russia and Japan did not end up in a similarly defined frontier, with warlord states and Honghuzi emerging through the period.

=== Role of legends and mysticism in the Great Game ===
Several scholars have focused on the role of legends and mysticism (sometimes interpreted as a form of Orientalism that was prominent in the late 19th and early 20th century), during the Great Game and in its aftermath.

Some writers such as Karl Meyer and Shareen Brysac have connected the Great Game to earlier and later expeditions in Inner Asia, predominantly those expeditions by British, Russian, and German orientalists. Robert Irwin summarizes the expeditions as &quot;William Moorcroft, the horse doctor with a mission to find new stock for the cavalry in British India; Charles Metcalfe, the advocate of a forward policy on the frontier in the early 19th century; Alexander &#x27;Bokhara&#x27; Burnes, the foolhardy political officer, who perished at the hands of an Afghan mob; Sir William Hay Macnaghten, the head of the ill-fated British Mission in Kabul (and a scholar who produced an important edition of &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;); Nikolai Przhevalsky, the explorer who gave his name to a hard-to-spell horse; Francis Younghusband, the mystical imperialist; Aurel Stein, the manuscript hunter; Sven Hedin, the Nazi sympathiser who seems to have regarded Asian exploration as a proving ground for the superman; Nicholas Roerich, the artist and barmy quester after the fabled hidden city of Shambhala.&quot;

The founder of Theosophy, esotericist Helena Blavatsky, has also been connected to the Great Game, with her Himalayas-inspired Western mysticism both critiquing, and falling for, two forms of Orientalism by the British and Russian Empires, as they competed to define and claim &quot;the Orient&quot;. Blavatsky would be referenced by the poet Velimir Khlebnikov, who argued that Britain and Russia had both taken traits from the Kazan Khanate and Mongol Empire respectively, in their colonial struggle over Asia. Blavatsky would also refer to Russia&#x27;s double-layered conception of itself as a European power in contrast to Asia as well as an empire based in Asia; meanwhile, she would also &quot;consciously appropriate&quot; British rhetoric on Russia in labelling herself a &quot;Russian savage&quot;. Both Blavatsky and Khlebnikov claimed Kalmyk ancestry in imitation of the traditionally nomadic culture. Scholar Anindita Banerjee argued this shows a &quot;deconstruction&quot; of national identities by identifying with a &quot;religious, geographic, and ethnic other&quot;, relevant to the diversity of Central Asia and India and the frontier that existed between the British and Russian Empires.


According to the scholar Andrei Znamenski, Soviet Communists of the 1920s aimed to extend their influence over Mongolia and Tibet, using the mythical Buddhist kingdom of Shambhala as a form of propaganda to further this mission, in a sort of &quot;great Bolshevik game&quot;. The expedition of Russian symbolist Nicholas Roerich has been put in context of the Great Game due to his interest in Tibet, Although Roerich did not like the Communists, he agreed to help Soviet intelligence and influence operations due to a shared paranoia towards Britain, as well as his goal to form a &quot;Sacred Union of the East&quot; Jan Morris states that &quot;Roerich brought the bewilderments of the later Great Game to America&quot; through mysticism movements called Roerichism.

In the early 1920s, Roerich asserted that beings from an esoteric Buddhist community in India told him that Russia was destined for a mission on Earth. That led Roerich to formulate his &quot;Great Plan,&quot; which envisaged the unification of millions of Asian peoples through a religious movement using the Future Buddha, or Maitreya, into a &quot;Second Union of the East.&quot; There, the King of Shambhala would, following the Maitreya prophecies, make his appearance to fight a great battle against all evil forces on Earth. Roerich understood that as &quot;perfection towards Common Good.&quot; The new polity was to include southwestern Altai, Tuva, Buryatia, Outer and Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet, with its capital in &quot;Zvenigorod,&quot; the &quot;City of Tolling Bells,&quot; which was to be built at the foot of Mount Belukha, in Altai. According to Roerich, the same Mahatmas revealed to him in 1922 that he was an incarnation of the Fifth Dalai Lama.

==Other uses of the term &quot;Great Game&quot;==
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan invited comparisons to the Great Game in the 1980s. Concerns of resource scarcity emerged once again in the 1990s, and with it the hope that the newly independent states of Central Asia and the Caucasus would provide a resource boom – the new &quot;Persian Gulf&quot; – and with it competition for oil and gas in a 21st-century version of the Great Game. These expectations were not supported by the facts, and came with an exaggeration of the region&#x27;s commercial and geopolitical value. Since that time, some journalists have used the expression The New Great Game to describe what they proposed was a renewed geopolitical interest in Central Asia because of the mineral wealth of the region, which was at that time becoming more available to foreign investment after the end of the Soviet Union. One journalist linked the term to an interest in the region&#x27;s minerals and another to its minerals and energy. The interest in oil and gas includes pipelines that transmit energy to China&#x27;s east coast. One view of the New Great Game is a shift to geoeconomic compared to geopolitical competition. Xiangming Chen believes that &quot;China and Russia are the two dominant power players vs. the weaker independent Central Asian states&quot;.

Other authors have criticized the reuse of the term &quot;Great Game&quot;. It may imply that Central Asian states are entirely the pawns of larger states, when this ignores the potentially counterbalancing factors. According to strategic analyst Ajay Patnaik, the &quot;New Great Game&quot; is a misnomer, because rather than two empires focused on the region as in the past, there are now many global and regional powers active with the rise of China and India as major economic powers. Central Asian states have diversified their political, economic, and security relationships. David Gosset of CEIBS Shanghai states &quot;the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) established in 2001 is showing that Central Asia&#x27;s actors have gained some real degree of independence. But fundamentally, the China factor introduces a level of predictability.&quot; In the 2015 international relations book &quot;Globalizing Central Asia&quot;, the authors state that Central Asian states have pursued a multivectored approach in balancing out the political and economic interests of larger powers, but it has had mixed success due to strategic reversals of administrations regarding the West, China, and Russia. They suppose that China could balance out Russia. However, Russia and China have a strategic partnership since 2001. According to Ajay Patnaik, &quot;China has advanced carefully in the region, using the SCO as the main regional mechanism, but never challenging Russian interests in Central Asia.&quot; In the Carnegie Endowment, Paul Stronski and Nicole Ng wrote in 2018 that China has not fundamentally challenged any Russian interests in Central Asia. They suggested that China, Russia, and the West could have mutual interests in regional stability in Central Asia.

The Great Game has been described as a cliché-metaphor, and there are authors who have now written on the topics of &quot;the Great Game&quot; in Antarctica, the world&#x27;s far north, and in outer space.

<doc id="154016" wikidata="Q288241" url="?curid=154016" title="Crispus Attucks">
<text>Crispus Attucks ( – March 5, 1770) was an American whaler, sailor, and stevedore of African and Native American descent who is traditionally regarded as the first person killed in the Boston Massacre, and as a result the first American killed in the American Revolution. 

Although he is widely remembered as the first American casualty of the American Revolutionary War, 11-year-old Christopher Seider was shot a few weeks earlier by customs officer Ebenezer Richardson on February 22, 1770. Historians disagree on whether Attucks was a free man or an escaped slave, but most agree that he was of Wampanoag and African descent. Two major sources of eyewitness testimony about the Boston Massacre published in 1770 did not refer to him as black or as a Negro; it appears he was instead viewed by Bostonians as being of mixed ethnicity. According to a contemporaneous account in the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;, he was a &quot;Mulattoe man, named Crispus Attucks, who was born in Framingham, but lately belonged to New Providence, and was here in order to go for North Carolina.&quot;

Attucks became an icon of the anti-slavery movement in the mid-19th century. Supporters of the abolition movement lauded him for playing a heroic role in the history of the United States.

== Early life and ethnic origins ==
Attucks was born in Framingham, Massachusetts. Town histories of Framingham written in 1847 and 1887 describe him as a slave of Deacon William Brown, though it is unclear whether Brown was his original owner. In 1750, Brown advertised for the return of a runaway slave named Crispas. In the advertisement, Brown describes Attucks and his clothing when he was last seen. He also said that a reward of 10 pounds would be given to whoever found and returned Attucks to him. Attucks&#x27;s status at the time of the massacre as a free person or a runaway slave has been a matter of debate for historians.

Attucks became a sailor and whaler, and he spent much of his life at sea or working around the docks along the Atlantic seaboard. In an 1874 article in &quot;The American Historical Record&quot;, Jebe B. Fisher recounts a passage in the memoirs of Boston Tea Party participant George R.T. Hewes, which stated that at the time of the massacre, Attucks &quot;was a Nantucket Indian, belonging onboard a whale ship of Mr. Folgers, then in the harbor, and he remembers a distinct war whoop which he yelled... the mob whistling, screaming, and rending like an Indian yell.&quot; Many historians believe Attucks went by the alias Michael Johnson in order to avoid being caught after his escape from slavery. He may only have been temporarily in Boston in early 1770, having recently returned from a voyage to the Bahamas. He was due to leave shortly afterward on a ship for North Carolina.

Though he is commonly described as an African American in popular culture, two major sources of eyewitness testimony about the Massacre, both published in 1770, did not refer to Attucks as &quot;black&quot; or as a &quot;Negro,&quot; but rather as a mulatto and an Indian. In an account from Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;, a man who may have been Attucks was referred to as a &quot;Mulattoe man, named Crispas, who was born in Framingham, but lately belonged to New-Providence, and was here in order to go for North Carolina.&quot; However, during Attucks&#x27;s time, mulatto was often used to describe skin tone rather than ethnicity, and sometimes referred to full-blooded Native Americans. In &quot;Potter&#x27;s American Monthly&quot;, the interchangeability of the two terms is demonstrated by court transcripts from the Attucks trial: Question: Did you see a mulatto among the persons who surrounded the soldiers?
Answer: I did not observe...
Question: Did they seem to be sailors or townsmen?
Answer: They were dressed some of them in the habits of sailors.
Question: Did you know the Indian who was killed?
Answer: No.
Question: Did you see any of them press on the soldiers with a cordwood stick?
Answer: No. Historians differ in opinion on Attucks&#x27;s heritage: some assert his family had intermarried with African slaves, while others maintain he had no African heritage. It is widely acknowledged that Attucks had considerable Native American heritage.

Biographer Mitch Kachun, as well as multiple 19th century Framingham town histories, have drawn a connection between Attucks and John Attuck of Framingham, a Narragansett man who was hanged in Framingham in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War. The word for &quot;deer&quot; in the Narragansett language is &quot;Attuck.&quot; Kachun also noted a possible connection to a probable Natick woman and possible Attucks mother or relative named Nanny Peterattucks, who is described as a &#x27;negro woman&#x27; in the 1747 estate inventory of Framingham slaveholder Joseph Buckminster and, along with Jacob Peterattucks, as &#x27;probable descendant of John Attuck, the Indian&#x27; in an 1847 history of Framingham. Other sources refer to their surname as Peter Attucks. In a 1747 history of the Hoosac Valley, an African colonial militiaman named Moses Peter Attucks, living in nearby Leicester, is described as a &#x27;negro slave of John White; elsewhere he is listed as Moses Attucks Jacob Peterattucks and Nanny Peterattucks are recorded as slaves with Joseph Buckminster in 1730, and in 1740 Jacob with Thomas Buckminster, who was appointed by Framingham in 1739 to lead a commission for the preservation of deer in the area. Historian William C. Nell reported an 1860 letter from a Natick resident, also printed in an 1860 edition of &quot;The Liberator&quot; newspaper that read,

Several persons are now living in Natick who remember the Attucks family, viz., Cris, who was killed March 5th; Sam, whose name was abbreviated into Sam Attucks, or Smattox; Sal, also known as Slattox; and Peter, called Pea Tattox [...] my mother, still living, aged 89, remembers Sal in particular, who used to be called the gourd-shell squaw, from the fact that she used to carry her rum in a gourd shell [...] the whole family are said to be the children of Jacob Peter Attucks... it has been conjectured that they are of Indian blood, but all who knew the descendants describe them as negroes.

The letter continues, &quot;his sister [Sal] used to say that if they had not killed Cris, Cris would have killed them.&quot;

Prince Yonger has been posited as the father of Attucks. However, according to Framingham town histories, Yonger did not arrive in Massachusetts until 1725, after Attucks was born, and did not marry Nanny Peterattucks until 1737, after which point they had children, who are noted in multiple town histories but among whom Crispus is not mentioned: &quot;a son, who died young, and Phebe, who never married.&quot; It is possible Yonger became Attucks&#x27; stepfather in 1737, though it is unclear whether Attucks had permanently left his mother&#x27;s home by that point. Neither Phebe nor the son are recorded with the Attucks or Peterattucks surname.

==Boston Massacre==
In the fall of 1768, British troops were sent to Boston to maintain order amid growing colonial unrest which had led to a spate of attacks on local officials following the introduction of the Stamp Act and the subsequent Townshend Acts. Radical Whigs had coordinated waterfront mobs against the authorities. The presence of troops, instead of reducing tensions, served to further inflame them.

After dusk on March 5, 1770, a wigmaker&#x27;s apprentice mistakenly accused a British officer of not paying a bill. The officer ignored his insults but a sentry intervened after the boy began physically assaulting the officer. Both townspeople and nine soldiers of the 29th Regiment of Foot gathered. The colonists threw snowballs and debris at the soldiers. A group of men including Attucks approached the Old State House armed with clubs and sticks. A soldier was struck with a piece of wood, an act some witnesses claimed was done by Attucks. Other witnesses stated that Attucks was &quot;leaning upon a stick&quot; when the soldiers opened fire.

Five colonists were killed and six were wounded. Attucks took two ricocheted bullets in the chest and was believed to be the first to die. County coroners Robert Pierpoint and Thomas Crafts Jr. conducted an autopsy on Attucks. He was &quot;felled by two bullets to his chest, one of them &#x27;goring the right lobe of the lungs and a great part of the liver most horribly&#x27;.&quot; Attucks&#x27; body was carried to Faneuil Hall, where it lay in state until Thursday, March 8, when he and the other victims were buried together in the same grave site in Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. He had lived for approximately 47 years.

== Reaction and trials ==

John Adams successfully defended most of the accused soldiers against a charge of murder. Two were found guilty of manslaughter. Faced with the prospect of hanging, the soldiers pleaded &quot;benefit of clergy&quot;, and were instead branded on their thumbs. In his arguments, Adams called the crowd &quot;a motley rabble of saucy boys, negros and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish Jack Tarrs.&quot; In particular, he charged Attucks with having &quot;undertaken to be the hero of the night,&quot; and with having precipitated a conflict by his &quot;mad behavior.&quot;

Two years later United States Founding Father Samuel Adams, a cousin of John Adams, named the event the &quot;Boston Massacre,&quot; and helped ensure it would not be forgotten. Boston artist Henry Pelham (half-brother of the celebrated portrait painter John Singleton Copley) created an image of the event. Paul Revere made a copy from which prints were made and distributed. Some copies of the print show a dark-skinned man with chest wounds, presumably representing Crispus Attucks. Other copies of the print show no difference in the skin tones of the victims.

The five who were killed were buried as heroes in the Granary Burying Ground, which also contains the graves of Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and other notable figures. Customs of the period discouraged the burial of black people and white people together, with &quot;black burials relegated to the rear or far side of the cemetery. Such a practice was not completely unknown, however. Prince Hall, for example, was interred in Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground in the North End of Boston 39.

== Legacy and honors ==

* 1858, Boston-area abolitionists, including William Cooper Nell, established &quot;Crispus Attucks Day&quot; to commemorate him.
* 1886, the places where Crispus Attucks and Samuel Gray fell were marked by circles on the pavement. Within each circle, a hub with spokes leads out to form a wheel.
* 1888, a monument honoring Attucks and the other victims of the Boston Massacre was erected on Boston Common. It is over 25 feet high and about 10 feet wide. The &quot;bas-relief&quot; (raised portion on the face of the main part of the monument) portrays the Boston Massacre, with Attucks lying in the foreground. Under the scene is the date, March 5, 1770. Above the bas-relief stands a female figure, &quot;Free America&quot;, holding the broken chain of oppression in her right hand. Beneath her right foot, she crushes the royal crown of England. At the left of the figure is an eagle. Thirteen stars are cut into one of the faces of the monument. Beneath these stars in raised letters are the names of the five men who were killed that day: Crispus Attucks, Samuel Gray, James Caldwell, Samuel Maverick, and Patrick Carr. Some men died a day later. Although that year leaders of the Massachusetts Historical Society and the New England Historic Genealogical Society opposed the creation of the Crispus Attucks memorial, since the 20th century both organizations have acknowledged his role and promoted interest in black history and genealogy.
* 1940, Attucks was honored with 1 of the 33 dioramas at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago.

<doc id="154024" wikidata="Q853423" url="?curid=154024" title="Seventeen Seconds">
<text>Seventeen Seconds is the second studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 18 April 1980 by Fiction Records. The album marked the first time frontman Robert Smith co-produced with Mike Hedges. After the departure of original bassist Michael Dempsey, Simon Gallup became an official member along with keyboardist Matthieu Hartley. The single &quot;A Forest&quot; was the band&#x27;s first entry in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart.

== History ==
At the end of the Cure&#x27;s 1979 UK tour supporting Siouxsie and the Banshees, Robert Smith spoke less and less with bassist Michael Dempsey. Early versions of &quot;Play for Today&quot; and &quot;M&quot; had been performed at a few concerts, but Dempsey did not like the new musical direction that Smith wanted to take. Smith commented: &quot;I think the final straw came when I played Michael the demos for the next album and he hated them. He wanted us to be XTC part 2 and – if anything – I wanted us to be the Banshees part 2. So he left&quot;. 

Playing guitar with the Banshees for two months and learning their songs opened up another horizon to Smith. &quot;It allowed me to think beyond what we were doing. I wanted to have a band that does what Steven Severin and Budgie do, where they just get a bassline and the drum part and Siouxsie wails&quot;. The records to which Smith was frequently listening during the composition of the album were &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; by Nick Drake, &quot;Isle of Wight&quot; by Jimi Hendrix, &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; by Van Morrison and &quot;Low&quot; by David Bowie. 

Smith wrote the lyrics and music for most of the record at his parents&#x27; home, on a Hammond organ with a built-in tape recorder. Interviewed in 2004, producer Mike Hedges did not recall any demo tracks, with the band generally playing the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added.

Two members of the Magazine Spies, bass guitarist Simon Gallup and keyboardist Matthieu Hartley, were added to the band&#x27;s lineup. Gallup replaced Dempsey, which relieved Smith as he felt Dempsey&#x27;s basslines were too ornate. Hartley&#x27;s synth work added a new dimension to the band&#x27;s newly ethereal sound, although he would later clash with Smith over complexity; Hartley enjoyed complex chords but Smith wanted single notes.

Money was short, so the album was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between £2,000 and £3,000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day. Smith stated that as a result, the track &quot;The Final Sound&quot;, which was planned to be much longer, was cut down to 53 seconds because the tape ran out while recording and the band could not record it again. The album, mostly a collection of downbeat tracks, features ambient echoing vocals with the sonic direction driven by its drum sound.

== Musical style ==
Retrospectively, &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; has been considered an early example of gothic rock. Its &quot;gloomscapes&quot; are considered to be &quot;a sonic touchstone&quot; for the forthcoming movement. The track &quot;The Final Sound&quot; is &quot;so positively gothic you could almost be fooled into believing that it was lifted from the soundtrack of some Hammer horror gorefest&quot;. The album has also been described as new wave and post-punk.

== Release and reissue ==
&quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; was released on 18 April 1980. It reached No. 20 on the British album charts. The record was repackaged in the US in 1981 (on the A&amp;M label) with &quot;Faith&quot; as &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, available as a double LP. In 2005, the album was remastered as part of Universal&#x27;s Deluxe Edition series, featuring bonus live tracks and demos as well as studio material by Cult Hero, a 1970s-style progressive rock band along the lines of Easy Cure that featured Smith&#x27;s postman Frank Bell as lead singer. &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; charted in the United States for the first time in September 2020, when it debuted at No. 186 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

== Reception and legacy ==
The album&#x27;s songs have been described by critics as featuring vague, often unsettling lyrics and dark, spare, minimalistic melodies. Some reviewers, such as Nick Kent of &quot;NME&quot;, felt that &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; represented a far more mature Cure, who had come very far musically in less than one year. Ian Cranna of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; wrote that the band were creating more ambitious music, while still retaining their &quot;powerful melodic intensity&quot;. Chris Westwood of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; was less enthusiastic, viewing the album as &quot;a sidewards step&quot; rather than a progression; he found the material &quot;biteless, a bit distant&quot;, showcasing a &quot;reclusive, disturbed Cure, sitting in cold, dark, empty rooms, watching clocks&quot;.

Simon Reynolds said the album was &quot;translucent-sounding&quot;, with shades of the Durutti Column, Young Marble Giants and &quot;Another Green World&quot; by Brian Eno. AllMusic writer Chris True said that while &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; had come to be largely overlooked in later years apart from its single &quot;A Forest&quot;, it nonetheless represented an important development for the Cure, capturing them becoming &quot;more rigid in sound, and more disciplined in attitude&quot;, and anticipating the bleak lyrical themes that would become more apparent on subsequent Cure albums.

&quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The authors note: &quot;Like the album&#x27;s cover art, which is little more than an abstract blur, the bleak, minimalist sound of &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;-era Cure is subtly suggestive.&quot; Attention is drawn to the &quot;beguiling bleakness, both in its brief instrumentals and the more pop-oriented tracks (such as the sharp, hook-laden &#x27;Play for Today&#x27;) that hark back to their earlier work.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list.

<text>Cotton Lyndal Hill is a fictional character in the Fox animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; voiced by Toby Huss. He was the father of Hank Hill, Good Hank Hill (or &quot;G.H.&quot;), Junichiro (his illegitimate half-Japanese son), and, according to him, at least 270 possible others. He was a World War II veteran who had his shins &quot;blowed off by a Japanman&#x27;s machine gun&quot; in combat and later had his feet attached to his knees as a result. This made him a foot shorter than his relatives and caused a characteristic waddle. According to Hank, Cotton was 6&#x27;4&quot; with his shins and was 5&#x27;0&quot; without them. Despite his disability, he eventually reached the rank of Colonel in the Texas State Defense Forces and was addressed as such by his friends. Cotton Hill dies in the 12th season of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; at age 80 after suffering severe burns from slipping on a flat top grill.

==Character biography==
===Early life and military service===
If Cotton&#x27;s story is to be believed, he was born around 1927, making him about 70 in the first season of the show. In a third-season episode Hank says Cotton is 70, and in the Season 4 episode &quot;Cotton Comes Marching Home&quot;, he states himself to be 71. Little is known about Cotton&#x27;s childhood other than that he started out with a gun at an early age according to Hank in the episode &quot;How to Fire A Rifle Without Really Trying&quot;, that he attended Fort Berk when he was very young and spent much of his childhood there as he revealed in &quot;An Officer and A Gentle Boy&quot;, that he apparently joined the army when he was only 14 years old as revealed in &quot;Shins of the Father&quot;, and that Cotton&#x27;s mother apparently died giving birth to him, as he exaggerates in &quot;Death Picks Cotton&quot;. Almost nothing is known about Cotton&#x27;s father, except that he may have been German, as Peggy tells Bobby in the episode &quot;Tears of an Inflatable Clown&quot; and the only time Cotton ever himself refers to his father during the entire series is when he shouts at Hank: &quot;You ain&#x27;t my daddy, I&#x27;m your daddy!&quot;. Cotton also has an unnamed brother (Dusty&#x27;s father).

Cotton was zealously proud of his military service record and his status as a war hero, although he tended to exaggerate his exploits. He often claims to anyone who will listen that he killed &quot;fitty [50] men&quot; during the war. He consistently reminded everyone within earshot about how he lost his shins during World War II:

&quot;I was 14, just a little older than Bobby. But I knew Uncle Sam needed me, so I lied and signed up. We had beat the Nazzys in Italy, and they shipped me to the Pacific theater. A Tojo torpedo sent our troop ship to the bottom. I could only save three of my buddies: Fatty, Stinky, and Brooklyn. They were kind of like you fellas [to Bill, Dale, and Boomhauer], only one of them was from Brooklyn. Out of the sun came a Tojo Zero and put fitty bullets in my back. The blood attracted sharks. I had to give &#x27;em Fatty. Then things took a turn for the worse. I made it to an island, but it was full of Tojos! They were spitting on the U.S. flag! So I rushed &#x27;em, but it was a trap. They opened fire and blew my shins off. Last thing I remember, I beat &#x27;em all to death with a big piece of Fatty. I woke up in a field hospital, and they were sewing my feet to my knees.&quot; 

He refers to the Japanese as &quot;Tojos,&quot; deriving from war-time Japanese Prime Minister and General Hideki Tojo. He would also refer to the Nazis as &quot;Nazzys&quot;.

Based upon Cotton&#x27;s uniform in the episode &quot;Returning Japanese&quot;, he was awarded the following military decorations: Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, and American Campaign Medal. Cotton left Japan wearing the rank of Private in his own flashback while reminiscing to Hank how he had met Michiko. He was referred to as a colonel repeatedly during the series, reflecting his rank in the Texas State Guard after the war. In the episode &quot;When Cotton Comes Marching Home&quot;, his Silver Star is displayed in a case at the VFW. In the 12th episode of season 11, he is wearing the third class of the Legion of Honor, the highest award given by the French government, who gave it to a select handful of American troops for their service in World War II.

Cotton states in a sixth-season episode that he served with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 77th Infantry Division.

He has a number of war trophies that can be seen in various episodes, including a Prussian Pickelhaube which he sometimes used to cut Hank&#x27;s hair in an even bowl cut during Hank&#x27;s youth, and a Nazi canoe which he claimed was &quot;Hitler&#x27;s canoe&quot;, though given his propensity to exaggerate his war stories, the actual origin of the canoe is uncertain.

The pride he has in his military service often colors his opinions of others; he has often expressed disdain for Hank&#x27;s lack of service, and enjoys making fun of his son for being excluded due to his narrow urethra. Cotton also has a tendency to exaggerate his service in the war. For example, in the episode &quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot; he stated he killed Nazis (&quot;Nazzys&quot;) in Munich on April 30 and Japanese (&quot;Tojos&quot;) on May 2 in Okinawa.

He also has expressed dislike for veterans of the Vietnam War, as he blames them to some degree for losing it - though he eventually accords them a measure of respect for trying their best.

Aside from some confirmation from his war buddies, it is unknown if Cotton actually ever served in Europe, considering the 77th served in the Pacific Theater and the majority of his war flashbacks are shown to take place in the Pacific fighting the Japanese. However, documentation obtained by Peggy in &quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot; did back his claim of fighting in the Sardinia campaign, which was mainly an air force campaign rather a battle on the ground.

Solomon Islands:
Cotton was ordered to retake an airfield on the Solomon Islands. His unit was pinned down by a Japanese machine gun nest high up in a hill, so he sneaked into a fifty-five gallon barrel of sake. He held his breath until the Japanese got good and drunk, and then he jumped out and spit it all out into his Zippo (lighter). He &quot;hibachi&#x27;d&quot; the whole squad. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;)

Guadalcanal:
In the episode &quot;Yankee Hanky&quot;, Cotton references that he and Stinky were on Guadalcanal, and it rained for 17 days.

Anzio:
On January 30, 1944, Cotton&#x27;s unit attacked Anzio. They had &quot;caught the Krauts with their pants down and their schnitzel exposed.&quot; They had taken the beach by noon, and the town by nightfall.

Normandy:
Cotton said that he climbed the cliffs of Normandy with a fifty-pound ice cream maker on his back. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;)

Saipan:
Cotton said that he led a platoon of men through the jungles of Sai Pan. (&quot;When Cotton Comes Marching Home&quot;)

Guam:
In 1944, in Guam, Cotton crawled through a minefield to retrieve General MacArthur&#x27;s corn cob pipe. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;)

Philippines:
Cotton said that he served in the Philippines. (&quot;Unfortunate Son&quot;)

Iwo Jima:
Cotton spent two weeks under a pile of bodies on Iwo Jima. (&quot;Revenge of the Lutefisk&quot;) He and Topsy show a bayonet technique Topsy used to gut a kamikaze. (&quot;Unfortunate Son&quot;)

Munich:
Cotton claimed to have fought in Munich on April 30, 1945, and probably longer, but later realized he didn&#x27;t. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;)

Okinawa:
On May 2, 1945, on Okinawa, Cotton invented a bayonet technique that is still used by the army today. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;)

P.O.W. Camp:
Cotton was captured at an unknown time by the Japanese, and put in a bamboo rat cage. He had to eat rats, but let the last one live so he could eat its droppings. He called it &quot;Jungle Rice&quot;, and said it &quot;tasted fine&quot;. By September, he was skinny enough to slip through the bars, and strangled the guard with a string made of braided rat tails, and ran to safety. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;) He had also learned to stop his heartbeat, so the Japanese would stop torturing him for a moment, probably at the P.O.W. camp (&quot;Death Picks Cotton&quot;), and claimed that he only cried when the Japanese tore off his fingernails. (&quot;Returning Japanese&quot;)

Miscellaneous:
Cotton severed the windpipe of a German corporal with a two-foot strand of dental floss he kept in his boot. (&quot;The Final Shinsult&quot;) He survived on a life raft by trapping rain water in his upturned eyelid. (&quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;)

===Death===
In the season 12 episode &quot;Death Picks Cotton,&quot; Cotton suffers severe injuries while at a Japanese restaurant in Arlen. Climbing onto a grill table, he chokes on a piece of shrimp (to which he is extremely allergic), then slips and falls on the hot surface. He is taken to the hospital and diagnosed with a hip fracture, severe burns on his arms, torn ligaments in his ankle/knee joints, and an infection of his esophagus due to swallowing the shrimp. X-rays reveal that he has four rusty bullets lodged in his back and one in his heart from old war wounds. In spite of his injuries and a heart attack suffered while in the hospital, Cotton survives long enough to torment both Hank and Peggy, even slowing his heartbeat down to feign death (a trick he learned while confined to a Japanese POW camp).

The last person to see him alive is Peggy, who tells him that despite Cotton&#x27;s constant torture of his son, Hank has always loved him and that she hopes he will live forever in the friendless, spiteful existence he has made for himself as the unhappy, unpleasant person he is. Cotton replies &quot;Oh, do ya, now?,&quot; laughs, and then dies completely, seemingly to spite Peggy. Peggy does not tell Hank of this exchange; instead, she lies that Cotton&#x27;s last words were kind ones meant for Hank. In the final scene of the episode, Dale Gribble fulfills a request from Cotton to blow up a storage shed Hank has built. Hank initially plans to honor a separate wish, to have Cotton&#x27;s head detached from his body and sent to the Emperor of Japan (he had also requested to have worms inserted into his mouth when doing so to &quot;scare that sonuvabitch&quot;), but Peggy stops him by (falsely) claiming that Cotton withdrew the request just before his death. Neither Didi nor G.H. appear in &quot;Death Picks Cotton,&quot; nor is his funeral shown. He was to have been buried at the Texas State Cemetery, a grave which he earned in recognition of his military service, as explained by the episode &quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot&quot;, although he ended up being cremated instead.

In the season 13 episode &quot;Serves Me Right for Giving General George S. Patton the Bathroom Key,&quot; Hank receives from Didi a box containing Cotton&#x27;s personal possessions and a list of embarrassing last requests. Cotton also left Hank a rude message on his tape recorder telling Hank that he wanted all the embarrassing requests completed by him. Peggy did not want Hank to fulfill Cotton&#x27;s wishes, but Hank said that fulfilling Cotton&#x27;s last requests was the best gift he had ever received from his father. Hank completed every single one of the humiliating requests, which Hank felt was Cotton&#x27;s way of humiliating Hank one last time. The last request Cotton left was to have his cremated remains flushed down a bar toilet that General George S. Patton once used; such practice was also a tradition in Cotton&#x27;s platoon, and all of Cotton&#x27;s deceased war buddies were also flushed down the toilet. Hank and his friends respectively honored the request and flushed Cotton&#x27;s remains down the toilet, resulting in the toilet getting clogged and the bar owner mailing Hank a $300 plumbing bill to pay for the damage. As a result of this, Peggy claims at the end of the episode that even though Cotton is dead, he will always find a way to disrupt their lives.

Fox published the following obituary for Cotton:

Cotton Hill, age 84, World War II veteran, died Sunday in a Texas VA hospital. Hill suffered from several injuries ranging from four rusty bullets lodged in his back (one in his heart) from his military service, a broken hip and torn ligaments in his ankle-knees, to an infection in his esophagus and severe burns caused by a freak shrimp accident that occurred earlier this week at Tokyaki&#x27;s Japanese restaurant. Hill leaves behind sons Hank Hill and G.H. (short for &quot;Good Hank&quot;); daughter-in-law Peggy Hill; grandson Bobby Hill; ex-wife Tilly; second wife Didi; first love and former Japanese lover Michiko; an illegitimate Japanese son, Junichiro; and nephew Dusty Hill (of band ZZ Top).

==Character analysis==
===Personality===
Cotton is a consistently misogynistic, chauvinistic, violent, abusive, and intolerant character. He talks down to women, berates his son, is prone to violent outbursts, and on more than one occasion has exhibited homicidal tendencies. His abrasive manner is consistently embarrassing for Hank and usually infuriating for Hank&#x27;s wife, Peggy. Throughout his history on the series, Cotton never once addressed Peggy by name, but he instead called her &quot;Hank&#x27;s wife&quot;, which was used as a running gag, including on the very rare occasion he&#x27;s trying to be nice to her (the only other names Cotton had ever addressed Peggy by was &quot;Hillary&quot; in the episode &quot;Shins of the Father&quot;, as well as Manimal and Sasquatch; Peggy also didn&#x27;t seem to care being called &quot;Hank&#x27;s Wife&quot; beyond visible annoyance, and never once told Cotton not to call her that). He even attempts to pass on some of his sexist traits to Bobby at one point, teaching him that women should be made to cook and clean for their husbands all day long.

On rare occasions, Cotton shows a vulnerable side that he normally keeps hidden: he realizes that he was a terrible father and person, hates himself for growing old and becoming disabled, and readily admits that he would die to protect his grandson, Bobby (&quot;Revenge of the Lutefisk&quot;). He also appears to not be bigoted towards black people or Jews, as he is shown interacting with both groups and acting more well-mannered than he usually is (when he finds out his ex-wife&#x27;s new boyfriend Gary is Jewish, he wishes him a Happy Hanukkah and says that one of his war buddies was also Jewish; presumably this is the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; man Cotton mentioned as having sacrificed himself during a shark attack so Cotton and others could escape alive, albeit horribly injured). When some annoying liberal roommates of Luanne&#x27;s reflexively insult him by calling him a Nazi, Cotton and his buddy Topsy get visibly angry and attack the roommates, scaring them into leaving the area and giving Luanne back her home.

Cotton also demonstrates a rough, demanding, and often abusive, but at times inspirational leadership. He admits to Hank that he always wanted to win in battle but accepted defeat when his men did their best. Through tough love and intense physical therapy, Cotton also helped Peggy walk again after a debilitating skydiving accident crippled her. Hank was initially wary of this, because he feared that Cotton was simply taking advantage of Peggy&#x27;s brief disability in order to humiliate her.

It was never revealed throughout the series how Cotton became such a nasty and rude character, or if he ever was a different person. Cotton has also shown in multiple episodes that he suffers from mild to severe post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (&quot;Returning Japanese&quot; &amp; &quot;Death Picks Cotton&quot;), which can explain the majority of his &quot;violent outbursts&quot;. Whatever the reason is, Cotton never sought forgiveness for how he treated Hank, Peggy, Tilly, and many others throughout the series. In the episode &quot;Hank gets Dusted&quot; Hank says straight up to his cousin Dusty that Cotton is in fact a jack-ass.

===Relationships===
Before leaving Japan, Cotton had an affair with a Japanese nurse, Michiko, which resulted in the birth of his eldest son (and Hank&#x27;s older half-brother), Junichiro (voiced by David Carradine); he left suddenly despite trying to stay, and knew nothing of his child until years later (a flashback clip shows him being clubbed and dragged onto the troopship leaving Japan). Michiko is one of the few women he treats respectfully at any time and the only woman he treats respectfully all the time.

After the war, Cotton supervised the installation of asbestos in eleven bowling alleys and every public school in Heimlich County. Cotton eventually traveled back to Japan to reconcile with his long-lost lover, and soon learned of his illegitimate son. Junichiro initially rejected Cotton&#x27;s attempt to make peace, and formally renounced his Hill family heritage. This enraged Cotton, who re-declared war on Japan and planned to spit in the face of Emperor Akihito out of spite. (&quot;Returning Japanese&quot;) When Cotton saw that Hank and Junichiro had mended fences and even become friends, and Junichiro said that he was not ashamed to be a Hill any more, Cotton ditched his plan and accepted the Emperor&#x27;s kind words. He also made peace with Junichiro&#x27;s mother, who tore a picture taken of them as young adults after World War II in half—and gave the half with her picture to Cotton, while keeping his picture for herself.

Cotton claimed he divorced from Hank&#x27;s mother, Tilly, because he &quot;outgrew&quot; her after she lost her large rear end, though it had been stated earlier in the show - such as in the season 1 episode &quot;Shins of a Father&quot; - that Tilly divorced him after years of verbal abuse. His second wife was a hospital volunteer, Deirdre &quot;Didi&quot; Hill. At age 71, Cotton fathered a third son from his second wife Didi, whom he named Good-Hank &quot;G.H.&quot; Hill to differentiate from, and possibly spite, Hank (who was temporarily called &quot;B.H. - Bad Hank&quot;).

Cotton&#x27;s relationship with Hank was strained; while Hank seemed to have a deep reverence (and fear) of his father, he stood up to Cotton on several occasions. Cotton also became depressed (and enraged) by the fact that he and Hank did not have a good relationship, once going homicidally insane when Hank said that he hates him. In spite of all this, however, Cotton never hesitated to refer to Hank as &quot;My Boy,&quot; and on several occasions tried to help him (such as when Kahn and Minh were befouling his house). Throughout the series, Cotton has also shown several times that he may actually care for Hank, such as calling him a good son in &quot;Returning Japanese&quot;, saving him from being shot in the episode &quot;Yankee Hankee&quot;, and leaving and trusting Hank with his last requests and personal possessions in &quot;Serving Me Right for giving George S. Patton the Bathroom Key&quot;. It is likely Cotton treats Hank horribly simply because he hates various aspects of Hank&#x27;s life, such as his job as a propane salesman, his place of birth (New York), his personality, how he chooses to raise Bobby, his marriage to Peggy, how he&#x27;s different from his cousin Dusty, how Hank thwarted his plan to assassinate Fidel Castro (Tilly had gone into labor just as Cotton was about to kill the communist leader), and - most importantly - how Hank did not follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and become a war hero.

Cotton had an antagonistic relationship with Peggy, whom he addressed as &quot;Hank&#x27;s wife&quot; among other epithets. On rare occasions though, Cotton evinced a grudging respect for Peggy, as in &quot;To Spank With Love&quot; and &quot;Cotton&#x27;s Plot.&quot;

Cotton appears to have a good relationship with Bobby. He once conceded that Hank was a better father than himself, stating, &quot;You made Bobby. All I made was you.&quot; Cotton shows that he is proud of Bobby and supports him. Once contemplating suicide, Cotton confides in Bobby and gives him a letter of recommendation for the army, irking Hank. Cotton often tries to pass on his misogynistic views to Bobby, even going so far as to try to buy him a hooker once, although Hank and Peggy are always able to reverse the damage. Cotton demonstrates his affection for Bobby in numerous instances. In &quot;How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying&quot;, he comes to watch Bobby and Hank shoot in a father-son shooting competition, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m always here to support my Bobby.&quot; In &quot;Revenge of the Lutefisk&quot;, Cotton even goes so far as to take the blame for Bobby after Bobby confesses he was the one who burned down the church (Claiming &quot;I&#x27;m an old man, everyone already hates me!&quot; whereas Bobby is just a child and has his whole life ahead of him.) and Didi reveals to Bobby that Cotton told her that if their unborn child turned out as good as Bobby, he wouldn&#x27;t abandon it. Reflecting on Cotton&#x27;s relationship with his grandson in &quot;Death Picks Cotton,&quot; Hank states, &quot;Even though he hates most things, he does love Bobby.&quot; It could be inferred that his love for Bobby is mixed also with a deep pride and respect for him, viewing him as actually tougher than Hank. Although Cotton respects Bobby more than anyone in the family, on his deathbed in &quot;Death Picks Cotton&quot;, Cotton claims he does not love anyone, though this could be him just trying to sound tough.

<text>Jesús Carlos Zárate Serna (born May 23, 1951) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1970 to 1988, and held the WBC bantamweight title from 1976 to 1979.

Zárate was voted Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine in 1977. Zárate was ranked #21 in &quot;The Ring&#x27;s&quot; list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. and voted as the #1 bantamweight (along with Rubén Olivares) of the 20th century by the Associated Press in 1999. In 1994, Zárate was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He is also the father of once-defeated Light Welterweight prospect, Carlos Zárate, Jr.

==Personal life==
Carlos Zárate has family members who have followed him into boxing. His son Carlos, now retired, fought in the Light Welterweight division and his nephew, Joel Luna Zárate, is the former WBO Latino Super Flyweight champion.

==Amateur career==
Zárate, considered along with rival Wilfredo Gómez to be among the better punchers of the lighter divisions, had an amateur record of 33 wins and 3 losses, with 30 knockout wins, and he won the Mexican &quot;Golden Gloves&quot;, or &quot;Guantes de Oro&quot;, in 1969.

==Professional career==
In 1970, Carlos made his professional debut with a 2-round knockout win over Luis Castañeda in Cuernavaca. That marked the beginning of a 23-fight knockout winning streak. The only boxers to get past the third round during that streak were Al Torres and Antonio Castañeda, who lasted 5 and 9 rounds respectively, both at Tijuana. Víctor Ramírez became the first boxer to last the distance with Zárate when Zárate beat him on points in January 1974 in Mexico City over ten rounds. Next began his second 20 plus knockout wins in a row streak, when none of his next 28 opponents heard the final bell on their feet.

===WBC Bantamweight championship===
After knocking out former world title challenger Néstor Jiménez in two rounds at Mexicali to end 1975, the WBC made Zárate their number one challenger at the Bantamweight division. So, after beating César Desiga by a knockout in four on March 29, 1976, in Monterrey, Zárate was faced on the night of May 8 of that year with defending WBC Bantamweight Champion Rodolfo Martínez in Los Angeles. Zárate became a world Bantamweight champion by knocking his countryman out in the eighth round. Zárate next won two fights by a knockout in the second and then defended it against Paul Ferreri, who lost by knockout in 12 in Los Angeles too. He finished &#x27;76 with a four-round knockout over Waruinge Nakayama in a title defense held at Culiacán.

===Fight against WBA Bantamweight champion===
After beginning 1977 with a third-round knockout win over Colombia&#x27;s Fernando Cabanela in Mexico City, Mexican boxing fans started talking about a possible unification bout between him and fellow Mexican Alfonso Zamora, the WBA&#x27;s world Bantamweight champion. Nicknamed by the American boxing press as &quot;The Z Boys&quot;, the two did square off, but not before much hassle and hurdle putting by both the WBC and WBA, who wanted both boxers to pay a large amount of money before sanctioning the bout. So, the California state boxing commission decided to sanction it as a ten-round, non-title bout instead. Fans didn&#x27;t seem to care that no world title belt would be involved that afternoon, and they packed the fight venue when Zárate and Zamora met in the LA suburb of Inglewood, California, at the Forum on April 23 of &#x27;77. Zárate made the tactical mistake of going toe to toe with a shorter but harder hitting puncher. Zárate got tagged repeatedly and then a man wearing a white tank top and grey sweat pants entered the ring. The fight was momentarily stopped by referee Richard Steele and a contingent of helmeted policemen stormed the ring, forcibly removing the intruder thereafter, Zárate managed to stay away from Zamora. After a first round, Zárate the better boxer, with a reach advantage stayed away and outboxed Zamora wearing him down then knocking him out in four to gain recognition by most boxing fans as the undisputed world champion of the Bantamweights. Then, he retained the WBC title with a knockout in six over Danilo Batista, and finished 1977 with a trip to Spain, where he retained the belt against challenger Juan Francisco Rodríguez, beaten in five.

In 1978, Zárate started out by meeting future world champion Alberto Dávila, whom he knocked out in eight at Los Angeles to retain his belt. Then, in April of that year, he made his first of two trips to Puerto Rico that year, to fight challenger Andres Hernandez, who lasted until the 13th. round at San Juan&#x27;s Roberto Clemente coliseum.

====Zárate vs. Gómez====
After retaining the title against Emilio Hernandez by a knockout in four and winning a non-title bout, Zárate announced he was moving up in weight and challenging the WBC Super Bantamweight champion, Wilfredo Gómez. According to many experts and the Ring Magazine book The Ring: Boxing In The 20th Century, Gómez and Zárate had the highest knockout win percentage of any two champions paired inside a ring in a world title fight: When Gómez and Zárate met on October 28, also at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, the challenger and still world Bantamweight champion Zárate was 52–0 with 51 knockouts, while defending world Super Bantamweight champion Gómez was 21-0-1 with 21 knockouts. Zárate went to the floor four times and tasted the sour taste of defeat for the first time in his career when he was beaten by a knockout in five rounds.

====Return to Bantamweight====
In 1979, Zárate made what would turn out to be his last successful defense, with a third-round knockout win over Mensah Kpalongo in Los Angeles. After winning a non-title bout against Celso Cháirez by a knockout in five in Houston, Texas, Zárate met gym-mate Lupe Pintor in Las Vegas and lost a close and controversial 15-round decision. Enraged by losing a decision he (as well as many fans) thought undeserved, he announced his retirement from boxing and vowed never to fight as a professional again.

===Five year retirement===
Zárate spent five years in retirement, but the temptation of the public adulation boxers receive when they become champions and the aroma of the boxing ring led him back into competition as a boxer. Despite still retaining an acceptable amount of his boxing ability, Zárate was nonetheless, a shadow of what he was before his 5-year retirement. In his return bout in 1986 against Adam García, he won a four-round decision. 11 more victories in a row, all by knockout, including one over then number one world Super Bantamweight challenger Richard Savage (knocked out by Zárate in five in Mexico City), made him the WBC&#x27;s number one challenger at the Super Bantamweight division once again.

And so, in October 1987, he traveled to Australia to meet the man boxing fans consider to be the greatest Australian world champion of all time: Jeff Fenech. In a fight contested for Fenech&#x27;s world Super Bantamweight title, Zárate lost by a four-round technical decision. After Fenech vacated the title soon after to pursue the world Featherweight crown, Zárate and countryman Daniel Zaragoza met for the vacant world championship belt, but Zárate came back on the losing end once again, being knocked out in the tenth round and finally announcing his retirement for good.

During the 1990s he also became a member of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame, and in 2003, he and Wilfredo Gómez met at a boxing undercard in Puerto Rico to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their boxing bout.

He had a record of 66 wins and 4 losses as a professional boxer, with 63 wins by knockout.

Carlos Zárate was voted as the Greatest Bantamweight Ever in 2014 by the Houston Boxing Hall Of Fame. The HBHOF is a voting body composed entirely of current and former fighters.
