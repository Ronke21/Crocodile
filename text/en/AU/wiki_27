<text>Arthur &quot;Harpo&quot; Marx (born Adolph Marx; November 23, 1888 – September 28, 1964) was an American comedian and harpist, and the second-oldest of the Marx Brothers. In contrast to the mainly verbal comedy of his brothers Groucho and Chico, Harpo&#x27;s comic style was visual, being an example of vaudeville, clown and pantomime traditions. In all of his movie appearances, he wore a curly reddish blonde wig and did not speak, instead blowing a horn or whistling to communicate. Marx frequently employed props such as a horn cane constructed from a lead pipe, tape, and a bulbhorn.

== Early life ==
Harpo was born on November 23, 1888, in Manhattan, New York City. He grew up in a neighborhood now known as Carnegie Hill (known at the time as Yorkville) on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, on East 93rd Street off Lexington Avenue. The turn-of-the-century tenement that Harpo later called &quot;the first real home I can remember&quot; was situated in a neighborhood populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans. The neighborhood hosted many historic homes and other buildings, such as the William Goadby Loew House (now the Spence School), the Congregation Shaare Zedek, and the Virginia Graham Fair Vanderbilt house.

His parents were Sam Marx (known by his nickname &quot;Frenchie&quot;/&quot;Frenchy&quot;) and his wife, Minnie Schoenberg Marx, sister of comedian and vaudeville performer Al Shean. Marx&#x27;s family was Jewish. His mother was from East Frisia, Germany, and his father, a tailor, was from Alsace, which was part of the Second French Empire at the time the elder Marx was born and for most of his childhood.

Harpo received little formal education and dropped out of New York Public School 86 at age eight (mainly due to bullying) during his second attempt to pass the second grade. He began to work, gaining employment in numerous odd jobs alongside his older brother Chico to contribute to the family income, including selling newspapers, working in a butcher shop, and as an office errand boy.

== Career ==
=== On stage ===

In January 1910, Harpo joined two of his younger brothers, Julius (later &quot;Groucho&quot;) and Milton (later &quot;Gummo&quot;), to form &quot;The Three Nightingales&quot;, which would later be renamed &quot;The Marx Brothers&quot;. Multiple unverified stories attempt to explain Harpo&#x27;s evolution as the &quot;silent&quot; character in the brothers&#x27; act. In his memoir, Groucho wrote that Harpo simply was not very good at memorizing dialogue, and thus was ideal to portray the archetypal vaudeville role of the &quot;dunce who couldn&#x27;t speak.&quot;

Differing stories exist regarding the origin of the Harpo stage name. The first suggests the pseudonym originated during a card game at the Orpheum Theatre in Galesburg, Illinois. In this version of the story, Marx was referred to by Art Fisher, the dealer that night, as &quot;Harpo&quot; because he played harp. However, this version of events is disputed, at least partially because the Orpheum Theatre was not constructed until late 1916, whereas Harpo later remembered acquiring the name in 1914. There is no dispute that Fisher coined the name, but some sources give an earlier date for its origin and suggest the game may have instead taken place at the Galesburg Auditorium Theatre or the same town&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre. Harpo learned how to hold the harp by emulating a harp-playing angel in a picture he saw in a five-and-dime. No one in town knew how to play the harp, so Harpo tuned it as best he could, starting with one basic note and tuning it from there. He began learning to play the instrument without lessons. Three years later, he found out he had tuned it incorrectly, but that his method placed much less tension on the strings. Despite Harpo&#x27;s musical talent, he never learned to read or write music. Although he paid top musicians handsome fees to teach him &quot;proper&quot; harp-playing technique, he maintained his unique style his entire life (his &quot;teachers,&quot; fascinated by his technique, spent their sessions watching and listening as Marx performed). The major exception was Mildred Dilling, the professional harpist who finally taught Harpo proper harp technique and collaborated with him regularly when he had difficulty composing. Upon his death in 1964, one of Harpo&#x27;s harps was donated to the State of Israel, and eventually found a home in an Israeli orchestra.

Chico found Harpo some of his first jobs. He and Chico were co-workers, playing piano to accompany silent films. Unlike Chico, Harpo could play only two songs on the piano, &quot;Waltz Me Around Again, Willie&quot; and &quot;Love Me and the World Is Mine&quot;, but he adapted this small repertoire in different tempos to suit the action on the screen. He was also seen playing a portion of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Prelude in C# minor&quot; in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, and played piano in &quot;A Night at the Opera.&quot; Ultimately, he relinquished the piano to Chico in favor of his trademark harp, upon which he performed Nacio Herb Brown&#x27;s 1935 song &quot;Alone&quot;, which was sung in the film by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones.

Harpo had changed his name from &quot;Adolph&quot;, a name he disliked (as a child, he was routinely called &quot;Ahdie&quot; instead), to &quot;Arthur&quot; by 1911. The similarity to the name of prominent Chicago show business attorney Adolph Marks may have further encouraged the change. Urban legends stating that the name change came about during World War I due to anti-German sentiment in the US, or during World War II because of the stigma that Adolf Hitler imposed on the name, are groundless.

=== On film ===
His first screen appearance was in the film &quot;Humor Risk&quot; (1921), with his brothers, although according to Groucho it was screened only once and then lost. Four years later, Harpo appeared without his brothers as the &quot;Village Peter Pan&quot; in &quot;Too Many Kisses&quot; which predated the brothers&#x27; first collaborative film, &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, by four years. Not only is &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; historical by virtue of being the first of the Marx&#x27;s many talkies, but also for being the first film to feature an overhead camera shot, at least five years before Busby Berkeley&#x27;s renowned first use of the technique in his 1936 film &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; to film a kaleidoscopic women&#x27;s dance routine. In &quot;Too Many Kisses&quot;, Harpo spoke the only line he would ever speak on-camera in a film: &quot;You sure you can&#x27;t move?&quot; (said to the film&#x27;s tied-up hero before punching him). Fittingly, it was a silent film, and the audience saw only his lips move and the line on a title card.

Harpo was often cast as Chico&#x27;s eccentric partner-in-crime, whom he would often help by playing charades to tell of Groucho&#x27;s problem, and/or annoy by giving Chico his leg, as an alternative to a handshake or simply to rest the leg.
Harpo became known for prop-laden sight gags, in particular the seemingly infinite number of odd things stored in his topcoat&#x27;s oversized pockets. In the film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932), Groucho, referring to an impossible situation, tells Harpo that he cannot &quot;burn the candle at both ends&quot;. Harpo immediately produces from within his coat pocket a lit candle burning at both ends. In the same film, a homeless man on the street asks Harpo for money for a cup of coffee, and he subsequently produces a steaming cup, complete with saucer, from inside his coat. Also in &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, he has a fish and a sword, and when he wants to go to his speakeasy, he stabs the fish in its mouth with his sword to give the password, &quot;Swordfish&quot;. In &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, he produces a lit blowtorch to light a cigar.

Harpo often used facial expressions and mime to get his point across instead of speaking. One of his facial expressions, which he used in every Marx Brothers film and stage play, beginning with &quot;Fun in Hi Skule&quot;, was known as &quot;the Gookie&quot;. Harpo created it by mimicking the expression of Mr. Gehrke, a New York tobacconist who would make a similar face while concentrating on rolling cigars.

Harpo further distinguished his character by wearing a &quot;fright wig&quot;. Early in his career, it was dyed pink, as evidenced by color film posters and by allusions to it in films, with character names such as &quot;Pinky&quot; in &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. This wig sometimes appeared blond on-screen due to black-and-white film stock. In some films, however, Harpo actually wore a blonde wig. Over time, he darkened the pink to more of a reddish color, which films again alluded to with character names, such as the name of his character in &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Rusty&quot;.

His non-speaking in his early films was occasionally referred to by the other Marx Brothers, who were careful to imply that his character&#x27;s not speaking was a choice rather than a disability. In reality, the decision to remain silent began when Harpo received a negative review, part of which suggested that Harpo&#x27;s portrayal of a fool was convincing only until he spoke. Soon after, the Brothers&#x27; uncle shared with Harpo a script he had written for them. Harpo was dismayed to find he had just three lines and said to his uncle, &quot;Well, maybe I won&#x27;t talk at all!&quot; This was meant sarcastically, but his uncle genuinely liked the idea. His brothers would make joking reference to this part of his act. For example, in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, his character was ironically dubbed &quot;The Professor&quot;. In &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, this exchange occurs:

In later films, Harpo was repeatedly put in situations where he attempted to convey a vital message by whistling and pantomime, reinforcing the idea that his character was unable to speak.

The Marxes&#x27; film &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939) contains a unique scene where Harpo is heard saying &quot;A-choo!&quot; twice, as he sneezes.

=== Tour in the Soviet Union ===
In 1933, following U.S. diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union, Harpo spent six weeks in Moscow as a performer and goodwill ambassador. His tour was a huge success, and the show ran for six weeks. Harpo&#x27;s name was transliterated into Russian, using the Cyrillic alphabet, as &quot;ХАРПО МАРКС,&quot; which is how he was billed during his Soviet Union appearances. Harpo, having no knowledge of Russian, pronounced it as &quot;Exapno Mapcase&quot;. At that time, Harpo and the Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov became friends.

During this time he served as a secret courier, delivering communiques to and from the US embassy in Moscow at the request of Ambassador William Christian Bullitt Jr., smuggling the messages in and out of the Soviet Union by taping a sealed envelope to his leg beneath his trousers. Marx recounted his relief at his voyage&#x27;s end: &quot;I pulled up my pants, ripped off the tape, unwound the straps, handed over the dispatches from Ambassador Bullitt, and gave my leg its first scratch in ten days.&quot;

== In other media ==
In 1936, he rode an ostrich on a team of polo-playing film stars who appeared as caricatures in the Walt Disney Production&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Polo Team&quot;, alongside Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. Walt Disney would later feature Harpo (with Groucho and Chico) as one of King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Fiddlers Three&quot; in the Silly Symphony &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot;.
Harpo was also caricatured in Fleischer Studios&#x27; Popeye cartoon &quot;Sock-A-Bye Baby&quot; (1934), in which Harpo&#x27;s harp playing awakens Popeye&#x27;s baby resulting in Popeye punching Marx, apparently fatally (as suggested when Harpo develops a halo and ascends to the heavens). Friz Freleng&#x27;s 1936 Merrie Melodies cartoon &quot;The Coo-Coo Nut Grove&quot; caricatured Harpo, one of multiple celebrities appearing as an animal, as a bird with a red beak who chases a &quot;woman&quot; who is later revealed to be Groucho.

Harpo also took an interest in painting. Some of his works can be seen in his autobiography, in which he recalls having tried to paint a nude female model, but that he had frozen up because he simply did not know how to paint properly. The model, pitying Marx, taught him some basic brush strokes. Eventually, the original project was abandoned in lieu of a painting, by the model herself, of a fully-clothed Harpo. Marx himself was the subject of a sketch by Salvador Dalí, who was Harpo&#x27;s friend and wrote the screenplay &quot;Giraffes on Horseback Salad&quot;.

Harpo recorded an album of harp music for RCA Victor (&quot;Harp by Harpo&quot;, 1952) and two for Mercury Records (&quot;Harpo in Hi-Fi&quot;, 1957; &quot;Harpo at Work&quot;, 1958).

Harpo made television appearances through the 1950s and 60s, including a 1955 episode of &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; in which he and Lucille Ball re-enacted the famous mirror scene from &quot;Duck Soup.&quot; Both Marx and Ball, clad in his typical clothes, portray Harpo. He also appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot; circa 1950. Harpo and Chico appeared in the May 8, 1959, episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; entitled &quot;The Incredible Jewelry Robbery&quot; entirely in pantomime. The episode concluded with a brief surprise appearance by Groucho. In 1960, Marx appeared in his first dramatic role, in an episode of &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot; titled &quot;A Silent Panic&quot;. Harpo plays a deaf-mute who witnesses a gangland murder while working as a &quot;mechanical man&quot; in a department store window. In 1961, to publicize his autobiography &quot;Harpo Speaks!&quot;, he appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Play Your Hunch&quot;, &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party&quot;, Groucho&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

In November 1961, he guest-starred with Carol Burnett in an installment of &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot; entitled &quot;The Wonderful World of Toys&quot;. The show was filmed in Central Park and featured Marx playing &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; on the harp. Other stars appearing in the episode included Eva Gabor, Audrey Meadows, Mitch Miller and Milton Berle. A visit to the set inspired poet Robert Lowell to pen his poem &quot;Harpo Marx.&quot;

Late 1962 brought Harpo&#x27;s final pair of television appearances, which aired within a month of each other. He portrayed a guardian angel on the September 25 episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;. His final role, opposite show star Fess Parker, was as himself on the October 20 episode, &quot;Musicale&quot;, of ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (based on Frank Capra&#x27;s film of the same name).

== Personal life ==

Harpo&#x27;s September 28, 1936, marriage to actress Susan Fleming became public knowledge the next month due to a congratulatory telegram sent by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Harpo&#x27;s marriage, like Gummo&#x27;s, was lifelong (Groucho was divorced three times, Zeppo twice, and Chico once). The couple adopted four children: Bill, Alex, Jimmy, and Minnie. When he was asked by George Burns in 1948 how many children he planned to adopt, he answered, &quot;I&#x27;d like to adopt as many children as I have windows in my house. So when I leave for work, I want a kid in every window, waving goodbye.&quot;

Harpo was good friends with theater critic Alexander Woollcott, alongside whom he became a regular member of the Algonquin Round Table. He once said his main contribution was to be the audience for the quips of other members. In their play &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart based the character of &quot;Banjo&quot; on Harpo. Harpo later played the role in Los Angeles opposite Woollcott, himself the inspiration for the character of Sheridan Whiteside.
In 1961, Harpo published his autobiography, &quot;Harpo Speaks!&quot; Because he did not speak in any of his film appearances, many moviegoers believed he actually was mute. In fact, radio and TV news recordings of his voice can be found on the Internet, in documentaries, and on bonus materials of Marx Brothers DVDs. A reporter who interviewed him in the early 1930s wrote that Harpo &quot;had a deep and distinguished voice, like a professional announcer&quot;, and like his brothers, spoke with a New York accent his entire life. According to those who personally knew him, Harpo&#x27;s voice was much deeper than Groucho&#x27;s, but it also sounded very similar to Chico&#x27;s. His son, Bill, recalled that in private, Harpo had a very deep and mature soft-spoken voice, but that he was &quot;not verbose&quot; like the other Marx brothers, instead preferring to listen and learn from others.

Harpo expressed public support for Zionism and Israel since the 1940s. He often appeared as a speaker at pro-Israel functions throughout the country. He visited Israel in 1963.

Harpo&#x27;s final public appearance came on January 19, 1963, when he announced his retirement, causing singer/comedian Allan Sherman to burst into tears. Comedian Steve Allen, who was in the audience, remembered that Harpo spoke for several minutes about his career, and how he would miss it all, and repeatedly interrupted Sherman when he tried to speak. Allen remembered that although the audience found this rare speech from Harpo charmingly ironic, his personal opinion was that Harpo &quot;wouldn&#x27;t shut up!&quot; Harpo, an avid croquet player, was inducted into the Croquet Hall of Fame in 1979.

== Death ==
On September 26, 1964, Marx was admitted to the intensive care unit of West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Los Angeles for a heart operation.

Marx died in the hospital after surgery on September 28, 1964, aged 75. Harpo&#x27;s death was said to have hit the surviving Marx brothers very hard. Groucho&#x27;s son Arthur Marx, who attended the funeral with most of the Marx family, later said that Harpo&#x27;s funeral was the only time in his life that he ever saw his father cry. In his will, Harpo Marx donated his trademark harp to the State of Israel, where it was later used in an Israeli orchestra. His remains were cremated at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and a portion of his ashes were allegedly scattered in the sand trap at the 7th hole of a golf course in Rancho Mirage, California.

== Legacy ==
Harpo&#x27;s trademark outfit consisted of a trench coat with over-large pockets, red wig (he switched to a blond one for every film after &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; because the red wig photographed dark in black-and-white), top hat, the comical horn heard in his movies, and his ever-present harp. In time, his talent earned him an international reputation as he performed in films as well as in stage shows around the globe. His talent extended to piano and clarinet (on which he played &quot;When My Dreams Come True&quot; in &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;), which, as he had with the harp, Harpo mostly learned independent of professional instruction. Marx&#x27;s son Bill went on to display his own musical abilities, performing his own compositions on piano live in concert alongside harpist Carrol McLaughlin. In 2002, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars, located at 190 E. Tahquitz Way, was dedicated to Harpo&#x27;s memory.

Harpo was frequently invited to parties thrown by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst.

=== Media portrayals ===
Marx was portrayed by the actor J. M. Henry in the 1994 film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;.

Marx was portrayed by actor Daniel Fortus in the Broadway production of &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Boys&quot;, a Broadway musical that ran for 64 performances at the Imperial Theatre from March to May 1970. The show focused on the early days of the Marx Brothers&#x27; act and the importance of their mother Minnie&#x27;s strong hand in guiding and molding them into a successful vaudeville and film comedy team.

Actress Priscilla Lopez played Gino, a character based on Harpo, in 1980&#x27;s Broadway send-up of Hollywood filmmaking &quot;A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine.&quot; This role earned Lopez a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical.

Les Marsden portrayed Harpo in &quot;&quot;, written by Groucho&#x27;s son, Arthur Marx, and Robert Fisher. The play, held at the off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Theatre, boasted a 264 show run from September 8, 1986, to May 3, 1987.

<text>François Édouard Anatole Lucas (; 4 April 1842 – 3 October 1891) was a French mathematician. Lucas is known for his study of the Fibonacci sequence. The related Lucas sequences and Lucas numbers are named after him.

==Biography==
Lucas was born in Amiens and educated at the École Normale Supérieure. He worked in the Paris Observatory and later became a professor of mathematics at the Lycée Saint Louis and the Lycée Charlemagne in Paris.

Lucas served as an artillery officer in the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871.

In 1875, Lucas posed a challenge to prove that the only solution of the Diophantine equation

:formula_1

with &quot;N&quot; &gt; 1 is when &quot;N&quot; = 24 and &quot;M&quot; = 70. This is known as the cannonball problem, since it can be visualized as the problem of taking a square arrangement of cannonballs on the ground and building a square pyramid out of them. It was not until 1918 that a proof (using elliptic functions) was found for this remarkable fact, which has relevance to the bosonic string theory in 26 dimensions. More recently, elementary proofs have been published.

He devised methods for testing the primality of numbers. In 1857, at age 15, Lucas began testing the primality of 2127 − 1, a number with 39 decimal digits, by hand, using Lucas sequences. In 1876, after 19 years of testing, he finally proved that 2127 − 1 was prime; this would remain the largest known Mersenne prime for three-quarters of a century. This may stand forever as the largest prime number proven by hand. Later Derrick Henry Lehmer refined Lucas&#x27;s primality tests and obtained the Lucas–Lehmer primality test.

He worked on the development of the umbral calculus.

Lucas is credited as the first to publish the Kempner function.

Lucas was also interested in recreational mathematics. He found an elegant binary solution to the Baguenaudier puzzle. He also invented the Tower of Hanoi puzzle in 1883, which he marketed under the nickname &quot;N. Claus de Siam&quot;, an anagram of &quot;Lucas d&#x27;Amiens&quot;, and published for the first time a description of the dots and boxes game in 1889.

Lucas died in unusual circumstances. At the banquet of the annual congress of the &quot;Association française pour l&#x27;avancement des sciences&quot;, a waiter dropped some crockery and a piece of broken plate cut Lucas on the cheek. He died a few days later of a severe skin inflammation, probably caused by sepsis, at 49 years old.

<text>A cannabis edible, also known as a cannabis-infused food or simply an edible, is a food item (either homemade or produced commercially) that contains decarboxylated cannabinoids (cannabinoid acids converted to their orally bioactive form) from cannabis extract as an active ingredient. Although &quot;edible&quot; may refer to either a food or a drink, a cannabis-infused drink may be referred to more specifically as a liquid edible or drinkable. Edibles are a way to consume cannabis. Unlike smoking, in which cannabinoids are inhaled into the lungs and pass rapidly into the bloodstream, peaking in about ten minutes and wearing off in a couple of hours, cannabis edibles may take hours to digest, and their effects may peak two to three hours after consumption and persist for around six hours. The food or drink used may affect both the timing and potency of the dose ingested.

Most edibles contain a significant amount of THC, which can induce a wide range of effects, including: heightened sensory perception, relaxation, sleepiness, dizziness, dry mouth, euphoria, depersonalization and/or derealization, hallucinations, paranoia, and decreased or increased anxiety. THC-dominant edibles are consumed for recreational and medical purposes. Some edibles contain a negligible amount of THC and are instead dominant in other cannabinoids, most commonly cannabidiol (CBD). The main characteristic of cannabis edibles is that they take longer to affect users compared to smoked cannabis.

Foods and beverages made from non-psychoactive cannabis products are known as hemp foods.

==History==
=== Eastern ===

The earliest mention of cannabis-infused food was as far back as 2000 B.C. in India. Known as one of the oldest cannabis traditions, Bhang – a cannabis infused drink made with yogurt, nuts, spices, rose water – is an official drink of Holi, highly celebrated and revered festivals celebrated by the people of Hindu community in India revering Shiva or Kali. The oil-solubility of cannabis extracts was also known to ancient Indians, with Sanskrit recipes requiring cannabis to be sautéed in ghee before mixing it with other ingredients.

Majoun (cannabis jam) is another early type of edible first created by the nomadic Berber tribes of North Africa sometime around the 11th century. The traditional Majoun recipe calls for cannabis extract, datura seeds, honey, nuts, kif (a mixture of kief), and sometimes dates and figs.

=== Western ===

The first mention of edibles in Europe appeared in a cookbook titled &quot;De honesta voluptate et valetudine&quot;, which translates to &quot;On Honorable Pleasure and Health&quot; written by Bartolomeo Platina in 1465.

The first cannabis edible recipe appeared in the United States in the early 1960s in a cookbook called &quot;The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book&quot; written by Alice B. Toklas. The recipe is called &quot;Hashish Fudge&quot; and was actually contributed by Alice&#x27;s good friend, Brion Gysin. Although it was omitted from the first American editions, Toklas&#x27; name and her &quot;brownies&quot; became synonymous with cannabis in the growing 1960s counterculture. Since then, many more cannabis cookbooks have been published.

In some U.S. states that have legalized cannabis, edibles have experienced a dramatic rise in sales. Since edibles often look like regular candy, they can be mistakenly eaten by children. Between 2009 and 2015 after cannabis was legalised in Colorado, there was a five-fold increase in the number of children under 10 who were treated in hospital or poison center for exposure to cannabis. Edibles were implicated in over half of these. Variations in dosage and delay in onset of effects (leading to taking of additional doses) also can cause overdose especially in children and inexperienced users. Calls to poison control have dramatically increased since 2008 due to dogs ingesting edibles. In Canada, cannabis-infused food products were legalized in October 2018, but regulatory restrictions and reduced consumer interest may inhibit innovation.

==Chemistry==

== Effects ==
Ingesting cannabis may produce effects that last longer and can be more intense than inhaling cannabis. Different edible formats of cannabinoids may affect the rate of cannabinoid digestion and metabolism, which vary among people. Generally, edible cannabis products are digested more slowly than occurs for aerosol products. Oral administration generally leads to two peaks of concentration, due to enterohepatic circulation. Common side effects of ingesting edibles include increased appetite, dry mouth, and bloodshot eyes.

=== Possible health effects ===
Cannabis edibles contain both delta 9 THC, which is responsible for the psychotropic properties of feeling relaxed and euphoric, and CBD, which may have effects without the psychoactive properties. Such effects may include analgesia, decreased inflammation, decreased spasticity, and anti-seizure effects. Cannabis edibles with CBD can decrease symptoms of psychosis and anxiety. Edible oils, tinctures, pills, and gummies have been prescribed to people with cancer to potentially improve poor appetite, pain, or weight loss. Cannabis edibles may be effective for muscle spasms and pain.

=== Possible side effects ===
Some users of cannabis have reported adverse effects, such as confusion, hallucinations, panic attacks, paranoia, and intense psychotic effects. Cannabis may cause short-term impairments in cognition, memory, alertness, coordination, and balance which can increase risk of falls, especially in older people, and make driving a car dangerous.

Overdoses may occur because the dosage of THC in edibles is impossible to determine without specialized lab equipment and it varies from product to product. Some or all legalized U.S. states require packaged edibles to have dosage on the label; for instance California AB266 requires labeling to include &quot;THC and other cannabinoid amount in milligrams per serving, servings per package, and the THC and other cannabinoid amount in milligrams for the package total&quot;, and states have required the recall of incorrectly labeled products. Overdoses can cause behavioral impairments, such as paranoia, impaired mobility, and nausea. Other risks, as a result of regular long-term cannabis use, include harmful effects to brain development, heart function, memory and cognition, and psychiatric health.

Long-term recreational marijuana use can cause cognitive impairments and also lead to cannabis use disorder (CUD). Symptoms of CUD include lack of motivation, decreased concentration, and loss of interest in other activities, tolerance, and dependence.

== Types ==
=== Edible infusions ===
==== Food ====

The important base to all food edibles is that it has fat that has been infused with THC. In other words, any food that contains butter, oil, milk, or any fatty substance can be turned into an edible. Examples of cannabis-infused foods include baked goods, candy, potato chips, and more. One may not be able to distinguish between regular baked goods and those containing cannabinoids. A mild grassy or cannabis flavor might be detectable if sufficient cannabis quantities are used.

Dawamesc is a cannabis edible found in Algeria and some other Arab countries, made of cannabis tops combined with: &quot;sugar, orange juice, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, musk, pistachios, and pine nuts.&quot;

Happy pizza is a style of pizza in Cambodia which includes cannabis-infused ingredients and has enough THC for psychoactive effects.

Cannabis-infused brownies contain cocoa solids which forms a polysubstance combination.

==== Drink ====
A cannabis-infused drink is a drink infused with THC and can be as potent as a cannabis-infused food.

In U.S. states that have legalized cannabis for recreational use, drinks were about 4% of the cannabis market in 2014 but had fallen to around 1.5% of the market in 2016. Cannabis infused drinks can come in the form of coffee, tea, soda, and alcohol.

List:
* Bhang
* Cannabis tea
* Maltos-Cannabis
* Pabst Blue Ribbon THC-infused seltzer

===== Tincture =====
According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannabis tinctures (&quot;tincturea&quot;) are a type of liquid cannabis extract obtained using ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene glycol and fatty oils as extraction solvents, depending on the type of tincture (and also on the solvent used) it can have a specific mass/volume ratio or a specific therapeutic agents content. Tinctures are potent, alcohol-based cannabis extracts. The solubility of THC in ethanol is greater than 1 g/mL. They are considered edibles as they are meant to be absorbed through the mouth and tongue. Tinctures are generally placed under the tongue using a dropper to allow it to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Tinctures can be added to any food or drink and provides more control over the cannabis dosage compared to cannabis-infused foods or drinks.

==== Dissolvable cannabinoid powder ====
Dissolvable cannabinoid powder is tasteless and odorless, and may elicit effects typical of oral cannabis products. Powders are water-soluble and can be mixed into foods and drinks. Unlike traditional edibles which can take some 90 minutes to take effect, cannabinoid powder may produce effects within 20 minutes due to solubility and uptake of the powder constituents via the digestive tract, allowing rapid effects, especially of THC.

==== CBD edibles ====
Cannabidiol (CBD) edibles are non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating, and contain varying amounts of THC, according to the manufacturer. These edibles provide the effects of cannabis without the psychoactive response to THC.

====Capsule====
Cannabis capsules are considered edibles as they are also metabolized in the gut. Capsules can contain either THC or CBD and are an easier, more convenient way of administering products.

=== Ingredients ===

==== Oil ====

Cannabis oil, or canna-oil, is a product that combines oil with THC. This combination is achieved through a process of infusion, where the THC is extracted from the flowers or concentrates and then added to the oil. The resulting product is a liquid that can be consumed orally, used as a cooking ingredient, or applied topically. Coconut oil is a commonly used oil for infusion, but other options are olive, avocado, and walnut oil.

==== Butter ====
Cannabis butter, or cannabutter, is unsalted butter blended with cannabis and water. Cleaned and dried buds are steeped in melted butter or oil in preparation for consumption. Cannabutter can be added to any baking recipe.

== Safety ==
=== Physical ===
The adverse effects on health are most important when it is used in excessive quantities or with heavy frequency. A study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse entitled &quot;Tasty THC: Promises and Challenges of Cannabis Edibles&quot; found that heavy, long-term cannabis use appeared to worsen brain development, and psychiatric and heart health. On the other hand, the study also discovered that cannabis edibles did not appear to affect pulmonary function nor increase risk for cancer which is one reason people choose cannabis edibles over smoking cannabis. The study concedes that over-consuming cannabis is not lethal; to date, there has never been a death related to the actual toxicity of cannabis. However, there has been one death involving cannabis edibles.

A safety concern with regards to cannabis edibles is overconsumption which is usually caused by the delayed effects of ingested cannabis. Because users do not feel the effects of cannabis edibles immediately, users may eat more to compensate and end up consuming too much THC. As a result, cannabis edibles as such have caused the most healthcare visits as compared to other forms of cannabis consumption. (Additionally, the amount of THC in any individual product may be highly variable.) Additionally people can have very different responses to the same amount of THC with 2.5 mg being enough for some people to begin to feel effects whilst, for others, 50 mg is required. Thus typical advice for newcomers is to &quot;start low and go slow&quot; in order to gauge the over-all initial effects, with 5–10 mg being one neophyte range.

=== Psychological ===
High concentrations of THC have been shown to cause hallucinations, delusions, and anxiety in some people; for most, these symptoms only last as long as that person is intoxicated, but some people can be affected for several days. Cannabis use has been connected with increased use of other drugs, although this connection has never been shown to be causal.

=== Children ===
Many edible cannabis products are packaged in a way which could appeal to children (gummies, etc.), though laws requiring a minimum age to purchase recreational cannabis are universal in jurisdictions that have fully legalized its use, similar to age restrictions on alcohol. As with alcohol and prescription medicines, care should be taken to prevent children from having access to the product, as cannabis edibles have been the main cause of a number of health care visits relating to accidental cannabis consumption by children. In 2022, the US National Poison Data System reported about 6,000 people calling for help after children under the age of 13 ate cannabis edibles, compared to 1,800 calls for CBD and 2,000 for dried marijuana. Children under the age of 5 who ate cannabis edibles is the largest source of marijuana-related calls to poison centers (36% of calls about marijuana product exposures in 2021). Although 65% of calls about a child under 13 who had consumed edibles ultimately involved no or only minor effects, almost 3% involved a child who was experiencing life-threatening symptoms or a similar major effect from consumption of the edibles. About 60% of these calls resulted in medical evaluation, and 20% resulted in hospitalization.

Cannabis intoxication in children under 10 is primarily due to unintentional intoxication through cannabis edibles, such as a child eating what appears to be candy. In such cases, it is typically the only drug consumed by the child, and is much more likely to result in hospitalization than in teenagers. , many children have needed care in an intensive care unit, including intubation. Although deaths and other serious outcomes are &quot;rarely reported&quot;, at least one child has died from eating THC gummies.

<text>Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA) is in Hai District, Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania. The airport serves the cities of Arusha and Moshi. The airport handled 802,731 passengers in 2014 and serves mainly regional flights, and a few long-haul services due to its importance as a leisure destination. It is the largest airport in northern Tanzania by size and passenger volume.

==Overview==
Many international visitors also go to national parks in Tanzania, to the Indian Ocean coast, to islands such as Zanzibar, and to Lake Victoria, reflected in the routes of connecting flights. With a runway almost long, the airport can handle aircraft as large as Boeing 747s and Antonov 124s. The airport served 665,147 passengers in 2012, a 3.7 percent increase over 2011. The airport served 802,731 passengers in 2014, of whom 45 percent were international, 38 percent domestic, and 17 percent transit.

On 19 February 2014, the governments of Tanzania and the Netherlands signed a grant arrangement to rehabilitate the airport, including its aprons, taxiways, and terminal building. The total cost of the project was expected to be €35.5 million, with €15.0 million funded by the Netherlands and the remainder by Tanzania. The design phase, completed by 2014, was financed entirely by the Dutch government. In November 2015, renovations began at the airport, aimed at doubling its capacity from 600,000 passengers to 1.2 million annually. The renovation work was being done by BAM International, a subsidiary of the Royal BAM Group in the Netherlands, at a cost of US$39.7 million, and was expected to be completed in May 2017.

==History==
Kilimanjaro Airport cost US$13 million to build. It opened on 2 December 1971, with construction financed by a long-term loan from the Italian government.

In 1998, it became the first international airport in Africa to be privatised. It is operated by the Kilimanjaro Airport Development Company.

The airport facilitates the tourism industry for visitors travelling to four regions: Arusha Region, Kilimanjaro Region, Mara Region and Manyara Region. Attractions in the regions include Mount Kilimanjaro National Park, Arusha National Park, Tarangire National Park, Lake Manyara National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and Serengeti National Park. The airport bills itself as the &quot;Gateway to Africa&#x27;s Wildlife Heritage&quot;.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines maintain regular, scheduled passenger and cargo service to and from Kilimanjaro International Airport.


Notes:

==Accidents and incidents==
On 18 December 2013, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 (ET-AQW) flying from Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro International Airport (runway length 11,811 feet) mistakenly landed at Arusha Municipal Field (runway length 6,102 feet), overrunning the end of the runway

<doc id="150116" wikidata="Q43084" url="?curid=150116" title="Black pepper">
<text>Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit (the peppercorn), which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. The fruit is a drupe (stonefruit) which is about in diameter (fresh and fully mature), dark red, and contains a stone which encloses a single pepper seed. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as &quot;pepper&quot;, or more precisely as &quot;black pepper&quot; (cooked and dried unripe fruit), &quot;green pepper&quot; (dried unripe fruit), or &quot;white pepper&quot; (ripe fruit seeds).

Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there and in other tropical regions. Ground, dried, and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world&#x27;s most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spiciness from that of capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the Western world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers or mills.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pepper&quot; derives from Old English &quot;pipor&quot;, Latin &quot;piper&quot;, and . The Greek likely derives from Dravidian &quot;pippali&quot;, meaning &quot;long pepper&quot;. Sanskrit &quot;pippali&quot; shares the same meaning.

In the 16th century, people began using &quot;pepper&quot; to also mean the New World chili pepper (genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;), which is not closely related.

==Varieties==

Processed peppercorns come in a variety of colours, any one of which may be used in food preparation, especially common peppercorn sauce.

===Black pepper===
Black pepper is produced from the still-green, unripe drupe of the pepper plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean them and to prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper, accelerating enzymes that cause browning during drying. 

The pepper drupes can also be dried in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper skin around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer containing melanoidin. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. After the peppercorns are dried, pepper powder for culinary uses is obtained by crushing the berries, which may also yield an essential oil by extraction.

===White pepper===
White pepper consists solely of the seed of the ripe fruit of the pepper plant, with the thin darker-coloured skin (flesh) of the fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by a process known as retting, where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week so the flesh of the peppercorn softens and decomposes; rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes the outer layer is removed from the seed through other mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.

Ground white pepper is commonly used in Chinese, Thai, and Portuguese cuisines. It finds occasional use in other cuisines in salads, light-coloured sauces, and mashed potatoes as a substitute for black pepper, because black pepper would visibly stand out. However, white pepper lacks certain compounds present in the outer layer of the drupe, resulting in a different overall flavour.

===Green pepper===
Green pepper, like black pepper, is made from unripe drupes. Dried green peppercorns are treated in a way that retains the green colour, such as with sulfur dioxide, canning, or freeze-drying. Pickled peppercorns, also green, are unripe drupes preserved in brine or vinegar.

Fresh, unpreserved green pepper drupes are used in some cuisines like Thai cuisine and Tamil cuisine. Their flavour has been described as &quot;spicy and fresh&quot;, with a &quot;bright aroma.&quot; They decay quickly if not dried or preserved, making them unsuitable for international shipping.

===Red peppercorns===
Red peppercorns usually consist of ripe peppercorn drupes preserved in brine and vinegar. Ripe red peppercorns can also be dried using the same colour-preserving techniques used to produce green pepper.

===Pink pepper and other plants===
Pink peppercorns are the fruits of the Peruvian pepper tree, &quot;Schinus molle&quot;, or its relative, the Brazilian pepper tree, &quot;Schinus terebinthifolius&quot;, plants from a different family (Anacardiaceae). As they are members of the cashew family, they may cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, for persons with a tree nut allergy.

The bark of &quot;Drimys winteri&quot; (&quot;canelo&quot; or &quot;winter&#x27;s bark&quot;) is used as a substitute for pepper in cold and temperate regions of Chile and Argentina, where it is easily found and readily available. In New Zealand, the seeds of kawakawa (&quot;Piper excelsum&quot;), a relative of black pepper, are sometimes used as pepper; the leaves of &quot;Pseudowintera colorata&quot; (&quot;mountain horopito&quot;) are another replacement for pepper. Several plants in the United States are also used as pepper substitutes, such as field pepperwort, least pepperwort, shepherd&#x27;s purse, horseradish, and field pennycress.

==Plants==

The pepper plant is a perennial woody vine growing up to in height on supporting trees, poles, or trellises. It is a spreading vine, rooting readily where trailing stems touch the ground. The leaves are alternate, entire, long and across. The flowers are small, produced on pendulous spikes long at the leaf nodes, the spikes lengthening up to as the fruit matures. 

Pepper can be grown in soil that is neither too dry nor susceptible to flooding, moist, well-drained, and rich in organic matter. The vines do not do well over an altitude of above sea level. The plants are propagated by cuttings about long, tied up to neighbouring trees or climbing frames at distances of about apart; trees with rough bark are favoured over those with smooth bark, as the pepper plants climb rough bark more readily. Competing plants are cleared away, leaving only sufficient trees to provide shade and permit free ventilation. The roots are covered in leaf mulch and manure, and the shoots are trimmed twice a year. On dry soils, the young plants require watering every other day during the dry season for the first three years. The plants bear fruit from the fourth or fifth year, and then typically for seven years. The cuttings are usually cultivars, selected both for yield and quality of fruit.

A single stem bears 20 to 30 fruiting spikes. The harvest begins as soon as one or two fruits at the base of the spikes begin to turn red, and before the fruit is fully mature, and still hard; if allowed to ripen completely, the fruits lose pungency, and ultimately fall off and are lost. The spikes are collected and spread out to dry in the sun, then the peppercorns are stripped off the spikes.

Black pepper is native either to Southeast Asia or South Asia. Within the genus &quot;Piper&quot;, it is most closely related to other Asian species such as &quot;P. caninum&quot;.

Wild pepper grows in the Western Ghats region of India. Into the 19th century, the forests contained expansive wild pepper vines, as recorded by the Scottish physician Francis Buchanan (also a botanist and geographer) in his book &quot;A journey from Madras through the countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar&quot; (Volume III). However, deforestation resulted in wild pepper growing in more limited forest patches from Goa to Kerala, with the wild source gradually decreasing as the quality and yield of the cultivated variety improved. No successful grafting of commercial pepper on wild pepper has been achieved to date.

==Production and trade==
In 2020, Vietnam was the world&#x27;s largest producer and exporter of black peppercorns, producing 270,192 tonnes or 36% of the world total (table). Other major producers were Brazil, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, China, and Malaysia. Global pepper production varies annually according to crop management, disease, and weather. Peppercorns are among the most widely traded spice in the world, accounting for 20% of all spice imports.

==History==
Black pepper is native to South Asia and Southeast Asia, and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE. J. Innes Miller notes that while pepper was grown in southern Thailand and in Malaysia, its most important source was India, particularly the Malabar Coast, in what is now the state of Kerala. The lost ancient port city of Muziris of the Chera Dynasty, famous for exporting black pepper and various other spices, is mentioned in a number of classical historical sources for its trade with the Roman Empire, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Levant, and Yemen. Peppercorns were a much-prized trade good, often referred to as &quot;black gold&quot; and used as a form of commodity money. The legacy of this trade remains in some Western legal systems that recognize the term &quot;peppercorn rent&quot; as a token payment for something that is, essentially, a gift.

The ancient history of black pepper is often interlinked with (and confused with) that of long pepper, the dried fruit of closely related &quot;Piper longum&quot;. The Romans knew of both and often referred to either as just &quot;piper&quot;. In fact, the popularity of long pepper did not entirely decline until the discovery of the New World and of chili peppers. Chili peppers—some of which, when dried, are similar in shape and taste to long pepper—were easier to grow in a variety of locations more convenient to Europe. Before the 16th century, pepper was being grown in Java, Sunda, Sumatra, Madagascar, Malaysia, and everywhere in Southeast Asia. These areas traded mainly with China, or used the pepper locally. Ports in the Malabar area also served as a stop-off point for much of the trade in other spices from farther east in the Indian Ocean. The Maluku Islands, historically known as the &quot;Spice Islands,&quot; are a region in Indonesia known for producing nutmeg, mace, cloves, and pepper, and were a major source of these spices in the world. The presence of these spices in the Maluku Islands sparked European interest to buy them directly in the 16th century.

===Ancient times===
Black peppercorns were found stuffed in the nostrils of Ramesses II, placed there as part of the mummification rituals shortly after his death in 1213 BCE. Little else is known about the use of pepper in ancient Egypt and how it reached the Nile from the Malabar Coast of India.

Pepper (both long and black) was known in Greece at least as early as the fourth century BCE, though it was probably an uncommon and expensive item that only the very rich could afford.
By the time of the early Roman Empire, especially after Rome&#x27;s conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE, open-ocean crossing of the Arabian Sea direct to Chera dynasty southern India&#x27;s Malabar Coast was near routine. Details of this trading across the Indian Ocean have been passed down in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;. According to the Greek geographer Strabo, the early empire sent a fleet of around 120 ships on an annual trip to India and back. The fleet timed its travel across the Arabian Sea to take advantage of the predictable monsoon winds. Returning from India, the ships travelled up the Red Sea, from where the cargo was carried overland or via the Nile-Red Sea canal to the Nile River, barged to Alexandria, and shipped from there to Italy and Rome. The rough geographical outlines of this same trade route would dominate the pepper trade into Europe for a millennium and a half to come.

With ships sailing directly to the Malabar coast, Malabar black pepper was now travelling a shorter trade route than long pepper, and the prices reflected it. Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; tells us the prices in Rome around 77 CE: &quot;Long pepper ... is 15 denarii per pound, while that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four.&quot; Pliny also complains, &quot;There is no year in which India does not drain the Roman Empire of 50 million sesterces&quot;, and further moralizes on pepper:

He does not state whether the 50 million was the actual amount of money which found its way to India or the total retail cost of the items in Rome, and, elsewhere, he cites a figure of 100 million sesterces.

Black pepper was a well-known and widespread, if expensive, seasoning in the Roman Empire. Apicius&#x27; &quot;De re coquinaria&quot;, a third-century cookbook probably based at least partly on one from the first century CE, includes pepper in a majority of its recipes. Edward Gibbon wrote, in &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, that pepper was &quot;a favorite ingredient of the most expensive Roman cookery&quot;.

===Postclassical Europe===
Pepper was so valuable that it was often used as collateral or even currency. The taste for pepper (or the appreciation of its monetary value) was passed on to those who would see Rome fall. Alaric, king of the Visigoths, included 3,000 pounds of pepper as part of the ransom he demanded from Rome when he besieged the city in the fifth century. After the fall of Rome, others took over the middle legs of the spice trade, first the Persians and then the Arabs; Innes Miller cites the account of Cosmas Indicopleustes, who travelled east to India, as proof that &quot;pepper was still being exported from India in the sixth century&quot;. By the end of the Early Middle Ages, the central portions of the spice trade were firmly under Islamic control. Once into the Mediterranean, the trade was largely monopolized by Italian powers, especially Venice and Genoa. The rise of these city-states was funded in large part by the spice trade.

A riddle authored by Saint Aldhelm, a seventh-century Bishop of Sherborne, sheds some light on black pepper&#x27;s role in England at that time:

It is commonly believed that during the Middle Ages, pepper was often used to conceal the taste of partially rotten meat. No evidence supports this claim, and historians view it as highly unlikely; in the Middle Ages, pepper was a luxury item, affordable only to the wealthy, who certainly had unspoiled meat available, as well. In addition, people of the time certainly knew that eating spoiled food would make them sick. Similarly, the belief that pepper was widely used as a preservative is questionable; it is true that piperine, the compound that gives pepper its spiciness, has some antimicrobial properties, but at the concentrations present when pepper is used as a spice, the effect is small. Salt is a much more effective preservative, and salt-cured meats were common fare, especially in winter. However, pepper and other spices certainly played a role in improving the taste of long-preserved meats.

Archaeological evidence of pepper consumption in late medieval Northern Europe comes from excavations on the Danish-Norwegian flagship, Gribshunden, which sank in the summer of 1495. In 2021, archaeologists recovered more than 2000 peppercorns from the wreck, along with a variety of other spices and exotic foodstuffs including clove, ginger, saffron, and almond. The ship was carrying King Hans to a political summit at the time of its loss. The spices were likely intended for feasts at the summit, which would have included the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Councils of State.
Its exorbitant price during the Middle Ages – and the monopoly on the trade held by Venice – was one of the inducements that led the Portuguese to seek a sea route to India. In 1498, Vasco da Gama became the first person to reach India by sailing around Africa (see Age of Discovery); asked by Arabs in Calicut (who spoke Spanish and Italian) why they had come, his representative replied, &quot;we seek Christians and spices&quot;. Though this first trip to India by way of the southern tip of Africa was only a modest success, the Portuguese quickly returned in greater numbers and eventually gained much greater control of trade on the Arabian Sea. The 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas granted Portugal exclusive rights to the half of the world where black pepper originated.

However, the Portuguese monopolized the spice trade for 150 years. Portuguese even became the lingua franca of the then known world. The spice trade made Portugal rich. However, in the 17th century, the Portuguese lost most of their valuable Indian Ocean trade to the Dutch and the English, who, taking advantage of the Spanish rule over Portugal during the Iberian Union (1580–1640), occupied by force almost all Portuguese interests in the area. The pepper ports of Malabar began to trade increasingly with the Dutch in the period 1661–1663.7
As pepper supplies into Europe increased, the price of pepper declined (though the total value of the import trade generally did not). Pepper, which in the early Middle Ages had been an item exclusively for the rich, started to become more of an everyday seasoning among those of more average means. Today, pepper accounts for one-fifth of the world&#x27;s spice trade.

===China===
It is possible that black pepper was known in China in the second century BCE, if poetic reports regarding an explorer named Tang Meng (唐蒙) are correct. Sent by Emperor Wu to what is now south-west China, Tang Meng is said to have come across something called &quot;jujiang&quot; or &quot;sauce-betel&quot;. He was told it came from the markets of Shu, an area in what is now the Sichuan province. The traditional view among historians is that &quot;sauce-betel&quot; is a sauce made from betel leaves, but arguments have been made that it actually refers to pepper, either long or black.

In the third century CE, black pepper made its first definite appearance in Chinese texts, as &quot;hujiao&quot; or &quot;foreign pepper&quot;. It does not appear to have been widely known at the time, failing to appear in a fourth-century work describing a wide variety of spices from beyond China&#x27;s southern border, including long pepper. By the 12th century, however, black pepper had become a popular ingredient in the cuisine of the wealthy and powerful, sometimes taking the place of China&#x27;s native Sichuan pepper (the tongue-numbing dried fruit of an unrelated plant).

Marco Polo testifies to pepper&#x27;s popularity in 13th-century China, when he relates what he is told of its consumption in the city of Kinsay (Hangzhou): &quot;... Messer Marco heard it stated by one of the Great Kaan&#x27;s officers of customs that the quantity of pepper introduced daily for consumption into the city of Kinsay amounted to 43 loads, each load being equal to 223 lbs.&quot;

During the course of the Ming treasure voyages in the early 15th century, Admiral Zheng He and his expeditionary fleets returned with such a large amount of black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity.

==Traditional medicine, phytochemicals, and research==

Like many eastern spices, pepper was historically both a seasoning and a traditional medicine. Pepper appears in the Buddhist Samaññaphala Sutta, chapter five, as one of the few medicines a monk is allowed to carry. Long pepper, being stronger, was often the preferred medication, but both were used. Black pepper (or perhaps long pepper) was believed to cure several illnesses, such as constipation, insomnia, oral abscesses, sunburn, and toothaches, among others.

Pepper contains phytochemicals, including amides, piperidines, and pyrrolidines.

Pepper is known to cause sneezing. Some sources say that piperine, a substance present in black pepper, irritates the nostrils, causing the sneezing. Few, if any, controlled studies have been carried out to answer the question.

===Nutrition===
One tablespoon (6 grams) of ground black pepper contains moderate amounts of vitamin K (13% of the daily value or DV), iron (10% DV), and manganese (18% DV), with trace amounts of other essential nutrients, protein, and dietary fibre.

==Flavour==

Pepper gets its spicy heat mostly from piperine derived from both the outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper contains between 4.6 and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, as the fermentation and other processing removes the fruit layer (which also contains some of the spicy piperine). Other flavours also commonly develop in this process, some of which are described as off-flavours when in excess: Primarily 3-methylindole (pig manure-like), 4-methylphenol (horse manure), 3-methylphenol (phenolic), and butyric acid (cheese). The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of &quot;Cyperus rotundus&quot;, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/l in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, as well as in some Shiraz wines.

Pepper loses flavour and aroma through evaporation, so airtight storage helps preserve its spiciness longer. Pepper can also lose flavour when exposed to light, which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine. Once ground, pepper&#x27;s aromatics can evaporate quickly; most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason. Handheld pepper mills or grinders, which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns, are used for this as an alternative to pepper shakers that dispense ground pepper. Spice mills such as pepper mills were found in European kitchens as early as the 14th century, but the mortar and pestle used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries, as well.

Enhancing the flavour profile of peppercorns (including piperine and essential oils), prior to processing, has been attempted through the postharvest application of ultraviolet-C light (UV-C).

<doc id="150130" wikidata="Q168700" url="?curid=150130" title="Spandau Prison">
<text>Spandau Prison was a former military prison located in the Spandau borough of West Berlin (present-day Berlin, Germany). Built in 1876, it became a proto-concentration camp under Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, it held seven top Nazi leaders convicted in the Nuremberg trials. After the death of its last prisoner, Rudolf Hess, in August 1987, the prison was demolished and replaced by a shopping centre for the British forces stationed in Germany to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.

== History ==
Spandau Prison was built in 1876 on Wilhelmstraße. It initially served as a military detention centre for the Prussian Army. From 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates. It held up to 600 inmates at that time.

In the aftermath of the Reichstag fire of 1933, opponents of Hitler, and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky, were held there in so-called protective custody. Spandau Prison became a predecessor of sorts of the Nazi concentration camps. While it was formally operated by the Prussian Ministry of Justice, the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates, as Kisch recalled in his memories of the prison. By the end of 1933, the first Nazi concentration camps had been erected (at Dachau, Osthofen, Oranienburg, Sonnenburg, Lichtenburg and the marshland camps around Esterwegen); all remaining prisoners who had been held in so-called protective custody in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps.

After World War II, the prison fell in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, but it was operated by the Four-Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials.

Only seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there. Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947, they were:
Of the seven, three were released after serving their full sentences, while three others (including Raeder and Funk, who were given life sentences) were released earlier due to ill health. Between 1966 and 1987, Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in the prison, and his only companion was the warden, Eugene K. Bird, who became a close friend. Bird wrote a book about Hess&#x27;s imprisonment titled &quot;The Loneliest Man in the World&quot;.

Spandau was one of only two Four-Power organisations to continue to operate after the breakdown of the Allied Control Council; the other was the Berlin Air Safety Centre. The four occupying powers of Berlin alternated control of the prison on a monthly basis, each having the responsibility for a total of three months out of the year. Observing the Four-Power flags that flew at the Allied Control Authority building could determine who controlled the prison.
The prison was demolished in August 1987, largely to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine, after the death of Hess, its final remaining prisoner. To further ensure its erasure, the site was made into a parking facility and a shopping centre, named The Britannia Centre Spandau, nicknamed Hessco&#x27;s after the well-known British supermarket chain Tesco. All materials from the demolished prison were ground to powder and dispersed in the North Sea, or buried at the former RAF Gatow airbase, with the exception of a single set of keys now exhibited in the regimental museum of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers at Berwick Barracks.

==The prison==

The prison, initially designed for a population in the hundreds, was an old brick building enclosed by one wall high, another of , a high wall topped with electrified wire, followed by a wall of barbed wire. In addition, some of the sixty soldiers on guard duty manned six machine-gun armed guard towers 24 hours a day. Due to the number of cells available, an empty cell was left between the prisoners&#x27; cells, to avoid the possibility of prisoners&#x27; communicating in Morse code. Other remaining cells in the wing were designated for other purposes, with one used for the prison library and another for a chapel. The cells were approximately long by wide and high.

===Garden===

The highlight of the prison, from the inmates&#x27; perspective, was the garden. Very spacious given the small number of prisoners using it, the garden space was initially divided into small personal plots that were used by each prisoner in various ways, usually to grow vegetables. Dönitz favoured growing beans, Funk tomatoes and Speer daisies, although the Soviet director subsequently banned flowers for a time. By regulation, all of the produce was to be put toward use in the prison kitchen, but prisoners and guards alike often skirted this rule and indulged in the garden&#x27;s offerings. As prison regulations slackened and as prisoners became either apathetic or too ill to maintain their plots, the garden was consolidated into one large workable area. This suited the former architect Speer, who, being one of the youngest and liveliest of the inmates, later took up the task of refashioning the entire plot of land into a large complex garden, complete with paths, rock gardens and floral displays. On days without access to the garden, for instance when it was raining, the prisoners occupied their time making envelopes together in the main corridor.

===Underutilization===

The Allied powers originally requisitioned the prison in November 1946, expecting it to accommodate a hundred or more war criminals. Besides the sixty or so soldiers on duty in or around the prison at any given time, there were teams of professional civilian warders from each of the four countries, four prison directors and their deputies, four army medical officers, cooks, translators, waiters, porters and others. This was perceived as a drastic misallocation of resources and became a serious point of contention among the prison directors, politicians from their respective countries, and especially the West Berlin government, who were left to foot the bill for Spandau yet suffered from a lack of space in their own prison system. The debate surrounding the imprisonment of seven war criminals in such a large space, with numerous and expensive complementary staff, was only heightened as time went on and prisoners were released.

Acrimony reached its peak after the release of Speer and Schirach in 1966, leaving only one inmate, Hess, remaining in an otherwise under-utilized prison. Various proposals were made to remedy this situation over the years, ranging from moving the prisoners to an appropriately sized wing of another larger, occupied prison, to releasing them; house arrest was also considered. Nevertheless, an official refraining order went into effect, forbidding the approaching of unsettled prisoners, and so the prison remained exclusively for the seven war criminals for the remainder of its existence.

==Life in the prison==

===Prison regulations===
Every facet of life in the prison was strictly set out by an intricate prison regulation scheme designed before the prisoners&#x27; arrival by the Four Powers – France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Compared with other established prison regulations at the time, Spandau&#x27;s rules were quite strict. The prisoners&#x27; outgoing letters to families were at first limited to one page every month, talking with fellow prisoners was prohibited, newspapers were banned, diaries and memoirs were forbidden, visits by families were limited to fifteen minutes every two months, and lights were flashed into the prisoners&#x27; cells every fifteen minutes during the night as a form of suicide watch. A considerable portion of the stricter regulations was either later revised toward the more lenient, or deliberately ignored by prison staff.

The directors and guards of the Western powers (France, Britain, and the United States) repeatedly voiced opposition to many of the stricter measures and made near-constant protest about them to their superiors throughout the prison&#x27;s existence, but they were invariably vetoed by the Soviet Union, which favored a tougher approach. The Soviet Union, which suffered between 10 and 19 million civilian deaths during the war and had pressed at the Nuremberg trials for the execution of all the current inmates, was unwilling to compromise with the Western powers in this regard, both because of the harsher punishment that they felt was justified, and to stress the Communist propaganda line that the capitalist powers had supposedly never been serious about denazification. This contrasted with Werl Prison, which housed hundreds of former officers and other lower-ranking Nazi men who were under a comparatively lax regime. However, a more contemporary consideration was that the continued incarceration of even one Nazi (i.e. Hess) in Spandau ensured a conduit that guaranteed the Soviets access to West Berlin would remain open, and Western commentators frequently accused the Russians of keeping Spandau prison in operation chiefly as a centre for Soviet espionage operations. It was one of the three places in west Berlin where Soviet troops were allowed. The other two are the Soviet Memorial in Tiergarten and the Berlin Air Safety Center

===Daily life===

Every day, prisoners were ordered to rise at 6 a.m., wash, clean their cells and the corridor together, eat breakfast, stay in the garden until lunch-time at noon (weather permitting), have a post-lunch rest in their cells, and then return to the garden. Dinner followed at 5 p.m., after which the prisoners returned to their cells. Lights out was at 10 p.m. Prisoners received a shave and a haircut, if necessary, on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays; they did their own laundry every Monday. This routine, except the time allowed in the garden, changed very little throughout the years, although each of the controlling nations made their own interpretation of the prison regulations.

Within a few years of their arrival at the prison, all sorts of illicit lines of communication with the outside world were opened for the inmates by sympathetic staff. These supplementary lines were free of the censorship placed on authorised communications, and were also virtually unlimited in volume, ordinarily occurring on either Sundays or Thursdays (except during times of total lock-down of exchanges). Every piece of paper given to the prisoners was recorded and tracked, so secret notes were most often written by other means, where the supply went officially unmonitored for the entire duration of the prison&#x27;s existence. Many inmates took full advantage of this. Albert Speer, after having his official request to write his memoirs denied, finally began setting down his experiences and perspectives of his time with the Nazi regime, which were smuggled out and later released as a bestselling book, &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;. Dönitz wrote letters to his former deputy regarding the protection of his prestige in the outside world. When his release was near, he gave instructions to his wife on how best she could help ease his transition back into politics, which he intended, but never actually accomplished. Walther Funk managed to obtain a seemingly constant supply of cognac (all alcohol was banned) and other treats that he would share with other prisoners on special occasions.

==The Spandau Seven==

The prisoners, still subject to the petty personal rivalries and battles for prestige that characterized Nazi party politics, divided themselves into groups: Albert Speer and Rudolf Hess were the loners, generally disliked by the others – the former for his admission of guilt and repudiation of Hitler at the Nuremberg trials, the latter for his antisocial personality and perceived mental instability. The two former grand admirals, Erich Raeder and Karl Dönitz, stayed together, despite their heated mutual dislike. This situation had come about when Dönitz replaced Raeder as Commander in Chief of the German navy in 1943. Baldur von Schirach and Walther Funk were described as &quot;inseparable&quot;. Konstantin von Neurath was, being a former diplomat, amiable and amenable to all the others.

Despite the length of time they spent with each other, remarkably little progress was made in the way of reconciliation. A notable example was Dönitz&#x27;s dislike of Speer being steadfastly maintained for his entire 10-year sentence, with it only coming to a head during the last few days of his imprisonment. Dönitz always believed that Hitler had named him as his successor due to Speer&#x27;s recommendation, which had led to Dönitz being tried at Nuremberg (Speer always denied this).

There is also a collection of medical reports concerning Baldur von Schirach, Albert Speer, and Rudolf Hess made during their confinement at Spandau, which have survived.

===Albert Speer===
===Erich Raeder and Karl Dönitz===

&quot;The Admiralty&quot;, as the other prisoners referred to Dönitz and Raeder, were often teamed together for various tasks. Raeder, with a liking for rigid systems and organization, designated himself as chief librarian of the prison library, with Dönitz as his assistant. Each designed their own sleeve insignia for both chief librarian (a silver book) and assistant chief librarian (a gold book) which were woven with the appropriate colored thread. Both men often withheld themselves from the other prisoners, with Dönitz claiming for his entire ten years in prison that he was still the rightful head of the German state (he also got one vote in the 1954 West German presidential election), and Raeder having contempt for the insolence and lack of discipline endemic in his nonmilitary fellow prisoners. Despite preferring to stay together, the two of them continued their wartime feud and argued most of the time over whether Raeder&#x27;s battleships or Dönitz&#x27;s U-boats were responsible for losing the war. This feud often resulted in fights. After Dönitz&#x27;s release in 1956, he wrote two books, one on his early life, &quot;My Ever-Changing Life&quot;, and one on his time as an admiral, &quot;Ten Years and Twenty Days&quot;. Raeder, in failing health and seemingly close to death, was released in 1955 and died in 1960.

===Rudolf Hess===
Rudolf Hess, sentenced to life but not released due to ill health (as were Raeder, Funk, or Neurath), served the longest sentence out of the seven and was by far the most demanding of the prisoners. Regarded as being the &#x27;laziest man in Spandau&#x27;, Hess avoided all forms of work that he deemed below his dignity, such as pulling weeds. He was the only one of the seven who almost never attended the prison&#x27;s Sunday church service. A paranoid hypochondriac, he repeatedly complained of all forms of illness, mostly stomach pains, and was suspicious of all food given to him, always taking the dish placed farthest away from him as a means of avoiding being poisoned. His alleged stomach pains often caused wild and excessive moans and cries of pain throughout the day and night, and their authenticity was repeatedly the subject of debate between the prisoners and the prison directors.

Raeder, Dönitz, and Schirach were contemptuous of this behaviour, and viewed it as cries for attention or as a means to avoid work. Speer and Funk, acutely aware of the likely psychosomatic nature of the illness, were more accommodating to Hess. Speer, in a move that invoked the ire of his fellow prisoners, would often tend to Hess&#x27;s needs, bringing him his coat when he was cold and coming to his defence when a director or guard was attempting to coax Hess out of bed and into work. Hess occasionally wailed in pain at night, affecting the sleep of the other prisoners. The prison&#x27;s medical officer would inject Hess with what was described as a &quot;sedative&quot;, but was in reality distilled water, and succeeded in putting Hess to sleep. The fact that Hess repeatedly shirked duties the others had to bear and received other preferential treatment because of his illness irked the other prisoners, and earned him the title of &quot;His imprisoned Lordship&quot; by the admirals, who often mocked him and played mean-spirited pranks on him. 

Hess was also unique among the prisoners in that, as a matter of dignity, he refused all visitors for more than twenty years, finally consenting to see his adult son and wife in 1969 after suffering from a perforated ulcer that required treatment at a hospital outside the prison. Fearing for his mental health now that he was the sole remaining inmate, and assuming that his death was imminent, the prison directors agreed to slacken most of the remaining regulations, moving Hess to the more spacious former chapel space, giving him a water heater to allow the making of tea or coffee when he liked, and permanently unlocking his cell so that he could freely access the prison&#x27;s bathing facilities and library.

Hess was frequently moved from room to room every night for security reasons. He was often taken to the British Military Hospital not far from the prison, where the entire second floor of the hospital was cordoned off for him. He remained under heavy guard while in hospital. Ward security was provided by soldiers including Royal Military Police Close Protection personnel. External security was provided by one of the British infantry battalions then stationed in Berlin. On some unusual occasions, the Soviets relaxed their strict regulations; during these times, Hess was allowed to spend extra time in the prison garden, and one of the wardens from the superpowers took Hess outside the prison walls for a stroll, and sometimes dinner, at a nearby Berlin restaurant, in a private room.

==In popular culture==
The British band Spandau Ballet got their name after a friend of the band, journalist and DJ Robert Elms, saw the words &#x27;Spandau Ballet&#x27; scrawled on the wall of a nightclub lavatory during a visit to Berlin. The graffiti referred to the way a condemned individual would twitch and &quot;dance&quot; at the end of the rope due to the standard drop method of hangings used at Spandau Prison and was in the tradition of similar gallows humour expressions such as &quot;dancing the Tyburn jig.&quot;

The prison featured in the 1985 film &quot;Wild Geese II&quot;, about a fictional group of mercenaries who are assigned to kidnap Rudolf Hess (played by Laurence Olivier), and in the book &quot;Spandau Phoenix&quot; by Greg Iles, which is a fictional account of Hess and Spandau Prison.

<text>The endgame (or ending) is the final stage of a chess game which occurs after the middlegame. It begins when few pieces are left on the board.

The line between the middlegame and the endgame is often not clear, and may occur gradually or with a quick exchange of pieces. The endgame, however, tends to have different characteristics from the middlegame, and the players have correspondingly different strategic concerns. In particular, pawns become more important as endgames often revolve around attempts to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth . The king, which normally is kept safe during the game, becomes active in the endgame, as it can help escort pawns to promotion, attack enemy pawns, protect other pieces, and restrict the movement of the enemy king. Not all chess games reach an endgame; some of them end earlier.

All chess positions with up to seven pieces on the board have been solved by endgame tablebases, so the outcome (win, loss, or draw) of best play by both sides in such positions is known, and endgame textbooks teach this best play. However, most endgames are not solved, so textbooks teach useful strategies and tactics about them. The body of chess theory devoted to endgames is known as endgame theory. Compared to opening theory, which changes frequently, giving way to middlegame positions that fall in and out of popularity, endgame theory is less subject to change.

Many endgame studies have been composed; they consist of endgame positions which are solved by finding a win for White when there is no obvious way to win, or finding a draw when White appears to lose. In some compositions, the starting position would be unlikely to occur in an actual game; but if the starting position is not artificial, the composition may be incorporated into endgame theory.

Endgames are usually classified based on the type of pieces that remain.
==The start of the endgame==
There is no strict criterion for when an endgame begins, and different authors have different opinions. The former World Chess Champion Alexander Alekhine said, &quot;We cannot define when the middle game ends and the endgame starts.&quot; Using the standard system for chess piece relative value, Speelman considers that endgames are positions in which each player has thirteen or fewer points in (not counting the king). Alternatively, they are positions in which the king can be used actively, but there are some famous exceptions to that. Minev characterizes endgames as positions having four or fewer pieces other than kings and pawns. Fine considers endgames to be positions without queens. Flear considers endgames to be positions where both players have at most one piece (other than kings and pawns) whereas Dvoretsky considers them to be positions in which at least one player has such a material configuration. Some problem composers believe that the endgame starts when the player to move can force a win or a draw against any variation of moves.

Alburt and Krogius give three characteristics of an endgame:

# Endgames favor an aggressive king.
# Passed pawns increase greatly in importance.
# Zugzwang is often a factor in endgames and rarely in other stages of the game.

Mednis and Crouch address the question of what constitutes an endgame negatively. They believe that the game is in the endgame if these apply:
* better ;
* open for attacking;
* vulnerable king position;
* misplaced pieces.

==General considerations==
Generally, the player having a material advantage tries to exchange pieces but avoids exchanging pawns in the endgame. Some exceptions to this are:

# Endings in which both sides have two rooks and some pawns – the player with more pawns should not exchange a pair of rooks
# Endings in which both sides have bishops on opposite colors with other pieces – the stronger side should avoid exchanging the other pieces
# Endings in which all the pawns are on the same side of the board – the stronger side should try to create a passed pawn by exchanging pawns

Usually, endings with pawns on both sides of the board are easier to win and the first player to promote a pawn to a queen wins if the opponent is unable to do so on the turn immediately after.

Max Euwe and Walter Meiden give these five generalizations:
# In king and pawn endings, an extra pawn is decisive in more than 90 percent of the cases.
# In endgames with pieces and pawns, an extra pawn is a winning advantage in 50 to 60 percent of the cases. It becomes more decisive if the stronger side has a positional advantage.
# The king plays an important role in the endgame.
# Initiative is more important in the endgame than in other phases of the game. In rook endgames, the initiative is usually worth at least a pawn.
# Two connected passed pawns are very strong. If they reach their sixth rank, they are as powerful as a rook.

==Common types of endgames==

===Endings with no pawns===
====Basic checkmates====

Many endings without pawns have been solved, that is, best play for both sides from any starting position can be determined, and the outcome (win, loss, or draw) is known. For example, the following are all wins for the side with pieces:
#king and queen against a king—A queen, with its king, can easily checkmate a lone king.
#king and rook against a king
#king and two bishops of opposite color against a king
#king, bishop, and knight against a king

See for a demonstration of the first two checkmates, which are generally taught in textbooks as basic knowledge. The last two are sometimes taught as basic knowledge as well, although the procedure for mate with bishop and knight is relatively difficult and many tournament players do not know it.

====Other endings with no pawns====
The ending of king and bishop versus king is a trivial draw, in that checkmate is not even possible. Likewise for king and knight versus king.

Two knights cannot force checkmate against a lone king (see Two knights endgame). While there is a board position that allows two knights to checkmate a lone king, such requires a careless move by the weaker side to execute. If the weaker side also has material (besides the king), checkmate is sometimes possible. The winning chances with two knights are insignificant except against a few pawns. () The procedure can be long and difficult. In competition, the fifty-move rule will often result in the game being drawn first.

The endgame of king and three knights against king will not normally occur in a game, but it is of theoretical interest. The three knights win.

Two of the most common pawnless endgames (when the defense has a piece in addition to the king) are (1) a queen versus a rook and (2) a rook and bishop versus a rook. A queen wins against a rook — see Queen versus rook endgame. A rook and bishop versus a rook is generally a theoretical draw, but the defense is difficult and there are winning positions (see Rook and bishop versus rook endgame).
===King and pawn endings===
King and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides. International Master Cecil Purdy said, &quot;Pawn endings are to chess as putting is to golf.&quot; Any endgame with pieces and pawns has the possibility of into a pawn ending.

In king and pawn endings, an extra pawn is decisive in more than 90 percent of the cases. Getting a passed pawn is crucial (a &quot;passed pawn&quot; is one which does not have an opposing pawn on its file or on adjacent files on its way to promotion). Nimzowitch once said that a passed pawn has a &quot;lust to expand&quot;. An &quot;&quot; is particularly deadly. The point of this is a deflection – while the defending king is preventing the outside passed pawn from queening, the attacking king wins pawns on the other side.

&quot;Opposition&quot; is an important technique that is used to gain an advantage. When two kings are in opposition, they are on the same (or ) with one empty square separating them. The player having the move &quot;loses&quot; the opposition. That player must move the king and allow the opponent&#x27;s king to advance. However, the opposition is a means to an end, which is penetration into the enemy position. The attacker should try to penetrate with or without the opposition. The tactics of triangulation and zugzwang as well as the theory of corresponding squares are often decisive.

Unlike most positions, king and pawn endgames can usually be analyzed to a definite conclusion, given enough skill and time. An error in a king and pawn endgame almost always turns a win into a draw or a draw into a loss – there is little chance for recovery. Accuracy is most important in these endgames. There are three fundamental ideas in these endgames: opposition, triangulation, and the Réti manoeuvre.

====King and pawn versus king====
This is one of the most basic endgames. A draw results if the defending king can reach the square in front of the pawn or the square in front of that (or capture the pawn). If the attacking king can prevent that, the king will assist the pawn in being promoted to a queen or rook, and checkmate can be achieved. A is an exception because the king may not be able to get out of the way of its pawn.
===Knight and pawn endings===
Knight and pawn endgames feature clever manoeuvring by the knights to capture opponent pawns. While a knight is poor at chasing a passed pawn, it is the ideal piece to block a passed pawn. Knights cannot lose a tempo, so knight and pawn endgames have much in common with king and pawn endgames. As a result, Mikhail Botvinnik stated, “A knight ending is really a pawn ending.”

====Knight and pawn versus knight====

This is generally a draw since the knight can be sacrificed for the pawn, however, the king and knight must be covering squares in the pawn&#x27;s path. If the pawn reaches the seventh rank and is supported by its king and knight, it usually promotes and wins. In this position, White to move wins: 1. b6 Nb7! 2. Ne6! Na5 3. Kc8! N-any 4. Nc7#. If Black plays the knight to any other square on move 2, White plays Kc8 anyway, threatening b7+ and promotion if the knight leaves the defense of the b7 square. Black to move draws starting with 1... Nc4 because White cannot gain a tempo.
===Bishop and pawn endings===
Bishop and pawn endgames come in two distinctly different variants. If the opposing bishops go on the same color of square, the mobility of the bishops is a crucial factor. A &quot;&quot; is one that is hemmed in by pawns of its own color, and has the burden of defending them.

The adjacent diagram, from Molnar–Nagy, Hungary 1966, illustrates the concepts of good bishop versus bad bishop, opposition, zugzwang, and outside passed pawn. White wins with 1. e6! (vacating e5 for his king) 1... Bxe6 2. Bc2! (threatening Bxg6) 2... Bf7 3. Be4! (threatening Bxc6) 3... Be8 4. Ke5! (seizing the opposition [i.e. the kings are two orthogonal squares apart, with the other player on move] and placing Black in zugzwang—he must either move his king, allowing White&#x27;s king to penetrate, or his bishop, allowing a decisive incursion by White&#x27;s bishop) 4... Bd7 5. Bxg6!
====Bishop and pawn versus bishop on the same color====

Two rules given by Luigi Centurini in the 19th century apply:
* The game is a draw if the defending king can reach any square in front of the pawn that is opposite in color to the squares the bishops travel on.
* If the defending king is behind the pawn and the attacking king is near the pawn, the defender can draw only if his king is attacking the pawn, he has the opposition, and his bishop can move on two diagonals that each have at least two squares available (other than the square it is on). This is the case for and the whose promotion square is not the same color as the bishop.

The position in the second diagram shows a winning position for White, although it requires accurate play. A always wins if the defending bishop only has one long diagonal available.

This position was reached in a game from the 1965 Candidates Tournament between Lajos Portisch and former World Champion Mikhail Tal. White must defend accurately and utilize reciprocal zugzwang. Often he has only one or two moves that avoid a losing position. Black was unable to make any progress and the game was drawn on move 83.
====Bishops on opposite colors====
Endings with &quot;bishops of opposite color&quot;, meaning that one bishop works on the light squares, the other one working on dark squares, are notorious for their character. Many players in a poor position have saved themselves from a loss by trading down to such an endgame. They are often drawn even when one side has a two-pawn advantage, since the weaker side can create a blockade on the squares on which his bishop operates. The weaker side should often try to make their bishop &quot;&quot; by placing their pawns on the same color of their bishop in order to defend their remaining pawns, thereby creating an impregnable fortress.
===Bishop versus knight endings (with pawns)===
Current theory is that bishops are better than knights about 60 percent of the time in the endgame. The more symmetrical the pawn structure, the better it is for the knight. The knight is best suited at an outpost in the center, particularly where it cannot easily be driven away, whereas the bishop is strongest when it can attack targets on both sides of the board or a series of squares of the same color.

Fine and Benko give four conclusions:
# In general the bishop is better than the knight.
# When there is a material advantage, the difference between the bishop and knight is not very important. However, the bishop usually wins more easily than the knight.
# If the material is even, the position should be drawn. However, the bishop can exploit positional advantages more efficiently.
# When most of the pawns are on the same color as the bishop (i.e. a bad bishop), the knight is better.

====Bishop and pawn versus knight====

This is a draw if the defending king is in front of the pawn or sufficiently close. The defending king can occupy a square in front of the pawn of the opposite color as the bishop and cannot be driven away. Otherwise the attacker can win.
====Knight and pawn versus bishop====

This is a draw if the defending king is in front of the pawn or sufficiently near. The bishop is kept on a diagonal that the pawn must cross, and the knight cannot both block the bishop and drive the defending king away. Otherwise, the attacker can win.
===Rook and pawn endings===

Rook and pawn endgames are often drawn in spite of one side having an extra pawn. (In some cases, two extra pawns are not enough to win.) An extra pawn is harder to convert to a win in a rook and pawn endgame than any other type of endgame except a bishop endgame with bishops on opposite colors. Rook endings are probably the deepest and most well studied endgames. They are a common type of endgame in practice, occurring in about 10 percent of all games (including ones that do not reach an endgame). These endgames occur frequently because rooks are often the last pieces to be exchanged. The ability to play these endgames well is a major factor distinguishing masters from amateurs. When both sides have two rooks and pawns, the stronger side usually has more winning chances than if each had only one rook.

Three rules of thumb regarding rooks are worth noting:
# Rooks should almost always be placed behind passed pawns, whether one&#x27;s own or the opponent&#x27;s (the Tarrasch rule). A notable exception is in the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook, if the pawn is not too far advanced. In that case, the best place for the opposing rook is in front of the pawn.
# Rooks are very poor defenders relative to their attacking strength, so it is often good to sacrifice a pawn for activity.
# A rook on the seventh rank can wreak mayhem among the opponent&#x27;s pawns. The power of a rook on the seventh rank is not confined to the endgame. The classic example is Capablanca versus Tartakower, New York 1924 (see annotated game without diagrams or Java board)

An important winning position in the rook and pawn versus rook endgame is the so-called Lucena position. If the side with the pawn can reach the Lucena position, he wins. There are several important drawing techniques, however, such as the Philidor position, the &quot;back-rank defense&quot; (rook on the first rank, for and only), the &quot;frontal defense&quot;, and the &quot;short-side defense&quot;. A general rule is that if the weaker side&#x27;s king can get to the queening square of the pawn, the game is a draw and otherwise it is a win, but there are many exceptions.

====Rook and pawn versus rook====
Generally (but not always), if the defending king can reach the queening square of the pawn the game is a draw (see Philidor position), otherwise the attacker usually wins (if it is not a rook pawn) (see Lucena position). The winning procedure can be very difficult and some positions require up to sixty moves to win. If the attacking rook is two files from the pawn and the defending king is cut off on the other side, the attacker normally wins (with a few exceptions). The rook and pawn versus rook is the most common of the &quot;piece and pawn versus piece&quot; endgames.

The most difficult case of a rook and pawn versus a rook occurs when the attacking rook is one file over from the pawn and the defending king is cut off on the other side. Siegbert Tarrasch gave the following rules for this case: For a player defending against a pawn on the fifth or even sixth ranks to obtain a draw, even after his king has been forced off the queening square, the following conditions must obtain: The file on which the pawn stands divides the board into two unequal parts. The defending rook must stand in the longer part and give checks from the flank at the greatest possible distance from the attacking king. Nothing less than a distance of three files makes it possible for the rook to keep on giving check. Otherwise it would ultimately be attacked by the king. The defending king must stand on the smaller part of the board.

(See the &quot;short side defense&quot; at Rook and pawn versus rook endgame.)

====Quotation====
*&quot;All rook and pawn endings are drawn.&quot;

The context of this quote shows it is a comment on the fact that a small advantage in a rook and pawn endgame is less likely to be converted into a win. Mark Dvoretsky said that the statement is &quot;semi-joking, semi-serious&quot;. This quotation has variously been attributed to Savielly Tartakower and to Siegbert Tarrasch. Writers Victor Korchnoi, John Emms, and James Howell, attribute the quote to Tartakower, whereas Dvoretsky, Andrew Soltis, Karsten Müller, and Kaufeld &amp; Kern attribute it to Tarrasch. John Watson attributed to Tarrasch &quot;by legend&quot; and says that statistics do not support the statement. Benko wonders if it was due to Vasily Smyslov. Attributing the quote to Tarrasch may be a result of confusion between this quote and the Tarrasch rule concerning rooks. The source of the quote is currently unresolved. Benko noted that although the saying is usually said with tongue in cheek, it is truer in practice than one might think.

===Queen and pawn endings===
In queen and pawn endings, passed pawns have paramount importance, because the queen can escort it to the queening square alone. The advancement of the passed pawn outweighs the number of pawns. The defender must resort to perpetual check. These endings are frequently extremely long affairs. For an example of a queen and pawn endgame see Kasparov versus the World – Kasparov won although he had fewer pawns because his was more advanced. For the ending with a queen versus a pawn, see Queen versus pawn endgame.

====Queen and pawn versus queen====
The queen and pawn versus queen endgame is the second most common of the &quot;piece and pawn versus piece&quot; endgames, after rook and pawn versus rook. It is very complicated and difficult to play. Human analysts were not able to make a complete analysis before the advent of endgame tablebases. This combination is a win less frequently than the equivalent ending with rooks.
===Rook versus a minor piece===

The difference in between a rook and a is about two points or a little less, the equivalent of two pawns.
* A rook and a pawn versus a minor piece: normally a win for the rook but there are some draws. In particular, if the pawn is on its sixth rank and is a or , and the bishop does not control the pawn&#x27;s promotion square, the position is a draw. See Wrong bishop.
* A rook versus a minor piece: normally a draw but in some cases the rook wins, see pawnless chess endgame.
* A rook versus a minor piece and one pawn: usually a draw but the rook may win.
* A rook versus a minor piece and two pawns: usually a draw but the minor piece may win.
* A rook versus a minor piece and three pawns: a win for the minor piece.

If both sides have pawns, the result essentially depends on how many pawns the minor piece has for the exchange:
* No pawns for the exchange (i.e. same number of pawns on each side): the rook usually wins.
* One pawn for the exchange (i.e. minor piece has one more pawn): the rook usually wins, but it is technically difficult. If all of the pawns are on one side of the board it is usually a draw.
* Two pawns for the exchange: this is normally a draw. With a bishop either side may have winning chances. With a knight, the rook may have winning chances and the defense is difficult for the knight if the pawns are scattered.
* Three pawns for the exchange: this is normally a win for the minor piece.

===Two minor pieces versus a rook===

In an endgame, two are approximately equivalent to a rook plus one pawn. The pawn structure is important. The two pieces have the advantage if the opponent&#x27;s pawns are weak. Initiative is more important in this endgame than any other. The general outcome can be broken down by the number of pawns.
* The two pieces have one or more extra pawns: always a win for the pieces.
* Same number of pawns: usually a draw but the two pieces win more often than the rook.
* The rook has one extra pawn: usually a draw but either side may have winning chances, depending on positional factors.
* The rook has two additional pawns: normally a win for the rook.
===Queen versus two rooks===

Without pawns this is normally drawn, but either side wins in some positions. A queen and pawn are normally equivalent to two rooks, which is usually a draw if both sides have an equal number of additional pawns. Two rooks plus one pawn versus a queen is also generally drawn. Otherwise, if either side has an additional pawn, that side normally wins. While playing for a draw, the defender (the side with fewer pawns) should try to avoid situations in which the queen and rooks are forcibly traded into a losing king and pawn endgame.
===Queen versus rook and minor piece===

If there are no pawns, the position is usually drawn, but either side wins in some positions. A queen is equivalent to a rook and bishop plus one pawn. If the queen has an additional pawn it wins, but with difficulty. A rook and bishop plus two pawns win over a queen.
===Queen versus rook===
* Without pawns, the queen normally wins but it can be difficult and there are some drawn positions (see ).
* If the rook has one pawn drawing positions are possible, depending on the pawn and the proximity of the rook and king. See . Otherwise the queen wins.
* If the rook has two connected pawns the position is usually a draw. For any other two pawns, the queen wins except in the positions where a fortress with one pawn can be reached.
* If the rook has three or more pawns the position is usually a draw but there are cases in which the queen wins and some in which the rook wins.
* If the queen also has a pawn or pawns it wins except in unusual positions.
===Piece versus pawns===

There are many cases for a lone piece versus pawns. The position of the pawns is critical.
* Minor piece versus pawns: A minor piece versus one or two pawns is normally a draw, unless the pawns are advanced. Three pawns either draw or win, depending on how advanced they are. Three connected pawns win against a bishop if they all get past their fourth rank. A knight can draw against three connected pawns if none are beyond their fourth rank.
* Rook versus pawns: If the rook&#x27;s king is not near, one pawn draws and two pawns win. If the rook&#x27;s king is near, the rook wins over one or two pawns and draws against three. Four pawns usually win but the rook may be able to draw, depending on their position. More than four pawns win against the rook.
* Queen versus pawns: A queen can win against any number of pawns, depending on how advanced they are. The queen would win against eight pawns on the second rank but one pawn on the seventh rank may draw (see Queen versus pawn endgame) and two advanced pawns may win.
==Effect of tablebases on endgame theory==
Endgame tablebases have made some minor corrections to historical endgame analysis, but they have made some more significant changes to endgame theory too. (The fifty-move rule is not taken into account in these studies.) Major changes to endgame theory as a result of tablebases include the following:
* (see ). There are two changes here enabling the rook to put up a better defense, but the queen still wins. (a) People usually opt for a second-rank defense with the rook on the second rank and the king behind it (or symmetrical positions on the other edges of the board). Tablebases show that a third-rank defense takes a while to breach, which is difficult for a human to do. (b) People had assumed that the rook needs to stay as close to the king for as long as possible, but tablebases show that it is best to move the rook away from the king at some earlier point.
* . Tablebases have shown that this can be won in many more positions than was thought, but the logic of the moves is presently beyond human understanding.
* . This was thought to be a draw due to the existence of a drawing fortress position, but the queen can win most of the time by preventing the bishops from getting to the fortress. However, it can take up to 71 moves to force a win.

* . This was thought to be a draw, and indeed it generally is, but the queen has more winning positions than was previously thought. Also, many analysts gave a position (see diagram) that they thought was a draw but it is actually a win for the queen. In the diagram, White checkmates in 43 moves, starting with 1. Qc7 (the only winning move). Nunn says &quot;The general result is undoubtedly a draw, but there are many losing positions, some of them very lengthy.&quot; On the other hand, 73.44% of positions are won by the queen, almost all of the remainder being positions where the side with two knights can immediately capture the queen – 97.59% of positions with the side with the queen to move are won by that side. However, these percentages can be misleading, and most &quot;general results&quot; are based on the analysis of grandmasters using the tablebase data. For instance, although nearly 90 percent of all of these positions are wins for the queen, it is generally a draw if the king is not separated from the knights and they are on reasonable squares.
* . This was thought to be a draw but the bishops generally win. However, it takes up to 66 moves. The position in the diagram was thought to be a draw for over one hundred years, but tablebases show that White wins in 57 moves. All of the long wins go through this type of semi-fortress position. It takes several moves to force Black out of the temporary fortress in the corner; then precise play with the bishops prevents Black from forming the temporary fortress in another corner. Before computer analysis, Speelman listed this position as unresolved, but &quot;probably a draw&quot;.
* . This was thought to be a draw but the queen and bishop usually win. It takes up to 84 moves.
* . This was thought to be a draw but the rook and bishop generally win. It takes up to 98 moves. Magnus Carlsen successfully converted this configuration within the 50-move limit against Francisco Vallejo Pons in 2019. Even with best play from the starting RB v BN position, the stronger side would have won a piece well within 50 moves.
* . The second-rank defense was discovered using tablebases.
==Longest known forced win==




In May 2006 a record-shattering 517-move endgame was announced (see first diagram). Marc Bourzutschky found it using a program written by Yakov Konoval. Black&#x27;s first move is 1... Rd7+ and White wins the rook in 517 moves. This was determined using the easier-to-calculate depth-to-conversion method, which assumes that the two sides are aiming respectively to reduce the game to a simpler won ending or to delay that conversion. Such endgames do not necessarily represent strictly optimal play from both sides, as Black may delay checkmate by allowing an earlier conversion or White may accelerate it by delaying a conversion (or not making one at all). In September 2009, it was found that the distance to &quot;mate&quot; (not conversion) in that position was 545 (see the first diagram). The same researchers later confirmed that this (along with variations of it) is the longest seven-piece pawnless endgame, and that, with pawns, the longest seven-piece endgame is the one depicted in the second diagram. White takes 6 moves to promote the pawn to a Knight (leading to a position similar to the first diagram), after which it takes another 543 moves to win the game, for a total of 549 moves. 

The fifty-move rule was ignored in the calculation of these results and lengths, and as of 2014, these games could never occur, because of the seventy-five-move rule.

==Endgame classification==

Endgames can be classified by the material on the board. The standard classification system lists each player&#x27;s material, including the kings, in the following order: king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, pawn. Each piece is designated by its algebraic symbol.

For example, if White has a king and pawn, and Black has only a king, the endgame is classified KPK. If White has bishop and knight, and Black has a rook, the endgame is classified KBNKR. KNBKR would not be standard.

In positions with two or more bishops on the board, a &quot;bishop signature&quot; may be added to clarify the relationship between the bishops. Two methods have been used. The informal method is to designate one color of squares as &quot;x&quot; and the other color as &quot;y&quot;. An endgame of KBPKB can be written KBPKB x-y if the bishops are opposite-colored, or KBPKB x-x if the bishops are same-colored. The more formal method is to use a four digit suffix of the form abcd:
*a = number of White light-squared bishops
*b = number of White dark-squared bishops
*c = number of Black light-squared bishops
*d = number of Black dark-squared bishops
Thus, the aforementioned endgame can be written KBPKB_1001 for opposite-color bishops, and KBPKB_1010 for same-color bishops.

In positions with one or more rooks on the board and where one or both players have one or both castling rights, a castling signature may be added to indicate which castling rights exist. The method is to use a one to four character suffix formed by omitting up to three characters from the string KQkq.

Thus the endgame where White has bishop and rook and Black has a rook can be written KBRKR if no castling rights exist or KBRKR_Kq if White may castle on the king&#x27;s side and Black may castle on the queen&#x27;s side. In case the position also has two or more bishops the castling signature follows the bishop signature as in KBBNKRR_1100_kq.

GBR code is an alternative method of endgame classification.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Endings&quot; (&quot;ECE&quot;) by Chess Informant had a different classification scheme, somewhat similar to the &quot;ECO&quot; codes, but it is not widely used. The full system is a 53-page index that was contained in the book &quot;The Best Endings of Capablanca and Fischer&quot;. The code starts with a letter representing the most powerful piece on the board, not counting kings. The order is queen, rook, bishop, knight, and then pawn. (Figurines are used to stand for the pieces.) Each of these has up to 100 subclassifications, for instance R00 through R99. The first digit is a code for the pieces. For instance, R0 contains all endgames with a rook versus pawns and a rook versus a lone king, R8 contains the double rook endgames, and R9 contains the endings with more than four pieces. The second digit is a classification for the number of pawns. For instance, R30 contains endgames with a rook versus a rook without pawns or with one pawn and R38 are rook versus rook endings in which one player has two extra pawns.

==Frequency table==
The table below lists the most common endings in actual games by percentage (percentage of games, not percentage of endings; generally pawns go along with the pieces).

<text>Heineken [[Naamloze vennootschap|N.V.]] (), branded as The Heineken Company is a Dutch multinational brewing company, founded in 1864 by Gerard Adriaan Heineken in Amsterdam. Heineken owns over 165 breweries in more than 70 countries. It produces 348 international, regional, local and speciality beers and ciders and employs approximately 85,000 people.

With an annual beer production of 24.14 billion litres in 2019, and global revenues of 23.894 billion euro in 2019, Heineken N.V. is the number one brewer in Europe and one of the largest brewers by volume in the world. Heineken&#x27;s Dutch breweries are located in Zoeterwoude, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Wijlre. The original brewery in Amsterdam, closed in 1988, is preserved as a museum called Heineken Experience.

Since the merger between the two largest brewing empires in the world, Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, in October 2016, Heineken has been the second-largest brewer in the world.
==History==
===Gerard Adriaan Heineken===
The Heineken company was founded in 1864 when the 22-year-old Gerard Adriaan Heineken bought a brewery known as De Hooiberg (the haystack) in Amsterdam. In 1869 Heineken switched to the use of bottom-fermenting yeast. In 1873 the brewery&#x27;s name changed to Heineken&#x27;s Bierbrouwerij Maatschappij (HBM), and opened a second brewery in Rotterdam in 1874. In 1886 Dr. H. Elion, a pupil of the French chemist Louis Pasteur, developed the &quot;Heineken A-yeast&quot; in the Heineken laboratory. This yeast is still the key ingredient of Heineken beer.

===Henry Pierre Heineken===
The founder&#x27;s son, , managed the company from 1917 to 1940, and continued involvement with the company until 1951. During his tenure, Heineken developed techniques to maintain consistent beer quality during large-scale production.

After World War I, the company focused more and more on exports. Three days after Prohibition ended in the United States, the first Heineken shipment landed in New York. From that day on, Heineken has remained one of the most successful imported beer brands in the United States.

===Alfred Henry Heineken===
On 1 June 1941, Henry Pierre&#x27;s son, Alfred Henry &quot;Freddy&quot; Heineken, entered the service of the Heineken company, which by then was no longer owned by the family. Freddy bought back stock several years later, to ensure the family controlled the company again, and in 1971 was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board. He was a powerful force behind Heineken&#x27;s continued global expansion, and while he retired from the Executive Board in 1989, he maintained involvement with the company until his death in 2002.During this period, Heineken tried to increase its stock price by purchasing competing breweries and closing them down. After World War II, many small breweries were bought or closed. In 1968 Heineken merged with its biggest competitor, Amstel, and in 1975 opened a new brewery in Zoeterwoude. The Amstel brewery was closed in 1980, and its production moved to Zoeterwoude and Den Bosch.

===Recent history===
Since mid-2007, Heineken has taken ownership of former S&amp;N International brands such as Strongbow and Bulmers ciders and John Smith&#x27;s and Newcastle Brown Ale beers. With the part acquisition of Scottish and Newcastle in 2007/2008, Heineken became the third-largest brewer based on revenues, behind the Belgian-Brazilian AB InBev and the British-South African SAB. Heineken owns the Czech brand Dačický, which was brewed in Kutná Hora from 1573 until Heineken took ownership of it and closed the brewery in 2009.

In October 2016, following the merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, Heineken became the second largest brewer in the world.

On 12 January 2010, Heineken International successfully bought the brewery division of Mexican giant FEMSA in all-stock deal expanding its reach throughout Latin America. The deal brought brands such as Dos Equis, Sol, Tecate, Indio, Bohemia and Kloster. Following the deal, Heineken started selling its products in Latin America through FEMSA&#x27;s distribution network. The deal made FEMSA 20% owner of Heineken N.V. essentially becoming its largest single shareholder after the Dutch families (Heineken family and Hoyer family) who owns 25.83% and public shareholders owning 54.17%. The FEMSA acquisition is expected to keep Heineken in its strong position by growing its market share in the Latin American markets. FEMSA has a massive distribution network and owns Mexico&#x27;s largest convenience store chain OXXO, which has thousands of locations throughout the country.In September 2014, it was announced that Heineken would sell its Mexican packaging business Empaque to Crown for around $1.23 billion. Also during that month, Heineken revealed it was in talks to sell its Czech operations to Molson Coors.

On 10 September 2015, Heineken International announced it would acquire a 50% stake in Lagunitas Brewing Company of Petaluma in California as part of an effort to allow it (Lagunitas) to expand its operations globally. As part of the deal, Lagunitas would no longer be considered a craft brewer as the Heineken stake was greater than 25%.

In January 2017, Heineken announced it was in negotiations to buy the Kirin Company&#x27;s 12 breweries in Brazil. The following month, Heineken closed the deal and bought Brasil Kirin for US$700 million.

On 4 May 2017, after previously acquiring 50% of Lagunitas Brewing Company, Heineken announced it would be purchasing the remaining 50% making it the sole owner of Lagunitas.

In 2018, Heineken signed an agreement with China Resources Enterprises to purchase a 40% stake into the company.

In June 2018, Heineken named Maggie Timoney as the CEO of Heineken USA, making her the first woman to become the CEO of a major United States beer supplier.

In June 2021, Heineken&#x27;s stake in United Breweries of India increased to 61.5%, ultimately taking control of the company.

In April 2023, Heineken completed the acquisition of Distell and Namibia Breweries.

In May 2023, Heineken N.V. bought back €333 million in shares from FEMSA. FEMSA would no longer hold any shares in Heineken N.V. and Heineken Holding N.V. other than the Heineken Holding N.V. shares underlying the exchangeable bond.

In August 2023, Heineken announced the sale of assets in Russia to the Arnest Group for €1 plus a €100 million commitment to repay domestic debt.

In April 2024, Heineken destroyed 300 acres of orchards in Wales.

==Marketing==
===Advertising===
Heineken&#x27;s main advertising slogan in the UK was &quot;Refreshes the parts other beers cannot reach&quot;, some of which featured voice-over narration by Danish comedian/pianist Victor Borge. The British TV campaign ran for over 30 years – stopping in 2005. From March 2011 they have been advertising using the song &#x27;The Golden Age&#x27; by The Asteroids Galaxy Tour. After the success of The Entrance, a web advert (4M views in YouTube), Heineken launched The Date in May 2011.

In March 2017 in Amsterdam, Heineken opened a pop-up bakery for five days to promote the yeast used in its brewing. The bread was made by Mark Plaating and proceeds were donated to a local baking guild.

===Sponsorships===

Heineken sponsors several sporting events. The Heineken Cup was an annual rugby union knock-out competition involving leading club, regional and provincial teams from the Six Nations: England, France, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Italy. Heineken was the title sponsor from the cup&#x27;s inaugural tournament in 1995–96, until the tournament ceased in 2014 and was replaced by the Champions Cup. Heineken continued its sponsorship of European Club Rugby as the principle partner of the European Rugby Champions Cup returning to title sponsorship of the Champions Cup from 2018–19. They have been credited as the &quot;Founding Partner of European Rugby&quot;.

Heineken has been an integral partner of the UEFA Champions League since 2005, with a theme of &quot;Enjoyed together around the world.&quot; The Heineken Open (tennis) is a tennis tournament on the ATP International Series played in Auckland, New Zealand. Heineken also sponsors the music events: the Heineken Open&#x27;er Festival, a contemporary music festival held in Poland; and, since 2004, the Oxegen music festival in Ireland. Heineken sponsors the Ballyheigue Summerfest in County Kerry, Ireland. In 2016, Heineken became the Official Beer of the Formula One World Championship after the Canadian Grand Prix. During the knockout stage of the 2019–20 season, Heineken 0,0% became the official beer of the UEFA Europa League as the season resumed followed with the start of the 2020–21 season.

===Holland Heineken House===
Since 1992 Heineken organises, together with NOC*NSF, the Dutch meeting place at all the Olympic Games, called the Holland Heineken House.

===Heineken Experience===

The Heineken Experience is a museum about Heineken Pilsener and the Heineken brewery, based in the original brewery in Amsterdam. The original building was built in 1867, and was in use as a brewery until 1988. In 1991, when part of the establishment was torn down, the Heineken Reception and Information Centre () was opened in the remaining building. In 2001 the name was changed to Heineken Experience.

The museum features &quot;rides&quot;, interactive exhibits, and two bars. It also gives an insight into the company&#x27;s history and brewing processes through the years. Visitors receive one small tasting glass and two full-sized glasses of Heineken beer to drink at the end of the tour, both paid for by the 21 euro entry fee.

==Controversies==

===Possible ties to the slave plantations===
On 15 February 1864, Gerard Adriaan Heineken bought De Hooiberg (the Haystack) brewery in Amsterdam. It remains unclear whether the funds for the purchase of the Haystack came from his father, a cheese trader, or his mother, whose estate included proceeds from her previous husband’s family’s historical investments in West Indies slave plantations.

In a letter to his mother 18 June 1863, Gerard discussed the potential Haystack purchase and his plans for the future. Gerard’s mother, Anna Geertruida van de Paauw, came to own shares in slave plantations in Berbice (modern day Guyana) and Suriname through her first marriage in 1829 to Pieter Jacob Schumacher van Oudorp (1804–1833) who died in 1833. The Schumacher family owned several plantations in Berbice and Suriname, according to records held at the UK’s National Archive. After Pieter Schumacher died, Anna was remarried to Cornelis Heineken and had four children, one of which was Gerard Heineken. Anna died in 1881.
===Price fixing===
On 18 April 2007 the European Commission fined Heineken €219.3m, Grolsch €31.65m and Bavaria €22.85m for operating a price fixing cartel in the Netherlands, totalling €273.7m. InBev, (formerly Interbrew), escaped without a penalty because it provided &quot;decisive information&quot; about the cartel which operated between 1996 and 1999 and others in the EU market. The brewers controlled 95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each.

Neelie Kroes said she was &quot;very disappointed&quot; that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level. She added, Heineken, Grolsch, Bavaria and InBev tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings to carve up the market for beer sold to supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafes. The price fixing extended to cheaper own-brand labels and rebates for bars.

In 2004 Heineken and Kronenbourg (then part of Scottish and Newcastle), the two dominant brewers in France, were fined €2.5m – with the penalty reduced for co-operating.
===Fake craft beers===
In Ireland, Heineken briefly marketed &quot;Blasket Blonde&quot; in County Kerry from March 2015 to September 2016, and &quot;Beanntraí Bru&quot; in parts of County Cork in August 2016, as locally-made craft beers, from invented breweries.

===Investments in Russia===
At the end of March 2022, over a month after Russia started its war in Ukraine, Heineken announced that it was leaving Russia (including with its other brands there, like Affligem, Amstel etc.), saying that ownership of the Russian subsidiary was no longer “durable or viable.” But despite this promise Heineken hired more than 240 new staff and launched 61 new products on the Russian market in the last year, investigators from &quot;Follow the Money&quot; reported, based on an overview of 2022 by Heineken Russia. 

The Dutch brewer&#x27;s Russian subsidiary looked back on “a turbulent year, with many new growth opportunities.” One of these opportunities being the departure of Coca-Cola and Pepsi from Russia, which Heineken &quot;cynically&quot; used to &quot;enter the non-alcoholic carbonated beverage market&quot;. Heineken announced more investments for 2023, including more modern packaging and new flavors. New products launched in Russia included an Irish stout, replacing Guinness (which had been brewed and sold by Heineken, under licence), after Diageo withdrew from Russia.

In August 2023, Heineken announced the sale of its Russian subsidiary to the Arnest Group for €1 plus a €100 million commitment to repay domestic debt.

<text>Spontaneous generation is a superseded scientific theory that held that living creatures could arise from non-living matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular. It was hypothesized that certain forms, such as fleas, could arise from inanimate matter such as dust, or that maggots could arise from dead flesh. The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by the Greek philosopher and naturalist Aristotle, who compiled and expanded the work of earlier natural philosophers and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms. Spontaneous generation was taken as scientific fact for two millennia. Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of the Italian biologists Francesco Redi and Lazzaro Spallanzani, it was not discredited until the work of the French chemist Louis Pasteur and the Irish physicist John Tyndall in the mid-19th century.

Among biologists, rejecting spontaneous genesis is no longer controversial. Experiments conducted by Pasteur and others were thought to have refuted the conventional notion of spontaneous generation by the mid-1800s. Since all life appears to have evolved from a single form approximately four billion years ago, attention has instead turned to the origin of life.

== Description ==
&quot;Spontaneous generation&quot; means both the supposed processes by which different types of life might repeatedly emerge from specific sources other than seeds, eggs, or parents, and the theoretical principles presented in support of any such phenomena. Crucial to this doctrine are the ideas that life comes from non-life and that no causal agent, such as a parent, is needed. Supposed examples included the seasonal generation of mice and other animals from the mud of the Nile, the emergence of fleas from inanimate matter such as dust, or the appearance of maggots in dead flesh. Such ideas have something in common with the modern hypothesis of the origin of life, which asserts that life emerged some four billion years ago from non-living materials, over a time span of millions of years, and subsequently diversified into all the forms that now exist.

The term &quot;equivocal generation&quot;, sometimes known as &quot;heterogenesis&quot; or &quot;xenogenesis&quot;, describes the supposed process by which one form of life arises from a different, unrelated form, such as tapeworms from the bodies of their hosts.

== Antiquity ==

=== Pre-Socratic philosophers ===

Active in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, early Greek philosophers, called &quot;physiologoi&quot; in antiquity (Greek: φυσιολόγοι; in English, physical or natural philosophers), attempted to give natural explanations of phenomena that had previously been ascribed to the agency of the gods. The &quot;physiologoi&quot; sought the material principle or &quot;arche&quot; (Greek: ἀρχή) of things, emphasizing the rational unity of the external world and rejecting theological or mythological explanations.

Anaximander, who believed that all things arose from the elemental nature of the universe, the &quot;apeiron&quot; (ἄπειρον) or the &quot;unbounded&quot; or &quot;infinite&quot;, was likely the first western thinker to propose that life developed spontaneously from nonliving matter. The primal chaos of the &quot;apeiron,&quot; eternally in motion, served as a platform on which elemental opposites (e.g., &quot;wet and dry&quot;, &quot;hot and cold&quot;) generated and shaped the many and varied things in the world. According to Hippolytus of Rome in the third century CE, Anaximander claimed that fish or fish-like creatures were first formed in the &quot;wet&quot; when acted on by the heat of the sun and that these aquatic creatures gave rise to human beings. The Roman author Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century, reported:

The Greek philosopher Anaximenes, a pupil of Anaximander, thought that air was the element that imparted life and endowed creatures with motion and thought. He proposed that plants and animals, including human beings, arose from a primordial terrestrial slime, a mixture of earth and water, combined with the sun&#x27;s heat. The philosopher Anaxagoras, too, believed that life emerged from a terrestrial slime. However, Anaximenes held that the seeds of plants existed in the air from the beginning, and those of animals in the aether. Another philosopher, Xenophanes, traced the origin of man back to the transitional period between the fluid stage of the Earth and the formation of land, under the influence of the Sun.

In what has occasionally been seen as a prefiguration of a concept of natural selection, Empedocles accepted the spontaneous generation of life, but held that different forms, made up of differing combinations of parts, spontaneously arose as though by trial and error: successful combinations formed the individuals present in the observer&#x27;s lifetime, whereas unsuccessful forms failed to reproduce.

=== Aristotle ===
In his biological works, the natural philosopher Aristotle theorized extensively the reproduction of various animals, whether by sexual, parthenogenetic, or spontaneous generation. In accordance with his fundamental theory of hylomorphism, which held that every physical entity was a compound of matter and form, Aristotle&#x27;s basic theory of sexual reproduction contended that the male&#x27;s seed imposed form, the set of characteristics passed down to offspring on the &quot;matter&quot; (menstrual blood) supplied by the female. Thus female matter is the &quot;material cause&quot; of generation—it supplies the matter that will constitute the offspring—while the male semen is the &quot;efficient cause&quot;, the factor that instigates and delineates the thing&#x27;s existence. Yet, Aristotle proposed in the &quot;History of Animals&quot;, many creatures form not through sexual processes but by spontaneous generation:

According to this theory, living things may come forth from nonliving things in a manner roughly analogous to the &quot;enformation of the female matter by the agency of the male seed&quot; seen in sexual reproduction. Nonliving materials, like the seminal fluid present in sexual generation, contain &quot;pneuma&quot; (πνεῦμα, &quot;breath&quot;), or &quot;vital heat&quot;. According to Aristotle, &quot;pneuma&quot; had more &quot;heat&quot; than regular air did, and this heat endowed the substance with certain vital properties:

Aristotle drew an analogy between the &quot;foamy matter&quot; (τὸ ἀφρῶδες, &quot;to aphrodes&quot;) found in nature and the &quot;seed&quot; of an animal, which he viewed as being a kind of foam itself (composed, as it was, from a mixture of water and &quot;pneuma&quot;). For Aristotle, the generative materials of male and female animals (semen and menstrual fluid) were essentially refinements, made by male and female bodies according to their respective proportions of heat, of ingested food, which was, in turn, a byproduct of the elements earth and water. Thus any creature, whether generated sexually from parents or spontaneously through the interaction of vital heat and elemental matter, was dependent on the proportions of &quot;pneuma&quot; and the various elements which Aristotle believed comprised all things. While Aristotle recognized that many living things emerged from putrefying matter, he pointed out that the putrefaction was not the source of life, but the byproduct of the action of the &quot;sweet&quot; element of water.

With varying degrees of observational confidence, Aristotle theorized the spontaneous generation of a range of creatures from different sorts of inanimate matter. The testaceans (a genus which for Aristotle included bivalves and snails), for instance, were characterized by spontaneous generation from mud, but differed based upon the precise material they grew in—for example, clams and scallops in sand, oysters in slime, and the barnacle and the limpet in the hollows of rocks.

=== Latin and early Christian sources ===

Athenaeus dissented towards spontaneous generation, claiming that a variety of anchovy did not generate from roe, as Aristotle stated, but rather, from sea foam.

As the dominant view of philosophers and thinkers continued to be in favour of spontaneous generation, some Christian theologians accepted the view. The Berber theologian and philosopher Augustine of Hippo discussed spontaneous generation in &quot;The City of God&quot; and &quot;The Literal Meaning of Genesis&quot;, citing Biblical passages such as &quot;Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life&quot; () as decrees that would enable ongoing creation.

== Middle Ages ==

From the fall of the Roman Empire in 5th century to the East–West Schism in 1054, the influence of Greek science declined, although spontaneous generation generally went unchallenged. New descriptions were made. Of the beliefs, some had doctrinal implications. In 1188, Gerald of Wales, after having traveled in Ireland, argued that the barnacle goose myth was evidence for the virgin birth of Jesus. Where the practice of fasting during Lent allowed fish, but prohibited fowl, the idea that the goose was in fact a fish suggested that its consumption be permitted during Lent. The practice was eventually prohibited by decree of Pope Innocent III in 1215.

After Aristotle’s works were reintroduced to Western Europe, they were translated into Latin from the original Greek or Arabic. They reached their greatest level of acceptance during the 13th century. With the availability of Latin translations, the German philosopher Albertus Magnus and his student Thomas Aquinas raised Aristotelianism to its greatest prominence. Albert wrote a paraphrase of Aristotle, &quot;De causis et processu universitatis&quot;, in which he removed some commentaries by Arabic scholars and incorporated others. The influential writings of Aquinas, on both the physical and metaphysical, are predominantly Aristotelian, but show numerous other influences.
Spontaneous generation is described in literature as if it were a fact well into the Renaissance. Shakespeare wrote of snakes and crocodiles forming from the mud of the Nile: 

The author of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, Izaak Walton repeats the question of the origin of eels &quot;as rats and mice, and many other living creatures, are bred in Egypt, by the sun&#x27;s heat when it shines upon the overflowing of the river...&quot;. While the ancient question of the origin of eels remained unanswered and the additional idea that eels reproduced from corruption of age was mentioned, the spontaneous generation of rats and mice stirred up no debate.

The Dutch biologist and microscopist Jan Swammerdam rejected the concept that one animal could arise from another or from putrification by chance because it was impious; he found the concept of spontaneous generation irreligious, and he associated it with atheism.

== Previous beliefs ==

* Frogs were believed to have spontaneously generated from mud.
* Mice were believed to become pregnant though the act of licking salt, or grew from the moisture of the earth.
* Barnacle geese were thought to have emerged from a crustacean, the goose barnacle (see the barnacle goose myth).
* Snakes could generate from the marrow of the human spine, and had previously generated from the blood of Medusa.
* Eels had multiple stories. Aristotle claimed that eels emerged from earthworms, and were lacking in sex and milt, spawn and passages for these. Later authors dissented. The Roman author and natural historian Pliny the Elder did not argue against the anatomic limits of eels, but stated that eels reproduce by budding, scraping themselves against rocks, liberating particles that become eels. The Greek author Athenaeus described eels as entwining and discharging a fluid which would settle on mud and generate life. 
* Bookworms could generate from excessive wind. Vitruvius, a Roman architect and writer of the 1st century BCE, advised that to stop their generation, libraries be placed facing eastwards to benefit from morning light, but not towards the south or the west as those winds were particularly offensive.
* Bees were generated in decomposing cows, through a process known as bugonia. Samson&#x27;s riddle led some to believe they could also generate through the body of a lion. 
* Wasps could be generated from decomposing horses.
* Cicada were generated from the spittle of the cuckoo.

== Experimental approach==

=== Early tests ===

The Brussels physician Jan Baptist van Helmont described a recipe for mice (a piece of dirty cloth plus wheat for 21 days) and scorpions (basil, placed between two bricks and left in sunlight). His notes suggest he may have attempted to do these things.

Where Aristotle held that the embryo was formed by a coagulation in the uterus, the English physician William Harvey showed by way of dissection of deer that there was no visible embryo during the first month. Although his work predated the microscope, this led him to suggest that life came from invisible eggs. In the frontispiece of his 1651 book &quot;Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium&quot; (&quot;Essays on the Generation of Animals&quot;), he denied spontaneous generation with the motto &quot;omnia ex ovo&quot; (&quot;everything from eggs&quot;).

The ancient beliefs were subjected to testing. In 1668, the Italian physician and parasitologist Francesco Redi challenged the idea that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat. In the first major experiment to challenge spontaneous generation, he placed meat in a variety of sealed, open, and partially covered containers. Realizing that the sealed containers were deprived of air, he used &quot;fine Naples veil&quot;, and observed no worms on the meat, but they appeared on the cloth. Redi used his experiments to support the preexistence theory put forth by the Catholic Church at that time, which maintained that living things originated from parents. In scientific circles Redi&#x27;s work very soon had great influence, as evidenced in a letter from the English natural theologian John Ray in 1671 to members of the Royal Society of London, in which he calls the spontaneous generation of insects &quot;unlikely&quot;.

Pier Antonio Micheli, , observed that when fungal spores were placed on slices of melon, the same type of fungi were produced that the spores came from, and from this observation he noted that fungi did not arise from spontaneous generation.

In 1745, John Needham performed a series of experiments on boiled broths. Believing that boiling would kill all living things, he showed that when sealed right after boiling, the broths would cloud, allowing the belief in spontaneous generation to persist. His studies were rigorously scrutinized by his peers, and many of them agreed.

Lazzaro Spallanzani modified the Needham experiment in 1768, where he attempted to exclude the possibility of introducing a contaminating factor between boiling and sealing. His technique involved boiling the broth in a sealed container with the air partially evacuated to prevent explosions. Although he did not see growth, the exclusion of air left the question of whether air was an essential factor in spontaneous generation. But attitudes were changing; by the start of the 19th century, a scientist such as Joseph Priestley could write that &quot;There is nothing in modern philosophy that appears to me so extraordinary, as the revival of what has long been considered as the exploded doctrine of equivocal, or, as Dr. [Erasmus] Darwin calls it, spontaneous generation.&quot;

In 1837, Charles Cagniard de la Tour, a physicist, and Theodor Schwann, one of the founders of cell theory, published their independent discovery of yeast in alcoholic fermentation. They used the microscope to examine foam left over from the process of brewing beer. Where the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described &quot;small spheroid globules&quot;, they observed yeast cells undergo cell division. Fermentation would not occur when sterile air or pure oxygen was introduced if yeast were not present. This suggested that airborne microorganisms, not spontaneous generation, was responsible.

However, although the idea of spontaneous generation had been in decline for nearly a century, its supporters did not abandon it all at once. As James Rennie wrote in 1838, despite Redi&#x27;s experiments, &quot;distinguished naturalists, such as Blumenbach, Cuvier, Bory de St. Vincent, R. Brown, &amp;c.&quot; continued to support the theory.

===Pasteur and Tyndall===

Louis Pasteur&#x27;s 1859 experiment is widely seen as having settled the question of spontaneous generation. He boiled a meat broth in a swan neck flask; the bend in the neck of the flask prevented falling particles from reaching the broth, while still allowing the free flow of air. The flask remained free of growth for an extended period. When the flask was turned so that particles could fall down the bends, the broth quickly became clouded. However, minority objections were persistent and not always unreasonable, given that the experimental difficulties were far more challenging than the popular accounts suggest. The investigations of the Irish physician John Tyndall, a correspondent of Pasteur and an admirer of his work, were decisive in disproving spontaneous generation. All the same, Tyndall encountered difficulties in dealing with microbial spores, which were not well understood in his day. Like Pasteur, he boiled his cultures to sterilize them, and some types of bacterial spores can survive boiling. The autoclave, which eventually came into universal application in medical practice and microbiology to sterilise equipment, was introduced after these experiments.

In 1862, the French Academy of Sciences paid special attention to the issue, establishing a prize &quot;to him who by well-conducted experiments throws new light on the question of the so-called spontaneous generation&quot; and appointed a commission to judge the winner. Pasteur and others used the term &quot;biogenesis&quot; as the opposite of spontaneous generation, to mean that life was generated only from other life. Pasteur&#x27;s claim followed the German physician Rudolf Virchow&#x27;s doctrine &quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot; (&quot;all cells from cells&quot;), itself derived from the work of Robert Remak. After Pasteur&#x27;s 1859 experiment, the term &quot;spontaneous generation&quot; fell out of favor. Experimentalists used a variety of terms for the study of the origin of life from nonliving materials. &quot;Heterogenesis&quot; was applied to the generation of living things from once-living organic matter (such as boiled broths), and the English physiologist Henry Charlton Bastian proposed the term &quot;archebiosis&quot; for life originating from non-living materials. Disliking the randomness and unpredictability implied by the term &quot;spontaneous generation&quot;, in 1870 Bastian coined the term &quot;biogenesis&quot; for the formation of life from nonliving matter. Soon thereafter, however, the English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley proposed the term &quot;abiogenesis&quot; for this same process, and adopted &quot;biogenesis&quot; for the process by which life arises from existing life.

<text>Penthouse is a men&#x27;s magazine founded by Bob Guccione and published by Los Angeles–based Penthouse World Media, LLC. It combines urban lifestyle articles and softcore pornographic pictures of women that, in the 1990s, evolved into hardcore pornographic pictures of women.

Although Guccione was American, the magazine was founded in the United Kingdom in 1965, and first published simultaneously in the UK and the US in March 1965. From September 1969, an &quot;American Edition&quot; was made available in the US. Since 2016, &quot;Penthouse&quot; has been under the ownership of Penthouse World Media (formerly known as Penthouse Global Media Inc.), which filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Its assets were subsequently acquired in June of that same year by WGCZ Ltd., the owners of XVideos, when it won a bankruptcy auction bid. Later on, Penthouse Global Media was spun off from WGCZ and rebranded as Penthouse World Media.

The magazine&#x27;s centerfold models are known as &quot;Penthouse&quot; &quot;Pets&quot;, and customarily wear a distinctive necklace in the form of a stylized key which incorporates both the Mars and Venus symbols in its design.

The first &quot;Pet of the Month&quot; was Denise Johns, who was also pictured on the cover. The first US Pet of the Month was Evelyn Treacher, who was on the cover of the first US edition in September 1969. The first Pet of the Year in the US was Stephanie McLean, pictured on the cover of the September 1971 issue.

In 2024, &quot;Penthouse&quot; started releasing physical copies of comic magazines.

==Bob Guccione==
At the height of its success, Guccione, who died in 2010, was considered one of the richest men in the United States. In 1982 he was listed in the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 ranking of wealthiest people. An April 2002 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported Guccione as saying that &quot;Penthouse&quot; grossed $3.5 billion to $4 billion over the 30-year life of the company.

==Publication history==

&quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine began publication in the UK in March 1965. In September 1969, in an attempt to compete with Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot;, the first American edition was published. Guccione offered editorial content that was more sensational than that of &quot;Playboy&quot;, and the magazine&#x27;s writing was far more investigative than Hefner&#x27;s upscale emphasis, with stories about government cover-ups and scandals.

Writers such as Seymour Hersh, James Dale Davidson, and Ernest Volkman exposed numerous scandals and corruption at the highest levels of the United States Government. Contributors to the magazine included Isaac Asimov, James Baldwin, Howard Blum, Victor Bockris, T. C. Boyle, Alexander Cockburn, Harry Crews, Cameron Crowe, Don DeLillo, Alan Dershowitz, Edward Jay Epstein, Chet Flippo, Albert Goldman, Anthony Haden-Guest, John Hawkes, Nat Hentoff, Warren Hinckle, Abbie Hoffman, Nicholas von Hoffman, Michael Korda, Paul Krassner, Michael Ledeen, Anthony Lewis, Joyce Carol Oates, James Purdy, Philip Roth, Harrison E. Salisbury, Gail Sheehy, Robert Sherrill, Mickey Spillane, Ben Stein, Harry Stein, Tad Szulc, Studs Terkel, Nick Tosches, Gore Vidal, Irving Wallace, and Ruth Westheimer (Dr. Ruth).

The magazine was founded on humble beginnings. Due to Guccione&#x27;s lack of resources, he personally photographed most of the models for the magazine&#x27;s early issues. Without professional training, Guccione applied his knowledge of painting to his photography, establishing the diffused, soft focus look that would become one of the trademarks of the magazine&#x27;s pictorials. Guccione would sometimes take several days to complete a shoot.

As the magazine grew more successful, Guccione openly embraced a life of luxury; his former mansion is said to be the largest private residence in Manhattan at . However, in contrast to Hugh Hefner, who threw wild parties at his Playboy Mansions, life at Guccione&#x27;s mansion was remarkably sedate, even during the hedonistic 1970s. He reportedly once had his bodyguards eject a local radio personality who had been hired as a DJ and jumped into the swimming pool naked.

The magazine&#x27;s pictorials offered more sexually explicit content than what was commonly seen in most openly sold men&#x27;s magazines of the era. It was the first to show female pubic hair, followed by full-frontal nudity, and eventually, the exposed vulva and anus. &quot;Penthouse&quot; has also featured a number of authorized and unauthorized photos of celebrities, such as Madonna and Vanessa Williams. In both cases, the photos were taken earlier in their careers and sold to &quot;Penthouse&quot; only after Madonna and Williams became famous.

However, in the late 1990s, poor business decisions were made by Guccione, from not incorporating digital marketing in the technology age to changing the content of the magazine and publishing control gradually slipped away from him. In a desperate attempt to boost sales, the magazine began to showcase more &quot;fetish&quot; content, including subjects such as urination, bondage, and &quot;facials.&quot; When this was featured, companies no longer wanted their products associated with or featured in &quot;Penthouse&quot; and quickly had their advertising removed. For the magazine, once respected and successful (and would outsell Playboy beginning in the late 1970s and continuing for several years there after), it was inevitably the beginning of its decline. Observers have commented that Guccione created an empire and also destroyed it.

On January 15, 2016, a press release emanating from then-owner Friend Finder Networks announced that &quot;Penthouse&quot; would end its print operations and move to all digital. However, managing director Kelly Holland quickly disavowed the decision and pledged to keep the print version of the magazine alive.

==Key symbol==
The magazine&#x27;s symbol was initially a single skeleton key, and in January 1973 became three keys. It was conceived by Bob Guccione and was in the table of contents of every issue from number 1 onward. According to the magazine in January 1973:
:The [key symbol] was apt, not only because every penthouse requires a key, but because a key is traditionally a phallic symbol—in Italian the word is &quot;chiave&quot;, yielding the verb &quot;chiavare&quot;, slang for copulation. In designing the Penthouse key Bob neatly united the standard symbols for male and female, the circle and arrow and circle and cross. So the key enshrines the ineluctable equation: Man plus Woman equals Penthouse. Later, when the London Penthouse Club was launched, the key was triplicated to provide a distinctive symbol. Though some have suspected papal inspiration in this development (cf. 3#Christianity), Bob&#x27;s explanation is simpler: &quot;Three is my lucky number, and I&#x27;ve found things happen in threes.&quot;

==Financial history==
In 1982, Guccione was listed in the Forbes 400 ranking of wealthiest people, with a reported $400 million net worth. An April 2002 &quot;New York Times&quot; article quoted Guccione as saying that &quot;Penthouse&quot; grossed $3.5 billion to $4 billion over the 30-year life of the company, with a net income of almost $500 million.

In 1999, hoping to raise cash and reduce debt, &quot;Penthouse&quot; sold several automotive magazine titles from its large portfolio Peterson Automotive, raising $33 million in cash. However, two of their retained publications, science and health magazines &quot;Omni&quot; and &quot;Longevity&quot; lost almost $100 million, contributing to financial problems.

===Bankruptcy===
On August 12, 2003, General Media, the parent company of the magazine, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Immediately upon filing, Cerberus Capital Management entered into a $5 million debtor-in-possession credit line with General Media to provide working capital. In October 2003, &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine was put up for sale as part of a deal with its creditors. On November 13, 2004, Guccione resigned as chairman and CEO of Penthouse International, the parent of General Media.

&quot;Penthouse&quot; filed for bankruptcy protection on September 17, 2013. The magazine&#x27;s then-current owner FriendFinder&#x27;s current common stock was wiped out and was no longer traded on the open market. In August 2013, FriendFinder&#x27;s stock was delisted from Nasdaq because it consistently failed to trade for more than $1.

As of 2015, General Media Communications, Inc. publishes entertainment magazines and operates as a subsidiary of FriendFinder Networks Inc.

===Ownership change===
In February 2016, Penthouse Global Media – a new company headed by Penthouse Entertainment managing director Kelly Holland – acquired the &quot;Penthouse&quot; brand from FriendFinder Networks.

Penthouse Global Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 11, 2018, to address debt-related issues.

Penthouse Global Media, Inc. were acquired by WGCZ Ltd., operators of XVideos, on June 4, 2018, after winning a bankruptcy auction for US$11.2 million; other companies, such as MindGeek, also participated in the auction. Penthouse Global Media, Inc. was later spun off from WGCZ and renamed Penthouse World Media.

== Awards and recognition ==
The magazine&#x27;s editorial content was praised and recognized by those in the academic field. In 1975, for example, Guccione was honored by Brandeis University for focusing &quot;his editorial attention on such critical issues of our day as the welfare of the Vietnam veteran and problems of criminality in modern society&quot;.

In 2013, director Barry Avrich made a film about Guccione&#x27;s life entitled &quot;Filthy Gorgeous: The Bob Guccione Story&quot;. It was produced by Jeremy Frommer and Rick Schwartz, who have since created a premier website inspired by Bob Guccione as an extension of the film called Filthy Gorgeous Media.

==Publishing milestones==

===Traci Lords and Vanessa Williams===
The September 1984 issue of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine would eventually become controversial because of its centerfold, Traci Lords. Lords posed nude for this issue at the beginning of her career as an adult film star. It was later revealed that Lords was underage throughout most of her career in pornography and was only 16 when she posed for &quot;Penthouse&quot;.

The same issue also caused controversy with nude pictures of Vanessa Williams that caused her to be stripped of her Miss America crown.

===Move from softcore to hardcore pictorials and back===
In 1998, &quot;Penthouse&quot; changed its format and began featuring sexually explicit pictures (i.e., actual oral, vaginal, and anal penetration), beginning with photos from the &quot;Stolen Honeymoon&quot; sex tape featuring Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee. It also began to regularly feature pictorials of female models urinating, which, until then, had been considered a defining limit of illegal obscenity as distinguished from legal pornography.

A different approach to restoring sales was attempted by the UK version of the magazine in 1997. Under the editorship of Tom Hilditch, the magazine was rebranded as PH.UK and relaunched as middle-shelf &quot;adult magazine for grown-ups&quot;. Fashion photographers (such as Corinne Day of &quot;The Face&quot; magazine) were hired to produce images that merged sex and fashion. The magazine&#x27;s editorial content included celebrity interviews and tackled issues of sexual politics. The experiment attracted a great deal of press interest, but failed to generate a significant increase in sales. PH.UK closed in late 1998.

Starting with the January 2005 issue, the new owners significantly softened the content of the magazine. &quot;Penthouse&quot; no longer showed male genitalia, real or simulated male-female sex, nor any form of explicit hardcore content (it does still feature female-female simulated sex on occasions). While this change was followed by the return of a limited number of mainstream advertisers to the magazine, it did not significantly raise the number of subscribers; total circulation is still below 350,000.

Some of &quot;Penthouse&quot;s secondary publications, such as &quot;Girls of Penthouse&quot;, continue to feature occasional images of explicit sex, either classic sets from the 1990s issues or stills of adult video shoots staged by the company&#x27;s Digital Media division.

==Other ventures==

===Film===
In 1974, Guccione invested in the film &quot;Chinatown&quot; and the end credits read &quot;A Paramount - Penthouse Presentation&quot;.

In 1976, Guccione used about US $17.5 million of his personal fortune to finance the controversial historical epic pornographic film &quot;Caligula&quot;, with Malcolm McDowell in the title role and a supporting cast including Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, Teresa Ann Savoy, and Peter O&#x27;Toole. The film, which was eventually released in late 1979, was produced in Italy (made at the Dear Studios in Rome) and was directed by Tinto Brass.

In 2001, &quot;Penthouse Presents&quot; began running on Hot Choice.

===Other publications===
Guccione also created the magazines &quot;Omni&quot;, &quot;Viva&quot;, and &quot;Longevity&quot;. Later Guccione started &quot;Penthouse Forum&quot;, which predominantly featured erotic writing and stories. In 1993, &quot;Penthouse&quot; published an adult comic book spin-off entitled &quot;Penthouse Comix&quot;, featuring sexually explicit stories. After an initial success, &quot;Penthouse Comix&quot; expanded into a line of four illustrated magazines with the addition of &quot;Penthouse Max&quot;, &quot;Penthouse Men&#x27;s Adventure Comix&quot; and &quot;Omni Comix&quot;. In 2023 Penthouse revived the comic label as Penthouse Comics. The first issue launched in February 2024 to 30,000 copies sold.

&quot;Penthouse Variations&quot; is a monthly magazine containing ostensibly reader-generated erotic stories (primarily) and some pictures and reviews. It is a spin-off magazine from &quot;Penthouse Letters&quot;. It was initially published in 1978. &quot;Variations&quot; focuses on &quot;kinkier&quot; topics of sexuality, such as bondage, fetish clothing, exhibitionism, voyeurism, foot fetishism, water sports, female dominance, bisexual exploration, transsexualism and sadomasochism, among others.

=== Home video ===
In 1983, Penthouse teamed up with Vestron Video to launch the Penthouse Video label. In 1991, Penthouse Video signed a deal with A*Vision Entertainment to release videos designed for an adult audience.

===Casinos===
In 1970, the Penthouse Club in London, England operated a casino. However, the next year the casino license was revoked by the gaming authorities. In 1972, Penthouse opened the Penthouse Adriatic Club casino on the island of Krk in Yugoslavia (now Croatia) at a cost of $45 million. However, the casino filed for bankruptcy the following year and was closed. In 1978, Penthouse began construction of the Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. However, Penthouse was unable to raise additional funding and construction stopped in 1980. The project sat idle until Donald Trump acquired the site in 1993.

===Auto racing===
&quot;Penthouse&quot; sponsors the &quot;1X&quot; car of driver Randy Hannagan in the World of Outlaws sprint car series. The magazine previously sponsored cars in the Formula One circuit from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Teams included Hesketh Racing and RAM Racing.

===3D HD porn channel===
January 2011, &quot;Penthouse&quot; announced the first 3D HD porn channel, to be available from the second quarter of 2011. Shot using dual lenses, it would consist of available Penthouse HD Channel lineup covering over 30 platforms in more than 15 countries. It was launched on 1 March 2011.

===Wine and spirits===
In January 2015, &quot;Penthouse&quot; announced its entry into the wine and spirits industry. The line of products were to debut at the 2015 Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas. Called &quot;Libido Libations&quot;, the spirits line is distributed by Prestige Imports LLC and produced by The Melchers Group BV. The wine offerings are the result of a partnership with California vintner John Crossland and Randal Tomich of the Australian winery Tomich Wines.

==Legal disputes==

===Editorial lawsuit===
In March 1975, &quot;Penthouse&quot; published an article headlined &quot;La Costa: The Hundred-Million-Dollar Resort with Criminal Clientele&quot;, written by Jeff Gerth and Lowell Bergman. The article indicated that the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, was developed by Mervyn Adelson and Irwin Molasky using loans from the Teamsters Pension Fund and that the resort was a playground for organized crime figures. The owners, along with two officials of the resort, Morris B. Moe Dalitz and Allard Roen, filed a libel lawsuit for $522 million against the magazine and the writers. In 1982, a jury absolved the magazine of any liability against the lawsuit from the owners. The plaintiffs appealed, but in December 1985, before a new trial could begin, the two sides settled. &quot;Penthouse&quot; issued a statement that they did not mean to imply that Adelson and Molaskey are or were members of organized crime. In turn the plaintiffs issued a statement lauding &quot;Penthouse&quot; publisher Guccione and his magazine for their &quot;personal and professional awards&quot;. Total litigation costs were estimated to exceed $20 million.

===&quot;Guccione v. Penthouse Media Group&quot;===
In 2006, Guccione sued Penthouse Media Group for fraud, breach of contract, and conspiracy, among other charges. Some of the people named in the case included Marc Bell, Jason Galanis, Fernando Molina, Charles Samel, and Daniel C. Stanton.

==National rampage protests==
In December 1984, a group of radical feminists began a civil disobedience campaign against &quot;Penthouse&quot; which they called a National Rampage. Led by Melissa Farley and Nikki Craft, they went into stores selling copies of the magazine and ripped them up, and they also burned an effigy of Bob Guccione in front of a bookstore in Madison, Wisconsin. In late 1985 the group began to focus on the printer of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, Meredith Corporation. They bought shares in the company and attended their annual stockholder&#x27;s meeting. The women were not allowed to speak, but they removed their coats, revealing images from a &quot;Penthouse&quot; shoot about Japanese rope bondage—among which two poses were construed by Farley to evoke dead bodies—ironed onto [their] shirts.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1960 was the fifth edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, held on Tuesday 29 March 1960 at the Royal Festival Hall in London, United Kingdom, and hosted by British television presenter and actress Catherine Boyle. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the United Kingdom was offered the rights to stage the contest after the , which had won the , declined the opportunity after having organised the event in .

 returned to the competition after an absence of one year, and made its first contest appearance, bringing the total number of participating countries to thirteen.

The winner was with the song &quot;Tom Pillibi&quot;, performed by Jacqueline Boyer, composed by André Popp and written by Pierre Cour. This marked France&#x27;s second contest victory, having also won in 1958. The placed second for the second consecutive year and earned their first top three finish by placing third.

== Location ==

The contest took place in London, United Kingdom. Although the had won the in Cannes, the Dutch broadcaster (NTS) declined to stage the event for a second time in three years, after hosting the in Hilversum. The rights to staging the contest subsequently passed to the United Kingdom&#x27;s British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), following the UK&#x27;s second place finish in the previous year&#x27;s event, a decision which was announced in October 1959.

The Royal Festival Hall was chosen to stage the 1960 contest. Situated on the South Bank of the River Thames, the venue was first opened in 1951 and was originally conceived for use during that year&#x27;s Festival of Britain; it is now part of the Southbank Centre, a complex of several artistic venues.

==Participating countries==

The number of entries grew to thirteen for this edition, with the eleven competing countries from the 1959 contest being joined by , returning after a one year absence, and , making its first appearance.

Fud Leclerc made his third appearance at the contest, having represented with &quot; (one of the two Belgian entries in that year&#x27;s contest) and with &quot;. The song from Luxembourg was the first entry performed in Luxembourgish at the contest, and one of only three entries performed in the language (alongside the country&#x27;s entries and ).


==Format==

The contest was organised and broadcast by the BBC, with Harry Carlisle serving as producer, Innes Lloyd as director, Richard Levin as designer, and Eric Robinson as musical director, leading the orchestra during the event. Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director, Eric Robinson, also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.

As had been the case since the 1957 contest, each country, participating through a single EBU member broadcaster, was represented by one song performed by up to two people on stage. The results of the event were determined through jury voting, with each country&#x27;s jury containing ten individuals who each gave one vote to their favourite song, with no abstentions allowed and with jurors unable to vote for their own country. A new innovation for this year&#x27;s event was to allow the national juries to listen to the final rehearsal of each country, which was also recorded to allow jury members to listen to the entries ahead of the live contest.

The draw to determine the order in which each country would perform was conducted on 28 March in the presence of the performers. Performance and technical rehearsals involving the artists and orchestra were held on 28 and 29 March ahead of the live transmission.

== Contest overview ==

The contest was held on 29 March 1960 at 21:00 (GMT) and lasted 1 hour and 20 minutes. The contest was presented by British television presenter and actress Catherine Boyle, the first of four contests in which she participated as host. Boyle presided over the opening of the contest and the voting process, while the various national broadcasters that carried the show provided commentary between each act, with the United Kingdom&#x27;s commentator David Jacobs also being heard by the assembled audience of over 2,500 people in the hall.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Tom Pillibi&quot;, composed by André Popp, written by Pierre Cour and performed by Jacqueline Boyer. Boyer is the daughter of Jacques Pills, who had represented Monaco in the and placed last with &quot;&quot;. France&#x27;s victory was their second in the contest, following their win in 1958, and brought them level on number of victories with the Netherlands. The UK gained their second consecutive second place finish, while Monaco considerably improved upon their debut performance the previous year with a third place finish.

It was originally planned for the top three songs to be performed again following the voting, as had occurred in the 1959 contest, however this was ultimately scrapped and only the winning song received its traditional reprise performance. The winning artist was presented with a silver gilt vase, which was awarded by Teddy Scholten; this marked the first time that the previous year&#x27;s winning artist awarded the prize to the next contest winner, which has since become Eurovision tradition.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1960 contest are listed below.
* Tage Danielsson
* Nick Burrell-Davis

== Detailed voting results ==

The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to the order in which each country performed.

== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>Celle () is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Uelzen, Gifhorn, Hanover and Heidekreis. 
== Geography ==
The district is located in the southernmost parts of the Lüneburg Heath (&quot;Lüneburger Heide&quot;). The Aller River enters the district in the east, runs through the town of Celle and leaves the district in the northwest. It is joined by many tributaries coming from the south.

== Lüneburg Regional Association ==
To look after cultural matters the Lüneburg Regional Association (&quot;Lüneburgischer Landschaftsverband&quot;) was founded as a registered association (&quot;eingetragener Verein&quot;).

== Coat of arms ==

The lion and the heart were part of the arms of the Lüneburg, a subdivision of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The Principality was occasionally (but incorrectly) also known as Brunswick-Celle, since Celle was its capital for some time. The only difference is the number of hearts (the original coat of arms included more than one heart).

== Towns and municipalities ==


== Miscellaneous ==
* The town of Bergen is known for its southern quarter of Belsen, where the Nazi concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen was.
* The village of Eschede north of Celle was the site of the Eschede train disaster on June 3, 1998, when an ICE high-speed train derailed and 101 people died.

The town is situated on the banks of the river Aller, a tributary of the Weser, and has a population of about 71,000. Celle is the southern gateway to the Lüneburg Heath, has a castle (&quot;Schloss Celle&quot;) built in the Renaissance and Baroque styles and a picturesque old town centre (the &quot;Altstadt&quot;) with more than 400 timber-framed houses, making Celle one of the most remarkable members of the German Timber-Frame Road. From 1378 to 1705 Celle was the official residence of the Lüneburg branch of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg (House of Welf), who had been banished from their original ducal seat by its townsfolk.

==History==

=== Middle Ages ===

Celle was first mentioned in a document of 985 as &quot;Kiellu&quot; (which means &quot;Fischbucht&quot; or fishing bay). It was granted the right to mint and circulate its own coins under the minting rights during the 11th century and several coins were found in the Sandur hoard in the Faroes. In 1292 Duke Otto II the Strict (1277–1330), a Welf who ruled the Principality of Lüneburg from 1277 to 1330, left Altencelle, where there had been defences in the form of a circular rampart (the &quot;Ringwall von Burg&quot;) since the 10th century, and founded a rectangular settlement by the existing castle (&quot;Burg&quot;) to the northwest. In 1301 he granted Celle its town privileges and in 1308 started construction on the town church.

In 1378 Celle became the &quot;Residenz&quot; of the dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg and in 1433 the princes of Lüneburg took up residence in the castle (&quot;Schloss&quot;). The ducal palace was situated on a triangle between the Aller and its tributary, the Fuhse. A moat connecting the rivers was built in 1433, turning the town centre into an island. In 1452 Duke Frederick the Pious of Lüneburg founded a Franciscan monastery. In 1464 the grain shipping monopoly generated an economic upturn for the town.

===Early modern period===


In 1524 the Reformation was introduced into Celle. In 1570 Duke William the Younger built the castle chapel, which was consecrated in 1585. 

In 1660 Celle had 3,750 inhabitants. From 1665 to 1705 Celle experienced a cultural boom as a &quot;Residenz&quot; under Duke George William. This has been put down in particular to his French wife, Eleonore d&#x27;Olbreuse, who brought fellow Huguenot Christians and Italian architects to Celle. During this time the French and Italian Gardens were laid out and the baroque castle theatre built. Because of the persecution of Huguenots under Louis XIV many French Huguenots sought refuge in Germany, especially in Berlin and in the towns of Celle, Neuwied and Hanau. About 300 Huguenots settled in Celle, where a new residential area was laid out for them in the southwest of the centre. Its main street, &quot;Hugenottenstrasse&quot;, is still a sightworthy historical street with well-preserved wooden houses built at the beginning of the 18th century. Many French refugees worked in the castle as cooks and servants, but some of them opened shops in Celle as tailors, carpenters, joiners, confectioners, wig makers and glovers, thus introducing some French cuisine, fashion and lifestyle into the town. Some years later protestant refugees from Austria sought refuge in Celle as well. &quot;Emigrantenstraße&quot; is another historical street, which was laid out for the Austrians.

In 1705 the last duke of the Brunswick–Lüneburg line died and Celle, along with the Principality of Lüneburg, passed back to the Hanover line of the Welfs. By way of compensation for the loss of its status as a &quot;Residenz&quot; town numerous administrative institutions were established in Celle, such as the Higher Court of Appeal (&quot;Oberappellationsgericht&quot;), the prison and the State Stud Farm. That began its development into an administrative and judicial centre. Even today the Lower Saxony-Bremen State Social Security Tribunal and the High Court responsible for most of Lower Saxony are based in Celle, amongst others.

Celle is also still home to a prison (the Justizvollzugsanstalt Celle or &quot;JVA Celle&quot;), which was built in a baroque style in the west of the city centre between 1710 and 1731. Sometimes tourists mistake it for a castle because of its typical baroque architecture. That the citizens of Celle once − in a vote − chose to have a prison in Celle rather than a university in order to protect the virtue of their daughters is not verifiable but it has remained a persistent anecdote in popular folklore.

In August 1714 George Elector of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick–Lüneburg (King George I) ascended to the British throne. Between then and 1866, when the town became Prussian during the Austro-Prussian War as part of the province of Hanover, Celle was a possession of the British Hanoverian line.

In 1786 Albrecht Thaer founded the first German Agricultural Testing Institute in the meadows in the Dammasch (&quot;dam marsh&quot;) (today Thaer&#x27;s Garden). The Albrecht-Thaer School is nowadays part of a vocational centre in the Celle sub-district of Altenhagen.

===Modern period===
In 1842 the Cambridge Dragoons Barracks (&quot;Cambridge-Dragoner-Kaserne&quot;) for the homonymous regiment named after the Hanoveran Viceroy Duke Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, was built in Celle. After being extended in 1913 and partially rebuilt after a fire in 1936, it was renamed &quot;Goodwood Barracks&quot; in 1945 and from 1976 to 1996 was the headquarters of Panzerbrigade 33 in the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr. In 1989 it was renamed again to Cambridge-Dragoner-Kaserne. Since 1996 the area has mainly been used to house one of the largest youth centres in Lower Saxony.

From 1869 to 1872 an infantry barracks was built for the 77th Infantry Regiment which also gave the main street (running the length of the front of the barracks) its name of 77er Strasse. In 1938 it was renamed the &quot;Heidekaserne&quot; (&quot;Heath Barracks&quot;). After the Second World War the barracks was used by British troops until 1993 during which time 94 Locating Regiment Royal Artillery held residency for over 25 years, followed briefly by 14 Signal Regiment, which relocated from Scheuen until the barracks were handed back to the local authorities. Today the New Town Hall (&quot;Neue Rathaus&quot;) and Celle Council Offices are housed in the restored brick building. Residential buildings and a town park have been established on the rest of the terrain. 

In 1892 − with the help of numerous citizens&#x27; donations − the present-day &quot;Bomann Museum&quot; with its important folklore and town-history collections was founded. In 1913 the 74 metre high clock tower was built on the town church and its clockwork underwent a major restoration in 2008. In the 1920s the silk mill was built. It was merged in 1932 with the one in Peine to become the &quot;Seidenwerk Spinnhütte AG&quot;. This concern expanded during the Nazi era into an armaments centre under the name of Seidenwerk Spinnhütte AG. A subsidiary founded in 1936, the Mitteldeutsche Spinnhütte AG, led war preparations through its branches in the central German towns of Apolda, Plauen, Osterode, Pirna and Wanfried. Its only product was the parachute silk needed for the paratroopers of the Wehrmacht.

During World War I, Germany operated two prisoner-of-war camps in Celle, and among its prisoners were British, Polish, Romanian, French, Belgian and Russian POWs and civilians. In 1916–1917, the Germans operated a special sub-sector for Polish POWs at one of the camps, with the aim of subjecting them to propaganda and conscripting them into a planned German-controlled Polish army to fight against Russia.

In September 1929 Rudolph Karstadt opened a Karstadt department store in Celle town centre, the façade of which was identical to that of the Karstadt store on Berlin&#x27;s Hermannplatz. The Celle branch was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a controversial new building, the aluminium-braced facade of which was meant to represent Celle&#x27;s timber-framed houses.

===Nazi era===
During Kristallnacht, the anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany on 9/10 November 1938, the synagogue in Celle was saved from complete destruction only because it was in a very narrow lane and there would have been a risk to the adjacent leather factory and other parts of the historical city centre with its old wooden houses.

On 1 April 1939 Altenhäusen, Klein Hehlen, Neuenhäusen, Vorwerk and Wietzenbruch were incorporated into Celle. When World War II broke out, two serious Allied bombings occurred during the bombing of Celle: one on 22 February when the Celle railway station was attacked as a part of Operation Clarion and on 8 April 1945, when 2.2% of the town was destroyed, especially the industrial areas and railway freight terminal. A train in which about 4,000 prisoners were being transported to the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was hit. The attack claimed hundreds of casualties, but some of the prisoners managed to escape into the nearby woods. SS guards and Celle citizens participated in the so-called &#x27;Celle hare hunt&#x27; (&quot;Celler Hasenjagd&quot;). The &#x27;hunt&#x27; claimed several hundred dead and went on until 10 April 1945 and represented the darkest chapter in Celle&#x27;s history. The exact number of victims has not been determined. Several of the perpetrators were later tried and convicted of this war crime. A memorial with an information board and a copper-beech tree was inaugurated in Triftanlagen park on 8 April 1992. The German word for copper-beech is Blutbuche, meaning blood beech.

About 2.2% of Celle (67 houses) was destroyed in the Second World War. 550 houses were heavily damaged and 614 were slightly damaged. Celle was spared from further destruction by surrendering without a fight to advancing allied troops on 12 April 1945, so that the historical city centre and the castle survived the war completely unscathed.

===Military===

In Nazi Germany, Celle was an important garrison location. Elements of the 17th and 73rd Infantry Regiments and the 19th Artillery Regiment were garrisoned in the town. Celle was also the headquarters of a military district command and a military records office.

The different German Army barracks (including the Freiherr von Fritsch Barracks in Scheuen and the Cambridge Dragoons Barracks in the city) were used as sites for the German 33rd Armoured Brigade until the 1990s. The Celle Air Base (Immelmann Barracks) in the District of Wietzenbruch is now the site of the Training Centre of the Army Aviation School and the Cambridge Dragoons Barracks has now become a youth cultural centre (CD-Kaserne).

The British Army barracks, which as Celle Station formed part of Bergen-Hohne Garrison, were handed over to the German authorities on 5 November 2012. Since German reunification, Celle has largely lost its role as a major garrison town.

===Post-war era===
After the war Celle applied, along with Bonn and Frankfurt, to become the seat for the Parliamentary Council (&quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot;), the immediate post-war governmental body in Germany, later superseded by the West German Bundestag. In the end the privilege went to Bonn.

Trenchard Barracks in Celle was the most modern barracks in Germany during the war, with blackout blinds between the double-glazed windows and other features which became commonplace afterwards. The cellar doors were trial rooms for the number of inmates from Belsen who could be gassed. When Belsen concentration camp was liberated Trenchard Barracks was used as a hospital for surviving inmates who needed treatment. Later it became the Barracks for the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade.

On 1 January 1973 Celle lost its status as an independent town (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) and became the largest municipality in the new district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of Celle. It also became the largest town in the new region (&quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot;) of Lüneburg. At the same time the localities of Ummern, Pollhöfen and Hahnenhorn were incorporated into Gifhorn district. Since then the parish of Hohne has looked after six villages (Hohne, Helmerkamp, Spechtshorn, Ummern, Pollhöfen and Hahnenhorn) in two rural districts. The town of Celle has also incorporated a number of villages from the surrounding area.

On 25 July 1978 a staged bomb attack was made on the outer wall of the prison. This was initially blamed on the Red Army Faction, but was later revealed to have been perpetrated by Lower Saxony&#x27;s intelligence service, the Verfassungsschutz. The incident became known as the Celle Hole.
In 2004 the region of Lüneburg was dissolved along with the rest of Lower Saxony&#x27;s administrative districts. Celle is currently the twelfth largest town in Lower Saxony.

===Incorporation of municipalities===
* 1 April 1939: Altenhäusen, Klein Hehlen, Neuenhäusen, Vorwerk und Wietzenbruch
* 1 January 1973: Altencelle, Altenhagen, Alvern, Bostel, Boye, Burg, Garßen, Groß Hehlen, Hustedt, Lachtehausen, Scheuen and Westercelle.

===Growth in population===
In the Middle Ages and early modern period Celle only had a few thousand inhabitants. The population grew only slowly and dropped frequently as a result of many wars, epidemics and periods of famine. Not until the beginnings of industrialisation in the 19th century did population growth accelerate. It reached a total of 8,800 in 1818 but by 1900 this had more than doubled to 20,000. The incorporation of the surrounding villages on 1 April 1939 saw a further (artificial) rise in numbers to 38,000.

Shortly after the Second World War the many refugees and displaced persons from Eastern Europe led to a steep rise in the number of inhabitants within just a few months from around 17,000 to 55,000 by December 1945. The addition of new municipalities on 1 January 1973 saw an additional 18,691 people being included within the borough of Celle and bringing the total population to 75,178 − its historical high point.
On 30 June 2005 the official number of inhabitants within Celle borough, according to an update by the Lower Saxony State Department of Statistics, was 71,402 (only main residences, and after adjustments with the other state departments).

The following overview shows the population numbers based on the &#x27;catchment area&#x27; at the time. The 1818 figure is an estimate, the rest are based on census results(¹) or official updates by the Department of Statistics. From 1871 the returns show the population actually present, from 1925 the resident population and since 1987 the population residing at their main residence. Before 1871 the numbers are based on various, different census-gathering processes.

==Main sights==
The buildings in Celle&#x27;s old town centre date back to the 16th century, among them numerous (and some 480 restored) half-timber houses with wood carvings, making Celle an important city for tourism in the southern Lüneburg Heath region. One of the most famous houses is &quot;Hoppenerhaus&quot; dating from 1532. The Old Latin School was built in 1602. The most impressive building in Celle is the ducal palace, Schloss Celle, which was built in 1530 in a well-kept park at the site of the former castle. It was enlarged in a baroque style in the 17th century, and a renaissance chapel and a special theatre which is the oldest theatre in Germany were added in 1674. The Old City Hall which is famous for its sandstone carvings was built 1561-1579 in a Renaissance style. Another major attraction is the &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (town church) with its white tower, from where the town trumpeter blows a fanfare twice a day (an old tradition that was revived as a tourist attraction). Originally it was a small gothic chapel built in 1380, but it was enlarged from 1675 to 1698 and transformed into a baroque church with impressive stucco ornaments.

&quot;Hugenottenstrasse&quot; is a historical street with well-preserved wooden houses built at the beginning of the 18th century. It was the main street of a residential area specially laid out for French Huguenots who sought refuge in Celle because of the Persecution of Huguenots under Louis XV in the 17th century. The oldest house dates from 1693. On the corner of Emigrantenstraße, another historical street which was laid out for Austrian refugees at the beginning of the 18th century, Neuhäuser Kirche, a Lutheran church was founded in 1710. It was enlarged from 1852 to 1866. Its steeple dates from the same period.

Even a large prison (&quot;Justizvollzugsanstalt, JVA&quot;) was built in a baroque style in the west of the city centre from 1710 to 1731. It was the only historical building of Celle which was damaged during the air raid on 8 April 1945. It was repaired after the war. Sometimes tourists walking from the railway station to the centre mistake it for a castle because of its typical baroque architecture.

Celle has a synagogue built in 1740, one of the few that survived the Nazi pogrom night of 1938, thanks to its location in a narrow street of wooden half-timber houses next to an important leather factory that would have been collaterally damaged. 

The Albrecht Thaer School, a school in Celle, was founded by Albrecht Daniel Thaer in 1796.

=== Museums ===
The Bomann Museum opposite the castle has works by the artist Eberhard Schlotter and has exhibitions of local folklore and town history. It houses the Tansey Collection, a collection of portrait miniatures. The Celle Art Museum (&quot;Kunstmuseum Celle&quot;) with its Robert Simon collection is affiliated with the Bomann Museum.

In the castle itself is the &quot;Residenz Museum&quot;, which makes use of its premises and an exhibition to document the princely House of Welf. The Garrison Museum deals with the history of Celle Garrison from 1866 to the present day, whilst the Shooting Museum (&quot;Schützenmuseum&quot;) in &quot;Haus der Stadtmauer&quot; is devoted to Celle&#x27;s shooting club history. The work of Celle&#x27;s &quot;Neues Bauen&quot; architect, Otto Haesler, is charted by the Haesler Museum. And in the old storage barn (&quot;Treppenspeicher&quot;) built in 1607, as well as the orangery, built in 1677 for the Institute of Apiculture, an exhibition of beekeeping may be viewed.

===Theatre===
The &quot;Schlosstheater Celle&quot; was founded in 1674 and is the oldest, still working theatre in Germany and the oldest baroque theatre in Europe. It has a main auditorium and two smaller stages (&quot;Malersaal&quot; and &quot;Turmbühne&quot;) as well as an additional external venue (&quot;Halle 19&quot;).
Located at the edge of the old town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;) is the performing arts theatre &quot;Kunst &amp; Bühne&quot; which is supported by the town and whose repertoire ranges from comedy to songs, jazz, cabaret and films.

===Parks===
The picturesque French Garden lies immediately south of the &quot;Altstadt&quot; and is where the Lower Saxon Institute of Apiculture may be found. The Castle Park, with its moats, is on the site of the former defensive fortifications of the ducal castle. Along &quot;Bahnhofstraße&quot; there is an area of common pasture used as a public park and play area (&quot;Triftanlagen&quot;).
On the right bank of the Aller are the Dammasch Meadows, a popular destination for trips and recreation, and immediately next to them is the garden of medicinal plants and the Thaers Garden with its little manor house. By the New Town Hall (&quot;Neues Rathaus&quot;) is the recently laid-out town park. Other important open areas include the various town cemeteries, such as the picturesque forest cemetery, the &quot;Waldfriedhof&quot;, with its nature garden.

Celle also hosted Angola&#x27;s national football team during the 2006 Football World Cup.

==Economy and Infrastructure==

=== Economy ===

Tourism is a large contributor to Celle&#x27;s economy, especially in the summer months during jazz, wine, and other festivals, which attract thousands of visitors.

The town is not really known for heavy industry, but many businesses which have started up in Celle and some, such as Rosa Graf Cosmetics, have reached the world market. Celle does have some links to the oil industry, though, particularly firms engineering parts for drilling; notably Baker Hughes (INTEQ and Hughes Christensen divisions; oil and gas industry service companies specialising in MWD, Wireline, Drill-bits, Drilling Applications Engineering, etc.), Cameron (global provider of pressure control, processing, flow control and compression systems as well as project management and aftermarket services for the oil and gas and process industries), and ITAG (drilling contractors and manufacturing plant). Halliburton, founded in 1919, is one of the world&#x27;s largest providers of products and services to the energy industry and has an office in Celle. There is also a school for advance drilling techniques.

Other light industries include electronics, food manufacture, and metal, wood and plastic processing. In addition there an ink manufacturer &quot;(formerly Hostmann-Steinberg now hubergroup)&quot;, paper factory &quot;(Werner Achilles Glanzfolien-Kaschieranstalt)&quot; and musical instruments makers (including &quot; Moeck&quot;). Celle is also home to Germany&#x27;s Bee institute which carries out scientific studies on the bee species as well as keeping its own bee hives.

Celle is also known as a town of civil servants, due to the large number of government officials and lawyers who work there providing important administrative and judicial services to the region. Agriculture and forestry also play a role.

====Foodstuffs====
Celle is the base for a crispbread factory, Barilla Wasa Deutschland. Regional and to some extent national suppliers are the high-alcohol drink manufactures of the &quot;Ratzeputz&quot; and &quot;Alter Provisor&quot; brands. Originally made in Celle&#x27;s Altstadt, the herb-based spirit &quot;Ratzeputz&quot; is now distilled on the Westercelle industrial estate, &quot;Alter Provisor&quot; is still produced and sold in the &quot;Altstadt&quot;. &quot;Celler Bier&quot; is also established here with its six varieties of beer. Another Celle speciality is &quot;Rohe Roulade&quot;, which initially gained fame in the &quot;Gasthaus Krohne&quot; (now &quot;Dackel&#x27;s Krohne&quot;) in the district of Blumlage and is now offered in many of Celle&#x27;s restaurants and pubs.

====Transport and logistics====
The East Hanoverian Railways (&quot;Osthannoversche Eisenbahnen&quot; or &quot;OHE&quot;) is a goods and passenger transport company covering the north German area with its headquarters in Celle.
Also based in Celle are the postal distribution centre for Deutsche Post&#x27;s post code district 29 and the transport company DTLS – Drilling Tools Logistic &amp; Service.

===Transport===

==== Rail ====
Celle lies on the Hanover – Celle – Uelzen – Lüneburg – Hamburg line. Intercity (IC) trains to Hanover and Hamburg stop hourly at the station as do individual ICE trains during the rush hour. metronom trains link Celle to Uelzen, Hanover and Göttingen as part of the regional transport network. Celle is the terminus for routes S 6 and S 7 of the Hanover S-Bahn.

The section between Celle and Großburgwedel was built in the 1920s as a high-speed line for testing and record journeys across the heath-like, so-called Wietzenbruch. It was nicknamed the Hare Railway (&quot;Hasenbahn&quot;) due to its environment which was devoid of habitation and the numerous hares killed on the line in its early days. In 1965 this section via Langenhagen was electrified for the TEE and IC services from Hamburg to Hanover, in order to save routing them via Lehrte and having to change direction in Hanover. Later it was upgraded for traffic operating regularly at .
Formerly there were railway links from Celle via Schwarmstedt to Bremen (Aller Valley Railway) and via Plockhorst to Brunswick; these were closed in the 1970s and have largely been dismantled. In 2004 the last remaining branch line from Gifhorn to Celle via Wienhausen, that was still used in places for goods traffic, was finally closed and work on lifting the line in the area of the town has begun.

The East Hanoverian Railways run goods trains on several branch lines in the Celle area, including those to Wittingen, Soltau and Munster. Occasionally heritage trains and specials also run on these lines.

The Lehrte–Celle railway is an important route for goods trains and was converted in 1998 into a modern S-Bahn line.

A tramway network of 2 lines had been operated since 1907 by the Celler Straßenbahn but this was closed and dismantled between 1954 and 1956.

====Road====
Important links are:

* North-south: the B 3 running north to Soltau/Hamburg and south to Hanover
* Southeast-west: the B 214 running southeast to Brunswick and west to Nienburg
* Northeast: the B 191 to Uelzen/Lüneburg/Ludwigslust
* Landesstraße 310 via Fuhrberg southwest to the junction at Mellendorf on the A 7 motorway
* Landesstraße 282 east-northeast via Beedenbostel, Eldingen and Steinhorst to Wittingen
* Landesstraße 180 via Winsen (Aller) west-northwest to the motorway services of &quot;Raststätte Allertal&quot;, on the A 7

====Air====

Hanover-Langenhagen airport with international flight connections is about away.

The Army airfield at Celle is 4.5 kilometres southwest of the town centre on the edge of the district of Wietzenbruch. Operated as RAF Celle after the Second World War, it was from here in 1948–49 that supply flights to Berlin took off as part of the Berlin Airlift. Today the airfield is mainly used by the Army Aviation School (&quot;Heeresfliegerwaffenschule&quot;) as a training airfield for helicopter pilots.
Celle-Arloh airfield near the district of Scheuen is a recreational airfield. It also offers round trips over the town of Celle and the Lüneburg Heath. There is also a glider airfield at Scheuen.

====Water====
Celle harbour is only used by tourists today. From Celle the Aller is classified downstream as a federal shipping lane; upstream a weir prevents ships passing. In former centuries Celle was an important transhipment station for ships between Brunswick and the ports in Bremen via Oker, Aller and the (Lower) Weser. Bremen and Brunswick merchants had specific tasks from the Dukes of Celle and later the town of Celle in order to ensure the safety of transport, because the speed of the Aller in the area of Celle made loading and unloading in the port necessary.

From 1900 the quantity of trade through Celle Harbour steadily decreased and switched to road and rail. Until 1970 the transport of grain to the Celle &quot;Rathsmühle&quot; and the transport of potash salts were still significant.

====Town public transport services====
The firm of CeBus runs eight bus lines around the town. There are 15 bus lines for regional services, with which the villages in the district of Celle can be reached. Sometimes town and region bus services are combined.

===Media===
The &quot;Cellesche Zeitung&quot; is the local daily newspaper with a circulation of 34,977 . In addition there is the bi-weekly &quot;Celler Kurier&quot; and weekly &quot;Celler Blitz&quot; as well as a monthly town magazine, the &quot;Celler Scene&quot;. Another monthly is the &quot;Celler Blickpunkt&quot;. The &quot;revista&quot; appears roughly every 2 months with a left-wing perspective of politics and culture.

===Education===

==== Schools ====
The grammar schools (&quot;Gymnasien&quot;) in Celle are the Hermann Billung Gymnasium which majors in mathematics, the sciences, Spanish and bilingual education (history to level 7 in English), the Kaiserin Auguste Viktoria Gymnasium with a focus on music and European studies, the Gymnasium Ernestinum with Latin and ancient Greek, which was founded in 1328 as the Latin school, and the Hölty Gymnasium with courses in Russian and which has a mathematics and science branch.

The other general schools are the three secondary schools (&quot;Realschulen&quot;) (Westercelle, Auf der Heese, Burgstraße), six combined primary (&quot;Grundschulen&quot;) and secondary modern (&quot;Hauptschulen&quot;) schools (Altstadt, Blumlage, Groß Hehlen, Heese-Süd, Neustadt, Wietzenbruch) as well as nine primary schools. In addition there are also the Catholic primary school (&quot;Katholische Schule&quot;) and the Montessori primary and secondary school, &quot;Freie Aktive Schule Celle&quot;.

Another important educational establishment in Celle is the Bohrmeisterschule which is a technical college for drilling, extraction and pipeline technology.

Celle is home to one of the two Lower Saxony State Firefighting Schools. It was also the location for the Celler Schule, one of the GEMA foundation institutions for up and coming songwriters, from 1996 to 2008, before it moved to Springe.

<text>Noether&#x27;s theorem states that every continuous symmetry of the action of a physical system with conservative forces has a corresponding conservation law. This is the first of two theorems (see Noether&#x27;s second theorem) published by the mathematician Emmy Noether in 1918. The action of a physical system is the integral over time of a Lagrangian function, from which the system&#x27;s behavior can be determined by the principle of least action. This theorem only applies to continuous and smooth symmetries of physical space.

Noether&#x27;s theorem is used in theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. It reveals the fundamental relation between the symmetries of a physical system and the conservation laws. It also made modern theoretical physicists much more focused on symmetries of physical systems. A generalization of the formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g., systems with a Rayleigh dissipation function). In particular, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

==Basic illustrations and background==
As an illustration, if a physical system behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space (that is, it&#x27;s invariant), its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous rotation: from this symmetry, Noether&#x27;s theorem dictates that the angular momentum of the system be conserved, as a consequence of its laws of motion. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. It is the laws of its motion that are symmetric.

As another example, if a physical process exhibits the same outcomes regardless of place or time, then its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous translations in space and time respectively: by Noether&#x27;s theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.

Noether&#x27;s theorem is important, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also as a practical calculational tool. It allows investigators to determine the conserved quantities (invariants) from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it allows researchers to consider whole classes of hypothetical Lagrangians with given invariants, to describe a physical system. As an illustration, suppose that a physical theory is proposed which conserves a quantity &quot;X&quot;. A researcher can calculate the types of Lagrangians that conserve &quot;X&quot; through a continuous symmetry. Due to Noether&#x27;s theorem, the properties of these Lagrangians provide further criteria to understand the implications and judge the fitness of the new theory.

There are numerous versions of Noether&#x27;s theorem, with varying degrees of generality. There are natural quantum counterparts of this theorem, expressed in the Ward–Takahashi identities. Generalizations of Noether&#x27;s theorem to superspaces also exist.

== Informal statement of the theorem ==
All fine technical points aside, Noether&#x27;s theorem can be stated informally as:

A more sophisticated version of the theorem involving fields states that:

The word &quot;symmetry&quot; in the above statement refers more precisely to the covariance of the form that a physical law takes with respect to a one-dimensional Lie group of transformations satisfying certain technical criteria. The conservation law of a physical quantity is usually expressed as a continuity equation.

The formal proof of the theorem utilizes the condition of invariance to derive an expression for a current associated with a conserved physical quantity. In modern terminology, the conserved quantity is called the &quot;Noether charge&quot;, while the flow carrying that charge is called the &quot;Noether current&quot;. The Noether current is defined up to a solenoidal (divergenceless) vector field.

In the context of gravitation, Felix Klein&#x27;s statement of Noether&#x27;s theorem for action &quot;I&quot; stipulates for the invariants: 
==Brief illustration and overview of the concept==

The main idea behind Noether&#x27;s theorem is most easily illustrated by a system with one coordinate formula_1 and a continuous symmetry formula_2 (gray arrows on the diagram). 

Consider any trajectory formula_3 (bold on the diagram) that satisfies the system&#x27;s laws of motion. That is, the action formula_4 governing this system is stationary on this trajectory, i.e. does not change under any local variation of the trajectory. In particular it would not change under a variation that applies the symmetry flow formula_5 on a time segment and is motionless outside that segment. To keep the trajectory continuous, we use &quot;buffering&quot; periods of small time formula_6 to transition between the segments gradually.

The total change in the action formula_4 now comprises changes brought by every interval in play. Parts, where variation itself vanishes, i.e outside formula_8 bring no formula_9. The middle part does not change the action either, because its transformation formula_5 is a symmetry and thus preserves the Lagrangian formula_11 and the action formula_12. The only remaining parts are the &quot;buffering&quot; pieces. In these regions both the coordinate formula_1 and velocity formula_14 change, but formula_14 changes by formula_16, and the change formula_17 in the coordinate is negligible by comparison since the time span formula_6 of the buffering is small (taken to the limit of 0), so formula_19. So the regions contribute mostly through their &quot;slanting&quot; formula_20. 

That changes the Lagrangian by formula_21, which integrates to
formula_22

These last terms, evaluated around the endpoints formula_23 and formula_24, should cancel each other in order to make the total change in the action formula_9 be zero, as would be expected if the trajectory is a solution. That is
formula_26
meaning the quantity formula_27 is conserved, which is the conclusion of Noether&#x27;s theorem. For instance if pure translations of formula_1 by a constant are the symmetry, then the conserved quantity becomes just formula_29, the canonical momentum.

More general cases follow the same idea:

==Historical context==
A conservation law states that some quantity &quot;X&quot; in the mathematical description of a system&#x27;s evolution remains constant throughout its motion – it is an invariant. Mathematically, the rate of change of &quot;X&quot; (its derivative with respect to time) is zero,

:formula_30

Such quantities are said to be conserved; they are often called constants of motion (although motion &quot;per se&quot; need not be involved, just evolution in time). For example, if the energy of a system is conserved, its energy is invariant at all times, which imposes a constraint on the system&#x27;s motion and may help in solving for it. Aside from insights that such constants of motion give into the nature of a system, they are a useful calculational tool; for example, an approximate solution can be corrected by finding the nearest state that satisfies the suitable conservation laws.

The earliest constants of motion discovered were momentum and kinetic energy, which were proposed in the 17th century by René Descartes and Gottfried Leibniz on the basis of collision experiments, and refined by subsequent researchers. Isaac Newton was the first to enunciate the conservation of momentum in its modern form, and showed that it was a consequence of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. According to general relativity, the conservation laws of linear momentum, energy and angular momentum are only exactly true globally when expressed in terms of the sum of the stress–energy tensor (non-gravitational stress–energy) and the Landau–Lifshitz stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor (gravitational stress–energy). The local conservation of non-gravitational linear momentum and energy in a free-falling reference frame is expressed by the vanishing of the covariant divergence of the stress–energy tensor. Another important conserved quantity, discovered in studies of the celestial mechanics of astronomical bodies, is the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, physicists developed more systematic methods for discovering invariants. A major advance came in 1788 with the development of Lagrangian mechanics, which is related to the principle of least action. In this approach, the state of the system can be described by any type of generalized coordinates q; the laws of motion need not be expressed in a Cartesian coordinate system, as was customary in Newtonian mechanics. The action is defined as the time integral &quot;I&quot; of a function known as the Lagrangian &quot;L&quot;

:formula_31

where the dot over q signifies the rate of change of the coordinates q,

:formula_32

Hamilton&#x27;s principle states that the physical path q(&quot;t&quot;)—the one actually taken by the system—is a path for which infinitesimal variations in that path cause no change in &quot;I&quot;, at least up to first order. This principle results in the Euler–Lagrange equations,

:formula_33

Thus, if one of the coordinates, say &quot;qk&quot;, does not appear in the Lagrangian, the right-hand side of the equation is zero, and the left-hand side requires that

:formula_34

where the momentum

:formula_35

is conserved throughout the motion (on the physical path).

Thus, the absence of the ignorable coordinate &quot;qk&quot; from the Lagrangian implies that the Lagrangian is unaffected by changes or transformations of &quot;qk&quot;; the Lagrangian is invariant, and is said to exhibit a symmetry under such transformations. This is the seed idea generalized in Noether&#x27;s theorem.

Several alternative methods for finding conserved quantities were developed in the 19th century, especially by William Rowan Hamilton. For example, he developed a theory of canonical transformations which allowed changing coordinates so that some coordinates disappeared from the Lagrangian, as above, resulting in conserved canonical momenta. Another approach, and perhaps the most efficient for finding conserved quantities, is the Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

Emmy Noether&#x27;s work on the invariance theorem began in 1915 when she was helping Felix Klein and David Hilbert with their work related to Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity By March 1918 she had most of the key ideas for the paper which would be published later in the year.

==Mathematical expression==
===Simple form using perturbations===

The essence of Noether&#x27;s theorem is generalizing the notion of ignorable coordinates.

One can assume that the Lagrangian &quot;L&quot; defined above is invariant under small perturbations (warpings) of the time variable &quot;t&quot; and the generalized coordinates q. One may write

:formula_36

where the perturbations &quot;δt&quot; and &quot;δ&quot;q are both small, but variable. For generality, assume there are (say) &quot;N&quot; such symmetry transformations of the action, i.e. transformations leaving the action unchanged; labelled by an index &quot;r&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ..., &quot;N&quot;.

Then the resultant perturbation can be written as a linear sum of the individual types of perturbations,
:formula_37

where &quot;ε&quot;&quot;r&quot; are infinitesimal parameter coefficients corresponding to each: 
* generator &quot;Tr&quot; of time evolution, and
* generator Q&quot;r&quot; of the generalized coordinates.
For translations, Q&quot;r&quot; is a constant with units of length; for rotations, it is an expression linear in the components of q, and the parameters make up an angle.

Using these definitions, Noether showed that the &quot;N&quot; quantities

:formula_38

are conserved (constants of motion).

==== Examples ====

I. Time invariance

For illustration, consider a Lagrangian that does not depend on time, i.e., that is invariant (symmetric) under changes &quot;t&quot; → &quot;t&quot; + δ&quot;t&quot;, without any change in the coordinates q. In this case, &quot;N&quot; = 1, &quot;T&quot; = 1 and Q = 0; the corresponding conserved quantity is the total energy &quot;H&quot;

:formula_39

II. Translational invariance

Consider a Lagrangian which does not depend on an (&quot;ignorable&quot;, as above) coordinate &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;; so it is invariant (symmetric) under changes &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; → &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;δq&quot;&quot;k&quot;. In that case, &quot;N&quot; = 1, &quot;T&quot; = 0, and &quot;Q&quot;&quot;k&quot; = 1; the conserved quantity is the corresponding linear momentum &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;

:formula_40

In special and general relativity, these two conservation laws can be expressed either &quot;globally&quot; (as it is done above), or &quot;locally&quot; as a continuity equation. The global versions can be united into a single global conservation law: the conservation of the energy-momentum 4-vector. The local versions of energy and momentum conservation (at any point in space-time) can also be united, into the conservation of a quantity defined &quot;locally&quot; at the space-time point: the stress–energy tensor(this will be derived in the next section).

III. Rotational invariance

The conservation of the angular momentum L = r × p is analogous to its linear momentum counterpart. It is assumed that the symmetry of the Lagrangian is rotational, i.e., that the Lagrangian does not depend on the absolute orientation of the physical system in space. For concreteness, assume that the Lagrangian does not change under small rotations of an angle &quot;δθ&quot; about an axis n; such a rotation transforms the Cartesian coordinates by the equation

:formula_41

Since time is not being transformed, &quot;T&quot; = 0, and &quot;N&quot; = 1. Taking &quot;δθ&quot; as the &quot;ε&quot; parameter and the Cartesian coordinates r as the generalized coordinates q, the corresponding Q variables are given by

:formula_42

Then Noether&#x27;s theorem states that the following quantity is conserved,
:formula_43

In other words, the component of the angular momentum L along the n axis is conserved. And if n is arbitrary, i.e., if the system is insensitive to any rotation, then every component of L is conserved; in short, angular momentum is conserved.

===Field theory version===
Although useful in its own right, the version of Noether&#x27;s theorem just given is a special case of the general version derived in 1915. To give the flavor of the general theorem, a version of Noether&#x27;s theorem for continuous fields in four-dimensional space–time is now given. Since field theory problems are more common in modern physics than mechanics problems, this field theory version is the most commonly used (or most often implemented) version of Noether&#x27;s theorem.

Let there be a set of differentiable fields formula_5 defined over all space and time; for example, the temperature formula_45 would be representative of such a field, being a number defined at every place and time. The principle of least action can be applied to such fields, but the action is now an integral over space and time

:formula_46

(the theorem can be further generalized to the case where the Lagrangian depends on up to the &quot;n&quot;th derivative, and can also be formulated using jet bundles).

A continuous transformation of the fields formula_5 can be written infinitesimally as

:formula_48

where formula_49 is in general a function that may depend on both formula_50 and formula_5. The condition for formula_49 to generate a physical symmetry is that the action formula_53 is left invariant. This will certainly be true if the Lagrangian density formula_54 is left invariant, but it will also be true if the Lagrangian changes by a divergence,

:formula_55

since the integral of a divergence becomes a boundary term according to the divergence theorem. A system described by a given action might have multiple independent symmetries of this type, indexed by formula_56 so the most general symmetry transformation would be written as

:formula_57

with the consequence

:formula_58

For such systems, Noether&#x27;s theorem states that there are formula_59 conserved current densities

:formula_60

(where the dot product is understood to contract the &quot;field&quot; indices, not the formula_61 index or formula_62 index).

In such cases, the conservation law is expressed in a four-dimensional way

:formula_63

which expresses the idea that the amount of a conserved quantity within a sphere cannot change unless some of it flows out of the sphere. For example, electric charge is conserved; the amount of charge within a sphere cannot change unless some of the charge leaves the sphere.

For illustration, consider a physical system of fields that behaves the same under translations in time and space, as considered above; in other words, formula_64 is constant in its third argument. In that case, &quot;N&quot; = 4, one for each dimension of space and time. An infinitesimal translation in space, formula_65 (with formula_66 denoting the Kronecker delta), affects the fields as formula_67: that is, relabelling the coordinates is equivalent to leaving the coordinates in place while translating the field itself, which in turn is equivalent to transforming the field by replacing its value at each point formula_50 with the value at the point formula_69 &quot;behind&quot; it which would be mapped onto formula_50 by the infinitesimal displacement under consideration. Since this is infinitesimal, we may write this transformation as

:formula_71

The Lagrangian density transforms in the same way, formula_72, so

:formula_73

and thus Noether&#x27;s theorem corresponds to the conservation law for the stress–energy tensor &quot;T&quot;&quot;μ&quot;&quot;ν&quot;, where we have used formula_74 in place of formula_62. To wit, by using the expression given earlier, and collecting the four conserved currents (one for each formula_74) into a tensor formula_77, Noether&#x27;s theorem gives

:formula_78

with

:formula_79

(we relabelled formula_74 as formula_81 at an intermediate step to avoid conflict). (However, the formula_77 obtained in this way may differ from the symmetric tensor used as the source term in general relativity; see Canonical stress–energy tensor.)

The conservation of electric charge, by contrast, can be derived by considering &quot;Ψ&quot; linear in the fields &quot;φ&quot; rather than in the derivatives. In quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude &quot;ψ&quot;(x) of finding a particle at a point x is a complex field &quot;φ&quot;, because it ascribes a complex number to every point in space and time. The probability amplitude itself is physically unmeasurable; only the probability &quot;p&quot; = |&quot;ψ&quot;|2 can be inferred from a set of measurements. Therefore, the system is invariant under transformations of the &quot;ψ&quot; field and its complex conjugate field &quot;ψ&quot;* that leave |&quot;ψ&quot;|2 unchanged, such as

:formula_83

a complex rotation. In the limit when the phase &quot;θ&quot; becomes infinitesimally small, &quot;δθ&quot;, it may be taken as the parameter &quot;ε&quot;, while the &quot;Ψ&quot; are equal to &quot;iψ&quot; and −&quot;iψ&quot;*, respectively. A specific example is the Klein–Gordon equation, the relativistically correct version of the Schrödinger equation for spinless particles, which has the Lagrangian density

:formula_84

In this case, Noether&#x27;s theorem states that the conserved (∂ ⋅ &quot;j&quot; = 0) current equals

:formula_85

which, when multiplied by the charge on that species of particle, equals the electric current density due to that type of particle. This &quot;gauge invariance&quot; was first noted by Hermann Weyl, and is one of the prototype gauge symmetries of physics.

== Derivations ==

===One independent variable===
Consider the simplest case, a system with one independent variable, time. Suppose the dependent variables q are such that the action integral

formula_86

is invariant under brief infinitesimal variations in the dependent variables. In other words, they satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equations

:formula_87

And suppose that the integral is invariant under a continuous symmetry. Mathematically such a symmetry is represented as a flow, φ, which acts on the variables as follows

:formula_88

where &quot;ε&quot; is a real variable indicating the amount of flow, and &quot;T&quot; is a real constant (which could be zero) indicating how much the flow shifts time.

:formula_89

The action integral flows to

:formula_90

which may be regarded as a function of &quot;ε&quot;. Calculating the derivative at &quot;ε&quot; = 0 and using Leibniz&#x27;s rule, we get

:formula_91

Notice that the Euler–Lagrange equations imply

:formula_92

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:formula_93

Again using the Euler–Lagrange equations we get

:formula_94

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:formula_95

From which one can see that

:formula_96

is a constant of the motion, i.e., it is a conserved quantity. Since φ[q, 0] = q, we get formula_97 and so the conserved quantity simplifies to

:formula_98

To avoid excessive complication of the formulas, this derivation assumed that the flow does not change as time passes. The same result can be obtained in the more general case.

===Field-theoretic derivation===
Noether&#x27;s theorem may also be derived for tensor fields formula_99 where the index &quot;A&quot; ranges over the various components of the various tensor fields. These field quantities are functions defined over a four-dimensional space whose points are labeled by coordinates &quot;x&quot;μ where the index &quot;μ&quot; ranges over time (&quot;μ&quot; = 0) and three spatial dimensions (&quot;μ&quot; = 1, 2, 3). These four coordinates are the independent variables; and the values of the fields at each event are the dependent variables. Under an infinitesimal transformation, the variation in the coordinates is written

:formula_100

whereas the transformation of the field variables is expressed as

:formula_101

By this definition, the field variations formula_102 result from two factors: intrinsic changes in the field themselves and changes in coordinates, since the transformed field &quot;α&quot;&quot;A&quot; depends on the transformed coordinates ξμ. To isolate the intrinsic changes, the field variation at a single point &quot;x&quot;μ may be defined

:formula_103

If the coordinates are changed, the boundary of the region of space–time over which the Lagrangian is being integrated also changes; the original boundary and its transformed version are denoted as Ω and Ω’, respectively.

Noether&#x27;s theorem begins with the assumption that a specific transformation of the coordinates and field variables does not change the action, which is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over the given region of spacetime. Expressed mathematically, this assumption may be written as

:formula_104

where the comma subscript indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate(s) that follows the comma, e.g.

:formula_105

Since ξ is a dummy variable of integration, and since the change in the boundary Ω is infinitesimal by assumption, the two integrals may be combined using the four-dimensional version of the divergence theorem into the following form

:formula_106

The difference in Lagrangians can be written to first-order in the infinitesimal variations as

:formula_107

However, because the variations are defined at the same point as described above, the variation and the derivative can be done in reverse order; they commute

:formula_108

Using the Euler–Lagrange field equations

:formula_109

the difference in Lagrangians can be written neatly as

:formula_110

Thus, the change in the action can be written as

:formula_111

Since this holds for any region Ω, the integrand must be zero

:formula_112

For any combination of the various symmetry transformations, the perturbation can be written

:formula_113

where formula_114 is the Lie derivative of 
formula_99 in the &quot;X&quot;&quot;μ&quot; direction. When formula_99 is a scalar or formula_117,

:formula_118

These equations imply that the field variation taken at one point equals

:formula_119

Differentiating the above divergence with respect to &quot;ε&quot; at &quot;ε&quot; = 0 and changing the sign yields the conservation law

:formula_120

where the conserved current equals

:formula_121

===Manifold/fiber bundle derivation===
Suppose we have an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold, &quot;M&quot; and a target manifold &quot;T&quot;. Let formula_122 be the configuration space of smooth functions from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;T&quot;. (More generally, we can have smooth sections of a fiber bundle &quot;T&quot; over &quot;M&quot;.)

Examples of this &quot;M&quot; in physics include:
* In classical mechanics, in the Hamiltonian formulation, &quot;M&quot; is the one-dimensional manifold formula_123, representing time and the target space is the cotangent bundle of space of generalized positions.
* In field theory, &quot;M&quot; is the spacetime manifold and the target space is the set of values the fields can take at any given point. For example, if there are &quot;m&quot; real-valued scalar fields, formula_124, then the target manifold is formula_125. If the field is a real vector field, then the target manifold is isomorphic to formula_126.

Now suppose there is a functional

:formula_127

called the action. (It takes values into formula_123, rather than formula_129; this is for physical reasons, and is unimportant for this proof.)

To get to the usual version of Noether&#x27;s theorem, we need additional restrictions on the action. We assume formula_130 is the integral over &quot;M&quot; of a function

:formula_131

called the Lagrangian density, depending on formula_5, its derivative and the position. In other words, for formula_5 in formula_122

:formula_135

Suppose we are given boundary conditions, i.e., a specification of the value of formula_5 at the boundary if &quot;M&quot; is compact, or some limit on formula_5 as &quot;x&quot; approaches ∞. Then the subspace of formula_122 consisting of functions formula_5 such that all functional derivatives of formula_53 at formula_5 are zero, that is:

:formula_142

and that formula_5 satisfies the given boundary conditions, is the subspace of on shell solutions. (See principle of stationary action)

Now, suppose we have an infinitesimal transformation on formula_122, generated by a functional derivation, &quot;Q&quot; such that

:formula_145

for all compact submanifolds &quot;N&quot; or in other words,

:formula_146

for all &quot;x&quot;, where we set

:formula_147

If this holds on shell and off shell, we say &quot;Q&quot; generates an off-shell symmetry. If this only holds on shell, we say &quot;Q&quot; generates an on-shell symmetry. Then, we say &quot;Q&quot; is a generator of a one parameter symmetry Lie group.

Now, for any &quot;N&quot;, because of the Euler–Lagrange theorem, on shell (and only on-shell), we have

:formula_148

Since this is true for any &quot;N&quot;, we have

:formula_149

But this is the continuity equation for the current formula_150 defined by:

:formula_151

which is called the Noether current associated with the symmetry. The continuity equation tells us that if we integrate this current over a space-like slice, we get a conserved quantity called the Noether charge (provided, of course, if &quot;M&quot; is noncompact, the currents fall off sufficiently fast at infinity).

=== Comments ===
Noether&#x27;s theorem is an on shell theorem: it relies on use of the equations of motion—the classical path. It reflects the relation between the boundary conditions and the variational principle. Assuming no boundary terms in the action, Noether&#x27;s theorem implies that

: formula_152

The quantum analogs of Noether&#x27;s theorem involving expectation values (e.g., formula_153) probing off shell quantities as well are the Ward–Takahashi identities.

=== Generalization to Lie algebras ===
Suppose we have two symmetry derivations &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;2. Then, [&quot;Q&quot;1, &quot;Q&quot;2] is also a symmetry derivation. Let us see this explicitly. Let us say
formula_154
and
formula_155

Then,
formula_156
where &quot;f&quot;12 = &quot;Q&quot;1[&quot;f&quot;2&quot;μ&quot;] − &quot;Q&quot;2[&quot;f&quot;1&quot;μ&quot;]. So,
formula_157

This shows we can extend Noether&#x27;s theorem to larger Lie algebras in a natural way.

=== Generalization of the proof ===
This applies to &quot;any&quot; local symmetry derivation &quot;Q&quot; satisfying &quot;QS&quot; ≈ 0, and also to more general local functional differentiable actions, including ones where the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the fields. Let &quot;ε&quot; be any arbitrary smooth function of the spacetime (or time) manifold such that the closure of its support is disjoint from the boundary. &quot;ε&quot; is a test function. Then, because of the variational principle (which does &quot;not&quot; apply to the boundary, by the way), the derivation distribution q generated by &quot;q&quot;[&quot;ε&quot;][Φ(&quot;x&quot;)] = &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;Q&quot;[Φ(&quot;x&quot;)] satisfies &quot;q&quot;[&quot;ε&quot;][&quot;S&quot;] ≈ 0 for every &quot;ε&quot;, or more compactly, &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)[&quot;S&quot;] ≈ 0 for all &quot;x&quot; not on the boundary (but remember that &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a shorthand for a derivation &quot;distribution&quot;, not a derivation parametrized by &quot;x&quot; in general). This is the generalization of Noether&#x27;s theorem.

To see how the generalization is related to the version given above, assume that the action is the spacetime integral of a Lagrangian that only depends on formula_5 and its first derivatives. Also, assume

:formula_159

Then,

:formula_160

for all formula_161.

More generally, if the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives, then

:formula_162

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: Conservation of energy ===
Looking at the specific case of a Newtonian particle of mass &quot;m&quot;, coordinate &quot;x&quot;, moving under the influence of a potential &quot;V&quot;, coordinatized by time &quot;t&quot;. The action, &quot;S&quot;, is:

:formula_163

The first term in the brackets is the kinetic energy of the particle, while the second is its potential energy. Consider the generator of time translations &quot;Q&quot; = &quot;d&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;. In other words, formula_164. The coordinate &quot;x&quot; has an explicit dependence on time, whilst &quot;V&quot; does not; consequently:

:formula_165

so we can set

:formula_166

Then,

:formula_167

The right hand side is the energy, and Noether&#x27;s theorem states that formula_168 (i.e. the principle of conservation of energy is a consequence of invariance under time translations).

More generally, if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, the quantity

:formula_169

(called the Hamiltonian) is conserved.

=== Example 2: Conservation of center of momentum ===
Still considering 1-dimensional time, let

:formula_170

for formula_59 Newtonian particles where the potential only depends pairwise upon the relative displacement.

For formula_172, consider the generator of Galilean transformations (i.e. a change in the frame of reference). In other words,

:formula_173

And

:formula_174

This has the form of formula_175 so we can set

:formula_176

Then,

:formula_177

where formula_178 is the total momentum, &quot;M&quot; is the total mass and formula_179 is the center of mass. Noether&#x27;s theorem states:

:formula_180

=== Example 3: Conformal transformation ===

Both examples 1 and 2 are over a 1-dimensional manifold (time). An example involving spacetime is a conformal transformation of a massless real scalar field with a quartic potential in (3 + 1)-Minkowski spacetime.

:formula_181

For &quot;Q&quot;, consider the generator of a spacetime rescaling. In other words,

:formula_182

The second term on the right hand side is due to the &quot;conformal weight&quot; of formula_5. And

:formula_184

This has the form of

:formula_185

(where we have performed a change of dummy indices) so set

:formula_186

Then

:formula_187

Noether&#x27;s theorem states that formula_188 (as one may explicitly check by substituting the Euler–Lagrange equations into the left hand side).

If one tries to find the Ward–Takahashi analog of this equation, one runs into a problem because of anomalies.

== Applications ==
Application of Noether&#x27;s theorem allows physicists to gain powerful insights into any general theory in physics, by just analyzing the various transformations that would make the form of the laws involved invariant. For example:

* Invariance of an isolated system with respect to spatial translation (in other words, that the laws of physics are the same at all locations in space) gives the law of conservation of linear momentum (which states that the total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant)
* Invariance of an isolated system with respect to time translation (i.e. that the laws of physics are the same at all points in time) gives the law of conservation of energy (which states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant)
* Invariance of an isolated system with respect to rotation (i.e., that the laws of physics are the same with respect to all angular orientations in space) gives the law of conservation of angular momentum (which states that the total angular momentum of an isolated system is constant)
* Invariance of an isolated system with respect to Lorentz boosts (i.e., that the laws of physics are the same with respect to all inertial reference frames) gives the center-of-mass theorem (which states that the center-of-mass of an isolated system moves at a constant velocity).

In quantum field theory, the analog to Noether&#x27;s theorem, the Ward–Takahashi identity, yields further conservation laws, such as the conservation of electric charge from the invariance with respect to a change in the phase factor of the complex field of the charged particle and the associated gauge of the electric potential and vector potential.

The Noether charge is also used in calculating the entropy of stationary black holes.

<text>A railroad switch (AE), turnout, or set of] points (CE) is a mechanical installation enabling railway trains to be guided from one track to another, such as at a railway junction or where a spur or siding branches off.

The most common type of switch consists of a pair of linked tapering rails, known as &quot;points&quot; (&quot;switch rails&quot; or &quot;point blades&quot;), lying between the diverging outer rails (the &quot;stock rails&quot;). These points can be moved laterally into one of two positions to direct a train coming from the point blades toward the straight path or the diverging path. A train moving from the narrow end toward the point blades (i.e. it will be directed to one of the two paths, depending on the position of the points) is said to be executing a &quot;facing-point movement&quot;.

For many types of switch, a train coming from either of the converging directions will pass through the switch regardless of the position of the points, as the vehicle&#x27;s wheels will force the points to move. Passage through a switch in this direction is known as a &quot;trailing-point movement&quot; and switches that allow this type of movement without damage to the mechanism are called &quot;trailable switches&quot;.

A switch generally has a straight &quot;through&quot; track (such as the main-line) and a diverging route. The handedness of the installation is described by the side that the diverging track leaves. &quot;Right-hand switches&quot; have a diverging path to the right of the straight track, when coming from the point blades, and a &quot;left-handed switch&quot; has the diverging track leaving to the opposite side. In many cases, such as rail yards, many switches can be found in a short section of track, sometimes with switches going both to the right and left (although it is better to keep these separated as much as feasible). Sometimes a switch merely divides one track into two; at others, it serves as a connection between two or more parallel tracks, allowing a train to &quot;switch&quot; between them. In many cases, where a switch is supplied to leave a track, a second is supplied to allow the train to reenter the track some distance down the line; this allows the track to serve as a siding, allowing a train to get off the track to allow traffic to pass (this siding can either be a dedicated short length of track, or formed from a section of a second, continuous, parallel line), and also allows trains coming from either direction to switch between lines; otherwise, the only way for a train coming from the opposite direction to use a switch would be to stop, and reverse through the switch onto the other line, and then continue forwards (or stop, if it is being used as a siding).

A &quot;straight track&quot; is not always present; for example, both tracks may curve, one to the left and one to the right (such as for a wye switch), or both tracks may curve, with differing radii, while still in the same direction. Switches consume a relatively high proportion of a railway maintenance budget.

== History ==
Simple single-bladed switches were used on early wooden railways to move wagons between tracks. As iron-railed plateways became more common in the eighteenth century, cast iron components were made to build switches with check rails. In 1797, John Curr described the system that he developed which used a single iron blade, hinged on a vertical pin that was tapered to lie against the plateway. By 1808, Curr&#x27;s basic design was in common use.

The use of a sprung rail, giving a smooth transition, was patented by Charles Fox in 1838.

Prior to the widespread availability of electricity, switches at heavily traveled junctions were operated from a signal box constructed near the tracks through an elaborate system of rods and levers. The levers were also used to control railway signals to control the movement of trains over the points. Eventually, mechanical systems known as interlockings were introduced to make sure that a signal could only be set to allow a train to proceed over points when it was safe to do so. Purely mechanical interlockings were eventually developed into integrated systems with electric control. On some low-traffic branch lines, in self-contained marshalling yards, or on heritage railways, switches may still have the earlier type of interlocking.

== Operation ==
A railroad car&#x27;s wheels are primarily guided along the tracks by coning of the wheels, rather than relying on the flanges on the insides of the wheels. When the wheels reach the switch, the wheels are guided along the route determined by which of the two points is connected to the track facing the switch. In the illustration, if the left point is connected, the left wheel will be guided along the rail of that point, and the train will diverge to the right. If the right point is connected, the right wheel&#x27;s flange will be guided along the rail of that point, and the train will continue along the straight track. Only one of the points may be connected to the facing track at any time; the two points are mechanically locked together to ensure that this is always the case.

A mechanism is provided to move the points from one position to the other (&quot;change the points&quot;). Historically, this would require a lever to be moved by a human operator, and some switches are still controlled this way. However, most are now operated by a remotely controlled actuator called a point machine; this may employ an electric motor or a pneumatic or hydraulic actuator. This both allows for remote control and monitoring and for the use of stiffer, strong switches that would be too difficult to move by hand, yet allow for higher speeds.

In a trailing-point movement (running through the switch in the wrong direction while they are set to turn off the track), the flanges on the wheels will force the points to the proper position. This is sometimes known as &quot;running through the switch&quot;. Some switches are designed to be forced to the proper position without damage. Examples include variable switches, spring switches, and weighted switches.

If the points are rigidly connected to the switch control mechanism, the control mechanism&#x27;s linkages may be bent, requiring repair before the switch is again usable. For this reason, switches are normally set to the proper position before performing a trailing-point movement.

=== High-speed operation ===
Generally, switches are designed to be safely traversed at low speed. However, it is possible to modify the simpler types of switch to allow trains to pass at high speed. More complicated switch systems, such as double slips, are restricted to low-speed operation. On European high-speed lines, it is not uncommon to find switches where a speed of or more is allowed on the diverging branch. Switches were passed over at a speed of (straight) during the French world speed run of April 2007.

The US Federal Railroad Administration has published the speed limits for higher-speed turnouts with  26.5 turnout that has speed limit of and  32.7 with speed limit of .

=== Operation in cold conditions ===

Under cold weather conditions, snow and ice can prevent the proper movement of switch or frog point rails, essentially inhibiting the proper operation of railroad switches. Historically, railway companies have employees keep their railroad switches clear of snow and ice by sweeping the snow away using switch brooms (Basically wire brooms with a chisel attached onto the opposite end of the broom – quite similar to ice scrapers used today), or gas torches for melting ice and snow. Such operation are still used in some countries, especially for branch routes with only limited traffic (e.g. seasonal lines). Modern switches for heavily trafficked lines are typically equipped with switch heaters installed in the vicinity of their point rails so that the point rails will not be frozen onto the stock rail and can no longer move. These heaters may take the form of electric heating elements or gas burners mounted on the rail, a lineside burner blowing hot air through ducts, or other innovative methods (e.g. geothermal heat sink, etc.) to keep the point &amp; stock rails above freezing temperatures. Where gas or electric heaters cannot be used due to logistic or economic constraints, anti-icing chemicals can sometimes be applied to create a barrier between the metal surfaces to prevent ice from forming between them (i.e. having frozen together by ice). Such approaches however, may not always be effective for extreme climates since these chemicals will be washed away over time, especially for heavily thrown switches that experience hundreds of throws daily.

Heating alone may not always be enough to keep switches functioning under snowy conditions. Wet snow conditions, which generate particularly sticky snow and whiteout conditions, may occur at temperatures just below freezing, causing chunks of ice to accumulate on trains. When trains traverse over some switches, the shock, vibration, possibly in combination with slight heating caused by braking or a city microclimate, may cause the chunks of ice to fall off, jamming the switches. The heaters need time to melt the ice, so if service frequency is extremely high, there may not be enough time for the ice to melt before the next train arrives, which will then result in service disruptions. Possible solutions include installing higher capacity heaters, reducing the frequency of trains, or applying anti-icing chemicals such as ethylene glycol to the trains.

== Classification ==
The divergence and length of a switch is determined by the angle of the frog (the point in the switch where two rails cross, see below) and the angle or curvature of the switch blades. The length and placement of the other components are determined from this using established formulas and standards. This divergence is measured as the number of units of length for a single unit of separation.

In North America this is generally referred to as a switch&#x27;s &quot;number&quot;. For example, on a &quot;number 12&quot; switch, the rails are one unit apart at a distance of twelve units from the center of the frog.

In the United Kingdom points and crossings using chaired bullhead rail would be referred to using a letter and number combination. The letter would define the length (and hence the radius) of the switch blades and the number would define the angle of the crossing (frog). Thus an A7 turnout would be very short and likely only to be found in tight places like dockyards whereas an E12 would be found as a fairly high speed turnout on a mainline.

On the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, switch curvatures were specified from A (sharpest) to F (shallowest), with the following corresponding radii:
* B – – simple crossover with a 1 in 8 crossing angle
* C – – scissors or simple crossover with a 1 in 10 crossing angle
* D – – double track junction switch with a 1 in 12 crossing angle

== Safety ==
Switches are necessary for the operation of a railway, but they do pose a number of risks:
* Reversing the points under a moving train will almost always derail the train.
* Points might move due to the extreme forces exerted by a passing train. In an especially noteworthy and extreme case, a switch&#x27;s setting was forcibly changed as a result of a disintegrated duo block wheel getting caught in a switch. This caused one of the world&#x27;s worst rail disasters, the Eschede train disaster. 
* A train might stand so close to the frog of a switch that a passing train would collide with its side (the first train is then said to have been &quot;fouling the switch&quot;).
* The necessary maintenance of the complex mechanical device might be neglected.
* Tampering with a manually operable switch or operation errors in an interlocking may result in two trains being on the same track, potentially causing a collision.

===Accidents===
Switch-related accidents caused by one or more of these risks have occurred, including:
* The 1980 Buttevant Rail Disaster at Buttevant, County Cork, in Ireland, when the Dublin–Cork express was derailed at high speed after being inadvertently switched into a siding via ground frame operated points, resulting in 18 deaths.
* Wrecks caused by switches being thrown open in front of the trains by saboteurs, as in the non-fatal derailments near Newport News, on 12 August 1992, and in Stewiacke, on 12 April 2001. To prevent these incidents, most unused switches are locked.
* The Eschede train disaster in 1998 in Germany was one of the world&#x27;s deadliest high-speed train accidents, resulting in 101 deaths. It occurred when a wheel rim of an ICE train failed at , partially derailing the car. The wheel rim went through the floor of the carriage and was dragging on the ground. While passing through the station at Eschede it threw a switch, causing the rear wheels of the car to switch onto a track diverging from the track taken by the front wheels. The car was thereby thrown into and destroyed the piers supporting a 300-tonne roadway overpass.
* The May 2002 Potters Bar rail crash at Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom, occurred when a switch sprang to a different position as a coach crossed it, a type of mishap called &quot;splitting the switch&quot;. The front wheels of a coach progressed along the straight track as intended, but the rear wheels slewed along the diverging track. This caused the whole coach to detach from the train and slew sideways across the platform ahead. The movement of the switch occurred beneath the final coach, so that the preceding coaches remained on the track. Poor maintenance of the points was found to be the primary cause of the crash.
* The interim report into the Grayrigg derailment of 23 February 2007 blamed an incorrectly maintained set of points.
** On 31 July 1991, several cars derailed, killing seven passengers, due to a missing locking pin on the switch mechanism. 
** Twenty-seven years later, on 4 August 2018, the Silver Star crashed into a parked freight train on a siding due to a misaligned switch, killing two crewmen.

== Components ==

=== Switchrails or points (point blades) ===
The &quot;switch rails&quot; or &quot;points&quot; (&quot;point blades&quot;) are the movable rails which guide the wheels towards either the straight or the diverging track. They are tapered, except on &quot;stub switches&quot; in industrial sidings, which have square ends.

In popular parlance in the UK and most other Commonwealth countries, the term &quot;points&quot; refers to the entire mechanism. In professional parlance, the term refers only to the movable rails and the entire mechanism is named &quot;turnout&quot; or &quot;points and crossings&quot;. Turnout and switch are terms used in North America in all contexts.

In some cases, the switch blades can be heat treated for improvement of their service life. There are different kinds of heat treatment processes such as edge hardening or complete hardening.

The cross-section of the switch blades also influences performance. New tangential blades perform better than old-style blades.

=== Crossing (frog or common crossing) ===

The crossing is the component that enables passage of wheels on either route through the turnout. It can be assembled out of several appropriately cut and bent pieces of rail or can be a single casting of manganese steel. On lines with heavy use, the casting may be treated with explosive shock hardening to increase service life.

=== Guard rail (check rail) ===
A &quot;guard rail&quot; is a short piece of rail placed alongside the main (stock) rail opposite the crossing. These ensure that the wheels follow the appropriate flangeway through the frog and that the train does not derail.

&quot;Check rails&quot; are often used on very sharp curves, even where there are no switches.

=== Switch motor ===
A &quot;switch motor&quot; or &quot;switch machine&quot; (point motor or point machine) is an electric, hydraulic or pneumatic mechanism that aligns the points with one of the possible routes. The motor is usually controlled remotely by the dispatcher (signaller in the UK). The switch motor also includes electrical contacts to detect that the switch has completely set and locked. If the switch fails to do this, the governing signal is kept at red (stop). There is also usually some kind of manual handle for operating the switch in emergencies, such as power failures, or for maintenance purposes.

A patent by W. B. Purvis dates from 1897.


=== Switch stand (points lever) ===
A &quot;switch stand&quot; (&quot;points lever&quot; or &quot;ground throw&quot;) is a lever and accompanying linkages to align the points of a switch by hand. The lever and its accompanying hardware is usually mounted to a pair of long ties (sleepers) that extend from the switch at the points. They are often used in a place of a switch motor on less frequently used switches. In some places, the lever may be some distance from the points, as part of a lever frame or ground frame. To prevent the tampering of switches by outside means, these switches are locked when not in use.

=== Facing point lock ===
A &quot;facing point lock&quot; (&quot;FPL&quot;), or &quot;point lock&quot;, is a device which, as the name implies, locks a set of points in position, as well as mechanically proving that they are in the correct position. The &quot;facing point&quot; part of the name refers to the fact that they prevent movement of the points during facing moves, where a train could potentially &quot;split&quot; the points (end up going down both tracks) if the points were to move underneath the train. During trailing moves, the wheels of a train will force the points into the correct position if they attempt to move, although this may cause considerable damage. This act is known as a &quot;run through&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, FPLs were common from an early date, due to laws being passed which forced the provision of FPLs for any routes traveled by passenger trains – it was, and still is, illegal for a passenger train to make a facing move over points without them being locked, either by a point lock, or temporarily clamped in one position or another.

=== Joints ===
&quot;Joints&quot; are used where the moving points meet the fixed rails of the switch. They allow the points to hinge easily between their positions. Originally the movable switch blades were connected to the fixed closure rails with loose joints, but since steel is somewhat flexible it is possible to obviate this looseness by thinning a short section of the rail&#x27;s bottom itself. This can be called a heelless switch.

=== Straight and curved switches ===
Turnouts were originally built with straight switch blades, which ended at the pointed end with a sharp angle. These switches cause a bump when the train traverses in the turnout direction. The switch blades could be made with a curved point which meets the stockrail at a tangent, causing less of a bump, but the disadvantage is that the metal at the point is thin and necessarily weak. A solution to these conflicting requirements was found in the 1920s on the German Reichsbahn. The first step was to have different rail profile for the stock rails and switch rails, with the switch rails being about less high, and stockier in the middle.

== Types ==
Apart from the standard right-hand and left-hand switches, switches commonly come in various combinations of configurations.

=== Slip switches ===

==== Double slip ====
A &quot;double slip switch&quot; (&quot;double slip&quot;) is a narrow-angled diagonal flat crossing of two lines combined with four pairs of points in such a way as to allow vehicles to change from one straight track to the other, alternatively to going straight across. A train approaching the arrangement may leave by either of the two tracks on the opposite side of the crossing. To reach the third possible exit, the train must change tracks on the slip and then reverse.

The arrangement gives the possibility of setting four routes, but because only one route can be traversed at a time, the four blades at each end of the crossing are often connected to move in unison, so the crossing can be worked by just two levers or point motors. This gives the same functionality of two points placed end to end. These compact (albeit complex) switches usually are found only in locations where space is limited, such as station throats (i.e. approaches) where a few main lines spread out to reach any of numerous platform tracks.

In North American English, the arrangement may also be called a &quot;double switch&quot;, or more colloquially, a &quot;puzzle switch&quot;. The Great Western Railway in the United Kingdom used the term &quot;double compound points&quot;, and the switch is also known as a &quot;double compound&quot; in Victoria (Australia). In Italian, the term for a double switch is , which means &quot;English switch&quot;. Likewise, it is called in Dutch and, occasionally, (&quot;english one&quot;, literally &quot;Englishman&quot;) in German.

==== Single slip ====
A &quot;single slip switch&quot; works on the same principle as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching on one of the two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or switch tracks to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot switch tracks. This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.

==== Outside slip ====
An &quot;outside slip switch&quot; is similar to the double or single slip switches described above, except that the switch blades are outside of the diamond instead of inside. An advantage over an inside slip switch is that trains can pass the slips with higher speeds. A disadvantage over an inside slip switch is that they are longer and need more space.

An outside slip switch can be so long that its slips do not overlap at all, as in the example pictured. In such a case a single, outside slip switch is the same as two regular switches and a regular crossing. Double outside slip switches are only used in rare, specific cases.

=== Crossover ===


A &quot;crossover&quot; is a pair of switches that connects two parallel rail tracks, allowing a train on one track to cross over to the other. Like the switches themselves, crossovers can be described as either &quot;facing&quot; or &quot;trailing&quot;.

When two crossovers are present in opposite directions, one after the other, the four-switch configuration is called a &quot;double crossover&quot;. If the crossovers in different directions overlap to form an ×, it is dubbed a &quot;scissors crossover&quot;, &quot;scissors crossing&quot;, or just &quot;scissors&quot;; or, due to the diamond in the center, a &quot;diamond crossover&quot;. This makes for a very compact track layout at the expense of using a level junction.

In a setup where each of the two tracks normally carries trains of only one direction, a crossover can be used either to detour &quot;wrong-rail&quot; around an obstruction or to reverse direction. A crossover can also join two tracks of the same direction, possibly a pair of local and express tracks, and allow trains to switch from one to the other.

On a crowded system, routine use of crossovers (or switches in general) will reduce throughput, as use of the switch blocks multiple tracks. For this reason, on some high-capacity rapid transit systems, crossovers between local and express tracks are not used during normal rush hour service, and service patterns are planned around use of the usually flying junctions at each end of the local-express line.

=== Stub switch ===

A &quot;stub switch&quot; lacks the tapered points (point blades) of a typical switch. Instead, both the movable rails and the ends of the rails of the diverging routes have their ends cut off square. The switch mechanism aligns the movable rails with the rails of one of the diverging routes. In 19th century US railroad use, the stub switch was typically used in conjunction with a harp switch stand.

The rails leading up to a stub switch are not secured to the sleepers for several feet, and rail alignment across the gap is not positively enforced. Stub switches also require some flexibility in the rails (meaning lighter rails), or an extra joint at which they hinge. Therefore, these switches cannot be traversed at high speed or by heavy traffic and so are not suitable for main line use. A further disadvantage is that a stub switch being approached from the diverging route that is not connected by the points would result in a derailment. Yet another disadvantage is that in very hot weather, expansion of the steel in the rails can cause the movable rails to stick to the stock rails, making switching impossible until the rails have cooled and contracted.

One advantage to stub switches is that they work better in the snow. The sideways action of the point rails pushes snow to the side, instead of packing the snow between the points and the rail in a more modern design.

Stub switches were more common in the very early days of railways and their tramway predecessors. Now, because of their disadvantages, stub switches are used primarily on narrow-gauge and branch lines.

=== Three-way switch ===
A &quot;three-way switch&quot; is used to split a railroad track into three divergent paths rather than the more usual two. There are two types of three-way switches. In a &quot;symmetrical three-way switch&quot;, the left and right branches diverge at the same place. In an &quot;asymmetrical three-way switch&quot;, the branches diverge in a staggered way using two interlaced turnouts. Both types of three-way switches require three frogs.

The complexity of symmetrical switches usually results in speed restrictions, therefore three-way switches are most often used in stations or depots where space is restricted and low speeds are normal. Symmetrical switches were used quite often on Swiss narrow-gauge railways. Asymmetrical three-way switches are more common, because they do not have speed restrictions compared to standard switches. However, because of their higher maintenance cost due to special parts as well as asymmetric wear, both types of three-way switches are replaced with two standard switches wherever possible.

In areas with very low speeds, like depots, and on railroads that had to be built very cheaply, like logging railroads, three-way switches were sometimes built as stub switches.

=== Plate switch ===
A &quot;plate switch&quot; incorporates the tapered points of a typical switch into a self-contained plate. Each point blade is moved separately by hand. Plate switches are only used for double-flanged wheels, with wheels running through the plates on their flanges, guided by the edges of the plate and the movable blade.

=== Off-railer ===
The off-railer is a system of installing a turnout over and above some plain track, without having to cut or replace that track. It is useful for installing temporary branches on agricultural railways, and sidings for track machines on mainline rails. Special ramps lift the wheels off the normal track, and then the off-railer curves away as required. Decauville has such a system. It is similar to a drawbridge crossing.

=== Interlaced turnout ===

An &quot;interlaced turnout&quot; is a method of splitting a track into three or more divergent paths. It is an arrangement of two standard turnouts, usually one left- and one right-handed, in an &quot;interlaced&quot; fashion. The points of the second turnout are positioned between the points and the frog of the first turnout. In common with other forms of three way turnouts an additional frog is required. Due to the inherent complexity of the arrangement, interlaced turnouts are normally only used in locations where space is exceptionally tight, such as station throats or industrial areas within large cities. Interlaced turnouts can also be found in some yards, where a series of switches branching off to the same side are placed so close together that the points of one switch are placed before the frog of the preceding switch.
=== Wye switch ===
A &quot;wye switch&quot; (&quot;Y points&quot;) has trailing ends which diverge symmetrically and in opposite directions. The name originates from the similarity of their shape to that of the letter Y. Wye switches are usually used where space is at a premium. In North America this is also called an &quot;equilateral switch&quot; or &quot;equilateral turnout&quot;. Common switches are more often associated with mainline speeds, whereas wye switches are generally low-speed yard switches.

One advantage of wye switches is that they can have a coarser frog angle using the same radius of curvature than a common switch. This means that they give rise to a less severe speed restriction than the diverging branch of a common switch, without having to resort to more expensive switches with a moving frog. For this reason they are sometimes used on a main line where it splits into two equally important branches or at the ends of a single track section in an otherwise double track line.

=== Run-off points ===

&quot;Run-off points&quot; are used to protect main lines from stray or runaway cars, or from trains passing signals set at danger. In these cases, vehicles would otherwise roll onto and foul (obstruct) the main line and cause a collision. Depending on the situation in which they are used, run-off points are referred to either as trap points or catch points. Derailers are another device used for the same purpose.

&quot;Catch points&quot; are installed on the running line itself, where the railway climbs at a steep gradient. They are used to prevent runaway vehicles colliding with another train further down the slope. In some cases, catch points lead into a sand drag to safely stop the runaway vehicle, which may be traveling at speed. Catch points are usually held in the &#x27;derail&#x27; position by a spring. They can be set to allow a train to pass safely in the downhill direction using a lever or other mechanism to override the spring for a short time.

Catch points originate from the days of the &#x27;unfitted&#x27; goods (freight) train. As these trains tended to consist of either completely unbraked wagons (relying entirely on the locomotive&#x27;s own brakes), or ones with unlinked, manually applied brakes (necessitating a stop at the top of steep downgrades for the guard to walk along the train and set the brakes on each wagon in turn), they also lacked any mechanism to automatically brake runaway cars. Catch points were therefore required to stop the rear portion of a poorly coupled train that might break away whilst &quot;climbing&quot; a steep grade – although they would also stop vehicles that ran away for any other reason. Now that trains are all &#x27;fitted&#x27; (and broken couplings are far less common), catch points are mostly obsolete.

Similar to catch points, &quot;trap points&quot; are provided at the exit from a siding or where a goods line joins a line that may be used by passenger trains. Unless they have been specifically set to allow traffic to pass onto the main line, the trap points will direct any approaching vehicle away from the main line. This may simply result in the vehicle being derailed, but in some cases a sand drag is used, especially where the vehicle is likely to be a runaway traveling at speed due to a slope.

==== Derailers ====
A &quot;derailer&quot; works by derailing any vehicle passing over it. There are different types of derailers, but in some cases they consist of a single switch point installed in a track. The point can be pulled into a position to derail any equipment that is not supposed to pass through.

=== Dual gauge switches ===
&quot;Dual gauge switches&quot; are used in dual gauge systems. There are various possible scenarios involving the routes that trains on each gauge may take, including the two gauges separating or one gauge being able to choose between diverging paths and the other not. Because of the extra track involved, dual gauge switches have more points and frogs than their single gauge counterparts. This limits speeds even more than usual.

A related formation is the &#x27;swish&#x27; or rail exchange, where (usually) the common rail changes sides. These have no moving parts, the narrower gauge wheels being guided by guard rails as they transition from one rail to another. The wider gauge only encounters continuous rail so is unaffected by the exchange. At dual gauge turntables, a similar arrangement is used to move the narrow-gauge track from one side to a central position.

=== Rack-railway switches ===
Rack-railway switches are as varied as rack-railway technologies. Where use of the rack is optional, as on the Zentralbahn in Switzerland or the West Coast Wilderness Railway in Tasmania, it is common to place turnouts only in relatively flat areas where the rack is not needed. On systems where only the pinion is driven and the conventional rail wheels are idlers, such as the Dolderbahn in Zürich, Štrbské Pleso in Slovakia and the Schynige Platte rack railway, the rack must be continuous through the switch. The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle. The Štrbské Pleso and Schynige Platte Strub rack system instead relies on a complex set of moving points which assemble the rack in the traversed direction and simultaneously clear the crossed direction conventional rails. In some rack systems, such as the Morgan system, where locomotives always have multiple driving pinions, it is possible to simplify turnouts by interrupting the rack rail, so long as the interruption is shorter than the spacing between the drive pinions on the locomotives.

=== Switch diamond ===
Although not strictly speaking a turnout, a &quot;switch diamond&quot; is an active trackwork assembly used where the crossing angle between two tracks is too shallow for totally passive trackwork: the unguided sections of each rail would overlap. These vaguely resemble two standard points assembled very closely toe-to-toe. These would also often utilize swingnose crossings at the outer ends to ensure complete wheel support in the same way as provided on shallow angle turnouts. In North America these are known as &quot;movable-point diamonds&quot;. In the UK, where the angle of divergence is shallower than 1 in 8 (center-line measure) a switched diamond will be found rather than a passive or fixed diamond.

Such switches are usually implemented on the basis of increasing the safe crossing speed. Open blades impose a speed restriction, due to the potential of the crossing impact fracturing the rail as both wheels on each axle hit the crossing gaps almost simultaneously. Switched blades, as shown in the photograph, allow a much higher speed across the gap by providing an essentially continuous piece of rail across the gap on both sides.

The frog end of the switched crossing, despite still having a gap in one rail, is less problematic in this regard. The outer rail is still continuous, the wing rail (the part that turns out, after the frog gap) provides a gradual transition, and the check rail avoids the possibility of points splitting. This can be seen in how, under examination, the wing rail has a wider polished section, showing how the wheel load is transferred across the gap.

=== Single-point switch ===
Single point switches, known as Tongue and Plain Mate switches, are sometimes used on freight railways in slow speed operation in paved areas such as in ports. In the United States, they are regulated by provision 213.135(i) of the Federal Railroad Administration Track Safety Standards.

On streetcar (tram) systems using grooved rails, if the wheels on both sides of the car are connected by a rigid solid axle, only one switchpoint is needed to steer it onto one or the other track. The switchpoint will be on inside rail of the switch&#x27;s curve route. When a streetcar enters the curve route of the switch, the wheel on the inside of the curve (the right side of the car on a right turn) is pulled into the turn, and through the axle, directs the wheel on the outside to also follow the curve. The outside wheel is supported for a short distance by its flange running in the groove.

Some low floor streetcar designs use split axles (a separate half-axle for the wheel on each side of the car). Such streetcars are unsuitable for use with single-point switches as there would be no mechanism to transfer the force from the inner to outer wheels at switches.

A single-point switch is cheaper to build, especially in street trackage, as there is no need to link to a second switchpoint.
=== Rotary switch ===
Rotary switches are sometimes used on cog railways to maintain alignment of the cog with two different tracks. They are used on the Pilatus Cog Railway to allow up-bound and down-bound trains to pass each other on a grade while sharing the remainder of the single track.

A rotary switch rotates about its long axis to present a track connection to a chosen set of tracks. Physically, it flips over (rotates about its long axis 180 degrees) to connect to the chosen set of tracks. Once the rotary switch is secured the train can proceed. Cog alignment is maintained in both positions.
=== Temporary points ===
When a tram track is interrupted during repairs, a set of temporary points may be placed on top of existing track to allow trams to cross to the parallel track. These are known as or in German, in French, and , or in Dutch. They may be welded into place and allow trams to pass at walking pace.

== Expansion joint ==
Expansion joints look like a part of a railroad switch, but have a completely different purpose, namely to compensate for the shrinkage or expansion of the road bed – e.g. typically, a larger steel bridge – due to changes in temperature, to avoid sun kink.

== Turnout speeds ==
Turnout speeds are governed by a number of factors.

As a general rule, the smaller the crossing angle of a turnout, the higher the turnout speed.
In North America, turnouts are rated numerically, which represents the ratio of divergence per length as measured at the frog. A rule of thumb is that the rated speed of a switch (in miles per hour) is twice the numerical rating:
*  15: 
*  20: 

Higher speed turnouts have also been used in the United States:
*  26.5: 
*  32.7: 

In New South Wales standard turnouts of tangential types include:
* 1/7.5
* 1/8.25
** see also NSW 1 in 8.25 crossing
* 1/10.5
* 1/12.0
* 1/15

=== Uganda ===
 1 in 16, for 100 km/h

== Assembly and transport ==
Turnouts are large pieces of rail infrastructure which may be too big, wide, or heavy to transport in one piece. Special wagons can carry the pieces at approximately 45° from vertical, so that they fit within the structure gauge. Once all the pieces have arrived, the turnout is assembled sleeper by sleeper on site. A set of turnouts may be trial assembled beforehand off site, to check that everything fits.

<text>Losing chess is one of the most popular chess variants. The objective of each player is to lose all of their pieces or be stalemated, that is, a misère version. In some variations, a player may also win by checkmating or by being checkmated.

Losing chess was weakly solved in 2016 by Mark Watkins as a win for White, beginning with 1.e3.

==Rules (main variant)==
The rules are the same as those for standard chess, except for the following special rules:
* Capturing is compulsory.
** When more than one capture is available, the capturing player may choose.
* The king has no , being effectively replaced by a mann, and accordingly:
** it may be captured like any other piece; 
** there is no check or checkmate;
*** therefore the king may expose itself to capture;
** there is no castling;
** a pawn may also be promoted to a king.
* Stalemate is a win for the stalemated player (the player with no legal moves). This includes having no remaining pieces on the board.

Draws by repetition, agreement, or the fifty-move rule work as in standard chess. Positions when neither player can win are also draws: for example, when the only pieces remaining are . (This is similar to the dead position rule in standard chess.)

== History ==
The origin of the game is unknown, but believed to significantly predate an early version, named take me, played in the 1870s. Because of the popularity of losing chess, several variations have spawned. The most widely played (main variant) is described in &quot;Popular Chess Variants&quot; by D. B. Pritchard. Losing chess began to gain popularity in the 20th century, which was facilitated by some publications about this variant in the UK, Germany, and Italy.

In September 1998, what was known as the &quot;first International Losing Chess Meeting&quot; was held in Geneva, Switzerland, courtesy of Fabrice Liardet, recognized through a tournament held there as the strongest Losing Chess player in the world at the time. Indeed, there were many international players, including the Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, as well as Switzerland. 

Losing chess gained a new surge in popularity at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries as an online game, thanks to the implementation of this variant on FICS in 1996, which greatly contributed to the popularization of losing chess. International tournaments were held in 1998 and 2001. As of 2022, the IAF hosts annual international tournaments in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The internet chess server Lichess facilitates play of the game, referring to it as &quot;antichess&quot;; after regular chess it is the most popular variant on the site in terms of numbers of games played. Since 2018 the site has hosted an annual &quot;Lichess World Championship&quot; for the variant. Chess.com also added this variant to their server, calling it &quot;giveaway.&quot;

==Analysis==

Because of the forced capture rule, losing chess games often involve long sequences of captures by one player. This means that a minor mistake can doom a game. Such mistakes can be made from the very first move—it is currently known that a Black win can be forced after 13 of White&#x27;s 20 legal opening moves. Some of these openings took months of computer time to solve: they vary greatly in difficulty. 

*The wins against 1.e4, 1.d4, and 1.d3 consist of simple series of forced captures and can be played from memory by most average players.
*The wins against 1.Nc3, 1.Nf3, 1.f4, and 1.h4 are harder to demonstrate, but can be solved by skilled players.
*The next tier of difficulty is formed by 1.b4, 1.c3, 1.f3, and 1.h3, which were solved by computers: they form a significant jump in difficulty from the previous set.
*1.a3 is much more difficult than those.
*1.Na3 is more difficult still.

In the table below, green marks winning first moves for White; red marks losing first moves; and yellow marks moves that are not yet solved.

This main variant of losing chess was weakly solved in October 2016; White is able to force a win beginning with 1.e3. This solution is valid for both FICS and &quot;International&quot; rules on stalemate. Some lines are trivial (1...d6, 1...d5, 1...Na6, and 1...g6 lose in less than 20 moves), others are quite simple (1...Nf6, 1...h6, 1...e5, 1...f5, 1...h5, 1...f6, 1...a6, 1...a5 lose in less than 30 moves, subject to knowledge of the theory), and some are quite complicated (1...Nh6, 1...Nc6, 1...c6, the win in which may require about 60 moves). The most difficult are the following five openings (in order of increasing difficulty): 1.e3 g5 (Wild Boar Defence), 1.e3 e6 (Modern Defence), 1.e3 b5 (Classical Defence), 1.e3 c5 (Polish Defence), and 1.e3 b6 (Liardet Defence).

David Pritchard, the author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot;, wrote that the &quot;complexity and beauty&quot; of losing chess is found in its endgame. He noted that, in contrast to regular chess, losing chess endgames with just two pieces require considerable skill to play correctly, whereas three- or four-piece endgames can exceed human capacity to solve precisely. For example, the following endgames may turn out to be quite complicated: &quot;2 Knights vs Rook&quot;, &quot;3 Kings vs King&quot;, or &quot;Bishop+Knight+King vs King&quot;. In the latter case, in particular, a win may require more than 60 moves, which means that it is sometimes unattainable due to the fifty-move rule.

==Variations==

===Variations regarding stalemate===

Implementations of the main variant can vary in regard to stalemate. &quot;International&quot; rules are as described above, with the stalemated player winning even if that player still has pieces on the board. FICS rules resolve stalemate as a win for the player with the fewer number of pieces remaining; if both have the same number, it is a draw (the piece types are irrelevant). &quot;Joint&quot; FICS/International rules resolves stalemate as a draw unless it is a victory for the same player under both rulesets. The stalemate in the diagram is a win for White under &quot;International&quot; rules, a win for Black under FICS rules, and a draw under &quot;joint&quot; rules.
===Variants in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot;===
Pritchard discusses the following variants of the game in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot;.

Variant 2

Rules are the same as the main rules, except:
Variant 3

Rules are the same as the main rules, except:
* The king has royal powers, and removing the king from check takes precedence over capturing another piece.
* A player wins by reducing his pieces to a bare king, or by checkmating the opponent.
* Stalemate is a draw.

Variant 4

Rules are the same as variant 3, except:
* A player wins by reducing his pieces to a bare king, or by getting checkmated.

<text>In mathematics, the adjective Noetherian is used to describe objects that satisfy an ascending or descending chain condition on certain kinds of subobjects, meaning that certain ascending or descending sequences of subobjects must have finite length. Noetherian objects are named after Emmy Noether, who was the first to study the ascending and descending chain conditions for rings. Specifically:
* Noetherian group, a group that satisfies the ascending chain condition on subgroups.
* Noetherian ring, a ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals.
* Noetherian module, a module that satisfies the ascending chain condition on submodules.
* More generally, an object in a category is said to be Noetherian if there is no infinitely increasing filtration of it by subobjects. A category is Noetherian if every object in it is Noetherian.
* Noetherian relation, a binary relation that satisfies the ascending chain condition on its elements.
* Noetherian topological space, a topological space that satisfies the descending chain condition on closed sets.
* Noetherian induction, also called well-founded induction, a proof method for binary relations that satisfy the descending chain condition.
* Noetherian rewriting system, an abstract rewriting system that has no infinite chains.
* Noetherian scheme, a scheme in algebraic geometry that admits a finite covering by open spectra of Noetherian rings.

<doc id="150170" wikidata="Q787322" url="?curid=150170" title="Trigonometric tables">
<text>In mathematics, tables of trigonometric functions are useful in a number of areas. Before the existence of pocket calculators, trigonometric tables were essential for navigation, science and engineering. The calculation of mathematical tables was an important area of study, which led to the development of the first mechanical computing devices.

Modern computers and pocket calculators now generate trigonometric function values on demand, using special libraries of mathematical code. Often, these libraries use pre-calculated tables internally, and compute the required value by using an appropriate interpolation method. Interpolation of simple look-up tables of trigonometric functions is still used in computer graphics, where only modest accuracy may be required and speed is often paramount.

Another important application of trigonometric tables and generation schemes is for fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, where the same trigonometric function values (called &quot;twiddle factors&quot;) must be evaluated many times in a given transform, especially in the common case where many transforms of the same size are computed. In this case, calling generic library routines every time is unacceptably slow. One option is to call the library routines once, to build up a table of those trigonometric values that will be needed, but this requires significant memory to store the table. The other possibility, since a regular sequence of values is required, is to use a recurrence formula to compute the trigonometric values on the fly. Significant research has been devoted to finding accurate, stable recurrence schemes in order to preserve the accuracy of the FFT (which is very sensitive to trigonometric errors).

A trigonometry table is essentially a reference chart that presents the values of sine, cosine, tangent, and other trigonometric functions for various angles. These angles are usually arranged across the top row of the table, while the different trigonometric functions are labeled in the first column on the left. To locate the value of a specific trigonometric function at a certain angle, you would find the row for the function and follow it across to the column under the desired angle.

== Using a trigonometry table involves a few straightforward steps ==

# Determine the specific angle for which you need to find the trigonometric values.
# Locate this angle along the horizontal axis (top row) of the table.
# Choose the trigonometric function you&#x27;re interested in from the vertical axis (first column).
# Trace across from the function and down from the angle to the point where they intersect on the table; the number at this intersection provides the value of the trigonometric function for that angle.

== On-demand computation ==
Modern computers and calculators use a variety of techniques to provide trigonometric function values on demand for arbitrary angles (Kantabutra, 1996). One common method, especially on higher-end processors with floating-point units, is to combine a polynomial or rational approximation (such as Chebyshev approximation, best uniform approximation, Padé approximation, and typically for higher or variable precisions, Taylor and Laurent series) with range reduction and a table lookup — they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Maintaining precision while performing such interpolation is nontrivial, but methods like Gal&#x27;s accurate tables, Cody and Waite range reduction, and Payne and Hanek radian reduction algorithms can be used for this purpose. On simpler devices that lack a hardware multiplier, there is an algorithm called CORDIC (as well as related techniques) that is more efficient, since it uses only shifts and additions. All of these methods are commonly implemented in hardware for performance reasons.

The particular polynomial used to approximate a trigonometric function is generated ahead of time using some approximation of a minimax approximation algorithm.

For very high precision calculations, when series-expansion convergence becomes too slow, trigonometric functions can be approximated by the arithmetic-geometric mean, which itself approximates the trigonometric function by the (complex) elliptic integral (Brent, 1976).

Trigonometric functions of angles that are rational multiples of 2π are algebraic numbers. The values for &quot;a/b·2π&quot; can be found by applying de Moivre&#x27;s identity for &quot;n = a&quot; to a &quot;bth&quot; root of unity, which is also a root of the polynomial &quot;xb - 1&quot; in the complex plane. For example, the cosine and sine of 2π ⋅ 5/37 are the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the 5th power of the 37th root of unity cos(2π/37) + sin(2π/37)i, which is a root of the degree-37 polynomial &quot;x&quot;37 − 1. For this case, a root-finding algorithm such as Newton&#x27;s method is much simpler than the arithmetic-geometric mean algorithms above while converging at a similar asymptotic rate. The latter algorithms are required for transcendental trigonometric constants, however.

== Half-angle and angle-addition formulas ==

Historically, the earliest method by which trigonometric tables were computed, and probably the most common until the advent of computers, was to repeatedly apply the half-angle and angle-addition trigonometric identities starting from a known value (such as sin(π/2) = 1, cos(π/2) = 0). This method was used by the ancient astronomer Ptolemy, who derived them in the &quot;Almagest&quot;, a treatise on astronomy. In modern form, the identities he derived are stated as follows (with signs determined by the quadrant in which &quot;x&quot; lies):

:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3

:formula_4

These were used to construct Ptolemy&#x27;s table of chords, which was applied to astronomical problems.

Various other permutations on these identities are possible: for example, some early trigonometric tables used not sine and cosine, but sine and versine.

== A quick, but inaccurate, approximation ==

A quick, but inaccurate, algorithm for calculating a table of &quot;N&quot; approximations &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; for sin(2π&quot;n&quot;/&quot;N&quot;) and &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; for cos(2π&quot;n&quot;/&quot;N&quot;) is:

:&quot;s&quot;0 = 0
:&quot;c&quot;0 = 1
:&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; + &quot;d&quot; × &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;
:&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;d&quot; × &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;
for &quot;n&quot; = 0...,&quot;N&quot; − 1, where &quot;d&quot; = 2π/&quot;N&quot;.

This is simply the Euler method for integrating the differential equation:

:formula_5
:formula_6

with initial conditions &quot;s&quot;(0) = 0 and &quot;c&quot;(0) = 1, whose analytical solution is &quot;s&quot; = sin(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;c&quot; = cos(&quot;t&quot;).

Unfortunately, this is not a useful algorithm for generating sine tables because it has a significant error, proportional to 1/&quot;N&quot;.

For example, for &quot;N&quot; = 256 the maximum error in the sine values is ~0.061 (&quot;s&quot;202 = −1.0368 instead of −0.9757). For &quot;N&quot; = 1024, the maximum error in the sine values is ~0.015 (&quot;s&quot;803 = −0.99321 instead of −0.97832), about 4 times smaller. If the sine and cosine values obtained were to be plotted, this algorithm would draw a logarithmic spiral rather than a circle.

== A better, but still imperfect, recurrence formula ==
A simple recurrence formula to generate trigonometric tables is based on Euler&#x27;s formula and the relation:

:formula_7

This leads to the following recurrence to compute trigonometric values &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; as above:

:&quot;c&quot;0 = 1
:&quot;s&quot;0 = 0
:&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;w&quot;&quot;r&quot; &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;
:&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;
for &quot;n&quot; = 0, ..., &quot;N&quot; − 1, where &quot;w&quot;&quot;r&quot; = cos(2π/&quot;N&quot;) and &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; = sin(2π/&quot;N&quot;). These two starting trigonometric values are usually computed using existing library functions (but could also be found e.g. by employing Newton&#x27;s method in the complex plane to solve for the primitive root of &quot;z&quot;&quot;N&quot; − 1).

This method would produce an &quot;exact&quot; table in exact arithmetic, but has errors in finite-precision floating-point arithmetic. In fact, the errors grow as O(ε &quot;N&quot;) (in both the worst and average cases), where ε is the floating-point precision.

A significant improvement is to use the following modification to the above, a trick (due to Singleton) often used to generate trigonometric values for FFT implementations:

:&quot;c&quot;0 = 1
:&quot;s&quot;0 = 0
:&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; − (α &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; + β &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;)
:&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; + (β &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; − α &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;)

where α = 2 sin2(π/&quot;N&quot;) and β = sin(2π/&quot;N&quot;). The errors of this method are much smaller, O(ε √&quot;N&quot;) on average and O(ε &quot;N&quot;) in the worst case, but this is still large enough to substantially degrade the accuracy of FFTs of large sizes.

<doc id="150172" wikidata="Q5440666" url="?curid=150172" title="Federalist Society">
<text>The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies (FedSoc) is an American conservative and libertarian legal organization that advocates for a textualist and originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it has chapters at more than 200 law schools and features student, lawyer, and faculty divisions; the lawyers division comprises more than 70,000 practicing attorneys in ninety cities. Through speaking events, lectures, and other activities, it provides a forum for members of the legal profession, the judiciary, and the legal academy. It is one of the most influential legal organizations in the United States.

The Federalist Society was founded in 1982 by a group of students from Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Chicago Law School with the aim of challenging liberal or left-wing ideology within elite American law schools and universities. The organization&#x27;s stated objectives are &quot;checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning&quot;, and it plays a central role in networking and mentoring young conservative lawyers. It vetted President Donald Trump&#x27;s list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees; in March 2020, 43 out of 51 of Trump&#x27;s appellate court nominees were current or former members of the society.

Of the current nine members of the Supreme Court of the United States, at least five are current or former members of the organization—Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts previously served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter, but denies ever being a member. 

== Founding ==
Founded in 1982 by students at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Chicago Law School, the Federalist Society began as a student organization which sought to challenge liberal ideology in American law schools. The group&#x27;s first activity was a three-day symposium titled &quot;A Symposium on Federalism: Legal and Political Ramifications&quot; held at Yale in April 1982. The symposium, which was attended by 200 people, was organized by Steven G. Calabresi, Lee Liberman Otis, and David M. McIntosh; it included speakers such as Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork, and Theodore Olson.

In 2018, &quot;Politico Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;it is no exaggeration to suggest that it was perhaps the most effective student conference ever—a blueprint, in retrospect, for how to marry youthful enthusiasm with intellectual oomph to achieve far-reaching results.&quot; The society states that it &quot;is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.&quot;

==Background==
The society looks to Federalist Paper Number 78 for an articulation of the virtue of judicial restraint, as written by Alexander Hamilton: &quot;It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature ... The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.&quot;

Its logo is a silhouette of former President and Constitution author James Madison, who co-wrote &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;. Commissioner Paul S. Atkins of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission considered society members &quot;the heirs of James Madison&#x27;s legacy&quot; in a speech he gave in January 2008 to its lawyers chapter in Dallas, Texas. Madison is generally credited as the father of the Constitution and became the fourth President of the United States.

The society&#x27;s name is said to have been based on the eighteenth-century Federalist Party; however, James Madison associated with Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republican Party in opposition to Federalist Party policies borne from a loose interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The society&#x27;s views are more closely associated with the general meaning of Federalism (particularly the New Federalism) and the content of the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; than with the later Federalist Party.

The society&#x27;s initial 1982 conference was funded, at a cost of $25,000, by the Institute for Educational Affairs. Later funding of $5.5 million came from the John M. Olin Foundation. Other early donors included the Scaife Foundation and the Koch family foundations. Donors to the Federalist Society have included Google, Chevron, Charles G. and David H. Koch; the family foundation of Richard Mellon Scaife; and the Mercer family. By 2017, the Federalist Society had $20 million in annual revenue.

The society holds a national lawyers convention each year in Washington, D.C. It is one of the highest profile conservative legal events of the year. Speakers have included former ACLU head Nadine Strossen, business executive and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, former BB&amp;T chairman John Allison, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, U.S. Senator Mike Lee, and White House Counsel under President Barack Obama Neil Eggleston. The Federalist Society invites to its events &quot;capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives.&quot;

The &quot;Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy&quot; is the Federalist Society&#x27;s official journal, and a subscription is provided to members.

The Federalist Society is a client of the public relations firm Creative Response Concepts.

==Methods and influence==

The Federalist Society has 200 student chapters at law schools across the United States as well as lawyers chapters in 90 U.S. cities. The Federalist Society provides its 70,000 members with &quot;intellectual sparring and professional grooming.&quot; David Montgomery, writing in &quot;The Washington Post Magazine&quot;, said that each individual member of the group is &quot;akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.&quot; Montgomery called the Federalist Society &quot;a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a &#x27;political epistemic community&#x27;,&quot; echoing Amanda Hollis-Brusky, who described the Federalist Society as &quot;an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy.&quot; Former Federalist Society executive vice president Leonard Leo has said &quot;he endorses the network theory of the society,&quot; saying, &quot;It&#x27;s less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.&quot;

Steven Teles, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University and the author of &quot;The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law&quot;, wrote that the Federalist Society&#x27;s influence on the judicial selection process may not be the group&#x27;s most important impact. Instead, the &quot;supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network&quot; may be paramount, with judges needing &quot;scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles into new areas. Where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. They require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. Without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, you&#x27;re not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.&quot; According to professor Lawrence Baum, the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush &quot;aimed to nominate conservative judges, and membership in the Federalist Society was a proxy for adherence to conservative ideology.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post Magazine&quot; wrote that the Federalist Society &quot;provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go&quot; and that &quot;Much of the Federalist Society&#x27;s influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level.&quot; The Federalist Society lobbies for no particular policies, it does not sign amicus briefs, and it does not represent clients in cases. Amanda Hollis-Brusky, political science associate professor at Pomona College, and Calvin TerBeek, Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Chicago, dispute that the Federalist Society is non-partisan, pointing to documents written by the Federalist Society to donors in 1984 where the organization states that one of its missions is pushing conservative positions. In rebuttal to Hollis-Brusky and TerBeek, former Solicitor General Ted Olson also wrote in &quot;Politico Magazine&quot; pointing out that in 37 years of its existence never &quot;has the Federalist Society filed a lawsuit or brief in any litigation, and never once during that period has it passed any resolution advocating for or against any legal issue.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;Politico Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;the organization had markedly and undeniably changed the nature of the judiciary.&quot; The Federalist Society has been described as influential during the presidencies of George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.

The American Constitution Society, founded in 2001, was explicitly started as a liberal analogue to the Federalist Society.

In January 2020, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States circulated a proposed advisory opinion that would bar membership in the Federalist Society or the American Constitution Society for members of the judiciary. The proposed opinion would continue to allow membership in the American Bar Association (ABA). The proposed restriction is limited to membership, and judges would still be allowed to participate in events hosted by organizations such as the Federalist Society and the American Constitution Society through speaking engagements, panel discussions, and event attendance. The proposed advisory opinion had a 120-day comment stage ending on May 20, 2020.

The Federalist Society has a Regulatory Transparency Project (RTP), whose goal, according to &quot;National Review&quot;, is to &quot;foster a nationwide conversation about areas where the costs of regulation exceed any benefits.&quot; The RTP includes twelve working groups who analyze government regulations in different policy and legal areas. The project&#x27;s methods include issuing white papers and holding events.

The Federalist Society&#x27;s 2024 annual gala, which took place shortly after Donald Trump&#x27;s election to a second presidential term, featured a conversation between Neil Gorsuch and Stephen Breyer. The two jurists conveyed a joint message that the Supreme Court is a collegial body whose independence must be protected.

== Judicial philosophy ==
According to &quot;The Washington Post Magazine&quot;, &quot;Many individual Federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the Federalist Society. Rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. In that sense, the Federalist Society is a talent network and placement agency as well.&quot;

A 2008 study found that Federalist Society members appointed by Republican administrations to the U.S. Courts of Appeals had more conservative voting records than non-members. Critics say the organization favors judicial activism, in particular on social issues. Many members of the Federalist Society favored overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the Supreme Court ruling that permitted abortion, prior to its overturning in 2022. The organization tends to favor judges who take conservative stances on abortion rights and other social issues. Members of the Federalist Society have presented oral arguments in every single abortion case that has been before the Supreme Court since 1992.

According to the authors of &quot;Building Coalitions, Making Policy: The Politics of the Clinton, Bush, and Obama Presidencies&quot; (2012), &quot;Federalist Society members declaim the notion that they are united around a particular philosophy,&quot; although many members have been associated with textualist or originalist methods of constitutional interpretation. Judicial restraint tends to align with conservative views on abortion and LGBT rights, while &quot;Critics point out that conservatives are typically not so intent on following &#x27;original meaning&#x27; in areas such as affirmative action, executive powers, free speech and federalism.&quot; Liberals have questioned &quot;how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results.&quot; Leonard Leo, former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, &quot;disputes the notion that the Constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results.&quot; He told &quot;The Washington Post Magazine&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re practicing originalism appropriately when you&#x27;re doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results&quot; and that &quot;There are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation...The fact that people may come out differently occasionally—that&#x27;s okay. Half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.&quot; Increasingly, according to the magazine, &quot;A number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. As this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in Supreme Court dissents.&quot;

==Legal activities of members==
Members of the Federalist Society have opposed regulation of private property and private businesses, and have argued that specific regulations must be enacted by legislatures rather than courts or executives that interpret existing statutes and powers.

=== &quot;Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1&quot; ===
Members of the Federalist Society have argued that courts should not take race into account when making decisions. For example, members of the group have argued that civil rights cases involving racially discriminatory policies should not consider race, but rather the individuals involved. Federalist Society members were extensively involved with the &quot;Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1&quot; ruling where the Supreme Court struck down voluntary desegregation plans in several jurisdictions. The authors of &quot;The Federalist Society: How Conservatives Took the Law Back from Liberals&quot; write that &quot;Conservatives believe, however, that it is not appropriate for the government to promote racial balance. The essence of the conservative position is that there is no legal difference between considering race or gender for purposes of exclusion and considering race or gender for purposes of inclusion. They argue that both are harmful and make racial problems worse. On the other hand, many civil rights advocates believe that because our history has been one of the systematic exclusion of racial minorities and women from social, political, and economic institutions and from positions of power and influence, the conservative view leads to the continuation of exclusion and retards society&#x27;s ability to move toward inclusion.&quot;

=== &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; ===
Members of the Federalist Society have forcefully argued against regulations on guns. Members hold that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals to guns, as opposed to being a collective right to arms. At the time of the Federalist Society&#x27;s creation and since the 19th century, the Supreme Court and academics had held a more restrictive view of gun rights. The Federalist Society was influential in shifting legal views on gun rights, culminating in the Supreme Court ruling &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; which struck down gun regulations in the District of Columbia that required guns to be kept &quot;unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock&quot;.

=== &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; ===
The Federalist Society had a significant influence on the &quot;Citizens United&quot; Supreme Court ruling which weakened regulations on campaign finance by finding that the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by nonprofit corporations, for-profit corporations, labor unions, and other associations.

===&quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot;===
The ideas of the Federalist Society were &quot;at the intellectual heart&quot; of &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot;, which challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with members of the group playing a &quot;mostly behind-the-scenes part in NFIB—and in many of the most significant conservative legal victories of the last 30 years.&quot; In her book on the history of the Federalist Society, political scientist Amanda Hollis-Brusky writes that &quot;Federalist Society members had been invested in the litigation efforts against the ACA well before the Act was signed into law—before there was even anything concrete to litigate against.&quot;

Libertarian law professor Randy Barnett attended his first Federalist Society event in 1986 and found the group &quot;open to testing a diversity of ideas&quot;. He became a &quot;leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the Federalist Society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan.&quot; His participation in the legal challenge to the ACA was initiated at the Federalist Society&#x27;s 2009 national convention, well before the ACA&#x27;s passage in 2010. He co-authored a 16-page legal memorandum &quot;that outlined a constitutional case against the health-care measure.&quot; The memorandum &quot;became a source of talking points during congressional debate and laid the framework for subsequent court challenges; Barnett represented one of the plaintiffs.&quot; Barnett said the Federalist Society &quot;involves people, gets them interested, and they oftentimes will do something about that.&quot;

== Role in presidencies ==

=== George W. Bush administration ===
Legal positions in the George W. Bush administration were overwhelmingly staffed with Federalist Society members. Approximately half of Bush&#x27;s nominees for appellate court judgeships were Federalist Society members. The Bush administration was harshly criticized for the decision to nominate Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, with conservative critics arguing that she lacked a consistently conservative track record, did not have Federalist Society &quot;credentials&quot; and for her purported ties to the ABA (which conservatives considered to be liberal). After conservative outcry, Miers withdrew the nomination. The Bush administration went on to nominate Samuel Alito, a Federalist Society member with a consistent conservative track record who was active in Federalist Society circles, to the Supreme Court.

Members of the society helped to encourage Bush&#x27;s decision to terminate a nearly half-century-old practice of giving the ABA confidential early access to judicial nominees, allowing the ABA to rate nominee&#x27;s qualifications for office before the nominations were announced. Since the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the ABA provided the service to presidents of both parties and the nation by vetting the qualifications of those under consideration for lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary before any other group. The society alleged that the bar association showed a liberal bias in its recommendations. Examples given included that while former Supreme Court clerks nominated to the Court of Appeals by Democrats had an average rating of slightly below &quot;well qualified&quot;, similar Republican nominees were rated on average as only &quot;qualified/well qualified.&quot; In addition the bar association gave Ronald Reagan&#x27;s judicial nominees Richard Posner and Frank H. Easterbrook its lowest possible ratings of &quot;qualified/not qualified&quot;, and Judges Posner and Easterbrook have gone on to become the two most highly cited judges in the federal appellate judiciary.

=== Donald Trump administration ===
According to &quot;Politico Magazine&quot;, &quot;Trump is president for a long list of reasons, of course, but near the top of that list is the imprimatur the Federalist Society granted him. He almost certainly couldn&#x27;t have gotten what he wanted without the Federalists. And they almost certainly couldn&#x27;t have gotten what they wanted without him.&quot; During the 2016 presidential campaign, Texas Senator Ted Cruz &quot;accused Trump of not being a true conservative&quot; and warned Republicans that Trump would nominate liberal judges. While consulting with conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation to create a list of nominees, Trump stated: &quot;I&#x27;m going to submit a list of justices, potential justices of the United States Supreme Court, that I will appoint from the list. I won&#x27;t go beyond that list.&quot;

The Federalist Society was influential in the Trump administration, hand-selecting Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and recruiting a slate of conservative judges to fill vacancies throughout the federal judiciary. The society helped to assemble the list of 21 people from which Trump said he would choose a nominee to replace Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Nine of the 21 individuals spoke at the society&#x27;s annual convention in late November 2016, while nearly all of the others were in attendance. Federalist Society members generally chose not to criticize Trump, and &quot;Politico&quot; described the Federalist Society membership as &quot;elite, conservative lawyers who have generally chosen to give Trump a pass on his breaches of long-cherished legal norms and traditions in exchange for the gift of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.&quot; Former Federalist Society executive vice president Leonard Leo said: &quot;What President Trump has done with judicial selection and appointments is probably at the very center of his legacy, and may well be his greatest accomplishments thus far.&quot;

In May 2018, the Federalist Society hosted a phone call entitled &quot;examining the legality of the Mueller Investigation&quot;, where one of the featured speakers argued that Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was unconstitutional.

In January 2021, some members of the Federalist Society, such as Jeremy Rosen, an appellate lawyer in Los Angeles, argued that members who assisted Trump in the spreading of false claims of election fraud during the 2020 U.S. presidential election should be &quot;distanced from the conservative group.&quot; Specific members mentioned for possible removal included John Eastman, chair of the Federalist Society&#x27;s federalism and separation of powers practice group, who made claims about election fraud at a Trump rally on January 6, 2021—the day of the Capitol attack. Others mentioned included Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who voted against the certification of election results.

<doc id="150178" wikidata="Q4413527" url="?curid=150178" title="X86 memory segmentation">
<text>x86 memory segmentation is a term for the kind of memory segmentation characteristic of the Intel x86 computer instruction set architecture. The x86 architecture has supported memory segmentation since the original Intel 8086 (1978), but &quot;x86 memory segmentation&quot; is a plainly descriptive retronym. The introduction of memory segmentation mechanisms in this architecture reflects the legacy of earlier 80xx processors, which initially could only address 16, or later 64 KB of memory (16,384 or 65,536 bytes), and whose instructions and registers were optimised for the latter. Dealing with larger addresses and more memory was thus comparably slower, as that capability was somewhat grafted-on in the Intel 8086. Memory segmentation could keep programs compatible, relocatable in memory, and by confining significant parts of a program&#x27;s operation to 64 KB segments, the program could still run faster.

In 1982, the Intel 80286 added support for virtual memory and memory protection; the original mode was renamed [[real mode]], and the new version was named [[protected mode]]. The x86-64 architecture, introduced in 2003, has largely dropped support for segmentation in 64-bit mode.

In both real and protected modes, the system uses 16-bit &quot;segment registers&quot; to derive the actual memory address. In real mode, the registers CS, DS, SS, and ES point to the currently used program code segment (CS), the current data segment (DS), the current stack segment (SS), and one &quot;extra&quot; segment determined by the programmer (ES). The Intel 80386, introduced in 1985, adds two additional segment registers, FS and GS, with no specific uses defined by the hardware. The way in which the segment registers are used differs between the two modes.

The choice of segment is normally defaulted by the processor according to the function being executed. Instructions are always fetched from the code segment. Any stack push or pop or any data reference referring to the stack uses the stack segment. All other references to data use the data segment. The extra segment is the default destination for string operations (for example MOVS or CMPS). FS and GS have no hardware-assigned uses. The instruction format allows an optional &quot;segment prefix&quot; byte which can be used to override the default segment for selected instructions if desired.

== Real mode ==
In real mode or V86 mode, the fundamental size of a &quot;segment&quot; is 65,536 bytes, with individual bytes being addressed using 16-bit &quot;offsets&quot;.

The 16-bit segment selector in the segment register is interpreted as the most significant 16 bits of a linear 20-bit address, called a segment address, of which the remaining four least significant bits are all zeros. The segment address is always added to a 16-bit offset in the instruction to yield a &quot;linear&quot; address, which is the same as physical address in this mode. For instance, the segmented address 06EFh:1234h (here the suffix &quot;h&quot; means hexadecimal) has a segment selector of 06EFh, representing a segment address of 06EF0h, to which the offset is added, yielding the linear address 06EF0h + 1234h = 08124h.
(The leading zeros of the linear address, segmented addresses, and the segment and offset fields are shown here for clarity. They are usually omitted.)
Because of the way the segment address and offset are added, a single linear address can be mapped to up to 212 = 4096 distinct segment:offset pairs. For example, the linear address 08124h can have the segmented addresses 06EFh:1234h, 0812h:0004h, 0000h:8124h, etc. This could be confusing to programmers accustomed to unique addressing schemes, but it can also be used to advantage, for example when addressing multiple nested data structures.

While real mode segments are &quot;technically&quot; always 64 KB long, the practical effect is only that no segment can be &quot;longer&quot; than 64 KB, rather than that every segment as actually used in a program &quot;must&quot; be treated as 64 KB long – dealing with effectively smaller segments is possible: usable sizes range from 16 through 65,536 bytes, in 16-byte steps. Because there is no protection or privilege limitation in real mode, it is still entirely up to the program to coordinate and keep within the bounds of any segments. This is true both when a segment is programmatically treated as smaller than, or the full 64 KB, but it is also true that any program can always access any memory by just changing segments, since it can arbitrarily set segment selectors to change segment addresses with absolutely no supervision. Therefore, while real mode can be thought of as allowing different segment lengths, and as allowing segments to be overlapping or non-overlapping as desired, none of this is restrictively enforced by the CPU.

The effective 20-bit address space of PC/XT-generation CPUs limits the addressable memory to 220 bytes, or 1,048,576 bytes (1 MB). This derived directly from the hardware design of the Intel 8086 (and, subsequently, the closely related 8088), which had exactly 20 address pins. (Both were packaged in 40-pin DIP packages; even with only 20 address lines, the address and data buses were multiplexed to fit all the address and data lines within the limited pin count.)

Each segment begins at a multiple of 16 bytes, called a &quot;paragraph&quot;, from the beginning of the linear (flat) address space. That is, at 16 byte intervals. Since all segments are technically 64 KB long, this explains how overlap can occur between segments and why any location in the linear memory address space can be accessed with many segment:offset pairs. The actual location of the beginning of a segment in the linear address space can be calculated with segment×16. A segment value of 0Ch (12) would give a linear address at C0h (192) in the linear address space. The address offset can then be added to this number. 0Ch:0Fh (12:15) would be C0h+0Fh=CFh (192+15=207), CFh (207) being the linear address. Such address translations are carried out by the segmentation unit of the CPU. The last segment, FFFFh (65535), begins at linear address FFFF0h (1048560), 16 bytes before the end of the 20 bit address space, and thus, can access, with an offset of up to 65,536 bytes, up to 65,520 (65536−16) bytes past the end of the 20 bit 8088 address space. On the 8088, these address accesses were wrapped around to the beginning of the address space such that 65535:16 would access address 0 and 65533:1000 would access address 952 of the linear address space. The use of this feature by programmers led to the Gate A20 compatibility issues in later CPU generations, Intel 286 and above, where the linear address space was expanded past 20 bits.

In 16-bit real mode, enabling applications to make use of multiple memory segments (in order to access more memory than available in any one 64K-segment) is quite complex, but was viewed as a necessary evil for all but the smallest tools (which could do with less memory). The root of the problem is that no appropriate address-arithmetic instructions suitable for flat addressing of the entire memory range are available. Flat addressing is possible by applying multiple instructions, which however leads to slower programs.

The &quot;memory model&quot; concept derives from the setup of the segment registers. For example, in the &quot;tiny model&quot; CS=DS=SS, that is the program&#x27;s code, data, and stack are all contained within a single 64 KB segment. In the &quot;small&quot; memory model DS=SS, so both data and stack reside in the same segment; CS points to a different code segment of up to 64 KB.

== Protected mode ==


=== 80286 protected mode ===
The 80286&#x27;s protected mode extends the processor&#x27;s address space to 224 bytes (16 megabytes), but not by adjusting the shift value. Instead, the 16-bit segment registers now contain an index into a table of segment descriptors containing 24-bit base addresses to which the offset is added. To support old software, the processor starts up in &quot;real mode&quot;, a mode in which it uses the segmented addressing model of the 8086. There is a small difference though: the resulting physical address is no longer truncated to 20 bits, so real mode pointers (but not 8086 pointers) can now refer to addresses between 10000016 and 10FFEF16. This roughly 64-kilobyte region of memory was known as the High Memory Area (HMA), and later versions of DOS could use it to increase the available &quot;conventional&quot; memory (i.e. within the first MB). With the addition of the HMA, the total address space is approximately 1.06 MB. Though the 80286 does not truncate real-mode addresses to 20 bits, a system containing an 80286 can do so with hardware external to the processor, by gating off the 21st address line, the A20 line. The IBM PC AT provided the hardware to do this (for full backward compatibility with software for the original IBM PC and PC/XT models), and so all subsequent &quot;AT-class&quot; PC clones did as well.

286 protected mode was seldom used as it would have excluded the large body of users with 8086/88 machines. Moreover, it still necessitated dividing memory into 64k segments like was done in real mode. This limitation can be worked around on 32-bit CPUs which permit the use of memory pointers greater than 64k in size, however as the Segment Limit field is only 24-bit long, the maximum segment size that can be created is 16MB (although paging can be used to allocate more memory, no individual segment may exceed 16MB). This method was commonly used on Windows 3.x applications to produce a flat memory space, although as the OS itself was still 16-bit, API calls could not be made with 32-bit instructions. Thus, it was still necessary to place all code that performs API calls in 64k segments.

Once 286 protected mode is invoked, it could not normally be exited except by performing a hardware reset. Machines following the rising IBM PC/AT standard could feign a reset to the CPU via the standardised keyboard controller, but this was significantly sluggish. Windows 3.x worked around both of these problems by intentionally triggering a triple fault in the interrupt-handling mechanisms of the CPU, which would cause the CPU to drop back into real mode, nearly instantly.

=== Detailed segmentation unit workflow ===
A logical address consists of a 16-bit segment selector (supplying 13+1 address bits) and a 16-bit offset. The segment selector must be located in one of the segment registers. That selector consists of a 2-bit Requested Privilege Level (RPL), a 1-bit Table Indicator (TI), and a 13-bit index.

When attempting address translation of a given logical address, the processor reads the 64-bit segment descriptor structure from either the Global Descriptor Table when TI=0 or the Local Descriptor Table when TI=1. It then performs the privilege check:
: max(CPL, RPL) ≤ DPL
where CPL is the current privilege level (found in the lower 2 bits of the CS register), RPL is the requested privilege level from the segment selector, and DPL is the descriptor privilege level of the segment (found in the descriptor). All privilege levels are integers in the range 0–3, where the lowest number corresponds to the highest privilege.

If the inequality is false, the processor generates a general protection (GP) fault. Otherwise, address translation continues. The processor then takes the 16-bit offset and compares it against the segment limit specified in the segment descriptor. If it is larger, a GP fault is generated. Otherwise, the processor adds the 24-bit segment base, specified in descriptor, to the offset, creating a linear physical address.

The privilege check is done only when the segment register is loaded, because segment descriptors are cached in hidden parts of the segment registers.

=== 80386 protected mode ===
In the Intel 80386 and later, protected mode retains the segmentation mechanism of 80286 protected mode, but a paging unit has been added as a second layer of address translation between the segmentation unit and the physical bus. Also, importantly, address offsets are 32-bit (instead of 16-bit), and the segment base in each segment descriptor is also 32-bit (instead of 24-bit). The general operation of the segmentation unit is otherwise unchanged. The paging unit may be enabled or disabled; if disabled, operation is the same as on the 80286. If the paging unit is enabled, addresses in a segment are now virtual addresses, rather than physical addresses as they were on the 80286. That is, the segment starting address, the offset, and the final 32-bit address the segmentation unit derived by adding the two are all virtual (or logical) addresses when the paging unit is enabled. When the segmentation unit generates and validates these 32-bit virtual addresses, the enabled paging unit finally translates these virtual addresses into physical addresses. The physical addresses are 32-bit on the 386, but can be larger on newer processors which support Physical Address Extension.

The 80386 also introduced two new general-purpose data segment registers, FS and GS, to the original set of four segment registers (CS, DS, ES, and SS).

A 386 CPU can be put back into real mode by clearing a bit in the CR0 control register, however this is a privileged operation in order to enforce security and robustness. By way of comparison, a 286 could only be returned to real mode by forcing a processor reset, e.g. by a triple fault or using external hardware.

== Later developments ==
The x86-64 architecture does not use segmentation in long mode (64-bit mode). Four of the segment registers, CS, SS, DS, and ES, are forced to base address 0, and the limit to 264. The segment registers FS and GS can still have a nonzero base address. This allows operating systems to use these segments for special purposes. Unlike the global descriptor table mechanism used by legacy modes, the base address of these segments is stored in a model-specific register. The x86-64 architecture further provides the special &quot;SWAPGS&quot; instruction, which allows swapping the kernel mode and user mode base addresses.

For instance, Microsoft Windows on x86-64 uses the GS segment to point to the Thread Environment Block, a small data structure for each thread, which contains information about exception handling, thread-local variables, and other per-thread state. Similarly, the Linux kernel uses the GS segment to store per-CPU data.

GS/FS are also used in gcc&#x27;s thread-local storage and canary-based stack protector.

== Practices ==
Logical addresses can be explicitly specified in x86 assembly language, e.g. (AT&amp;T syntax):
 movl $42, %fs:(%eax) ; Equivalent to M[fs:eax]&lt;-42) in RTL

or in Intel syntax:

mov dword [fs:eax], 42
However, segment registers are usually used implicitly.

* All CPU instructions are implicitly fetched from the &quot;code segment&quot; specified by the segment selector held in the CS register.
* Most memory references come from the &quot;data segment&quot; specified by the segment selector held in the DS register. These may also come from the extra segment specified by the segment selector held in the ES register, if a segment-override prefix precedes the instruction that makes the memory reference. Most, but not all, instructions that use DS by default will accept an ES override prefix.
* Processor stack references, either implicitly (e.g. push and pop instructions) or explicitly (memory accesses using the (E)SP or (E)BP registers) use the &quot;stack segment&quot; specified by the segment selector held in the SS register.
* String instructions (e.g. stos, movs), along with data segment, also use the &quot;extra segment&quot; specified by the segment selector held in the ES register.

Segmentation cannot be turned off on x86-32 processors (this is true for 64-bit mode as well, but beyond the scope of discussion), so many 32-bit operating systems simulate a flat memory model by setting all segments&#x27; bases to 0 in order to make segmentation neutral to programs. For instance, the Linux kernel sets up only 4 general purpose segments:

Since the base is set to 0 in all cases and the limit 4 GiB, the segmentation unit does not affect the addresses the program issues before they arrive at the paging unit. (This, of course, refers to 80386 and later processors, as the earlier x86 processors do not have a paging unit.)

Current Linux also uses GS to point to thread-local storage.

Segments can be defined to be either code, data, or system segments. Additional permission bits are present to make segments read only, read/write, execute, etc.

In protected mode, code may always modify all segment registers &quot;except&quot; CS (the code segment selector). This is because the current privilege level (CPL) of the processor is stored in the lower 2 bits of the CS register. The only ways to raise the processor privilege level (and reload CS) are through the lcall (far call) and int (interrupt) instructions. Similarly, the only ways to lower the privilege level (and reload CS) are through lret (far return) and iret (interrupt return) instructions. In real mode, code may also modify the CS register by making a far jump (or using an undocumented codice_1 instruction on the 8086 or 8088). Of course, in real mode, there are no privilege levels; all programs have absolute unchecked access to all of memory and all CPU instructions.

<doc id="150179" wikidata="Q192824" url="?curid=150179" title="IATA airport code">
<text>An IATA airport code, also known as an IATA location identifier, IATA station code, or simply a [[location identifier]], is a three-letter geocode designating many airports and metropolitan areas around the world, defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The characters prominently displayed on baggage tags attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used.

The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by the IATA&#x27;s headquarters in Montreal, Canada. The codes are published semi-annually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory.

IATA provides codes for airport handling entities, and for certain railway stations.

Alphabetical lists of airports sorted by IATA code are available. A list of railway station codes, shared in agreements between airlines and rail lines such as Amtrak, SNCF, and , is available. However, many railway administrations have their own list of codes for their stations, such as the list of Amtrak station codes.

==History==
Airport codes arose out of the convenience that the practice brought pilots for location identification in the 1930s. Initially, pilots in the United States used the two-letter code from the National Weather Service (NWS) for identifying cities. This system became unmanageable for cities and towns without an NWS identifier, and the use of two letters allowed only a few hundred combinations; a three-letter system of airport codes was implemented. This system allowed for 17,576 permutations, assuming all letters can be used in conjunction with each other.

==Naming conventions==

===National policies===

====United States====
Since the U.S. Navy reserved &quot;N&quot; codes, and to prevent confusion with Federal Communications Commission broadcast call signs, which begin with &quot;W&quot; or &quot;K&quot;, the airports of certain U.S. cities whose name begins with one of these letters had to adopt &quot;irregular&quot; airport codes:
* EWR for Newark, New Jersey
* HVN for New Haven, Connecticut
* ORF for Norfolk, Virginia
* EYW for Key West, Florida
* OME for Nome, Alaska
* BNA for Nashville, Tennessee (whose airport&#x27;s original name was &quot;Berry Field&quot;)
* APC for Napa, California.
* ILM for Wilmington, North Carolina

This practice is not followed outside the United States:
* Karachi is KHI
* Warsaw is WAW
* Nagoya is NGO

In addition, since three letter codes starting with Q are widely used in radio communication, cities whose name begins with &quot;Q&quot; also had to find alternate codes, as in the case of:
* Qiqihar (NDG)
* Quetta (UET)
* Quito (UIO)
* Quimper (UIP)

IATA codes should not be confused with the FAA identifiers of U.S. airports. Most FAA identifiers agree with the corresponding IATA codes, but some do not, such as Saipan, whose FAA identifier is GSN and its IATA code is SPN, and some coincide with IATA codes of non-U.S. airports.

====Canada====

Canada&#x27;s unusual codes—which bear little to no similarity with any conventional abbreviation to the city&#x27;s name—such as YUL in Montréal, and YYZ in Toronto, originated from the two-letter codes used to identify weather reporting stations in the 1930s. The letters preceding the two-letter code follow the following format:
* &quot;Y&quot; – Indicating &quot;yes&quot;, this letter was used when the station shared its location with an airport.
* &quot;W&quot; – When the weather-reporting station shared its location with no airport, this letter hinted at &quot;Without&quot;.
* &quot;U&quot; – This letter was used when the station was located together with a non-directional beacon (NDB).
* &quot;X&quot; – Suggesting that the last two letters of a code were in use by a Canadian airport, this letter was put in place.
* &quot;Z&quot; – This letter indicated that an airport code had been used for the identification of an airport in the U.S.

Most large airports in Canada have codes that begin with the letter &quot;Y&quot;, although not all &quot;Y&quot; codes are Canadian (for example, YUM for Yuma, Arizona, and YNT for Yantai, China), and not all Canadian airports start with the letter &quot;Y&quot; (for example, ZBF for Bathurst, New Brunswick). Many Canadian airports have a code that starts with W, X or Z, but none of these are major airports. When the Canadian transcontinental railroads were built, each station was assigned its own two-letter Morse code:
* VR for Vancouver
* TZ for Toronto
* QB for Quebec City
* WG for Winnipeg
* SJ for Saint John
* YC for Calgary
* OW for Ottawa
* EG for Edmonton

When the Canadian government established airports, it used the existing railway codes for them as well. If the airport had a weather station, authorities added a &quot;Y&quot; to the front of the code, meaning &quot;Yes&quot; to indicate it had a weather station or some other letter to indicate it did not. When international codes were created in cooperation with the United States, because &quot;Y&quot; was seldom used in the United States, Canada simply used the weather station codes for its airports, changing the &quot;Y&quot; to a &quot;Z&quot; if it conflicted with an airport code already in use. The result is that most major Canadian airport codes start with &quot;Y&quot; followed by two letters in the city&#x27;s name (for example, YOW for Ottawa, YWG for Winnipeg, YYC for Calgary, or YVR for Vancouver), whereas other Canadian airports append the two-letter code of the radio beacons that were the closest to the actual airport, such as YQX in Gander or YXS in Prince George.

Four of the ten provincial capital airports in Canada have ended up with codes beginning with YY, including:
* YYZ for Toronto, Ontario
* YYJ for Victoria, British Columbia
* YYT for St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador
* YYG for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island

Canada&#x27;s largest airport is YYZ for Toronto Pearson (as YTZ was already allocated to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, the airport was given the station code of Malton, Mississauga, where it is located). YUL is used for Montréal–Trudeau (UL was the ID code for the beacon in the city of Kirkland. While these codes make it difficult for the public to associate them with a particular Canadian city, some codes have become popular in usage despite their cryptic nature, particularly at the largest airports. Toronto&#x27;s code has entered pop culture in the form of &quot;YYZ&quot;, a song by the rock band Rush, which utilizes the Morse code signal as a musical motif. Some airports have started using their IATA codes as brand names, such as Calgary International Airport (YYC) and Vancouver International Airport (YVR).

====New Zealand====
Numerous New Zealand airports use codes that contain the letter Z, to distinguish them from similar airport names in other countries. Examples include 
HLZ for Hamilton, 
ZQN for Queenstown, 
and WSZ for Westport.

===Naming conventions in general===
Predominantly, airport codes are named after the first three letters of the city in which it is located, for instance:
* AMS for Amsterdam
* ATL for Atlanta
* CLE for Cleveland
* DEL for Delhi
* IND for Indianapolis
* SAN for San Diego
* BER for Berlin
* GLA for Glasgow
* MEX for Mexico City
* DEN for Denver
* IST for Istanbul
* SIN for Singapore
* HAN for Hanoi
* AUS for Austin
The code may also be a combination of the letters in its name, such as:
* ALA for Almaty (formerly known as Alma-Ata)
* BLR for Bengaluru
* ORK for Cork
* EWR for Newark
* GDL for Guadalajara
* JNB for Johannesburg
* HKG for Hong Kong
* SLC for Salt Lake City
* WAW for Warsaw
* PQC for Phu Quoc
* SGN for Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known as Sai Gon)

Sometimes the airport code reflects pronunciation, rather than spelling, namely:
* NAN, which reflects the pronunciation of &quot;Nadi&quot; as in Fijian, where &quot;d&quot; is realized as the prenasalized stop 

For many reasons, some airport codes do not fit the normal scheme described above. Some airports, for example, cross several municipalities or regions, and therefore, use codes derived from some of their letters, resulting in:
* DFW for Dallas/Fort Worth
* DTW for Detroit–Wayne County
* LBA for Leeds–Bradford (Airport)
* MSP for Minneapolis–Saint Paul
* RDU for Raleigh–Durham

Other airports—particularly those serving cities with multiple airports—have codes derived from the name of the airport itself, for instance:
* JFK for New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy
* LHR for London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport
* CDG for Paris&#x27;s Charles de Gaulle (see below)

This is also true with some cities with a single airport (even if there is more than one airport in the metropolitan area of said city), such as BDL for Hartford, Connecticut&#x27;s Bradley International Airport or Baltimore&#x27;s BWI, for Baltimore/Washington International Airport; however, the latter also serves Washington, D.C., alongside Dulles International Airport (IAD, for International Airport Dulles) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA, for District of Columbia Airport).

The code also sometimes comes from the airport&#x27;s former name, such as Orlando International Airport&#x27;s MCO (for McCoy Air Force Base), or Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport, which is coded ORD for its original name: Orchard Field. In rare cases, the code comes from the airport&#x27;s unofficial name, such as Kahului Airport&#x27;s OGG (for local aviation pioneer Jimmy Hogg).

====Cities with multiple commercial airports====
In large metropolitan areas, airport codes are often named after the airport itself instead of the city it serves, while another code is reserved which refers to the city itself which can be used to search for flights to any of its airports. For instance:
* Beijing (BJS) – Capital (PEK) and Daxing (PKX)

When different cities with the same name each have an airport, they need to be assigned different codes. Examples include:
* Juan Santamaría International Airport (SJO) is in Alajuela, serving the capital San José de Costa Rica. While Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC) is in San Jose, California, the United States.
* Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM) is in Birmingham, Alabama, the United States and Birmingham Airport (BHX) is in Birmingham, England, United Kingdom.
* Portland International Jetport (PWM) is in Portland, Maine, while Portland International Airport (PDX) is in Portland, Oregon.
* Manchester Airport (MAN) is in Manchester, England, United Kingdom, while Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (MHT) is in Manchester, New Hampshire, United States.
* Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (SCL) is in Santiago, Chile; while Antonio Maceo Airport (SCU) is in Santiago, Cuba; Santiago–Rosalía de Castro Airport (SCQ) is in Santiago de Compostela, Spain; and Cibao International Airport (STI) serves Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic.

Sometimes, a new airport is built, replacing the old one, leaving the city&#x27;s new &quot;major&quot; airport (or the only remaining airport) code to no longer correspond with the city&#x27;s name. The original airport in Nashville, Tennessee, was built in 1936 as part of the Works Progress Administration and called Berry Field with the designation, BNA. A new facility known as Nashville International Airport was built in 1987 but still uses BNA. This is in conjunction to rules aimed to avoid confusion that seem to apply in the United States, which state that &quot;the first and second letters or second and third letters of an identifier may not be duplicated with less than 200 nautical miles separation.&quot; Thus, Washington, D.C. area&#x27;s three airports all have radically different codes: IAD for Washington–Dulles, DCA for Washington–Reagan (District of Columbia Airport), and BWI for Baltimore (Baltimore–Washington International, formerly BAL). Since HOU is used for William P. Hobby Airport, the new Houston–Intercontinental became IAH. The code BKK was originally assigned to Bangkok–Don Mueang and was later transferred to Suvarnabhumi Airport, while the former adopted DMK. The code ISK was originally assigned to Gandhinagar Airport (Nashik&#x27;s old airport) and later on transferred to Ozar Airport (Nashik&#x27;s current airport). Shanghai–Hongqiao retained the code SHA, while the newer Shanghai–Pudong adopted PVG. The opposite was true for Berlin: the airport Berlin–Tegel used the code TXL, while its smaller counterpart Berlin–Schönefeld used SXF; the Berlin Brandenburg Airport has the airport code BER, which is also part of its branding. The airports of Hamburg (HAM) and Hannover (HAJ) are less than apart and therefore share the same first and middle letters, indicating that this rule might be followed only in Germany.

====Cities or airports changing names====

* In Ukraine: IEV for Kyiv (formerly Kiev), VSG for Luhansk (formerly Voroshilovgrad), KGO for Kropyvnytskyi (formerly Kirovograd), LWO for Lviv (formerly Lwów while part of Poland until 1939, and still called Lvov in Russian), and IFO for Ivano-Frankivsk (in Soviet times spelt in Russian as Ivano-Frankovsk);
* In Vietnam: SGN for Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon)
* In Western Sahara: VIL for Dakhla (formerly Villa Cisneros)

Some airport codes are based on previous names associated with a present airport, often with a military heritage. These include:
* Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare, which is assigned ORD based on its old name of Orchard Field. It was expanded and renamed O&#x27;Hare in the mid-1950s.
* Rickenbacker International Airport uses LCK, for its former name of Lockbourne Air Force Base.
*Travis Air Force Base uses SUU, for its former name of Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Base.
* North Texas Regional Airport uses PNX, for its former name of Perrin Air Force Station.
* Fresno Yosemite International Airport uses the code FAT, derived from a previous name of the airport, Fresno Air Terminal.
* Orlando International Airport was founded as Orlando Army Air Field #2 but uses MCO for having been renamed McCoy Air Force Base in 1959 in honor of a wing commander who crashed at the field in 1958. It was converted in the early 1960s to joint civilian/military use and renamed Orlando Jetport at McCoy, then renamed Orlando International Airport in the early 1980s.
* Spokane International Airport was so named in 1960 but goes by GEG because it was built on the former Geiger Field, renamed in 1941 for Major Harold Geiger when the US Army acquired it.
* Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was originally named Moisant Field after daredevil aviator John Moisant, who died in 1910 in an airplane crash on agricultural land where the airport is now located. Its IATA code MSY was derived from Moisant Stock Yards, as Lakefront Airport retained the code NEW.
* Lehigh Valley International Airport uses ABE, for its former name of Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton International Airport.
* William R. Fairchild International Airport uses CLM, for its former name of Clallam County Municipal Landing Field.
* Chicago Executive Airport uses PWK, for its former name, Palwaukee Municipal Airport (which was derived from its location on Palatine Road and Milwaukee Avenue).
* Dallas Executive Airport used RBD, for its former name, Redbird Airport.
* TSTC Waco Airport uses CNW, as it was formerly Connally Air Force Base.
* Glacier Park International Airport uses FCA, for its former name Flathead County Airport.

Some airports are named for an administrative division or nearby city, rather than the one they are located in:
* Juan Santamaría International Airport is located in Alajuela province, but since it is so close to the capital city of San José, Costa Rica, the airport serves the whole Central Valley using SJO.
* Grand Strand Airport uses CRE for the former municipality of Crescent Beach, South Carolina.
* San Ignacio Town Airstrip, located in San Ignacio, Belize, uses CYD because it is located in the Cayo District.
* Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Crystal City, Virginia uses DCA for the District of Columbia (DC) and Arlington.
* Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz International Airport in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia uses ELQ for the Al-Qassim Province (El Qassim)
* Damazin Airport in Sudan uses RSS, for the nearby Roseires Dam.

Other airport codes are of obscure origin, and each has its own peculiarities:
* Nashville uses BNA for its former name as Berry Field, henceforth Berry Nashville Airport.
* Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport is SDF for Standiford Field, its original name (Elisha David Standiford who, as a businessman and legislator, played an important role in Louisville transportation history and owned part of the land on which the airport was built.)
* Knoxville uses TYS for Charles McGhee Tyson, whose family donated the land for the first airport in Knoxville
* Kahului, the main gateway into Maui, uses OGG in homage to Hawaiian aviation pioneer Bertram J. Hogg
* Gold Coast, Australia, uses OOL due to its former name as Coolangatta Airport, named after the suburb in which it is located
* Sunshine Coast, Australia, uses MCY due to its former names Maroochydore Airport and Maroochydore-Sunshine Coast Airport. It is actually located in Marcoola rather than Maroochydore.
* Buli Airport uses PGQ, for its location in the Pekaulang administrative division.
* New River Valley Airport uses PSK for its location in Pulaski County, Virginia.
* Río Amazonas Airport uses PTZ for its location in Pastaza Province.
* Brackett Field uses POC, as it was named after a flying enthusiast and faculty member of nearby Pomona College.
* Yan&#x27;an Nanniwan Airport inherited the ENY code from the city of Yan&#x27;an&#x27;s old airport, Yan&#x27;an Ershilipu Airport.
* Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport uses the code ECP, which when proposed was thought it could stand for &quot;Everyone Can Party&quot;

In Asia, codes that do not correspond with their city&#x27;s names include Niigata&#x27;s KIJ, Nanchang&#x27;s KHN and Pyongyang&#x27;s FNJ.

====Multiple codes for a single airport====
EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg, which serves three countries, has three airport codes: BSL, MLH, EAP.

* The French part of the airport is assigned MLH, for Mulhouse, France
* The Swiss part of the airport is assigned BSL, for Basel, Switzerland
* The Airport has a neutral code, EAP, for EuroAirport.

====Airport codes using the English name of the city====
Some cities have a name in their respective language which is different from the name in English, yet the airport code represents &quot;only&quot; the English name. Examples include:
* AMD – Ahmedabad, India ()
* BKK – Bangkok, Thailand ()
* CAI – Cairo, Egypt ()
* CGN – Cologne, Germany ()
* CPH – Copenhagen, Denmark ()
* DEL – Delhi, India ()
* DUB – Dublin, Ireland ()
* FLR – Florence, Italy ()
* GVA – Geneva, Switzerland ()
* HAV – Havana, Cuba ()
* LKO – Lucknow, India ()
* PRG – Prague, Czechia ()
* VCE – Venice, Italy ()
* VIE – Vienna, Austria ()

====Scarcity of codes====
Due to scarcity of codes, some airports are given codes with letters not found in their names:
*ACI for Alderney, UK
*BGO for Bergen, Norway
*DAD for Da Nang, Vietnam
*FNJ for Pyongyang, North Korea
*CMH for Columbus, Ohio, US

;Use of &#x27;X&#x27; as a filler
The use of &#x27;X&#x27; as a filler letter is a practice to create three-letter identifiers when more straightforward options were unavailable:

*XWA for Williston, North Dakota, USA 
* MMX for Malmö, Sweden
* MXX for Mora–Siljan Airport, Sweden
* DXB for Dubai, United Arab Emirates (e.g. DUB was already allocated to Dublin Airport in Ireland)
* MXP for Milan Malpensa, Italy
* GRX for Granada International Airport, Spain (e.g. GRA was already allocated to Gamarra Airport in Colombia)
* XGG for Gorom Gorom Airport, Burkina Faso
* BHX for Birmingham Airport, United Kingdom (e.g. BHM was already allocated to Birmingham–Shuttlesworth Airport in the United States)

Some airports in the United States retained their NWS (National Weather Service) codes and simply appended an X at the end. Examples include:
* LAX for Los Angeles
* PDX for Portland
* PHX for Phoenix (Note: the X does not originate from the x at the end of Phoenix but is the result of appending an X at the end of the NWS code.)

====Airports without codes====
A lot of minor airfields without scheduled passenger traffic have ICAO codes but not IATA codes, since the four letter codes allow more number of codes, and IATA codes are mainly used for passenger services such as tickets, and ICAO codes by pilots. In the US, such airfields use FAA codes instead of ICAO.

There are airports with scheduled service for which there are ICAO codes but not IATA codes, such as Nkhotakota Airport/Tangole Airport in Malawi or Chōfu Airport in Tokyo, Japan. There are also several minor airports in Russia (e.g., Omsukchan Airport) which lack IATA codes and instead use internal Russian codes for booking. Flights to these airports cannot be booked through the international air booking systems or have international luggage transferred there, and thus, they are booked instead through the airline or a domestic booking system. Several heliports in Greenland have 3-letter codes used internally which might be IATA codes for airports in faraway countries.

There are several airports with scheduled service that have not been assigned ICAO codes that do have IATA codes, especially in the U.S. For example, several airports in Alaska have scheduled commercial service, such as Stebbins and Nanwalek, which use FAA codes instead of ICAO codes.

Thus, neither system completely includes all airports with scheduled service.

====Use in colloquial speech====
Some airports are identified in colloquial speech by their IATA code. Examples include LAX, PDX and CCU.

<doc id="150183" wikidata="Q313404" url="?curid=150183" title="Eschede train disaster">
<text>On 3 June 1998, part of an ICE 1 train on the Hannover–Hamburg railway near Eschede in Lower Saxony, Germany derailed and crashed into an overpass that crossed the railroad, which then collapsed onto the train. 101 people were killed and at least 88 were injured, making it the second-deadliest railway disaster in German history after the 1939 Genthin rail disaster, and the world&#x27;s worst ever high-speed rail disaster.

The cause of the derailment was a single fatigue crack in one wheel, which caused a part of the wheel to become caught in a railroad switch (points), changing the direction of the switch as the train passed over it. This led to the train&#x27;s carriages going down two separate tracks, causing the train to derail and crash into the pillars of a concrete road bridge, which then collapsed and crushed two coaches. The remaining coaches and the rear power car crashed into the wreckage.

After the incident, many investigations into the wheel fracture took place. Analysis concluded that the accident was caused by poor wheel design which allowed a fatigue fracture to develop on the wheel rim.
Investigators also considered other contributing factors, including the failure to stop the train, and maintenance procedures.

The disaster had legal and technical consequences including trials, fines and compensation payments. The wheel design was modified and train windows were made easier to break in an emergency.
A memorial place was opened at the place of the disaster.

== Background ==

The InterCity Express 1, abbreviated as ICE 1, is the first German high-speed train and was introduced in 1988.

==Timeline==
===Wheel fracture===
ICE 1 trainset 51 was travelling as ICE 884 &quot;Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen&quot; from Munich to Hamburg. The train was scheduled to stop at Augsburg, Nürnberg, Würzburg, Fulda, Kassel, Göttingen, and Hanover before reaching Hamburg. After stopping in Hanover at 10:30, the train continued its journey northwards. About and forty minutes away from Hamburg and south of central Eschede, near Celle, the steel tyre on a wheel on the third axle of the first car split and peeled away from the wheel, having been weakened by metal fatigue. The momentum of this caused the steel tyre to flatten and it was catapulted upwards, penetrating the floor of the train carriage where it remained stuck.

The tyre embedded in the carriage was seen by Jörg Dittmann, one of the passengers in Coach 1. The tyre went through an armrest in his compartment between the seats where his wife and son were sitting. Dittmann took his wife and son out of the damaged coach and went to inform a conductor in the third coach.

The conductor, who noticed vibrations in the train, told Dittmann that company policy required him to investigate the circumstances before pulling the emergency brake. The conductor took one minute to reach the site in Coach 1. According to Dittmann, the train had begun to sway from side to side by then. The conductor did not show willingness to stop the train immediately, and wished to first investigate the incident more thoroughly. Dittmann could not find an emergency brake in the corridor and had not noticed that there was an emergency brake handle in his own compartment. The train crashed just as Dittmann was about to show the armrest puncture to the conductor.

===Derailment===
As the train passed over the first of two points, the embedded tyre slammed against the guide rail of the points, pulling it from the railway ties. This guide rail also penetrated the floor of the car, becoming embedded in the vehicle and lifting the bogie off the rails. At 10:59 local time (08:59 UTC), one of the now-derailed wheels struck the points lever of the second switch, changing its setting. The rear axles of car number 3 were switched onto a parallel track, and the entire car was thereby thrown sideways into the piers supporting a roadway overpass, destroying them.

Car number 4, likewise derailed by the violent deviation of car number 3 and still travelling at , passed intact under the bridge and rolled onto the embankment immediately behind it, striking several trees before coming to a stop. Two Deutsche Bahn railway workers who had been working near the bridge were killed instantly when the derailed car crushed them. The breaking of the car couplings caused the automatic emergency brakes to engage, and the mostly undamaged first three cars came to a stop.

===Bridge collapse===
The front power car and coaches one and two cleared the bridge. The third carriage hit the bridge, causing it to collapse, but cleared the bridge. Coach four cleared the bridge, moved away from the track onto an embankment, and hit a group of trees before stopping. The bridge pieces crushed the rear half of coach five. The restaurant coach, six, was crushed to a height. With the track now obstructed completely by the collapsed bridge, the remaining cars jackknifed into the rubble in a zig-zag pattern: car 7, the service car, the restaurant car, the three first-class cars numbered 10 to 12, and the rear power car all derailed and slammed into the pile. The resulting chaos was likened to a partially collapsed folding ruler. An automobile was also found in the wreckage; it belonged to the two railway technicians killed, and was probably parked on the bridge before the accident.

Separated from the rest of the carriages, the detached front power car coasted for a further three kilometers (two miles) until it came to a stop after passing Eschede railway station.

The crash produced a sound that witnesses later described as &quot;startling&quot;, &quot;horribly loud&quot;, and &quot;like a plane crash&quot;. People living nearby, alerted by the sound, were the first to arrive at the scene; Erika Karl, the first, photographed the site. She said that, upon hearing the noise, her husband initially believed there had been an aircraft accident. After the accident, eight of the ICE carriages occupied an area slightly longer than the length of a single carriage.

At 11:02, the local police declared an emergency. At 11:07, as the magnitude of the disaster quickly became apparent and this was elevated to &quot;major emergency&quot;. At 12:30 the Celle district government declared a &quot;catastrophic emergency&quot; (civil state of emergency). More than 1,000 rescue workers from regional emergency services, fire departments, rescue services, the police and army were dispatched. Some 37 emergency physicians, who happened to be attending a professional conference in nearby Hanover, also provided assistance during the early hours of the rescue effort, as did units of the British Forces Germany.

While the driver and many passengers in the front part of the train survived with minor to moderate injuries, very few passengers survived in the rear carriages, which crashed into the concrete bridge pile at a speed of . 101 were killed, including the two railway workers who had been standing under the bridge.

ICE 787, travelling from Hamburg to Hanover, had passed under the bridge going in the opposite direction only two minutes earlier. That train had passed the bridge one minute ahead of schedule, while the accident train was one minute behind schedule. Had both been on time, ICE 787 may have also been impacted by the derailment.

By 13:45 authorities had given emergency treatment to 87 people, of whom the 27 most severely injured were airlifted to hospitals.

==Causes==
The disintegrated resilient wheel was the cause of the accident, but several factors contributed to the severity of the damage, including proximity to the bridge and flipping point, and the wheel being on a car near the front of the train, causing many cars to derail.

===Wheel design===
The ICE 1 trains were originally equipped with single-cast wheelsets, known as monobloc wheels. Once in service it soon became apparent that this design could, as a result of metal fatigue and uneven wear, result in resonance and vibration at cruising speed. Passengers noticed this particularly in the restaurant car, where there were reports of loud vibrations in the dinnerware and of glasses &quot;creeping&quot; across tables.

Managers in the railway organisation had experienced these severe vibrations on a previous trip and asked to have the problem solved. In response engineers decided that to solve the problem, the suspension of ICE cars could be improved with the use of a rubber damping ring between the rail-contacting steel tyre and the steel wheel body. A similar design (known as resilient wheels) had been employed successfully in trams around the world, at much lower speeds. This kind of wheel, dubbed a &quot;wheel–tyre&quot; design, consisted of a wheel body surrounded by a rubber damper and then a relatively thin metal tyre. The new design was not tested at high speed in Germany before it was made operational, but was successful at resolving the issue of vibration at cruising speeds. Decade-long experience at high speed gathered by train manufacturers and railway companies in Italy, France and Japan was not considered.

At the time, there were no facilities in Germany that could test the actual failure limit of the wheels, and so complete prototypes were never tested physically. The design and specification relied greatly on available materials data and theory. The very few laboratory and rail tests that were performed did not measure wheel behaviour with extended wear conditions or speeds greater than normal cruising. Nevertheless, over several years the wheels had been reliable and, until the accident, had not caused any major problems.

In July 1997, nearly one year before the disaster, Üstra, the company that operates Hanover&#x27;s tram network, discovered fatigue cracks in dual block wheels on trams running at about . It began changing wheels before fatigue cracks could develop, much earlier than was legally required by the specification. Üstra reported its findings in a warning to all other users of wheels built with similar designs, including Deutsche Bahn, in late 1997. According to Üstra, Deutsche Bahn replied by stating that they had not noticed problems in their trains.

The (Fraunhofer LBF) in Darmstadt was charged with the task of determining the cause of the accident. It was revealed later that the institute had told the DB management as early as 1992 about its concerns about possible wheel–tyre failure.

It was soon apparent that dynamic repetitive forces had not been considered in the modelling done during the design phase, and the resulting design lacked an adequate margin of safety. The following factors, overlooked during design, were noted:

# The tyres were flattened into an ellipse as the wheel turned through each revolution (approximately 500,000 times during a typical day in service on an ICE train), with corresponding fatigue effects.
# In contrast to the monobloc wheel design, cracks could form on the inside as well as the outside of the tyre.
# As the tyre wore thinner, dynamic forces increased, causing crack growth.
# Flat spots and ridges or swells in the tyre dramatically increased the dynamic forces on the assembly and greatly accelerated wear.

===Failure to stop train===

Failing to stop the train resulted in a catastrophic series of events. Had the train been stopped immediately after the disintegration of the wheel, it is unlikely that the subsequent events would have occurred.

Valuable time was lost when the train manager refused to stop the train until he had investigated the problem himself, saying this was company policy. This decision was upheld in court, absolving the train manager of all charges. Given that he was a customer service employee and not a train maintainer or engineer, he had no more authority to make an engineering judgment about whether or not to stop the train than did any passenger.

===Maintenance===
About the time of the disaster, the technicians at Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s maintenance facility in Munich used only standard flashlights for visual inspection of the tyres, instead of metal fatigue detection equipment. Previously, advanced testing machines had been used; however the equipment generated many false positive error messages, so it was considered unreliable and its use was discontinued.

During the week prior to the Eschede disaster, three separate automated checks indicated that a wheel was defective. Investigators discovered, from a maintenance report generated by the train&#x27;s on-board computer, that two months prior to the Eschede disaster, conductors and other train staff filed eight separate complaints about the noises and vibrations generated from the bogie with the defective wheel; the company did not replace the wheel. Deutsche Bahn said that its inspections were proper at the time and that the engineers could not have predicted the wheel fracture.

===Other factors===
The design of the overbridge may have also contributed to the accident because it had two thin piers holding up the bridge on either side, instead of the spans going from solid abutments to solid abutments. The bridge that collapsed in the Granville rail disaster of 1977 had a similar weakness. The bridge built after the disaster is a cantilevered design that does not have this vulnerability.

Another contributing factor to the casualty rate was the use of welds that &quot;unzipped&quot; during the crash in the carriage bodies.

==Consequences==

===Legal===
Immediately after the accident, Deutsche Bahn paid 30,000 Deutsche Marks (about US$19,000) for each fatality to the applicable families. At a later time Deutsche Bahn settled with some victims. Deutsche Bahn stated that it paid the equivalent of more than 30 million U.S. dollars to survivors and the families of victims.

In August 2002, two Deutsche Bahn officials and one engineer were charged with manslaughter. The trial lasted 53 days with expert witnesses from around the world testifying. The case ended in a plea bargain in April 2003. According to the German code of criminal procedure, if the defendant has not been found to bear substantial guilt, and if the state attorney and the defendant agree, the defendant may pay a fine and the criminal proceedings are dismissed with prejudice and without a verdict. Each engineer paid €10,000 (around US$12,000).

===Technical===
Within weeks, all wheels of similar design were replaced with monobloc wheels. The entire German railway network was checked for similar arrangements of switches close to possible obstacles.

Rescue workers at the crash site experienced considerable difficulties in cutting their way through the train to gain access to the victims. Both the aluminium framework and the pressure-proof windows offered unexpected resistance to rescue equipment. As a result, all trains were refitted with windows that have breaking seams.

==Memorial==
Udo Bauch, a survivor who was left disabled by the accident, built his own memorial with his own money. Bauch said that the chapel received 5,000 to 6,000 visitors per year. One year after Bauch&#x27;s memorial was built, an official memorial, funded partly by Deutsche Bahn, was established.

The official memorial was opened on 11 May 2001 in the presence of 400 relatives as well as many dignitaries, rescuers and residents of Eschede. The memorial consists of 101 wild cherry trees, with each representing one fatality. The trees have been planted along the rails near the bridge and with the switch in front. From the field, a staircase leads up to the street and a gate; on the other side of the street a number of stairs lead further up to nowhere. There is an inscription on the side of the stone gate and an inscription on a memorial wall that also lists the names of the fatalities placed at the centre of the trees.
== Dramatization ==
The Eschede derailment, as well as the investigation into the incident, was covered as the fifth episode of the first season of the National Geographic TV documentary series &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot;, entitled &quot;Derailment at Eschede&quot; which was filmed on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway in Derbyshire, UK.

<text>Ashkenazi Jews ( ; also known as Ashkenazic Jews or Ashkenazim) constitute a Jewish diaspora population that emerged in the Holy Roman Empire around the end of the first millennium CE. They traditionally speak Yiddish, a language that originated in the 9th century, and largely migrated towards northern and eastern Europe during the late Middle Ages due to persecution. Hebrew was primarily used as a literary and sacred language until its 20th-century revival as a common language in Israel.

Ashkenazim adapted their traditions to Europe and underwent a transformation in their interpretation of Judaism. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, Jews who remained in or returned to historical German lands experienced a cultural reorientation. Under the influence of the Haskalah and the struggle for emancipation, as well as the intellectual and cultural ferment in urban centres, some gradually abandoned Yiddish in favor of German and developed new forms of Jewish religious life and cultural identity.

Throughout the centuries, Ashkenazim made significant contributions to Europe&#x27;s philosophy, scholarship, literature, art, music, and science.

As a proportion of the world Jewish population, Ashkenazim were estimated to be 3% in the 11th century, rising to 92% in 1930 near the population&#x27;s peak. The Ashkenazi population was significantly diminished by the Holocaust carried out by Nazi Germany during World War II, which killed some six million Jews, affecting practically every European Jewish family. In 1933, prior to World War II, the estimated worldwide Jewish population was 15.3 million. Israeli demographer and statistician Sergio D. Pergola implied that Ashkenazim comprised 65–70% of Jews worldwide in 2000, while other estimates suggest more than 75%. , the population was estimated to be between 10 million and 11.2 million. 

Genetic studies indicate that Ashkenazim have both Levantine and European (mainly southern and eastern European) ancestry. These studies draw diverging conclusions about the degree and sources of European admixture, with some focusing on the European genetic origin in Ashkenazi maternal lineages, contrasting with the predominantly Middle Eastern genetic origin in paternal lineages.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; derives from the biblical figure of Ashkenaz, the first son of Gomer, son of Japhet, son of Noah, and a Japhetic patriarch in the Table of Nations (). The name of Gomer has often been linked to the Cimmerians.

The Biblical &quot;Ashkenaz&quot; is usually derived from Assyrian (cuneiform &quot;Aškuzai/Iškuzai&quot;), a people who expelled the Cimmerians from the Armenian area of the Upper Euphrates; the name &quot;&quot; is identified with the Scythians. The intrusive &quot;n&quot; in the Biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a &quot;vav&quot;  with a &quot;nun&quot; .

In Jeremiah 51:27, Ashkenaz figures as one of three kingdoms in the far north, the others being Minni and Ararat (corresponding to Urartu), called on by God to resist Babylon. In Talmud (b. Yoma 10a; y. Megillah 71b) the name Gomer is rendered as &quot;Germania&quot;, which elsewhere in rabbinical literature was identified with Germanikia in northwestern Syria, but later became associated with &quot;Germania&quot;. In &quot;Genesis Rabbah&quot;, Rabbi Berechiah mentions Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah as German tribes or as German lands. Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius.

In the 10th-century &quot;History of Armenia&quot; of Yovhannes Drasxanakertc&#x27;i (1.15), Ashkenaz was associated with Armenia, as it was occasionally in Jewish usage, where its denotation extended at times to Adiabene, Khazaria, Crimea and areas to the east. His contemporary Saadia Gaon identified Ashkenaz with the &quot;Saquliba&quot; or Slavic territories, and such usage covered also the lands of tribes neighboring the Slavs, and Eastern and Central Europe. In modern times, Samuel Krauss identified the Biblical &quot;Ashkenaz&quot; with Khazaria.

Sometime in the Early Medieval period, the Jews of central and eastern Europe came to be called by this term. Conforming to the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain was denominated &quot;Sefarad&quot; (Obadiah 20), France was called &quot;Tsarefat&quot; (1 Kings 17:9), and Bohemia was called the &quot;Land of Canaan&quot;. By the start of the high medieval period, Hai Gaon refers to questions that had been addressed to him from Ashkenaz, by which he undoubtedly means Germany, and Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use &quot;Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz&quot; to designate Germany, earlier known as &quot;Loter&quot;, where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose. Rashi uses &quot;leshon Ashkenaz&quot; (Ashkenazi language) to describe Yiddish, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. During the 12th century, the word appears quite frequently. In the &quot;Mahzor Vitry&quot;, the kingdom of Ashkenaz is referred to chiefly in regard to the ritual of the synagogue there, but occasionally also with regard to certain other observances. In the literature of the 13th century, references to the land and the language of Ashkenaz often occur. Examples include Solomon ben Aderet&#x27;s Responsa (vol. i., No. 395); the Responsa of Asher ben Jehiel (pp. 4, 6); his &quot;Halakot&quot; (Berakot i. 12, ed. Wilna, p. 10); the work of his son Jacob ben Asher, &quot;Tur Orach Chayim&quot; (chapter 59); the Responsa of Isaac ben Sheshet (numbers 193, 268, 270). Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to the Jews of both medieval Germany and France.

In later times, the word Ashkenaz is used to designate southern and western Germany, the ritual of which sections differs somewhat from that of eastern Germany and Poland. Thus the prayer-book of Isaiah Horowitz, and many others, give the piyyutim according to the Minhag of Ashkenaz and Poland.
==History==

Like other Jewish ethnic groups, the Ashkenazi originate from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah. Ashkenazi Jews share a significant amount of ancestry with other Jewish populations and derive their ancestry mostly from populations in the Middle East, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Other than their origins in ancient Israel, the question of how Ashkenazi Jews came to exist as a distinct community is unknown, and has given rise to several theories.

=== Early Jewish communities in Europe ===
Beginning in the fourth century BCE, Jewish colonies sprang up in southern Europe, including the Aegean Islands, Greece, and Italy. Jews left ancient Israel for a number of causes, including a number of push and pull factors. More Jews moved into these communities as a result of wars, persecution, unrest, and for opportunities in trade and commerce.

Jews migrated to southern Europe from the Middle East voluntarily for opportunities in trade and commerce. Following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests, Jews migrated to Greek settlements in the Eastern Mediterranean, spurred on by economic opportunities. Jewish economic migration to southern Europe is also believed to have occurred during the Roman period.

In 63 BCE, the Siege of Jerusalem saw the Roman Republic conquer Judea, and thousands of Jewish prisoners of war were brought to Rome as slaves. After gaining their freedom, they settled permanently in Rome as traders. It is likely that there was an additional influx of Jewish slaves taken to southern Europe by Roman forces after the capture of Jerusalem by the forces of Herod the Great with assistance from Roman forces in 37 BCE. It is known that Jewish war captives were sold into slavery after the suppression of a minor Jewish revolt in 53 BCE, and some were probably taken to southern Europe.

Regarding Jewish settlements founded in southern Europe during the Roman era, E. Mary Smallwood wrote that &quot;no date or origin can be assigned to the numerous settlements eventually known in the west, and some may have been founded as a result of the dispersal of Palestinian Jews after the revolts of AD 66–70 and 132–135, but it is reasonable to conjecture that many, such as the settlement in Puteoli attested in 4 BC, went back to the late republic or early empire and originated in voluntary emigration and the lure of trade and commerce.&quot;

===Jewish–Roman Wars===

The first and second centuries CE saw a series of unsuccessful large-scale Jewish revolts against Rome. The Roman suppression of these revolts led to wide-scale destruction, a very high toll of life and enslavement. The First Jewish-Roman War (66–73 CE) resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. Two generations later, the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE) erupted. Judea&#x27;s countryside was devastated, and many were killed, displaced or sold into slavery. Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony under the name of Aelia Capitolina, and the province of Judea was renamed Syria Palaestina. Jews were prohibited from entering the city on pain of death. Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt.

With their national aspirations crushed and widespread devastation in Judea, despondent Jews migrated out of Judea in the aftermath of both revolts, and many settled in southern Europe. In contrast to the earlier Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, the movement was by no means a singular, centralized event, and a Jewish diaspora had already been established before.

During both of these rebellions, many Jews were captured and sold into slavery by the Romans. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, 97,000 Jews were sold as slaves in the aftermath of the first revolt. In one occasion, Vespasian reportedly ordered 6,000 Jewish prisoners of war from Galilee to work on the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece. Jewish slaves and their children eventually gained their freedom and joined local free Jewish communities.

=== Late antiquity ===
Many Jews were denied full Roman citizenship until Emperor Caracalla granted all free peoples this privilege in 212 CE. Jews were required to pay a poll tax until the reign of Emperor Julian in 363 CE. In the late Roman Empire, Jews were free to form networks of cultural and religious ties and enter into various local occupations. However, after Christianity became the official religion of Rome and Constantinople in 380 CE, Jews were increasingly marginalized.

The Synagogue in the Agora of Athens is dated to the period between 267 and 396 CE. The Stobi Synagogue in Macedonia was built on the ruins of a more ancient synagogue in the 4th century, while later in the 5th century, the synagogue was transformed into a Christian basilica. Hellenistic Judaism thrived in Antioch and Alexandria, and many of these Greek-speaking Jews would convert to Christianity.

Sporadic epigraphic evidence in gravesite excavations, particularly in Brigetio (Szőny), Aquincum (Óbuda), Intercisa (Dunaújváros), Triccinae (Sárvár), Savaria (Szombathely), Sopianae (Pécs) in Hungary, and Mursa (Osijek) in Croatia, attest to the presence of Jews after the 2nd and 3rd centuries where Roman garrisons were established. There was a sufficient number of Jews in Pannonia to form communities and build a synagogue. Jewish troops were among the Syrian soldiers transferred there, and replenished from the Middle East. After 175 CE Jews and especially Syrians came from Antioch, Tarsus, and Cappadocia. Others came from Italy and the Hellenized parts of the Roman Empire. The excavations suggest they first lived in isolated enclaves attached to Roman legion camps and intermarried with other similar oriental families within the military orders of the region.

Raphael Patai states that later Roman writers remarked that they differed little in either customs, manner of writing, or names from the people among whom they dwelt; and it was especially difficult to differentiate Jews from the Syrians. After Pannonia was ceded to the Huns in 433, the garrison populations were withdrawn to Italy, and only a few, enigmatic traces remain of a possible Jewish presence in the area some centuries later. No evidence has yet been found of a Jewish presence in antiquity in Germany beyond its Roman border, nor in Eastern Europe. In Gaul and Germany itself, with the possible exception of Trier and Cologne, the archeological evidence suggests at most a fleeting presence of very few Jews, primarily itinerant traders or artisans.

Estimating the number of Jews in antiquity is a task fraught with peril due to the nature of and lack of accurate documentation. The number of Jews in the Roman Empire for a long time was based on the accounts of Syrian Orthodox bishop Bar Hebraeus who lived between 1226 and 1286 CE, who stated by the time of the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, as many as six million Jews were already living in the Roman Empire, a conclusion which has been contested as highly exaggerated. The 13th-century author Bar Hebraeus gave a figure of 6,944,000 Jews in the Roman world. Salo Wittmayer Baron considered the figure convincing. The figure of seven million within and one million outside the Roman world in the mid-first century became widely accepted, including by Louis Feldman. However, contemporary scholars now accept that Bar Hebraeus based his figure on a census of total Roman citizens and thus included non-Jews, the figure of 6,944,000 being recorded in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Chronicon&quot;. Louis Feldman, previously an active supporter of the figure, now states that he and Baron were mistaken. Philo gives a figure of one million Jews living in Egypt. Brian McGing rejects Baron&#x27;s figures entirely, arguing that we have no clue as to the size of the Jewish demographic in the ancient world. Sometimes the scholars who accepted the high number of Jews in Rome had explained it by Jews having been active in proselytising. The idea of ancient Jews trying to convert Gentiles to Judaism is nowadays rejected by several scholars. The Romans did not distinguish between Jews inside and outside of the land of Israel/Judaea. They collected an annual temple tax from Jews both in and outside of Israel. The revolts in and suppression of diaspora communities in Egypt, Libya and Crete during the Kitos War of 115–117 CE had a severe impact on the Jewish diaspora.

A substantial Jewish population emerged in northern Gaul by the Middle Ages, but Jewish communities existed in 465 CE in Brittany, in 524 CE in Valence, and in 533 CE in Orléans. Throughout this period and into the early Middle Ages, some Jews assimilated into the dominant Greek and Latin cultures, mostly through conversion to Christianity. King Dagobert I of the Franks expelled the Jews from his Merovingian kingdom in 629. Jews in former Roman territories faced new challenges as harsher anti-Jewish Church rulings were enforced.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
Charlemagne&#x27;s expansion of the Frankish empire around 800, including northern Italy and Rome, brought on a brief period of stability and unity in Francia. This created opportunities for Jewish merchants to settle again north of the Alps. Charlemagne granted the Jews freedoms similar to those once enjoyed under the Roman Empire. In addition, Jews from southern Italy, fleeing religious persecution, began to move into Central Europe. Returning to Frankish lands, many Jewish merchants took up occupations in finance and commerce, including money lending, or usury. (Church legislation banned Christians from lending money in exchange for interest.) From Charlemagne&#x27;s time to the present, Jewish life in northern Europe is well documented. By the 11th century, when Rashi of Troyes wrote his commentaries, Jews in what came to be known as &quot;Ashkenaz&quot; were known for their halakhic learning, and Talmudic studies. They were criticized by Sephardim and other Jewish scholars in Islamic lands for their lack of expertise in Jewish jurisprudence and general ignorance of Hebrew linguistics and literature. Yiddish emerged as a result of Judeo-Latin language contact with various High German vernaculars in the medieval period. It is a Germanic language written in Hebrew letters, and heavily influenced by Hebrew and Aramaic, with some elements of Romance and later Slavic languages.

===High and Late Middle Ages migrations===

Historical records show evidence of Jewish communities north of the Alps and Pyrenees as early as the 8th and 9th centuries. By the 11th century, Jewish settlers moving from southern European and Middle Eastern centers (such as Babylonian Jews and Persian Jews) and Maghrebi Jewish traders from North Africa who had contacts with their Ashkenazi brethren and had visited each other from time to time in each&#x27;s domain appear to have begun to settle in the north, especially along the Rhine, often in response to new economic opportunities and at the invitation of local Christian rulers. Thus Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, invited Jacob ben Yekutiel and his fellow Jews to settle in his lands; and soon after the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror likewise extended a welcome to continental Jews to take up residence there. Bishop Rüdiger Huzmann called on the Jews of Mainz to relocate to Speyer. In all of these decisions, the idea that Jews had the know-how and capacity to jump-start the economy, improve revenues, and enlarge trade seems to have played a prominent role. Typically, Jews relocated close to the markets and churches in town centres, where, though they came under the authority of both royal and ecclesiastical powers, they were accorded administrative autonomy.

According to 16th-century mystic Rabbi Elijah of Chelm, Ashkenazi Jews lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century. The story is told that a German-speaking Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed Dolberger. So when the knights of the First Crusade came to siege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger&#x27;s family members who was among them rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to Worms to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakhic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.

In the 11th century, the &quot;Rabbinic mode of thought and life&quot; and the culture of the Babylonian Talmud that underlies it became established in southern Italy and then spread north to Ashkenaz. However, many traditions and customs from the Jerusalem Talmud and other Land of Israel rabbinic sources were known and practiced in Ashkenaz long before the 11th century - so long before that the sources of these practices were forgotten by 11th century Ashkenazi writers, and the practices regarded simply as &quot;minhag&quot;.

Numerous massacres of Jews occurred throughout Europe during the Christian Crusades. Inspired by the preaching of a First Crusade, crusader mobs in France and Germany perpetrated the Rhineland massacres of 1096, devastating Jewish communities along the Rhine River, including the SHuM cities of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz. The cluster of cities contain the earliest Jewish settlements north of the Alps, and played a major role in the formation of Ashkenazi Jewish religious tradition, along with Troyes and Sens in France. Nonetheless, Jewish life in Germany persisted, while some Ashkenazi Jews joined Sephardic Jewry in Spain. Expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), gradually pushed Ashkenazi Jewry eastward, to Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as &quot;usurious&quot; loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near-universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.
In Poland, Jews were granted special protection by the Statute of Kalisz of 1264. By the 15th century, the Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Poland were the largest Jewish communities of the Diaspora. This area, which eventually fell under the domination of Russia, Austria, and Prussia (Germany) following the Partitions of Poland, and was later largely regained by reborn Poland in the interbellum, would remain the main center of Ashkenazi Jewry until the Holocaust.

The answer to why there was so little assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe for so long would seem to lie in part in the probability that the alien surroundings in central and eastern Europe were not conducive, though there was some assimilation. Furthermore, Jews lived almost exclusively in shtetls, maintained a strong system of education for males, heeded rabbinic leadership, and had a very different lifestyle to that of their neighbours; all of these tendencies increased with every outbreak of antisemitism.

In parts of Eastern Europe, before the arrival of the Ashkenazi Jews from Central Europe, some non-Ashkenazi Jews were present who spoke Leshon Knaan and held various other Non-Ashkenazi traditions and customs. In 1966, the historian Cecil Roth questioned the inclusion of all Yiddish speaking Jews as Ashkenazim in descent, suggesting that upon the arrival of Ashkenazi Jews from central Europe to Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to the 16th century, there were a substantial number of non-Ashkenazim Jews already there who later abandoned their original Eastern European Jewish culture in favor of the Ashkenazi one. However, according to more recent research, mass migrations of Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews occurred to Eastern Europe, from Central Europe in the west, who due to high birth rates absorbed and largely replaced the preceding non-Ashkenazi Jewish groups of Eastern Europe (whose numbers the demographer Sergio Della Pergola considers to have been small). Genetic evidence also indicates that Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews largely descend from Ashkenazi Jews who migrated from central to eastern Europe and subsequently experienced high birthrates and genetic isolation.

Some Jewish immigration from southern Europe to Eastern Europe continued into the early modern period. During the 16th century, as conditions for Italian Jews worsened, many Jews from Venice and the surrounding area migrated to Poland and Lithuania. During the 16th and 17th centuries, some Sephardi Jews and Romaniote Jews from throughout the Ottoman Empire migrated to Eastern Europe, as did Arabic-speaking Mizrahi Jews and Persian Jews.

===Modern history===
Material relating to the history of German Jews has been preserved in the communal accounts of certain communities on the Rhine, a &quot;Memorbuch&quot;, and a &quot;Liebesbrief&quot;, documents that are now part of the Sassoon Collection. Heinrich Graetz also added to the history of German Jewry in modern times in the abstract of his seminal work, &quot;History of the Jews&quot;, which he entitled &quot;Volksthümliche Geschichte der Juden&quot;.

In an essay on Sephardi Jewry, Daniel Elazar at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs summarized the demographic history of Ashkenazi Jews in the last thousand years. He noted that at the end of the 11th century, 97% of world Jewry was Sephardic and 3% Ashkenazi; in the mid-17th century, &quot;Sephardim still outnumbered Ashkenazim three to two&quot;; by the end of the 18th century, &quot;Ashkenazim outnumbered Sephardim three to two, the result of improved living conditions in Christian Europe versus the Ottoman Muslim world.&quot; By 1930, Arthur Ruppin estimated that Ashkenazi Jews accounted for nearly 92% of world Jewry. These factors are sheer demography showing the migration patterns of Jews from Southern and Western Europe to Central and Eastern Europe.

In 1740, a family from Lithuania became the first Ashkenazi Jews to settle in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem.

In the generations after emigration from the west, Jewish communities in places like Poland, Russia, and Belarus enjoyed a comparatively stable socio-political environment. A thriving publishing industry and the printing of hundreds of biblical commentaries precipitated the development of the Hasidic movement as well as major Jewish academic centers. After two centuries of comparative tolerance in the new nations, massive westward emigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries in response to pogroms in the east and the economic opportunities offered in other parts of the world. Ashkenazi Jews have made up the majority of the American Jewish community since 1750.

In the context of the European Enlightenment, Jewish emancipation began in 18th century France and spread throughout Western and Central Europe. Disabilities that had limited the rights of Jews since the Middle Ages were abolished, including the requirements to wear distinctive clothing, pay special taxes, and live in ghettos isolated from non-Jewish communities and the prohibitions on certain professions. Laws were passed to integrate Jews into their host countries, forcing Ashkenazi Jews to adopt family names (they had formerly used patronymics). Newfound inclusion into public life led to cultural growth in the &quot;Haskalah&quot;, or Jewish Enlightenment, with its goal of integrating modern European values into Jewish life. As a reaction to increasing antisemitism and assimilation following the emancipation, Zionism developed in central Europe. Other Jews, particularly those in the Pale of Settlement, turned to socialism. These tendencies would be united in Labor Zionism, the founding ideology of the State of Israel.

==== The Holocaust ====

Of the estimated 8.8 million Jews living in Europe at the beginning of World War II, the majority of whom were Ashkenazi, about 6 million – more than two-thirds – were systematically murdered in the Holocaust. These included 3 million of 3.3 million Polish Jews (91%); 900,000 of 1.5 million in Ukraine (60%); and 50–90% of the Jews of other Slavic nations, Germany, Hungary, and the Baltic states, and over 25% of the Jews in France. Sephardi communities suffered similar devastation in a few countries, including Greece, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. As the large majority of the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, their percentage dropped from an estimate of 92% of world Jewry in 1930 to nearly 80% of world Jewry today. The Holocaust also effectively put an end to the dynamic development of the Yiddish language in the previous decades, as the vast majority of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, around 5 million, were Yiddish speakers. Many of the surviving Ashkenazi Jews emigrated to countries such as Israel, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and the United States after the war.

Following the Holocaust, some sources place Ashkenazim today as making up approximately 83%–85% of Jews worldwide, while Sergio DellaPergola in a rough calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, implies that Ashkenazi make up a notably lower figure, less than 74%. Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide.

====Israel====

From the 1880s onwards, Ashkenazi Jews from Russia, Poland and Germany immigrated to the Land of Israel in large numbers. By 1948, they comprised 80% of the Jewish population of Israel, shortly before the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world changed the demographic composition of Israeli society. Currently, Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews.

Ashkenazi Jews have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics of Israel since its founding. During the first decades of Israel as a state, strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society, are chiefly attributed to the concept of the &quot;melting pot&quot;. That is to say, all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to &quot;meltdown&quot; their own particular exilic identities within the general social &quot;pot&quot; in order to become Israeli.

Religious Ashkenazi Jews living in Israel are obliged to follow the authority of the chief Ashkenazi rabbi in halakhic matters. In this respect, a religiously Ashkenazi Jew is an Israeli who is more likely to support certain religious interests in Israel, including certain political parties. These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews. The role of religious parties, including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel&#x27;s composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the Knesset, a unicameral legislature with 120 seats.

==== United States of America ====

As of 2020, 66% of American Jews identify as Ashkenazic, compared to 4% who identify as Sephardic or Mizrahi, and 6% who claim mixed heritage. A disproportionate number of Ashkenazi Americans are religious compared to American Jews of other racial groups. They live in large populations in the states of New York, California, Florida, and New Jersey. The majority of American Ashkenazi Jewish voters vote for the Democratic Party; Orthodox Ashkenazim tend to support the Republican Party, while Conservative, Reform, and non denominational Ashkenazim tend to support the Democratic Party.

==Definition==
===By religion===
Religious Jews have minhagim, customs, in addition to halakha, or religious law, and different interpretations of the law. Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household&#x27;s religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family&#x27;s past. In this sense, &quot;Ashkenazic&quot; refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. Reform Judaism, which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.

In a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follow Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the Early Middle Ages, the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at Baghdad and in Islamic Spain. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a &quot;minhag&quot; of its own. Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.

In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism.

New developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. In North American cities, social trends such as the chavurah movement, and the emergence of &quot;post-denominational Judaism&quot; often bring together younger Jews of diverse ethnic backgrounds. In recent years, there has been increased interest in &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, which many Ashkenazi Jews study outside of the Yeshiva framework. Another trend is the new popularity of ecstatic worship in the Jewish Renewal movement and the Carlebach style minyan, both of which are nominally of Ashkenazi origin. Outside of Haredi communities, the traditional Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew has also drastically declined in favor of the Sephardi-based pronunciation of Modern Hebrew.

===By culture===

Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of &quot;Yiddishkeit&quot;, which means &quot;Jewishness&quot; in the Yiddish language. &quot;Yiddishkeit&quot; is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, &quot;Yiddishkeit&quot; now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, &quot;Yiddishkeit&quot; can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

As Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of aliyah to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas such as South Africa; and Europe (particularly France) and Latin America, the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim have given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. Hebrew has replaced Yiddish as the primary Jewish language for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many Hasidic and Hareidi groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. (There are numerous Ashkenazi Jewish anglophones and Russian-speakers as well, although English and Russian are not originally Jewish languages.)

France&#x27;s blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the Middle Ages, by the time of the French Revolution, there were two distinct Jewish populations. One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the Inquisition and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German Alsace, and mainly speaking a German dialect similar to Yiddish. (The third community of Provençal Jews living in Comtat Venaissin were technically outside France, and were later absorbed into the Sephardim.) The two communities were so separate and different that the National Assembly emancipated them separately in 1790 and 1791.

But after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the Dreyfus affair in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from antisemitism, the Russian revolution, and the economic turmoil of the Great Depression. By the 1930s, Paris had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in diverse political movements. After the Vichy years and the Holocaust, the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by Ashkenazi refugees from Central Europe, and later by Sephardi immigrants and refugees from North Africa, many of them francophone.

Ashkenazi Jews did not record their traditions or achievements by text, instead these traditions were passed down orally from one generation to the next. The desire to maintain pre-Holocaust traditions relating to Ashkenazi culture has often been met with criticism by Jews in Eastern Europe. Reasoning for this could be related to the development of a new style of Jewish arts and culture developed by the Jews of Palestine during the 1930s and 1940s, which in conjunction with the decimation of European Ashkenazi Jews and their culture by the Nazi regime made it easier to assimilate to the new style of ritual rather than try to repair the older traditions. This new style of tradition was referred to as the &quot;Mediterranean Style&quot;, and was noted for its simplicity and metaphorical rejuvenation of Jews abroad. This was intended to replace the Galut traditions, which were more sorrowful in practice.

Then, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former Soviet Union and Central Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.

===By ethnicity===
In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews who settled in Central Europe. For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers (Y-chromosome haplotypes) and for matrilineal markers (mitotypes). Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and non-Jews.

==Customs, laws and traditions==
The &quot;Halakhic&quot; practices of (Orthodox) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of Sephardi Jews, particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot; itself, in the gloss of Moses Isserles. Well known differences in practice include:

* Observance of &quot;Pesach&quot; (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating legumes, grain, millet, and rice (quinoa, however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.
* Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.
* Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of wigs as a hair covering for married and widowed women.
* Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper Halakhic removal of the sciatic nerve, while many Ashkenazi Jews do not.
* Ashkenazi Jews often name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children&#x27;s grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among Dutch Jews, where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as Chuts.
* Ashkenazi tefillin bear some differences from Sephardic tefillin. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don tefillin while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.
* Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of Hebrew differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter tav in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /θ/ sound. 
* The prayer shawl or tallit (tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew) is worn by all Ashkenazi men after marriage, except western European Ashkenazi men, who wear it from bar mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.

===Ashkenazic liturgy===

The term Ashkenazi also refers to the Nusach Ashkenaz, the liturgical tradition used by Ashkenazi Jews in their siddur (prayer book). A nusach is defined by a liturgical tradition&#x27;s choice of prayers, the order of prayers, the text of prayers, and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are Nusach Sefard (not to be confused with the Sephardic ritual), which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach, and Nusach Ari, used by those in Chabad.

== Relations with Sephardim ==

Relations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have at times been tense and clouded by arrogance, snobbery and claims of racial superiority with both sides claiming the inferiority of the other, based upon such features as physical traits and culture.

North African Sephardim and Berber Jews were often looked down upon by Ashkenazim as second-class citizens during the first decade after the creation of Israel. This has led to protest movements such as the Israeli Black Panthers led by Saadia Marciano, a Moroccan Jew. Research in 2010 revealed a genetic common ancestry of all Jewish populations. In some instances, Ashkenazi communities have accepted significant numbers of Sephardi newcomers, sometimes resulting in intermarriage and the possible merging between the two communities.

==Notable Ashkenazim==
Though Ashkenazi Jews have never exceeded 3% of the American population, Jews account for 37% of the winners of the U.S. National Medal of Science, 25% of the American Nobel Prize winners in literature, and 40% of the American Nobel Prize winners in science and economics.

==Genetics==
===Genetic origins===
Efforts to identify the origins of Ashkenazi Jews through DNA analysis began in the 1990s. There are three types of genetic origin testing, autosomal DNA (atDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA). Autosomal DNA is a mixture from an individual&#x27;s entire ancestry. Y-DNA shows a male&#x27;s lineage along his paternal line. mtDNA shows any person&#x27;s lineage only along their maternal line. Genome-wide association studies have also been used for genetic origin testing.

Like most DNA studies of human migration patterns, the earliest studies on Ashkenazi Jews focused on the Y-DNA and mtDNA segments of the human genome. Both segments are unaffected by recombination (except for the ends of the Y chromosome – the pseudoautosomal regions known as PAR1 and PAR2), thus allowing tracing of direct maternal and paternal lineages.

These studies revealed that Ashkenazi Jews originate from an ancient (2000–700 BCE) population of the Middle East who spread to Europe. Ashkenazic Jews display the homogeneity of a genetic bottleneck, meaning they descend from a larger population whose numbers were greatly reduced but recovered through a few founding individuals. Although the Jewish people, in general, were present across a wide geographical area as described, genetic research by Gil Atzmon of the Longevity Genes Project at Albert Einstein College of Medicine suggests &quot;that Ashkenazim branched off from other Jews around the time of the destruction of the First Temple, 2,500 years ago ... flourished during the Roman Empire but then went through a &#x27;severe bottleneck&#x27; as they dispersed, reducing a population of several million to just 400 families who left Northern Italy around the year 1000 for Central and eventually Eastern Europe.&quot;

Various studies have drawn diverging conclusions about the degree and sources of the non-Levantine admixture in Ashkenazim, particularly the extent of the non-Levantine origin in maternal lineages, which is in contrast to the predominant Levantine genetic origin in paternal lineages. But all studies agree that both lineages have genetic overlap with the Fertile Crescent, albeit at differing rates. Collectively, Ashkenazi Jews are less genetically diverse than other Jewish ethnic divisions, due to their genetic bottleneck.

====Male lineages: Y-chromosomal DNA====
Most genetic studies of Ashkenazi Jews conclude that the male lines were from the Middle East.

A 2000 study by Hammer &quot;et al.&quot; found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon among indigenous Europeans. This suggests that Ashkenazim male ancestors are mostly from the Middle East. Ashkenazim had less than 0.5% male genetic admixture per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with &quot;relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,&quot; and the total admixture estimate &quot;very similar to Motulsky&#x27;s average estimate of 12.5%&quot;. This supported the finding that &quot;Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.&quot; &quot;Past research found that 50%–80% of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East,&quot; Richards said. The population has subsequently spread out.

A 2001 study by Nebel &quot;et al.&quot; showed that Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews share overall Near Eastern paternal ancestries. In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent. The study also found Eu 19 (R1a) chromosomes had elevated frequency among Ashkenazi Jews (13%), and they are very frequent in Central and Eastern Europeans (54–60%). They hypothesized that the differences among Ashkenazim could reflect low-level gene flow from surrounding European populations or genetic drift during isolation. A 2005 study by Nebel &quot;et al.&quot;, found a similar level of 11.5% of male Ashkenazim belonging to R1a1a (M17+), the dominant Y-chromosome haplogroup in Central and Eastern Europeans. However, a 2017 study, of Ashkenazi Levites where the proportion reaches 50%, found a &quot;rich variation of haplogroup R1a outside of Europe which is phylogenetically separate from the typically European R1a branches&quot;, and concludes that the particular R1a-Y2619 sub-clade is evidence for a local origin, and that this validates the &quot;Middle Eastern origin of the Ashkenazi Levite lineage&quot; which had previously been concluded based on a few samples.

====Female lineages: Mitochondrial DNA====

A 2006 study by Behar &quot;et al.&quot;, of 1,000 units of haplogroup K (mtDNA), suggested that about 40% of today&#x27;s Ashkenazim descend from just four women who were &quot;likely from a Hebrew/Levantine mtDNA pool&quot; originating in the Middle East in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. The rest of Ashkenazi mtDNA reportedly originated from about 150 women, most of whom were also likely of Middle Eastern origin. Specifically, although haplogroup K is common throughout western Eurasia, its global distribution makes it very unlikely that &quot;the four aforementioned founder lineages entered the Ashkenazi mtDNA pool via gene flow from a European host population&quot;.

A 2013 study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards tested all 16,600 DNA units of mtDNA, and found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study argued that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East or the Caucasus, but instead assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. The study estimated that more than 80% of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to (mainly prehistoric Western) Europe, and only 8% from the Near East, while the origin of the remainder is undetermined. According to the study this &quot;point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.&quot; Karl Skorecki criticized the study, arguing that while it &quot;re-opened the question of the maternal origins of Ashkenazi Jewry, the phylogenetic analysis in the manuscript does not &#x27;settle&#x27; the question.&quot;

A 2014 study by Fernández &quot;et al.&quot; found that Ashkenazi Jews display a frequency of haplogroup K in their maternal DNA, suggesting an ancient Near Eastern matrilineal origin, similar to the results of the Behar study in 2006. Fernández noted that this observation clearly contradicts the results of the 2013 study led by Richards that suggested a European source for 3 exclusively Ashkenazi K lineages.

====Association and linkage studies (autosomal DNA)====
In genetic epidemiology, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS) is an examination of all or most of the genes (the genome) of different individuals of a particular species to see how much the genes vary from individual to individual. These techniques were originally designed for epidemiological uses, to identify genetic associations with observable traits.

A 2006 study by Seldin &quot;et al.&quot; used over 5,000 autosomal SNPs to demonstrate European genetic substructure. The results showed &quot;a consistent and reproducible distinction between &#x27;northern&#x27; and &#x27;southern&#x27; European population groups&quot;. Most northern, central, and eastern Europeans (Finns, Swedes, English, Irish, Germans, and Ukrainians) showed &gt;90%, while most southern Europeans (Italians, Greeks, Portuguese, Spaniards) showed &gt;85%. Both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews showed &gt;85% membership in the &quot;southern&quot; group. Referring to the Jews clustering with southern Europeans, the authors state the results were &quot;consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups&quot;.

A 2007 study by Bauchet &quot;et al.&quot; found that Ashkenazim were most closely clustered with Arabic North African populations than with the global population, and in the European structure analysis, they share similarities only with Greeks and Southern Italians, reflecting their east Mediterranean origins.

A 2010 study of Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer &quot;et al.&quot; identified two major groups: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews, by using &quot;principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis&quot;. &quot;The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry&quot;, as the two groups share ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and finds that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships, and that each studied Jewish group (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen. Atzmon&#x27;s team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that this similarity may be due to inter-marriage and conversions during the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins.

A 2010 study by Bray &quot;et al.&quot;, using SNP microarray techniques and linkage analysis, found that when assuming Druze and Palestinian Arab populations to represent the reference to world Jewry ancestor genome, 35% to 55% of the modern Ashkenazi genome may be of European origin, and that European &quot;admixture is considerably higher than previous estimates by studies that used the Y chromosome&quot; with this reference point. The authors interpreted this linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population as matching signs &quot;of interbreeding or &#x27;admixture&#x27; between Middle Eastern and European populations&quot;. On the Bray &quot;et al.&quot; tree, Ashkenazi Jews were found to be a genetically more divergent population than Russians, Orcadians, French, Basques, Sardinians, Italians and Tuscans. The study also observed that Ashkenazim are more diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives, which was counterintuitive because Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset, not a superset, of their assumed geographical source population. Bray &quot;et al.&quot; therefore suggest that these results reflect a history of mixing between genetically distinct populations in Europe. However, it is possible that Ashkenazim&#x27;s high heterozygocity was due to a relaxation of marriage prescription in their ancestors, while the low heterozygocity in te Middle East is due to maintenance of FBD marriage there. Therefore, Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray &quot;et al.&quot; study may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to &quot;mine&quot; their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter&#x27;s marriage practices, not necessarily from the former&#x27;s admixture with Europeans. 

A 2010 genome-wide genetic study by Behar &quot;et al.&quot; examined the genetic relationships among all major Jewish groups, including Ashkenazim, and their genetic relationship with non-Jewish ethnic populations. It found that today&#x27;s Jews (except Indian and Ethiopian Jews) are closely related to people from the Levant. The authors explained that &quot;the most parsimonious explanation for these observations is a common genetic origin, which is consistent with an historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelite residents of the Levant&quot;.

A 2013 study by Behar &quot;et al.&quot; found evidence among Ashkenazim of mixed European and Levantine origins. The authors found Ashkenazi had the greatest affinity and shared ancestry firstly with other Jewish groups from southern Europe, Syria, and North Africa, and secondly with both southern Europeans (such as Italians) and modern Levantines (such as the Druze, Cypriots, Lebanese and Samaritans). The study found no affinity of Ashkenazim to northern Caucasus populations, and no more affinity to modern south Caucasus and eastern Anatolian populations (such as Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and Turks) than found in other Jews or non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as the Kurds, Iranians, Druze and Lebanese).

A 2017 autosomal study by Xue, Shai Carmi &quot;et al.&quot; found an admixture of Middle-Eastern and European ancestry in Ashkenazi Jews: with the European component comprising ≈50%–70% (estimated at &quot;possibly 60%&quot;) and largely being of a southern European source and a minority eastern European, and the remainder (estimated at possibly ≈40%) being Middle Eastern ancestry showing the strongest affinity to Levantine populations such as the Druze and Lebanese.

A 2018 study, referencing the popular theory of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) origins in &quot;an initial settlement in Western Europe (Northern France and Germany), followed by migration to Poland and an expansion there and in the rest of Eastern Europe&quot;, tested &quot;whether Ashkenazi Jews with recent origins in Eastern Europe are genetically distinct from Western European Ashkenazi&quot;. The study concluded that &quot;Western AJ consist of two slightly distinct groups: one that descends from a subset of the original founders [who remained in Western Europe], and another that migrated there back from Eastern Europe, possibly after absorbing a limited degree of gene flow&quot;.

A 2022 study of genome data from the medieval Jewish cemetery of Erfurt found at least two related but genetically distinct Jewish groups: one closely related to Middle Eastern populations and especially similar to modern Ashkenazi Jews from France and Germany and modern Sephardic Jews from Turkey; the other group had a substantial contribution from Eastern European populations. But today Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe no longer exhibit this genetic variability, and instead, their genomes resemble a nearly even mixture of the two Erfurt groups (with about 60% from the first group and 40% from the second).

===The Khazar hypothesis===

In the late 19th century, it was proposed that the core of Ashkenazi Jews were genetically descended from a hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora who had migrated westward from modern Russia and Ukraine into modern France and Germany (as opposed to the currently held theory that Jews migrated from France and Germany into Eastern Europe). The hypothesis is not corroborated by historical sources, and is unsubstantiated by genetics, but it is still occasionally supported by scholars who have had some success in keeping the theory in the academic consciousness.

The theory has sometimes been used by Jewish authors such as Arthur Koestler as part of an argument against traditional forms of antisemitism (for example the claim that &quot;the Jews killed Christ&quot;), just as similar arguments have been advanced on behalf of the Crimean Karaites. Today, however, the theory is more often associated with antisemitism and anti-Zionism.

A 2013 trans-genome study carried out by 30 geneticists, from 13 universities and academies, from nine countries, assembling the largest data set available to date, for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins found no evidence of Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews. The authors concluded:

The authors found no affinity in Ashkenazim with north Caucasus populations, as well as no greater affinity in Ashkenazim to south Caucasus or Anatolian populations than that found in non-Ashkenazi Jews and non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as the Kurds, Iranians, Druze and Lebanese). The greatest affinity and shared ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews were found to be (after those with other Jewish groups from southern Europe, Syria, and North Africa) with both southern Europeans and Levantines such as Druze, Cypriot, Lebanese and Samaritan groups.

=== East Asian ancestry ===
In addition to the genetic contributions from neighboring Europeans, Near Easterners and North Africans, Ashkenazi Jews share some East Eurasian haplogroups, such as N9a, A, and M33c, with Chinese populations. This originates from their economic and cultural exchanges along the Silk Road.

===Medical genetics===
There are many references to Ashkenazi Jews in the literature of medical and population genetics. Indeed, much awareness of &quot;Ashkenazi Jews&quot; as an ethnic group or category stems from the large number of genetic studies of disease, including many that are well reported in the media, that have been conducted among Jews. Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons:

* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of endogamy, yet they are sizable.
* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.

The result is a form of ascertainment bias. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations. Healthcare professionals are often taught to consider those of Ashkenazi descent to be at increased risk for colon cancer. People of Ashkenazi descent are at much higher risk of being a carrier for Tay–Sachs disease, which is fatal in its homozygous form.

Genetic counseling and genetic testing are often undertaken by couples where both partners are of Ashkenazi ancestry. Some organizations, most notably Dor Yeshorim, organize screening programs to prevent homozygosity for the genes that cause related diseases.
