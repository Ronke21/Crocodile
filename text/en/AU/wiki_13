<text>Japanese hip hop is hip hop music from Japan. It is said to have begun when Hiroshi Fujiwara returned to Japan and started playing hip hop records in the early 1980s. Japanese hip hop tends to be most directly influenced by old school hip hop, taking from the era&#x27;s catchy beats, dance culture and overall fun and carefree nature and incorporating it into their music. As a result, hip hop stands as one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan and the line between it and pop music is frequently blurred.

==History of hip hop in Japan==
Although rather informal and small scale, the early days of Japanese hip hop provide the history for the emergence of the cultural movement. Early hip hop was not led by corporate interests, but rather was largely ignored by large record companies and performance venues. In this respect, Japanese hip-hop offers a representation of cultural globalization, as it expanded despite criticism on the part of record companies and major media outlets. The history shows that certain kinds of cultural exchange are not initiated through cultural understanding, but instead from some interaction that can incite a desire to learn, to participate, and to contribute individuality. In Japan, this motivation to represent individuality was breakdancing, which was one of the leading edges of hip-hop at the time.

The first known Japanese group to experiment with hip hop was Yellow Magic Orchestra, which created an early electro hip hop track, &quot;Rap Phenomena&quot;, for their 1981 album &quot;BGM&quot;. In turn, the synthpop and electro music of Yellow Magic Orchestra and Ryuichi Sakamoto, and their use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, had a significant influence on early key American hip hop figures such as Afrika Bambaataa and Mantronix.

An important spark for Japanese hip-hop occurred in 1983 when breakdancing appeared in Tokyo through film and live performances even though American hip hop records could previously be heard in Tokyo discos. According to Takagi Kan, a first generation Japanese MC, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tell what was with the rap and the DJing...but with the breakdancing and graffiti art, you could understand it visually. Or rather, it wasn&#x27;t understanding so much as, &#x27;Whoa, that&#x27;s cool&#x27; &quot;[kakkoii]&quot;. With rap and DJing, I couldn&#x27;t imagine what could be cool about it.&quot; Dancing has a visual impact that everyone can understand, when it comes to dance there is not a language barrier. Break dancing represented the foundation for the spread of Japanese hip-hop and served as a medium for globalization.

As in Germany, much of Japan was introduced to hip hop in the fall of 1983 with the movie &quot;Wild Style&quot;. The film is &quot;the classic hip-hop flick, full of great subway shots, breakdancing, freestyle MCing and rare footage of one of the godfathers of hip-hop, Grandmaster Flash, pulling off an awesome scratch-mix set on a pair of ancient turntables.&quot; The popularity of the film led to many of the artists involved in it to make a trip to Japan to promote the film and they even performed in some of the department stores while they were there.

Shortly after, Japanese took up breakdancing in Tokyo&#x27;s Yoyogi Park, where street musicians gather every Sunday to perform. Crazy-A, now the leader of Rock Steady Crew Japan,&quot; was one of the pioneers of break dancing in Yoyogi back in the early 1984&quot;. Crazy-A organizes the annual &quot;B-Boy Park,&quot; which happens every August, and draws a large number of fans and dozens of break dancing groups. This was all considered the Old School Era of rap in Tokyo. There was much of what they called Soul Dancing, which helped the Japanese culture accept the street dance culture.

The rise of DJs was really the next step for the Japanese hip hop scene. Before 1985, there weren&#x27;t very many DJs on the radio, but with the increase in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn&#x27;t going to have the same cache as it would be hard to rap in Japanese.

Street musicians began to breakdance in Yoyogi Park, including DJ Krush who has become a world-renowned DJ after arising from the Yoyogi Park scene. In 1986 an all hip hop club opened in Shibuya. While interest in hip-hop in Japan grew some during the 1980s and early 1990s, the rap scene remained fairly small and rather marginalized. One reason for the rap scene to remain so small and a little bit less popular compared to hip hop is because the Japanese language does &quot;not contain stress accents and sentences must end with one of a few simple verb endings.&quot; Ito Seiko, Chikado Haruo, Tinnie Punx and Takagi Kan were rappers that emerged from Japan at this time, and they proved to be rather successful.

=== 1990s ===

By the early 1990s, major American artists began to tour Japan, and their music would receive Japanese releases.

The years 1994 and 1995 marked the beginning of hip-hop&#x27;s commercial success in Japan. The first hit was Schadaraparr&#x27;s &quot;Kon&#x27;ya wa būgi bakku&quot; (Boogie Back Tonight) by Scha Dara Parr and Ozawa Kenji, followed by East End X Yuri&#x27;s &quot;Da. Yo. Ne.&quot; and &quot;Maicca,&quot; which each sold a million copies. This sudden popularity of J-rap, which was largely characterized as party rap, sparked a debate over &#x27;realness&#x27; and authenticity between commercial and underground hip-hop artists.

Popular brands in Japan during this period also collaborated with multiple hip hop artists. A Bathing Ape (or BAPE) A Japanese clothing company founded by Nigo in 1993. . Artist such as Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, and KAWS have collaborated with BAPE.
An example of an underground attack on mainstream J-Rap is Lamp Eye&#x27;s &quot;Shogen,&quot; in which rapper You the Rock disses the more pop oriented group Dassen Trio. Writer Ian Condry argues that the rappers on this track are closely emulating the traditional macho posturing of rap, citing influences such as Public Enemy and Rakim. Dassen Trio, and other pop rappers, respond to such attacks with the argument that their subject matter is more culturally appropriate and accessible for Japanese fans, and question the standards of &quot;realness&quot; put forth by underground rappers.

Actual Japanese rap lyrics have a tendency to refer to mundane subjects such as food, cell phones, and shopping.

=== 2000s, 2010s and 2020s ===
Since 2000, the hip hop scene in Japan has grown and diversified. Hip-hop style and Japanese rap has been an enormous commercial success in Japan. In a 2003 interview with the BBC, Tokyo record-store owner, Hideaki Tamura noted &quot;Japanese hip-hop really exploded in the last two, three years. I never thought there would be a time when Japanese records could outsell American ones but it&#x27;s happening.&quot; Additionally, a huge number of new scenes have developed. These include “rock rap to hard core gangsta, spoken word/poetry, to conscious, old school, techno rap, antigovernment, pro-marijuana, heavymetal-sampled rap, and so on.”

Tamura points to a shift in Japanese hip hop, when artists began to focus on issues pertinent to Japanese society, versus previous styles and subjects that were copied from US hip hop culture. For Japan, the style of hip hop was much more appealing than topics popular in American hip hop, such as violence. Ian Condry, on the other hand, focuses on an interplay between local and global hip hop within the genba of Japan. For Condry, Japanese hip hop was born out of simultaneous localization and globalization of hip hop culture, rather than a shift between the two binary factors.

==Political aspects==

King Giddra&#x27;s &quot;911&quot; reflects on Ground Zero and its aftermath in two eras: August 1945 and September 11, 2001. It also called for world peace. Groups such as Rhymester tackle issues that are not openly addressed in society. Rhymester member Utamaru talked about the motives for Japanese government support of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

==Influence of African American Culture on Japanese hip hop==
Previous to the inception of hip hop, soul dancing became popularized in Japan in the 1970s. Shows like &#x27;Soul Train&#x27; spread the African-American style of on-going dance that would soon be picked up by varying cultures all over the world. It is this style of dance that laid the foundation for the globalization of African-American culture due to its universal criteria. Anyone can dance to soul music, which is not the case in terms of rapping, b-boying, etc. As movies like &#x27;Flashdance&#x27; (1983) reached the islands, more and more young people began dancing on the street and other public arenas, which added to its cultural integration. Soon, Japanese culture was ready to alter the very structure of their language in order to partake in hip hop.
Hip hop was thought to have originally become popular in Japan because the Japanese people wanted to imitate African-Americans. The Japanese would hear these rapper&#x27;s music spinning in clubs, exposing to them a small, narrow view of American West Coast hip hop. It was not only the music they latched onto, however. They came to love the entire hip hop culture, including the loose-fitting clothes, graffiti writing, and break dancing. Some Japanese hip-hop fans would even go to tanning salons to darken their skin, and style their hair in afros or dreadlocks to imitate the &quot;cool&quot; looks of Africans, although they are ridiculed by others, including other hip-hoppers.

=== Racial themes ===
This style is called &quot;burapan&quot; - &quot;the name given to the fashion sensibilities of all black wannabes.&quot; and is similar to the English term wigger. The term &quot;burapan&quot;, though, has a derogatory history stemming from the WW2 occupation of Japan. Japanese law at the beginning of the American occupation legalised prostitution and created specific brothels to service allied occupation forces such as the Recreation and Amusement Association, in order to stop the rape and sexual assault of local women.

These prostitutes became known as &quot;panpan&quot;, a euphemism used by the American soldiers when hunting for a prostitute. Pan derives from the American company Pan American World Airways and combines with the Japanese word &quot;pan&quot; meaning bread (thus these girls were also euphemistically known as bread girls) The more attractive girls often had to service &quot;white bread&quot; or white soldiers and were known as &quot;yagipan&quot; with &quot;yagi&quot; being the Japanese word for goat, a white hairy animal. Less attractive girls serviced &quot;black bread&quot; or black soldiers and were known as &quot;burapan&quot; with &quot;bura&quot; deriving from the Japanese word burakumin relating to social stigma. Therefore, a &quot;burapan&quot; is literally &quot;a woman who prostitutes herself for black men.&quot;

Although the word has come to describe a trend of dress and culture modeled after Africans, it is inherently problematic because of its origins. The soundtrack of Wild Style was marketed in Japan as a cassette with a book of photos-scenes from the film, neighborhoods, breakers, graffiti, etc. Japan&#x27;s hip hop contributions have been perceived by many to be based more on appearances than anything else.

A subculture of hip-hoppers who subscribe to the &quot;burapan&quot; style are referred to as blackfacers, a reference to the blackface style of makeup used in minstrel acting that began as an imitation or caricaturation of Africans. One Japanese pop group, the Gosperats, has been known to wear blackface makeup during performances, who were influenced by the 80&#x27;s doo wop group Chanels. The appearance of these &quot;Jiggers&quot; has shown a growing popularity with the hip-hop subculture in Japan despite what can be viewed as racial ideological tendencies of the country towards Black people, and all non-Japanese in general. There are roughly 50,000 Africans in Japan; which is approximately .04% of the Japanese population. Although such an insignificant percent of the Japanese population is African, Japanese subculture is very much accepting of African culture. For many rebellious Japanese youth it provides an outlet for &quot;coolness&quot; and a chance to express themselves outside the box. However, some Japanese fans of hip-hop find it embarrassing and ridiculous that these blackface fans do this because they feel like they shouldn&#x27;t change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it can be seen as a racist act, but for many of the young Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit.

Even as Japanese hung Sambo signs throughout the city, they were undeniably attracted to black music and style. Before hip hop, the Japanese had embraced jazz, rock n roll and funk. It is important to note however, despite the seemingly racist tendencies toward Africans and the simultaneous embrace of black culture, the Japanese have a very different construction of racial ideology than the US. Whereas the white versus black dichotomy typifies the racial system in the US, the Japanese construct their identities in terms of nationalism. Rather than identifying strongly with a color, Japanese tradition speaks to a homogeneous society that places foreigners in the &quot;other category.&quot; Because of this context, &quot;jiggers&quot; and the young teens who wear blackface rebel by embracing individual identities that are different from the norm.

=== Blackface ===
People who tan in order to get a darker skin complexion (especially the females, mainly those who are part of the ganguro subculture) are considered blackfacers. These Japanese men and women tend to embrace their assumed skin color and party with black people, especially African soldiers and Africans who have moved to Japan. The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan. Blackface is used as a way to connect with African-Americans and the hegemonic racial structure that exists in the United States. Japan is seen as a homogenous and insular group, and the use of blackface shows that the youth of Japan are not only concerned with Japanese issues, but issues on a global level.

Those partaking in blackface are &quot;ordinary high school and college kids&quot; and they pursue African American &quot;blackness&quot; with great passion. Their dedication to this cultural transformation is evident through their interest in even more underground American hip hop acts such as the Boot Camp Clik. As they appear almost obsessed with all things that are &quot;black&quot;.
It is said that the Buraoan style is on the downswing. Mikako, a fashion analyzer, says that &quot;the &#x27;cool&#x27; that my friend at the nightclub aspired to wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;cool&#x27; for very long&quot;.

Noted in Joe Wood&#x27;s article, &quot;The Yellow Negro&quot;, &quot;Japan in the eighties seemed a lot like America in the fifties.&quot; In other words, the socio-economic conditions for white American middle-class children (white negroes) in the 1950s and their Japanese counterpart (Japanese blackfacers) in the 1980s allowed unprecedented cultural deviance to occur. It is the wealth and prosperity characteristic of these demographic groups at these specific points in time that can lend us understanding to when, why, and how one culture can most fluidly assimilate into another. Ironically, both cultures adopted black cultural practices in the midst of a post-war boom. In the case of Japan, the &#x27;Japanese Miracle&#x27; gave many middle-class families the financial padding necessary for such diverse consumerism.

Rebelling against the conformity and homogeneity of Japanese society, Japanese blackfacers took it a step further by uniquely adapting the physical look of black culture by literally tanning their faces to seem more &#x27;black.&#x27; To Japanese hip-hop fans and to Japanese culture, the hip-hop phenomena severely influenced Japanese youth. Japanese hip hop is just an animation. It mimics only the style of American hip hop, not the meaning.

Some critics of Japanese hip hop believe that it simply follows a long line of black music that ultimately gained popularity through a different ethnic group mimicking the music. The &quot;Elvis Effect&quot; occurs &quot;when white participation in traditionally black avenues of cultural production produces feelings of unease.&quot; It occurs whenever a white person attempts a historically black art-form, is discovered to critical acclaim, and this is what leads to that art-form receiving widespread commercial acceptance. Aside from Elvis Presley, notable examples throughout music history include Dave Brubeck, Eric Clapton, and Eminem. Many critics believe that this concept is relevant to Japanese and other forms of global hip hop. If listeners first discover Hip Hop through a Japanese artist, there is the fear that they will never bother learning about hip hop&#x27;s origins and simply continue to listen to strictly Japanese versions of the genre.

==Japanese hip hop dance scene==
Dancing is an important aspect of the hip-hop culture. Before hip-hop was popular in Japan, there was soul dancing, which provided a foundation for Japanese acceptance of street dance culture. A big break through time for the dance scene in Japan was after the movies &quot;Flashdance,&quot; &quot;Wild Style&quot;, and &quot;Beat Street&quot;. This was only the beginning of the dance explosion in Japan. The New York hip hop scene also had a large impact on the dance influence in Japan. Lalah Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; music video had a large impact on dancers in Japan and started to mold the style into something closer to the NY sophisticated dance style.

This attracted many Japanese people to NY to see this style of dancing for themselves. In addition in 1992 the form of street dancing known as &quot;house&quot; emerged from the influence of music videos as well. It took very well to the culture in Japan and is now well known. Wood discusses in his writing &quot;Yellow Negro&quot; the influence that race plays on the club scene and the type of dancing and music played in Japan depends on the racial composition of its guests. The club scene is a very important scene for the Japanese people to be able to express hip hop in a visual way that stretches across all barriers regardless of language.

==Language==
Initially language was a barrier for hip-hop in Japan. Rappers only rapped in English because it was believed that the differences between English and Japanese would make it impossible to rap in Japanese. Unlike English, the Japanese language ends phrases in auxiliary verbs. Whereas English ends in verbs or nouns, which are extremely common, Japanese rappers were limited by the small number of grammatically correct possibilities for ending a phrase. Japanese also lacks the stresses on certain syllables that provide flow to English rapping. Even traditional Japanese poetry was based on the numbers of syllables present, unlike English poetry, which was based on the stresses in a line. Most Japanese lyrical music was also formulated using textual repetition, not relying on the flow of the words.

The Japanese also have many ways of indicating class distinctions. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving the bridge of the song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow. Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often homonyms were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended. Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.

Rhymes were also added to Japanese hip-hop by altering the basic structure of the language by eliminating the final auxiliary verbs in raps and instead placing key words at the end of lines. Additionally, to make Japanese work in a rhyming setting, the rappers change the language by using slang, derogatory terms, regional variations, gendered variations, and bilingual puns so that &quot;more hip-hop&quot; means the creation of &quot;more Japanese.&quot; Rappers are able to express themselves using mature lyrics and &quot;create&quot; new language that does not inhibit their rhyming. As such, Japanese hip-hop music is often praised for its mature and culturally relevant lyrics.

English phrases were also put at the end of lines where a Japanese word could not be found to fit. This made rhyming in Japanese far easier, both in basic language and in regard to themes like the concept of social responsibility versus emotional needs.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s it was thought &quot;rap&quot; needed definition before rhyme. Rappers like mc Bell and Cake-K explain that rap is talking with rhythm and melody. Mc Bell argues that rap cannot exist without rhyme: &quot;you need words ending with the same sound...three rhymes in a measure is called three-link rhyming.&quot; English is perceived as cool so that Japanese rappers usually add typical phrases such as &#x27;check it out!&#x27;, &#x27;say ho!&#x27;, &#x27;awww shit!&#x27;, and &#x27;Goddamn!&#x27; According to Shuhei Hosokawa, those phrases are incidentally added and &quot;the phonetic quality of black verbal expression is sometimes adopted&quot; as well. He also notes that in Japanese Hip-Hop, the &quot;semantics matter, yet so do phonetics...meaningful wording&quot; is important, as is &quot;playful rhyming&quot;.

==Venues and events==
Genba, also known as the actual site, is the place and space for established and future underground hip-hop artists to gain and maintain recognition. It is here in these venues and night clubs that the artist performs and networks with people from the music industry, the audience, and the media. If the artist is a crowd favorite, the audience cheers or dances and this in a way decides the fate.

Without such &quot;genba&quot; acknowledgments, artists would disappear from the scene. Conversely, the business success of some rappers is not rejected but seen with a touch of envy, especially if they manage to go frequently to nightclubs such as Zeebra to sustain their networks and keep up to date on the latest trends.

Before the turn of the new millennium, &quot;genba&quot; served as a places where Japanese hip hop culture was created and born. In the city of Tokyo, between the youth shopping districts of Shibuya and Harajuku, there was created a &quot;genb&quot;a – a fathering point for youthful fans and performers. Traffic was stopped, and people and artists were able to perform and express themselves outside in this very public arena. This area became known as &quot;Hokouten,&quot; short for &quot;hokousha tengoku&quot;, which means &quot;pedestrian paradise.&quot;

Thumpin&#x27; Camp was one of the most memorable and largest hip hop events that occurred in Japan. July 7, 1996 is an unforgettable day for many rappers, as well as the fans; about four thousand people attended the show. Males were more attracted to this hip hop scene than females; thus, about 80% of the audience was male adolescents. Over thirty rappers, DJs, and break-dancers from the underground scene performed in the show. This event touched many young individuals who were passionate about hip hop. The Thumpin’Camp show left a remarkable memory in the hip hop history in Japan.

Japan boasts a variety of clubs, which, although they are &quot;open to all races...the kind of music played depends on the race of the next largest racial group.&quot; That group, being next largest to the Japanese, who can be found at each of the different clubs. The clubs that only play hip hop and reggae are attended mostly by black people. In the clubs frequented by Japanese people and those that white people attend, there is an even proportion of race and gender. In these clubs, you will generally find equal numbers of Japanese men and women, and a fairly even proportion of racially different men and women.

As aforementioned, genba is agreeably one of the most prominent and core place for hip hop in Japan, there is however a visible shift and spread/increase of Japanese hip hop venues. Among these are clubs, crowds on streets and many more. According to Ian Condry, in his book he outlines the idea and fact that, clubs have become one of the most convenient and top promoting places for Japanese hip hop. Great Djs and turntable-lists use clubs to as venues to not promote other rappers, by that spreading the hip-hop culture, bring and promote new songs and their own hip hop work. Referring to some sources such as, the above named source is a Japanese hip hop forum that also focuses on clubs in Japan. The above source also services proof of Dj and upcoming artists naming places, clubs, Street gatherings of where they are going to be so as to promote their work or any artist they are interested in. The above all in all justifies the view that Japanese Hip hop venues are not just genba but have rather taken and shift or taking a shift into a variety of places such as the ones named above.

==Notable Japanese artists==
KOHH has been mentioned several times as a major influential force to the Japanese hip hop scene in recent years. KOHH has occasionally criticized how small the hip hop scene is in Japan and has tackled major mainstream TVs for its negligence of noticing hip hop. KOHH has also being praised for his smart use of topics like drug use and violence within the Japanese society which are considered controversial in the country. After being featured in &quot;잊지마&quot; (It G Ma), KOHH received an even bigger praise from international audiences who recognized his use of the phrase &#x27;Arigatō&#x27; (&quot;Thank you&quot;) in his verse as the trademark of the hit song and praised the artist whose performance was the one that left the biggest impression on the track. M-flo&#x27;s Taku Takahashi has appointed KOHH as one of the main acts in the Japanese hip hop renaissance. Although KOHH isn&#x27;t actively producing music today, KOHH was a major influence and help in the Japanese hip hop scene. 

One major Japanese hip hop group, Rhymester, has expressed opinions on various global and philosophical issues through their lyrics. Rhymester has put out motivating messages through hip hop, with songs like &quot;B-Boyism&quot; that emphasizes improving oneself, with lyrics such as &quot;I&#x27;m not surrendering this aesthetic flattering no one, I improve myself only the wonderful, useless people get it, and roar, at the edge of the bass.&quot; The group has also written socially critical lyrics, in songs attacking the Japanese government, as well as the United States for invading Iraq. Rhymester is also known for its collaborative work with the Funky Grammar Unit in the 1990s, as well as its participation in hip hop battles.

Another major group of Japanese hip-hop is King Giddra. They are one of the few pioneers of Japanese hip-hop. They began their hip hop careers in 1993 and felt hip-hop was needed in Japan. Group members, Zeebra and K Dub Shine, both of whom had lived in the U.S., were convinced of the necessity for hip-hop to be about issues of social opposition. They used hip-hop to address social issues of the time, such as: the inability of college graduates to find employment and the media overload of advertising sex and violence. They also &quot;challenged youth not only to recognize the difficulties faced by Japanese society but also to speak up about them.&quot; Their first album has been cited as being influential in the development of rapping style in Japanese.

Dabo is one of the first hip hop artists in Japan. He sprung to the scene in the 1990s and has fame all over Japan. He is the first Japanese artist to be signed to Def Jam Japan. He is also disliked for his style of hip hop, which is said to be imitation of African American Hip Hop. Many Japanese musicians feel that artists similar to Dabo are just mimicking what they see in American hip hop and is not unique in any sense.

Hip hop is also an outlet for Japanese minority groups such as Burakumin and Koreans in Japan to express their experiences. Jin Black is a rapper who writes about his life in a Burakumin neighborhood.

One of the propelling factors of the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, Tommy Hilfiger jeans and baseball caps. This macho look is even found on the women. In Tokyo you are most likely to find the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. Shibuya is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop&#x27;s growing presence can be most experienced. Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the Bathing Ape line. Bape has been worn by Pharrell Williams and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available in many of these stores can be very expensive. Hip hop fashion is now also popular in the suburbs – although some people are only following fashion trends and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop&#x27;s presence can definitely be seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.

Nujabes (Jun Seba) was another heavy influence on the evolution of hip-hop in Japan. While not exactly a rapper himself, he lived as a record producer, audio engineer, DJ,arranger, and composer. He acted a trailblazer in both Jazz Rap and Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity). Shing02, was a frequent collaborator on the &quot;luv(sic)&quot; hexology.

==Japanese influence on current hip-hop==
Japanese Denim is very popular amongst modern hip-hop culture. From Evisu to Red Monkey which are notable by many American hip-hop artists, show the spread of Japanese culture in to hip-hop.

Japanese art has been an influence on hip hop culture as well. Takashi Murakami paints Japanese cultural objects and icons repetitiously and markets them on all sorts of products including keychains, mouse pads, T-shirts and Louis Vuitton handbags. He is responsible for Kanye West&#x27;s Graduation and Kids See Ghosts album covers.

<doc id="148862" wikidata="Q1329328" url="?curid=148862" title="Dragon Ash">
<text>is a Japanese rap rock group founded in 1996 by Kenji &quot;KJ&quot; Furuya and Makoto Sakurai. They were one of the first groups to popularize hip hop in Japan. Dragon Ash is a member of Mob Squad, which is an affiliation with the bands Source and Endive. Dragon Ash uses the French fleur-de-lis as their band logo/symbol.

==History==
Dragon Ash started out as a punk rock group. Lead singer and guitarist Kenji Furuya, son of actor Ikko Furuya, met drummer Makoto Sakurai when they were junior high students in a Tokyo suburb, and the two started playing together. Though temporarily sidetracked into following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Furuya gave up the few acting gigs that he was getting on TV dramas to concentrate on music in high school. In 1996, they took on bass player Ikuzo Baba, ten years their senior. The group debuted in 1997 with two EPs at the beginning of the year, &quot;The Day Dragged On&quot; and &quot;Public Garden&quot;, influenced by Nirvana. By the end of the year and time of their release, &quot;Mustang!&quot;, the group had progressed to a blend of various pop and rock influences.

Through 1998 their popularity increased, and by the time of &quot;Buzz Songs&quot;, their sound had solidified to rap rock, helped with the mixing skills of DJ Bots, who occasionally appeared on some songs. Two singles – &quot;Let Yourself Go, Let Myself Go&quot; and &quot;Grateful Days,&quot; the latter featuring hardcore rapper Zeebra and soulstress ACO – sold so well that they topped the Japanese single and album Oricon charts; also simultaneously, usually reserved for pop music.

Their fourth single, &quot;Let Yourself Go, Let Myself Go&quot;, reached number 7 on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart, and eventually climbed to number 4, selling a total of 640,000 copies. The band simultaneously released their fifth and sixth singles, &quot;Grateful Days&quot; and &quot;I Love Hip Hop&quot;, which debuted at number 3 and number 4, respectively. When these two singles debuted, &quot;Let Yourself Go, Let Myself Go&quot; had not yet dropped off the top 10 chart, giving Dragon Ash three top 10 singles at the same time.

The band finally reached the peak of their success when they released their third album, &quot;Viva la Revolution&quot;, in July 1999 and it hit number 1 on its debut week. The album has sold in excess of 2,000,000 copies.

During 1999, Dragon Ash had become a four-piece, with DJ Bots essential to the mix. In 2000, Dragon Ash undertook the Total Music Communication Tour, touring Japan with a lineup that included other rising rock acts, such as Missile Girl Scout, Penpals, and Skebou Kings. Meanwhile, Furuya and DJ Bots formed a duo of sorts, writing and producing songs for acts such as Sugar Soul under the name Steady &amp; Co. Likewise, Baba and Sakurai sidelined as a remixing unit called Motor Headphone, popping up on various compilations. The full band released &quot;Lily of da Valley&quot; in 2001.

Dragon Ash collaborated with the hip hop group Rappagariya on &quot;Deep Impact&quot; in 2000. In 2003 the group expanded to include its full current roster of members, bringing in Hiroki, Atsushi, and Dri-V. In 2007 they celebrated their 10th anniversary by simultaneously releasing two best-of albums, &quot;The Best of Dragon Ash with Changes Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;The Best of Dragon Ash with Changes Vol. 2&quot;. Both albums hit number 1 upon their debut.

Bandleader Kenji Furuya released his first solo album &quot;Everything Becomes The Music&quot; from Victor Entertainment in mid-2015. Following his solo debut song &quot;Swallow Dive&quot; in March 2015, anime director Kenji Kamiyama directed a music video for &quot;Stairway&quot;, the leading track from the album.

Dragon Ash covered &quot;Rocket Dive&quot; for the June 6, 2018 hide tribute album &quot;Tribute Impulse&quot;.

<text>, commonly referred to by their contracted nickname , are a Japanese pop rock band formed in 1989. Consisting of Kazutoshi Sakurai, Kenichi Tahara, Keisuke Nakagawa, and Hideya Suzuki, they made their major label debut in 1992. They are one of the best selling artists in Japan and one of the most successful Japanese rock artists, having sold over 75 million records and creating the in the mid-1990s in Japan. They held the record for the highest first week sales of a single in Japan for 15 years, with 1.2 million copies of their 10th single , have 30 consecutive number 1 singles, replaced Glay as the all-male band (with 3 or more members) to have the most number 1 albums on the Oricon charts, and won the Japan Record Award in 1994 for &quot;Innocent World&quot; and in 2004 for &quot;Sign&quot;. As of 2012, Mr. Children has published fifteen original studio albums and 34 physical singles, along with five compilations, a live album, and fifteen home video releases.

The band&#x27;s music is mainly composed and written by lead singer Sakurai, with the exception of the Suzuki-penned songs &quot;Asia&quot; and &quot;#2601&quot; from the albums &quot;Atomic Heart&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;, and occasional collaborative song writing with producer Takeshi Kobayashi.

In 2012 they celebrated their 20th debut anniversary by releasing dual best album titled &quot;Mr. Children 2001–2005 ＜micro＞&quot; and &quot;Mr. Children 2005–2010 ＜macro＞&quot;. Both albums dominated the best-selling album category on the 2012 Oricon yearly chart, selling over 2.5 million copies. Mr.Children has become the third artists who achieved top 2 spots on the yearly album ranking, and this is the first time in 14 years for any artist to achieve this. Moreover, &quot;[(An Imitation) Blood Orange]&quot;, an album of new material released in November 2012, debuted No.1 on the Oricon Chart—at the end of the year, all three albums released that year were in the Top 10 best selling albums of 2012.

In 2015, Mr. Children was named No.1 Concert Mobilization Power Ranking based on the overall number of people who attended their performances during 2015 in Japan, mobilizing 1,119,000 fans (36 concerts).

==History==
===1987–1992===
The group&#x27;s members first met in the year of 1987, when Sakurai, Tahara and Nakagawa were in &quot;The Walls&quot;, which was originally influenced by the band Echoes. The frontman of Echoes, Jinsei Tsuji, was a political activist, and because of this, The Walls too became a political band. Drummer Hideya Suzuki was not an original member of The Walls. When the original drummer departed, the band recruited Suzuki, who went to the same school as the other members. In late 1988, The Walls disintegrated, while the remaining members formed Mr. Children in early 1989. The name of Mr. Children supposedly came about during a talk at a dinner where the group thought the word &quot;children&quot; had a nice ring to it, but because they were no longer children themselves, they decided to add Mr. in front of it. They credit this change as a new way they started to look at the group.

After changing their name and overall sound, Mr. Children auditioned at a music club called La Mama, failing to pass the first time, but passing a second audition to play at the club. After playing in the club, they were asked to try and debut as professionals. Mr. Children sent out five demo tapes; all failed to generate record label interest, and the group took a three-month hiatus in 1991. Hideya Suzuki worked as a receptionist at an economy hotel, while Kazutoshi Sakurai worked with his father who owned a construction company. When they returned, the group created a sixth demo tape and caught the attention of Toy&#x27;s Factory. The label signed the group and had them play as the opening act for the rock group Jun Sky Walkers. It was also during this time that they were introduced to their long-time friend and producer Takeshi Kobayashi. Kobayashi was already known in the music industry as a music composer for Keisuke Kuwata of Southern All Stars and Kyōko Koizumi.

===1992–2000===
On May 10, 1992, Mr. Children&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Everything&quot;, was released and represented the long journey they took to get to this point. Three months later their first single was released on August 21, 1992. After the release of the single the group held two tours for the album, both held between September 23, 1992 and November 5 of the same year, the &#x27;92 Everything Tour comprising ten and the &#x27;92 Your Everything Tour consisting of twelve performances. To cap off the year and lead them into the next, Mr. Children released their second album, &quot;Kind of Love&quot; and their second single on December 1, 1992. &quot;Dakishimetai&quot; was later used as an insert song for the Japanese drama . Shortly after, a new tour called &#x27;92–93 Kind of Love Tour started and lasted from December 7, 1992 till January 25, 1993.

In 1993, with the completion of the band&#x27;s tour they began work on for their third album. The first single of the new year to be released was &quot;Replay&quot;, released on July 1, 1993 and used in commercials. On September 9, 1993 their third album &quot;Versus&quot; was released, but failed to bring the group into the spotlight. They continued on and held a new tour. The &#x27;93 Versus Tour was held from September 23 until November 5 and had the band holding nine performances. Shortly after, &quot;Cross Road&quot; was released on November 10, 1993, which was used to promote the Japanese drama . The single was not a hit, but through word of mouth &quot;Cross Road&quot; gained popularity and after 22 weeks sold over a million copies and later, though released in 1993, managed to become the fifteenth best selling single in Oricon&#x27;s 1994 yearly charts. Sakurai confessed years later as to not liking his works up to this point. According to him:

On June 1, 1994 a new single called &quot;Innocent World&quot; was released and used a promotional song for the soft drink . The single solidified the groups popularity with its sales, managing to sell 1,935,830 copies and becoming the No. 1 selling single in Oricon&#x27;s 1994 yearly charts. Afterwards work began on their fourth original album &quot;Atomic Heart&quot;. The album was released on September 1, 1994 and became the band&#x27;s highest selling album to date. Due to the huge success the band received from the album and &quot;Innocent World&quot; single, the groups popularity built up creating the in Japan.

The band also had Takeshi Kobayashi produce two new tours for them. The first tour, named after the &quot;Innocent World&quot; single was held from September 18 to December 18. The band also released their sixth single &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; on November 10, 1994 which was used as the theme song to the Japanese drama . The song was written while the group was on tour, was later voted in 2006 as fans No. 1 all-time favorite song on Music Station, and is currently the third highest selling drama tie-in single in Japan. The next single, was released on December 12, 1994, though originally intended to be the B-side of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. To end the year, &quot;Innocent World&quot; won the Song of the Year award at the 36th annual Japan Record Awards.

In 1995, the second half of the Atomic Heart tour started, lasting from January 1 to February 2. Mr. Children also became involved in charity work, doing a collaboration song with Keisuke Kuwata of Southern All Stars. The single was used as the theme song for the Act Against AIDS campaign, was produced by Mr. Children and written by Kuwata. To promote the single and the campaign, they held a one-month tour from April 18 until May 14, entitled , where the group did cover songs of many English speaking artists such as The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. During the tour the group was also filming a documentary/concert movie called &quot;Es ~Mr. Children in Film~&quot;. It was released in theaters on June 6, 1995, preceded by the group&#x27;s eight single &quot;Es (Theme of Es)&quot; on May 10, to promote the movie. Two months later the group held an open air tour titled from July 16 to September 10, during which the ninth single, was released on August 10.

On February 6, 1996 Mr. Children&#x27;s tenth single was released, to promote the Japanese drama and also for Daio Paper&#x27;s commercial. The single went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest first week selling single of all time (which was later broken by idol group AKB48) and is currently Japan&#x27;s eighth highest selling drama tie-in single. The success of the single was also a surprise for Sakurai, who admitted to spending very little time writing the song. Two months later, on April 5, 1996 the group&#x27;s eleventh single was released, followed by their fifth original album on June 24 and their twelfth single , on August 8. To close the year, the Regress or Progress Tour started and lasted from August 24, 1996 to March 28, 1997. The group visited 14 cities and held 55 concerts.

Mr. Children&#x27;s 13th single, &quot;Everything (It&#x27;s You)&quot;, was released on February 5, 1997, with the title track used as the theme song to the Japanese drama . A month later, on March 5 &quot;Bolero&quot;, Mr. Children&#x27;s sixth album was released. Soon after, rumors started of the group disbanding. Sakurai&#x27;s reply: &quot;The band will dissolve only when we have no more talent and have relationship problems with each other.&quot; Yet the group then decided to take some time off. Nakagawa and Suzuki start a side project band called &quot;Hayashi Hideo&quot;, and joined by Kenji Fujii from My Little Lover and Sawao Yamanaka from The Pillows, went on a club tour.

On February 11, 1998, they released their 14th single , theme song to the Japanese drama . The group was still on hiatus during this time and made no live performances to promote the single and did not appear in the music video for the song. Finally on October 21, 1998, Mr. Children officially re-grouped and released their 15th single, with the Japanese drama using it as their theme song. The song remains a public favorite in voting polls, Oricon citing its inspirational lyrics as the reason.

On January 13, 1999, , their 16th single, was released, followed by their seventh album, &quot;Discovery&quot;, on February 3, 1999. Sakurai compared his approach to the songwriting for the record to surfing:

Eleven days later they began the Discovery Tour &#x27;99, from February 14 to July 12, where the group visited 16 cities and held 42 shows. During the tour, Mr. Children released their 17th single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; on May 12, which was used in &quot;Sea Breeze&quot; commercials. Though originally released on the &quot;Discovery&quot; album, the song was re-released as a single with a lighter beat. The single was not a success and became Mr. Children&#x27;s lowest selling single since &quot;Cross Road&quot;. During the Discovery Tour &#x27;99, an idea for a live album was brought up. It was released as a 500,000 copy limited edition on September 8, 1999 and called &quot;1/42&quot; (referring to one of the 42 shows in the tour). Most of the tracks were recorded on June 16, 1999 at the Makomanai ice arena, while the bonus track &quot;Dakishimetai&quot; was recorded at the Okinawa Ginowan-Shi seaside park.

At the beginning of a new century , released on January 13, 2000 became the group&#x27;s 18th single. While &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; failed to be a success, &quot;Kuchibue&quot; proved to be a hit selling 724,070 copies. On August 9, 2000, their 19th single &quot;Not Found&quot; was also used as the theme song to the Japanese drama , followed a month later by their 9th original album &quot;Q&quot; on September 27, 2000. The band went to New York to record this album, where they re-recorded some of their old indie material and for the first time, producer Takeshi Kobayashi performed with the band on a recording. The cover for the album was shot bought Size, Inc. at the Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. The album was not a favorite amongst fans for various reasons and became their first album since &quot;Atomic Heart&quot; to not sell over one million copies. ‘Concert tour Q’ started, visiting 13 cities and holding 35 concerts between October 15, 2000 and February 24, 2001.

===2001–2006===
In 2001, Mr. Children continued their Q tour, followed by dual &quot;Best Of&quot; albums. Titled &quot;Mr. Children 1992–1995&quot; and &quot;Mr. Children 1996–2000&quot;, they were both released on July 11, 2001. Both albums went on to sell a combined total of 4,034,785 copies. According to an interview done with MTV Japan Sakurai stated the best of albums weren&#x27;t something they had planned on doing yet. During this time, the group was finishing up work for their new upcoming album and had planned to start promoting singles on it. However it was decided that a best of album was needed and so they were released. Four days following the dual album release, the group launched the ‘Popsaurus’ tour, visiting 10 cities and playing 15 shows, lasting from July 15, 2001 all the way through September 25, 2001. A month into the tour their 20th single was released and used to promote the Wonda Canned Coffee by Asahi Soft Drinks. Two months after the Popsaurus tour ended, &quot;Youthful Days&quot; was released. Released on November 7, 2001, it was their 21st single and was an insert song for the Japanese drama Antique Bakery. &quot;Youthful Days&quot; debuted at number-one on Japanese Oricon&#x27;s Charts in its first week at retail (ahead of Mr. Moonlight (Ai no Big Band) by Morning Musume, from album 4th Ikimashoi!), and It ended up being their best selling single for the year. The b-side for the single, &quot;Drawing&quot;, originally had no commercial tie-in, but two years later was used as the theme song to the 2003 Japanese drama , Starring former Shibugakitai member Masahiro Motoki.

Mr. Children released their 22nd single on New Year&#x27;s Day of 2002 (January 1), which was used as a show song in the Japanese drama Antique Bakery. Four months later their tenth original album &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot; was released on May 10, the groups&#x27; tenth anniversary. The release of the album on their 10th anniversary was not something that had originally intended. As the group was wrapping up recording, Sakurai asked if the album could be released in the spring time. While the group and their management was trying to think of how to promote an album in the spring time, they came up with releasing the album on their 10th anniversary. A new tour, titled &quot;Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World&quot; was set to begin later that year. The previous single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; from the &quot;Discovery&quot; album was selected to be used as an official theme for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in Japan and South Korea. On May 24, 2002 Mr. Children attended the first ever MTV Video Music Awards Japan and topped the awards show by winning &#x27;Video of the Year&#x27; for the song &quot;Kimi ga suki&quot;, the band also nominated in Best Group Category but losing to Backstreet Boys. Two months after the release of the new album, Mr.Children&#x27;s 23rd single &quot;Any&quot;, was released on July 11, 2002 and used to promote NTT DoCoMo Group &quot;10th Anniversary&quot;. The group was not able to properly promote the single. As preparations for the new tour were beginning and promotion for the new single were being done, lead singer Sakurai was hospitalized on July 21, 2002, after a blockage in his cerebellum was detected. The &quot;Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World&quot; was canceled and all group activities were put on a temporary hiatus. While recovering, Sakurai wrote a song called &quot;Hero&quot;, that was inspired by his hospitalization. The song was released as the group&#x27;s 24th single on December 11, 2002 and was used in NTT DoCoMo Group &quot;10th Anniversary&quot; commercial. The first press version of the single included a DVD where, in addition to a &quot;&#x27;Mr. Children 2002 documentary -Hero-&quot; that was aired, the singer talked about his hospitalization and inspiration for the song. On November 15, 2002 Mr.Children&#x27;s website announced the band&#x27;s return to the stage for a &quot;stew of home pride&quot; with a one night only live, December 21, 2002 the group returned to the stage for a single concert, later released on DVD, titled &quot;Wonederful World on Dec. 21&quot;.

The group remained quiet for most of 2003. Sakurai helped to launch Artists&#x27; Power Bank (AP Bank), a non-profit environmental financial institution, in June. Sakamoto Ryuichi, a well known composer, came up with the initial idea to build a wind-power plant. With the help of Sakurai and music producer Takeshi Kobayashi, their goal later became to invest in environmentally friendly projects, such as renewable energy, and as of 2007, participated in other social issues such as helping the victims of a Chuetsu offshore earthquake in Niigata Prefecture on July 16, 2007. Near the end of the year, Mr. Children re-grouped and released their 25th single . It became their first double a-side single with &quot;Tenohira&quot; receiving no commercial tie-in, and &quot;Kurumi&quot; used to promote . The single was a hit and became Mr.Children&#x27;s best selling single since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Youthful Days&quot; single.

In 2004, Sakurai started a solo project titled Bank Band, which became a spin-off of AP Bank. As Bank Band, Sakurai released a first album, titled , which contained covers of two Mr. Children songs, &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Yasashii Uta&quot;. Mr. Children released their eleventh album on April 4, 2004, titled , which came with a documentary DVD showing the group working and talking about the concept behind the album. To help promote the album, Mr. Children used the song in &#x27;Nissin Cup Noodle – NO Border&#x27; commercials and as the &#x27;News 23&#x27; theme song. According to Sakurai, is

In the following month, they released their 26th single, &quot;Sign&quot;, on May 26, which was used as the theme song to the Japanese drama &quot;Orange Days&quot; and went on to win the Song of the Year award at the 46th annual Japan Record Awards ten years after their win for &#x27;Innocent World&#x27;.

Most of the 2005 was spent working on a new album. As a solo act, Kazutoshi Sakurai appeared at Golden Circle vol.7 on February 28, 2005. Finally on June 29, 2005 the group released their 27th single . The single became a monster hit selling 569,000 copies its first week, and ending with 925,632 copies sold.

Even though it was released as a single, it was classified as an album by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. A month later the group attended Kazutoshi Sakurai&#x27;s 3-day festival &#x27;ap bank fes’ 05&#x27; from July 16, 2005 through July 18, 2005, followed by &#x27;SETSTOCK &#x27;05&#x27; at Kokuei bihoku kyuuryou park on July 23, 2005 and &#x27;Higher Ground 2005&#x27; at Umi no nakamichi kaihinkouen outdoor theater on July 30, 2005. Three months later on September 21, 2005, &quot;I Love U (I♥U)&quot;, Mr.Children’s 12th original album, was released. Two months later Dome Tour 2005 &#x27;I Love U&#x27; began, running from November 12, 2005 through December 27, 2005 and were only the fourth artist in Japanese history to play at the Osaka, Tokyo, Sapporo, Nagoya and Fukuoka dome&#x27;s.

The first single for 2006, was their 28th single released on July 5, 2006 and used as the promotion song for Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Tobira wo akeyou&quot; commercial and as the theme song to NTV&#x27;s 2006 FIFA World Cup broadcasting. Due to the groups involvement with ap bank fes. &#x27;06, there were no magazine or radio promotions, and only 3 live performances were done to promote the single. However the commercial tie-in&#x27;s for the single proved to be a success and &quot;Houkiboshi&quot; was voted No. 3 as the favorite commercial song for 2006 and voted as the favorite winter song heard in the summer. Ten days following the release of &#x27;Houkiboshi&#x27;, Mr.Children participated in the 3 day festival, ap bank fes &#x27;06, where they performed &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Strange Chameleon&quot;, &quot;Owarinaki tabi&quot;, and &quot;Hokiboshi&quot;. One month later Mr.Children were special guests at The Mujintou fes. 2006 and performed &quot;Mirai&quot;, &quot;Innocent world&quot;, &quot;Hokorobi&quot;, &quot;Sign&quot;, &quot;Owarinaki tabi&quot;, &quot;Worlds end&quot;, and &quot;Houkiboshi&quot;. Shortly after Mr.Children announced a joint tour with fellow Japanese rockers the pillows, known as &#x27;Mr.Children &amp; the pillows new big bang tour ~This is Hybrid Innocent~&#x27;. The tour was held from September 26, 2006 through October 11, 2006. On November 15, 2006, the group released their 29th single , which was used as the theme song , by NTV, a controversial television drama about underage pregnancy. Kazutoshi Sakurai had begun writing the song in February 2006 and finished writing in March 2006. and shot the promotional video in September 2006. One of the b-sides of single was a re-recording of Mr. Children&#x27;s 2003 song &quot;Kurumi&quot;, used as a theme song in the movie .

=== 2007-present ===
On January 24, 2007, the band released their 30th single, , which was used as the theme song for the movie , and while only a limited edition single, brought the group to 26 consecutive No. 1 singles. Shortly after, the 13th original album, &quot;Home&quot;, was released on March 14, which would become the group&#x27;s first in almost 13 years to chart at No. 1 for two consecutive weeks. It was also the first Japanese album in 2007 to sell more than a million copies. Work on the record had come to a standstill, during the recording of the song &quot;Houkiboshi&quot;, due to a dispute among the group over &quot;Home&quot;&#x27;s direction. Producer Kobayashi suggested to make an album that &quot;pays attention to the world with a message&quot;.

The album reflected a more personal touch from the group, with talking about the 9/11 attacks in New York City, and , being inspired by Kazutoshi Sakurai&#x27;s father who had been sick. The title of the album, &quot;Home&quot;, was originally going to be titled &quot;Home Made&quot; or &quot;Home Ground&quot;, because the group wanted the album to have the meaning that it was made by hand. However, they choose to name it just &quot;Home&quot; because they felt that by adding another word it would be limiting the idea in mind. Three days after the release of &quot;Home&quot;, Mr. Children won the awards Best Video of the Year and Best Group Video for the single &quot;Shirushi&quot; at the Space Shower Music Video Awards &#x27;07. For the album, the group held two promotional tours. The first half called Mr. Children Home Tour 2007, started on May 4 and lasted until June 23. During the tour, a new compilation album titled &quot;B-Side&quot; was released on May 10, which was also the group&#x27;s 15th anniversary. The release of a B-side compilation had been suggested by singer Sakurai while working on &quot;Home&quot;:

He injured his left index finger, which required four stitches and the following two concerts had to be rescheduled. Publicity for the tour reached a high, when they performed in front of a sold-out tour for 15,000 fans at Yokohama Arena on June 7, 2007 and reignited speculation that the Mr.Children phenomenon was alive and well. A second half of the tour to promote &#x27;Home&#x27;, titled Mr.Children Home Tour 2007 -In the Field- took place from August 4 to September 30. Both tours ended up being a big success for the group, and became the most attended Japan tour in 2007 at 550,000 fans.

==Charitable and other activities==
Since their official debut, Mr.Children has engaged in social and charitable causes. As a group they participated in the live concert for Act Against AIDS on December 1, 1994 and again on December 1, 1995. The goal of live was to raise awareness about AIDS. The proceeds from the event were donated to support children living with HIV. The live was followed up by a collaboration Act Against AIDS charity single with fellow Japanese artist Kuwata Keisuke titled ‘Kiseki no hoshi’ and released on January 23, 1995. On April 25, 2001 Kazutoshi Sakurai also participated in the recording of Zero Landmine, a single created to promote awareness of the problem of landmines and promote a ban on landmines. In addition the group has also participated in Kazutoshi Sakura&#x27;s solo project, AP bank. AP Bank, a nonprofit lending group, carries the goal of tackling environmental problems by financing environmentally friendly projects such as renewable energy, in addition to holding yearly festivals to raise money to fund additional projects. Since its inception in 2005, Mr.Children has been actively participating in the festivals, with an announcement in 2008 that the group will now work more closely with its cause by participating during the entire three-day festival duration in addition to further details to be announced at a later time.

Members Kazutoshi Sakurai and Kenichi Tahara joined together to create Acid Test for the concert ‘Dream Power John Lennon Super live broadcasting’ on October 9, 2001. The live was part of Yoko Ono’s Dream Power and educational platform where artists came together to hold a charity concert to raise money for school construction funds for children in Africa and Asia. The John Lennon song covered by Acid Test during the live, &quot;Mother&quot;, was later recorded and released on a tribute album &quot;Happy Birthday, John&quot;, and released on September 30, 2005.

In addition to social causes, Mr.Children&#x27;s music has been used as background music for numerous television advertisements, television programs, television drama&#x27;s, and motion pictures. Examples of the group&#x27;s commercial tie-ins include &quot;and I love you&quot;, &quot;Bokura no Oto&quot;, and &quot;Tagatame&quot; for Nissin Cup Noodle no Border commercials, &#x27;Gift&#x27; for the 2008 Beijing Olympics on NHK, and &quot;Tabidachi no uta&quot; for the 2007 Japanese movie . As a group, Mr.Children have not endorsed products by physically appearing in television commercials or printed media advertisements. One of the methods used to help promote the group is through &quot;Brajacket&quot;&#x27;s, a dust jacket for books, which are available at stands in bookstores for free. The &quot;Brajacket&quot; serve as free advertising for various products from ice cream to movies and musicals. Mr. Children have used this method to promote singles and albums; for example and &quot;I Love U (I♥U)&quot;.

The fan club, which started in 1994, was kept relatively secretive at first, as the group has never made any mention of it on their official website. In 2006, for the release of the group&#x27;s 29th single &quot;Shirushi&quot;, the official website was revamped and with it information about the fan club was finally added. Just like before however, the fan club can only be joined by mail and requires an admission fee of 3,500 yen, with yearly re-applications for membership.

<text>Uirō (Japanese: , , ), also known as , is a traditional Japanese steamed cake made of glutinous rice flour and sugar. It is chewy, similar to &quot;mochi&quot;, and subtly sweet. Flavors include azuki bean paste, green tea (matcha), &quot;yuzu&quot;, strawberry and chestnut. Nagoya is particularly famous for its &quot;uirō&quot;, and there are other regional versions, notably in Yamaguchi and Odawara, although Odawara&#x27;s &quot;uirō&quot; is better known as a medicine. It can be purchased in traditional Japanese confectionery shops throughout Japan.

&quot;Uirō&quot; was originally the name of a medicine in the Muromachi period (1336–1573). References to &quot;uirō&quot; as a confection first appear in the &quot;Wa-Kan Sansai Zue&quot;, Ryōan Terajima&#x27;s massive Edo-period dictionary published in 1712.

<doc id="148868" wikidata="Q1197407" url="?curid=148868" title="Yomiuri Giants">
<text>The are a Japanese professional baseball team competing in Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League. Based in Bunkyo, Tokyo, they are one of two professional baseball teams based in Tokyo, the other being the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. They have played their home games at Tokyo Dome since its opening in 1988. The team&#x27;s owner is Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, Japan&#x27;s largest media conglomerate which also owns two newspapers (including the eponymous &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;) and the Nippon Television Network (which includes flagship Nippon TV).

The Giants are the oldest professional sports team in Japan. They are also by far the most successful, having won 22 Japan Series titles and an additional nine in the era of NPB&#x27;s forerunner, the Japanese Baseball League. Their main rivalry is with the Hanshin Tigers, a team especially popular in the Kansai region. The Yomiuri Giants are regarded as &quot;The New York Yankees of Japan&quot; due to their widespread popularity, past dominance of the league, and polarizing effect on fans. (Baseball fans who are indifferent about teams other than their local team often have an intense dislike for the Giants; on the other hand, the Giants have a large fan base even in cities that have a team of their own.)

The English-language press occasionally calls the team the Tokyo Giants, but that name has not been in use in Japan for decades. (Lefty O&#x27;Doul, a former Major League Baseball player, named the team &quot;Tokyo Giants&quot; in the mid-1930s.) Instead, the team is officially known by the name of its corporate owner, just like the Hanshin Tigers and Orix Buffaloes. The team is often referred by fans and in news headlines and tables simply as &quot;Kyojin&quot; (巨人, the Japanese word for &quot;giant(s)&quot;), instead of the usual corporate owner&#x27;s name or the English nickname.

The Yomiuri Giants name and uniforms were based on the New York (now San Francisco) Giants. The team&#x27;s colors (orange and black) are the same colors worn by the National League&#x27;s Giants (both then as now in both New York and San Francisco). The stylized lettering on the team&#x27;s jerseys and caps is similar to the fancy lettering used by the Giants when they played in New York in the 1930s, although during the 1970s the Yomiuri Giants modernized their lettering to follow the style worn by the San Francisco Giants.

== Franchise history ==

=== Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club ===
The team began in 1934 as , a team of all-stars organized by media mogul Matsutarō Shōriki that toured the United States and matched up against an American all-star team that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer. While prior Japanese all-star contingents had disbanded, Shōriki went pro with this group, playing in an independent league. 

In 1935, the team traveled to the United States and faced off against college and minor league teams, ultimately playing 109 games in 128 days (including 34 games on 17 days as doubleheaders) across the country. The tour ended with a record of 75 wins, 33 losses, and 1 draw.

When they faced off against the San Francisco Seals, the manager of the Seals, Lefty O&#x27;Doul, stated the team needed a promotional name, as just the team being named &quot;Tokyo Dai Nippon Baseball Club&quot; wouldn&#x27;t mean anything of note to Americans, and because the tour was heavily funded with ticket sales. He suggested that since Tokyo was the New York of Japan, they should emulate one of the two named MLB teams in New York; either the Yankees or the Giants (New York&#x27;s third team, which would eventually be called the Dodgers, lacked an official nickname at the time). As &quot;Yankees&quot; was immediately out of the question, due to it being an American name, O&#x27;Doul suggested the name &quot;Giants&quot;, also thanks to the fact that coincidentally, O&#x27;Doul was formerly of the Giants himself, and the team adopted the Tokyo Giants moniker mid-tour.

However, the Giants name would face minor challenging from Shōriki himself after the tour, as he wanted to name the team the Tokyo Golden Kites, after the Order of the Golden Kite, a military order of the Empire of Japan (which would be abolished in 1947 following World War II). The players, however, would hold firm, and Shōriki would retain the Giants name.

=== Tokyo Kyojin ===
In 1936, with the formation of the Japanese Baseball League, the team changed its name to the Tokyo Kyojin, often called the Tokyo Giants in non-Japanese sources. It won eight league championships under that name from 1936 to 1943, including six championships in a row from 1938 to 1943.

Russian-born pitcher Victor Starffin, nicknamed &quot;the blue-eyed Japanese&quot;, starred for the team until 1944. One of the league&#x27;s premier pitchers, he won two MVP awards and a Best Nine award, and won at least 26 games in six different years, winning a league-record 42 games in 1939. He followed his record-setting performance with another 38 wins in 1940. Pitcher Eiji Sawamura co-starred with Starffin on the Kyojin. He pitched the first no-hitter in Japanese pro baseball, on September 25, 1936, as well as two others. In 1937, he went 33–10 with a 1.38 earned run average. From 1937 to 1943 Sawamura had a record of 63–22, 554 strikeouts, and a 1.74 ERA. Sawamura was conscripted into the Japanese Imperial Army in 1938, 1941, and 1943; he returned to play for the Giants between deployments, though injuries and time away hindered his form and velocity. He was released by the team in 1943, then killed in battle when his ship was torpedoed near the end of the Second World War.

Outfielder Haruyasu Nakajima was a featured hitter during the franchise&#x27;s first decade-and-a-half, and as player-manager led the Kyojin to a championship in 1941. Tetsuharu Kawakami was a team fixture from 1938 to 1958, winning the batting title five times, two home run crowns, three RBI titles, and had six titles for the most hits in a season. He was the first player in Japanese pro baseball to achieve 2,000 hits and was named the league&#x27;s MVP three times. Leadoff man Shosei Go starred for the team from 1937 to 1943, winning league MVP in 1943. Only and , he was nicknamed &quot;The Human Locomotive&quot; due to his speed.

Pitcher Hideo Fujimoto (also known as Hideo Nakagami) pitched for the team for 12 seasons from 1942 to 1955. He holds the Japanese records for lowest career ERA (1.90) and seasonal ERA (0.73 in 1943), as well as best all-time winning percentage (.697). He threw two career no-hitters, including the first perfect game in Japanese professional baseball. In addition, he served as the Giants&#x27; player-manager in 1944 (there was no 1945 season) and part of 1946.

=== Yomiuri Giants ===
In 1947 the team became the Yomiuri Giants, winning the final JBL championship in 1949 (again under player-manager Haruyasu Nakajima). From 1938 to 1987 the Giants played at Korakuen Stadium, moving to their current home the Tokyo Dome in 1988.

In 1950, the Giants were one of the founding members of Nippon Professional Baseball, joining the Central League.

Slugger Noboru Aota starred for the Giants from 1948 to 1952, winning the home run championship twice, and hitting a home run in the 1951 Japan Series, when the Giants defeated the Nankai Hawks 4 games to 2 for their first NPB championship. The Giants would also win Japan Series championships in 1952, 1953, and 1955, all over the Nankai Hawks. The team was the Central League champion every year from 1955 to 1959, winning the Japan Series championship in 1955, but they lost four consecutive Japan Series thereafter, with the first three losses coming against the Nishitetsu Lions, and then the Hawks finally got their revenge to close out the decade.

World career home run record holder Sadaharu Oh starred for the Giants from 1959 to 1980, and fellow Hall of Famer Shigeo Nagashima played for the team from 1958 to 1974. The Giants lineup, consisting of Oh batting third and Nagashima batting fourth, was nicknamed the &quot;ON Hou&quot;, (&quot;Oh-Nagashima Cannon&quot;) as the two players emerged as the best hitters in the league. Now the team&#x27;s manager, Tetsuharu Kawakami led the Giants to nine consecutive Japan Series championships from 1965 to 1973, and Oh and Nagashima dominated the batting titles during this period. During his career, Oh was a five-time batting champion and fifteen-time home-run champion, and won the Central League most valuable player award nine times. Nagashima won the season MVP award five times, and the Best Nine Award every single year of his career (a total 17 times). Future Hall of Famer Tsuneo Horiuchi pitched for the team during its heyday, from 1966 to 1983. The renowned left-hander Masaichi Kaneda pitched for the team from 1965 to 1969, later having his number retired by the Giants.

Shigeo Nagashima was appointed manager of the Giants almost immediately after his retirement in 1974, staying in that position until 1980. After a couple of down years the Giants re-assumed their dominant position in the Central League, winning league championships in 1976 and 1977. Sadaharu Oh rejoined the team as manager from 1984 to 1988. Nagashima returned as Giants manager from 1993 to 2001, winning Japan Series championships in 1994, 1996, and 2000.

Outfielder Hideki Matsui starred for the Giants for ten seasons in the 1990s and early 2000s before migrating to Major League Baseball. He was a three-time NPB MVP, leading his team to four Japan Series, winning three titles (1994, 2000 and 2002), and earning the popular nickname &quot;Godzilla&quot;. He also made nine consecutive All-Star Games and led the league in home runs and RBIs three times.

== Managerial history and lifetime records ==

==Rivalries==

The Giants have several rivalries with clubs in the Central League, most notably rivalries with the Nishinomiya-based Hanshin Tigers, the Nagoya-based Chunichi Dragons and their cross-town rivals, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. 

===Hanshin Tigers===
The Giants-Tigers rivalry is considered the most intense professional rivalry in the history of Japanese team sports.

The Giants-Tigers feud began on July 15, 1936 in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, at a time where Japanese clubs besides the Tigers did not have set home ballparks, and would bounce around wherever they could play. This game would set the tone for the history-setting rivalry, as the first home run in Giants professional club history would come on that day at the hands of Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame member Haruyasu Nakajima off Tigers&#x27; ace Tadashi Wakabayashi, but the Tigers would win the game 8-7. On September 25, 1936, young Giants ace Eiji Sawamura threw the first no-hitter in Japanese professional baseball history against the Tigers at Hanshin Koshien Stadium. He would be the only Giants pitcher to throw a no-hitter at Koshien until Shosei Togo did it on May 24, 2024.

The Giants-Tigers rivalry has seen mostly the Giants enjoy long standing periods of success at the expense of the Tigers. From to , the Giants won the Central League pennant over the Tigers in each of the four seasons; however, the Giants would lose all 4 of their Japan Series appearances during that time, three times to the Nishitetsu Lions (now the Saitama Seibu Lions) from 1956 to , and once to the Nankai Hawks (now the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks) in 1959. Most notably during this time, the only ever baseball , or &quot;Match viewed by the Emperor&quot; happened on June 25th, 1959, where Emperor Hirohito decided to watch the game between the Tigers and Giants; Giants legend Shigeo Nagashima would walk off future Tigers legend Minoru Murayama in the bottom of the 9th as the Giants won 5-4. During the Giants&#x27; V9 dynasty, where the Giants would win a record setting 9 consecutive Japan Series championships from to , the Tigers would finish 2nd in the Central League 5 of the 9 seasons, including 3 consecutive second place finishes from to .

As of the end of the season, the Giants have the edge in Japan Series championships, 22–2, Central League pennants, 39–6, overall championships, 31–6, and the Giants lead the Tigers head to head, 1127–888–77. The Giants and Tigers have met in the Climax Series 5 times, in which the Giants lead the overall head-to-head matchup 11-6-0, winning the series 4 times to the Tigers&#x27; 1.

===Tokyo Yakult Swallows===

The geographic rivalry between the Giants and the Shinjuku-based Tokyo Yakult Swallows has been around since the Swallows were founded by the former Japanese National Railways (known as Kokutetsu (国鉄) in Japanese)) as the Kokutetsu Swallows on January 12, 1950. However, the rivalry never truly began in earnest until Yakult, who bought the team from national newspaper Sankei Shimbun in 1970, added &quot;Tokyo&quot; to the team&#x27;s name in the 2005-06 NPB offseason, where games began being referred to by the media as the &quot;&quot;, or literally &quot;Tokyo Series&quot; in Japanese. In , the Swallows and Giants officially announced plans for an annual &quot;Tokyo Series&quot; event with each team hosting a series. At the same time, the Swallows began producing annual alternate uniforms for said rivalry games.

Since Yakult added Tokyo to the Swallows name in 2006, the Giants lead the head-to-head regular season series 260–184–19. Overall, since the Swallows were founded in 1950, the Giants lead the head-to-head regular season series 1094–758–61. The Swallows and Giants have met in the Climax Series 4 times, in which Yakult lead the head-to-head matchups 9–4–1 (including Yakult&#x27;s 1 advantage win in the 2015 and 2021 Central League Climax Series), winning the series 3 times to the Giants&#x27; 1 series win.

===Chunichi Dragons===
The Giants-Dragons rivalry is said to be the oldest professional rivalry in the history of professional Japanese team sports.

The Giants and one of the teams that would eventually form the Dragons, then known as the Nagoya Shachihoko, first met on February 5, 1936 at in the suburbs of Nagoya, marking the first ever game in the history of the Japanese Professional Baseball League, which is now known as Nippon Professional Baseball. The Shachihoko, later known as Nagoya Kinko, would be absorbed into the Nagoya Baseball Club in 1943 as their parent company, the Nagoya Shimbun, was forced to merge into rival newspaper company Shin-Aichi Shimbun under the , creating Chubu-Nippon Shimbun, or Chunichi Shimbun as it is known today. This created the Sangyo Baseball Club, which is now known as today&#x27;s Chunichi Dragons.

Like the Giants-Tigers rivalry, the Giants have enjoyed long standing success at the expense of the Dragons, creating animosity amongst Dragons fans. This came to a head in the finale of the 1994 NPB season, where the Giants and Dragons were tied in the standings, each sitting at 69-60-0. The Giants would win that game and the Central League pennant by a score of 6-3, in what would be known as the , and eventually would win the 1994 Japan Series over the Seibu Lions.

Since Nagoya Kinko merged into the Nagoya Baseball Club in 1943, the Giants lead the Dragons in Japan Series championships, 22-2, Central League pennants, 39-9, and head-to-head, 1061-871-61. The Giants and Dragons have met in the Climax Series 5 times, in which the overall head-to-head is tied, 12-12-1, including 1 game advantage wins in the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012 Central League Climax Series. The Giants also have won the head to head series in the Climax Series 3 times to Chunichi&#x27;s 2.

== &quot;Japan&#x27;s team&quot; and allegations of corruption ==

Due to the Yomiuri company&#x27;s vast influence in Japan as a major media conglomerate, the Giants have long been branded as &quot;Japan&#x27;s Team&quot;. In fact, for some years the Giants&#x27; uniforms had &quot;Tokyo&quot; on the jersey instead of &quot;Yomiuri&quot; or &quot;Giants&quot;, seeming to imply that the Giants represent the vast metropolis and geopolitical center of Japan, even though the Yakult Swallows are also based in Tokyo and three other teams play in the Greater Tokyo Area. This bandwagon appeal has been compared with the marketability of the New York Yankees, Real Madrid, and Manchester United, except that support for the Giants nearly exceeds 50% of those polled, while in the United States and England, support is judged to be between 30% and 40% for the Yankees and Manchester United, respectively. Correspondingly, fans of other professional baseball teams in Japan are often openly derisive and contemptuous of the Giants&#x27; bandwagon marketing tactics, and an &quot;anti-Giants&quot; movement exists in protest of the Giants&#x27; near-hegemony.

In addition, despite the Giants having employed many foreign players over the years, many Japanese point proudly to the &quot;pure-blooded period&quot; of 1958–1974 when the team enjoyed continued success — 13 pennants — despite having no foreign players.

It has also long been alleged that the Giants rely on underhanded tactics to recruit the best players, involving bribes to players and amateur coaches, or using their influence on the governing council of Japanese professional baseball to pass rules that favors their recruiting efforts. This may be one explanation for the Giants&#x27; abundance of success in league play. In August 2004, Yomiuri president Tsuneo Watanabe resigned after it was revealed that the club had violated scouting rules by paying ¥2 million to pitching prospect Yasuhiro Ichiba. Ten months later, Watanabe was hired as chairman of the Yomiuri corporation. In 2012, &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; discovered that the Giants had violated NPB rules by secretly paying pitcher Takahiko Nomaguchi while he was still an amateur playing in Japan&#x27;s corporate league.

In 2009, the Giants played the Japan national baseball team in an unofficial goodwill game before the World Baseball Classic.

== Controversies ==
=== 1973 First nine consecutive victories in professional baseball history ===
As of October 21 before this game was played, the teams only had a 0.5 game difference the Hanshin Tigers, this game resulted 9 to 0 win over Tigers on October 22, infielder Shozo Doi and catcher Masaaki Mori each had 3 hits and Doi hit a two run homerun in the fifth inning off Kenji Furusawa in the Giants 4 to 1 win from Nankai Hawks (now Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks) in Japan Series, starter Kazumi Takahashi (23 wins, 13 losses) contribution this season.

=== Oh home run controversy ===
In 1985, American Randy Bass, playing for the Hanshin Tigers, came into the last game of the season against the Oh-managed Giants with 54 home runs, one short of manager Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s single-season record of 55. Bass was intentionally walked four times on four straight pitches each time, leading Bass to famously hold his bat upside down. Bass reached over the plate on the fifth occasion and batted the ball into the outfield for a single. After the game, Oh denied ordering his pitchers to walk Bass, but Keith Comstock, an American pitcher for the Giants, later stated that an unnamed Giants coach had threatened a fine of $1,000 for every strike that any Giants pitcher threw to Bass. The magazine Takarajima investigated the incident and reported that the Giants front office had likely ordered the team not to allow Bass an opportunity to tie or break Oh&#x27;s record. For the most part the Japanese media remained silent on the incident as did league commissioner Takeso Shimoda. A similar situation to this was presented in the 1992 movie &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot;.

=== 1994 Central League tie-breaker game ===
With the Giants and Chunichi Dragons tied 69-60 after 129 games, and the makeup for the 129th game, originally scheduled for September 27, was postponed to September 29 by rain (the 130th scheduled game was played September 28 as planned), and it again was not played because of rain, the final game of the regular season was rescheduled for October 8, 1994. The winner advances to the Japan Series, with Chunichi having the advantage in case the game ends in a tie, Chunichi would advance by rule (the previous year&#x27;s better record). The Giants won 6 to 3 against Chunichi, and took the Central League pennant and advanced to the Japan Series. 

=== 1996 Nagashima controversy ===
The team accelerates at a stretch when winning in nine consecutive hits of professional baseball tie-record in one inning of July 9 against Hiroshima Carp&#x27;s game.
Both main starter, Masaki Saito, Dominican Balvino Galvez raised 16 won games the most wins on this season, relief pitcher, Mario Brito who reinforced during the season and Hirofumi Kono supported the team, Hideki Matsui was very success as a main season. Rookies Toshihisa Nishi and Takayuki Shimizu were active and generation change was also decided admirably. At the time I reached the biggest 11.5 game difference in league history and accomplished the league championship. Although defeated lost 1 to 4 games by Orix BlueWave (now Orix Buffaloes) on Japan Series.

=== 2008 Miracle season ===
Despite losing five consecutive games from the opening game on March 28, On May 26, a banned drug was detected to be used by Luis Gonzalez, so he was suspended for 1 year from Nippon Professional Baseball for violating league anti-doping policies, and on the following day, the Giants decided to release Gonzalez from his contract. At the time, October reached the biggest 13 game (as July) difference in league history and accomplished the league championship, from September 19, including their 3rd consecutive victory against the Hanshin Tigers, they recorded a total of 12 consecutive victories for the first time in 32 years, followed by 3 to 1 winning the final direct confrontation on October 8. Contributors included Shinnosuke Abe, Yoshinobu Takahashi, Michihiro Ogasawara, Alex Ramirez, Seth Adam Greisinger, Marc Jason Kroon, Hisanori Takahashi, and Tetsuya Utsumi, The Giants, however, lost 3 games to 4 to the Saitama Seibu Lions in the 2008 Japan Series. The Yomiuri Giants drew an average home attendance of 39,948 in 2008.

=== 2011 Kiyotake controversy ===
On 18 November 2011, Giants&#x27; general manager Hidetoshi Kiyotake was fired by the Yomiuri organization for &quot;defamation of the team and Yomiuri newspaper group&quot;. Kiyotake had recommended that Kaoru Okazaki be retained as the team&#x27;s 2012 head coach. After Yomiuri chairman Tsuneo Watanabe ordered Kiyotake to replace Okazaki with Suguru Egawa, Kiyotake called a public press conference on 11 November 2011 to complain about Watanabe&#x27;s interference in the club&#x27;s decision-making processes. Yomiuri&#x27;s response was to fire Kiyotake.

Okazaki was eventually selected to remain as the next season&#x27;s coach. The story made major headlines in the Japanese media. On 13 December 2011, Kiyotake sued Yomiuri for ¥62 million for unfair dismissal and defamation and demanded that the company issue him a formal apology, printed in the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;. Yomiuri counter-sued Kiyotake for ¥100 million, saying that he had damaged the team&#x27;s image. The suits, combined into one case, opened in Tokyo District Court on 2 February 2012.

=== 2012 Hara controversy ===
In 2012 Japanese weekly &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot; reported that current team manager Tatsunori Hara had paid ¥100 million to a former yakuza gangster in response to a threat to go public on an extra-marital affair that Hara had been involved in. The Yomiuri corporation admitted that the payout had been made, but sued &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot; for insinuating that the incident had underworld connections. The suit is pending.

=== 2015 gambling controversy ===
In 2015, an investigation by the league found that three Giants pitchers: Shoki Kasahara, Ryuya Matsumoto, and Satoshi Fukuda had bet on NPB and other sporting events with underworld bookmakers. The Giants claimed that the three did not bet on Giants games. Placing wagers on baseball games or associating with criminal elements is expressly prohibited in the contracts that all NPB players must sign, a rule similar to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Rule 21 in North America, intended to prevent a repeat of the Black Sox Scandal of 1919 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. On 9 November 2015, the Giants organization terminated the contracts of all three players, with an indefinite suspension from &quot;all&quot; World Baseball Softball Confederation leagues on the players. The offending players must be reinstated by the WBSC before they can participate in any league.

<doc id="148869" wikidata="Q183536" url="?curid=148869" title="Tokyo Tower">
<text>, also known as the Japan Radio Tower (, ) is a communications and observation tower in the district of Shiba-koen in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, completed in 1958. At , it was the tallest tower in Japan until the construction of Tokyo Skytree in 2012. It is a lattice tower inspired by the Eiffel Tower, and is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations.

The tower&#x27;s main sources of income are tourism and antenna leasing. FootTown, a four-story building directly under the tower, houses museums, restaurants, and shops. Departing from there, guests can visit two observation decks. The two-story Main Deck (formerly known as the Main Observatory) is at , while the smaller Top Deck (formerly known as the &quot;Special Observatory&quot;) reaches a height of . The names were changed following renovation of the top deck in 2018. The tower is repainted every five years, taking a year to complete the process.

In 1961, transmission antennae were added to the tower. They are used for radio and television broadcasting and now broadcast signals for Japanese media outlets such as NHK, TBS Television, and Fuji Television. The height of the tower was not suitable for Japan&#x27;s planned terrestrial digital broadcasting planned for July 2011, and for the Tokyo area. A taller digital broadcasting tower, known as Tokyo Skytree, was completed on 29 February 2012. Tokyo Tower has become a prominent landmark and frequently appears in media set in Tokyo.

==Construction==

A large broadcasting tower was needed in the Kantō region after NHK, Japan&#x27;s public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating in the months following the construction of NHK&#x27;s own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country&#x27;s postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its national recovery from World War II, as one of the countries most ravaged by the war.

Hisakichi Maeda, founder and president of Nippon Denpatō, the tower&#x27;s owner and operator, originally planned for the tower to be taller than the Empire State Building, which at 381 meters was the highest structure in the world at the time. However, the plan fell through because of the lack of both funds and materials. The tower&#x27;s height was eventually determined by the distance the TV stations needed to transmit throughout the Kantō region, a distance of about .

Tachū Naitō, designer of tall buildings in Japan, was chosen to design the newly proposed tower. Looking to the Western world for inspiration, Naitō based his design on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. With the help of engineering company Nikken Sekkei Ltd., Naitō claimed his design could withstand earthquakes with twice the intensity of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake or typhoons with wind speeds of up to .

The new construction project attracted hundreds of &quot;tobi&quot; (鳶), traditional Japanese construction workers who specialized in the construction of high-rise structures. The Takenaka Corporation broke ground in June 1957 and each day at least 400 laborers worked on the tower. It was constructed of steel, a third of which was scrap metal taken from US tanks damaged in the Korean War. When the 90-meter-long antenna was bolted into place on 14 October 1958, Tokyo Tower was the tallest freestanding tower in the world, taking the title from the Eiffel Tower by nine meters.

Though it is taller than the Eiffel Tower, Tokyo Tower weighs about 4,000 tons, 3,300 less than the Eiffel Tower as it is significantly thinner and simpler in construction. It was opened to the public on 23 December 1958 at a final cost of ¥2.8 billion ($8.4 million in 1958). Tokyo Tower was mortgaged for ¥10 billion in 2000. It was the tallest artificial structure in Japan until April 2010, when it was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree.

Planned as an antenna for telecommunications and brightly colored in accordance with the time&#x27;s Aviation Law, the tower&#x27;s two panoramic observatories are mostly frequented by tourists today. The tower constitutes a clear reference point in the center&#x27;s skyline, forming a strong landmark, both night and day. Every five years, the tower is repainted in a process that takes about a year to complete. Tokyo Tower is next planned to be repainted in 2024.

== Functions ==

Tokyo Tower&#x27;s two main revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism. It functions as a radio and television broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions. The tower recorded its 190 millionth visitor in 2024. Visitor numbers had been steadily declining, bottoming out at 2.3 million in 2000 before rising since then.

The first area tourists visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. There, visitors can eat, shop, and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from the first floor of FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from the second floor of the Main Observatory to reach the final observation deck—the Special Observatory.

=== Broadcasting ===

Tokyo Tower, a member of the World Federation of Great Towers, has been used by many organizations for broadcasting purposes. The structure was intended for broadcasting television, but radio antennas were installed in 1961 because it could accommodate them. While analog and digital television broadcasts are no longer conducted from the site, two FM radio stations remain on Tokyo Tower. Stations that use or have used the tower&#x27;s antenna include:

Japan employs both analog and digital broadcasting. In July 2011 all television broadcasting was changed to solely digital. Tokyo Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not tall enough to transmit the higher frequency waves to areas surrounded by forests or high-rise buildings. As an alternative, a new tower called the Tokyo Skytree was opened in 2012. In an attempt to make Tokyo Tower more appealing to NHK and the five other commercial broadcasters who planned to move their transmitting stations to the new tower, Nihon Denpatō officials drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 80 to 100 meters at a cost of approximately ¥4 billion (US$50 million).

As a result of their move to the Skytree, only one digital television station remained on Tokyo Tower: that of the Open University of Japan, whose JOUD-DTV and JOUD-FM continued on the tower until shutting down in 2018. FM radio stations will continue to use the tower for broadcasting in the Tokyo area. Masahiro Kawada, the tower&#x27;s planning director, raised the possibility of the tower becoming a backup for the Tokyo Skytree, depending on what the TV broadcasters want or need.

The antenna&#x27;s tip was damaged on 11 March 2011 by the Tōhoku earthquake. On 19 July 2012, Tokyo Tower&#x27;s height shrank to 315 meters while the top antenna was repaired for damage from the earthquake.

=== Attractions ===
==== FootTown ====
Located in the base of the tower is a 4-story building known as FootTown. The first floor includes the Aquarium Gallery, a reception hall, the 400-person-capacity &quot;Tower Restaurant&quot;, a FamilyMart convenience store and a souvenir shop. This floor&#x27;s main attractions, however, are the three elevators that serve as a direct ride to the Main Observatory. The second floor is primarily a food and shopping area. In addition to the five standalone restaurants, the second floor&#x27;s food court consists of four restaurants, including a McDonald&#x27;s and a Pizza-La.
FootTown&#x27;s third and fourth floors house several tourist attractions. The third floor is home to the Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia depicting interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book. The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displayed wax figures imported from London where they were made until it was closed in 2013.

The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ. A hologram gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower&#x27;s Trick Art Gallery is located on the building&#x27;s fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with.

On the roof of the FootTown building is a small amusement park that contains several small rides and hosts live performances for children. On weekends and holidays, visitors can use the roof to access the tower&#x27;s outside stairwell. At approximately 660 steps, the stairwell is an alternative to the tower&#x27;s elevators and leads directly to the Main Observatory.

==== Tokyo One Piece Tower ====

Based on the hit manga and anime &quot;One Piece&quot;, Tokyo Tower featured a small &quot;One Piece&quot; themed amusement park that opened in 2015 and closed in 2020. The amusement park offered a range of attractions, shops, and restaurants, all based on the characters from Eiichiro Oda&#x27;s manga. Patrons enjoyed various games or attractions based on their favorite characters and enjoyed meals from the world of &quot;One Piece&quot;. There was a gift store that features exclusive goods for &quot;One Piece&quot; fans.

== Appearance ==

Tokyo Tower requires of paint to completely paint the structure white and international orange, complying with air safety regulations. Before the tower&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 1987, the only lighting on the tower were light bulbs located on the corner contours that extended from the base to the antenna. In the spring of 1987, Nihon Denpatō invited lighting designer Motoko Ishii to visit the tower. Since its opening 30 years earlier, the tower&#x27;s annual ticket sales had dropped significantly, and in a bid to revitalize the tower and again establish it as an important tourist attraction and symbol of Tokyo, Ishii was hired to redesign Tokyo Tower&#x27;s lighting arrangement.

Unveiled in 1989, the new lighting arrangement required the removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176 floodlights in and around the tower&#x27;s frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.

Occasionally, Tokyo Tower&#x27;s lighting is changed to specific arrangements for special events. The tower is specially lit for some annual events.
Since 2000, the entire tower has been illuminated in a pink light on 1 October to highlight the beginning of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The tower has also had a variety of special lighting arrangements for Christmas since 1994. During New Year&#x27;s Eve, the tower lights up at midnight with a year number displayed on one side of the observatory to mark the arrival of the new year.

Special Japanese events have been cause to light the tower in several non-traditional ways. In 2002, alternating sections of the tower were lit blue to help celebrate the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Japan. Alternating sections of the tower were lit green on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Japanese–Irish relations. On a few occasions, Tokyo Tower has even been specially lit to correspond with corporate events. For example, the top half of the tower was lit green to correspond with the Japanese premiere of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and different sections of the tower were lit red, white and black to commemorate the first day of sales of Coca-Cola C2.

The tower was lit for the new millennium in 2000 with Motoko Ishii again reprising her role as the designer. In December 2008, Nihon Denpatō spent $6.5 million to create a new night-time illumination scheme—titled the &quot;Diamond Veil&quot;—to celebrate the tower&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The arrangement featured 276 lights in seven colors equally distributed across the towers four faces.

When employing specialty lighting on the tower, the Main Observatory often plays an important role. During the second international &quot;White Band Day&quot; on 10 September 2005, the tower was completely unlit except for the Main Observatory, which was lit with a bright white light. The resulting white ring represented the White Band referenced in the day&#x27;s name. The two floors of windows that make up the exterior of the Main Observatory are utilized to display words or numbers. When the tower employed lighting to commemorate terrestrial digital broadcasting first being available in the Kantō region on 1 December 2005, each side of the Main Observatory displayed the characters (&quot;chi deji&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;chijō dejitaru hōsō&quot; terrestrial digital broadcasting). More recently, the observatory displayed both &quot;TOKYO&quot; and &quot;2016&quot; to stress Tokyo&#x27;s 2016 Olympic bid. Primitive images, such as hearts, have also been displayed using the observatory&#x27;s windows.


==Renovation==
Operations at the Tokyo Tower Top Deck (at the height of 250 m) were suspended in 2016. The Top Deck reopened on March 3, 2018. At that time, Tokyo Tower also announced the renaming of both decks. Renovations on the main deck, which began in September 2016, caused partial closure of the deck.

==Mascots==

The Tokyo Tower has two mascots named ノッポン &quot;Noppon&quot;. They are two brothers: Older Brother, who wears blue dungarees, and Younger Brother, who wears red dungarees. They were unveiled on 23 December 1998 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Tokyo Tower.

== Media representation ==
Just as the Eiffel Tower is often used in popular culture to immediately locate a scene in Paris, Tokyo Tower is often used in the same way for Tokyo.

It is used in anime and manga such as &quot;Doraemon&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Magnitude 8.0&quot;, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; and &quot;Death Note&quot;. The tower is frequently used in the Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of numerous battles and visitations by Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (&quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt.

Tokyo Tower is represented in Unicode as an emoji at code point U+1F5FC: 🗼

The Tokyo Tower, and particularly the construction of that Tower, often appears in Shōwa nostalgia fiction and non-fiction, where it is used as a symbol of the financial prosperity of Shōwa era Japan. For example, the 2005 film &quot;Always Sanchōme no Yūhi&quot;, based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, was a nostalgic view of life in the neighborhoods beneath the construction of Tokyo Tower.

In the 2022 film &quot;Bubble&quot;, it is depicted as being destroyed by the titular reality-breaking bubbles.

<doc id="148870" wikidata="Q6411673" url="?curid=148870" title="King Giddra">
<text>King Giddra was a Japanese hip hop group that started in 1993. They were signed to the indie label P-Vine Records. After a six-year hiatus, they would go on to sign with DefStar Records, a sublabel under Sony Music Entertainment Japan (SMEJ) for their second album release.

==Members==
The group is made of up three members: K DUB SHINE (MC/concept leader of the group), ZEEBRA (MC), and DJ OASIS (DJ). The group is named after the 3-headed monster from the Godzilla movies, King Ghidorah. Zeebra has said that they chose the name after realizing that Godzilla is a character that represents international Japan. In the film, &quot;King Giddra is the bad guy, but as a public enemy, he is doing an extremely positive thing.&quot; They say that as an enemy of the public, they are an enemy of the system that oppresses them, like how Godzilla was the oppressive system and King Ghidorah was the enemy.
Although all three members were born in Tokyo, each member spent some time living and growing up in the United States. K DUB SHINE, did a homestay in Florida before moving to Oakland, California, where he would meet future members of the group, ZEEBRA and DJ OASIS. According to the group&#x27;s appearance on the Japanese music variety show, &quot;HEY!HEY!HEY! MUSIC CHAMP&quot;, DJ OASIS and ZEEBRA have known each other since grade school.

==Style of music==
Their style is influenced by the American rap group Public Enemy, which is evidenced by their political views on the state of Japanese society in the lyrics of their songs, such as &quot;Bullet of Truth.&quot; The song&#x27;s opening lyrics are &quot;Facing us is an illusion... the noise of a completely corrupt society/ Giddra lights a fire in the war of ideas in a 20-faced disguise forcing a new association of thoughts.&quot; The lyrics are indicative of a broader theme in hip hop of being critical of the greater majority in one&#x27;s society. The line referencing a &quot;new association of thoughts&quot; promotes the efficacy of hip hop to go beyond complaining about problems and actually change the way people think. &quot;This song is a throwback to the socially conscious lyrics of Hip Hop&#x27;s beginning in the inner-cities of America.&quot; In this song, King Giddra questions the education system that &quot;crushes the dreams of children&quot; as well as the media overload, especially in terms of advertising, sex and violence, which becomes a kind of mind control. Their debut album (The Power from the Sky) is also inspired by Public Enemy, from their song &quot;Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos&quot;. The title song, uses a sample from that PE song. By using American samples and rapping about Japanese issues, King Giddra mixes local and global perspectives of the world into their hip hop.

As the popularity of hip hop in Japan increased in the 1990s, mainstream J-Pop began to produce J-Rap, which was just party rap with no real political message. Those in the hip hop culture of Japan noticed the success of J-Rap and wondered if rap in Japan should discuss socio-political issues or if it should remain mainstream with lighter lyrics. King Giddra chose to make Japanese hip hop more political and about social issues that those in Japan faced. This also helped to create a Japanese style of rap that was not just an imitation of American rap because King Giddra discussed issues specific to Japan. For example, in their 1995 song, &quot;Bullet of Truth&quot;, the group discusses how the education system &quot;crushes the dreams of children&quot; by making them think they will have a successful job after graduation, when in reality, unemployment is very common among young Japanese adults. They also criticize the media by saying that its advertising is overpowering and becomes a sort of mind control. Japanese society is condemned for its &quot;heartless commercialism&quot; and &quot;despoiled environment&quot;.

By the early 2000s, different aspects of King Giddra&#x27;s political perspective began to emerge. Though still claiming inspiration from African American groups such as Public Enemy, projects such as &quot;The Ultimate Weapon&quot; (Saishuu Heiki) contained more overtly nationalistic statements. In 2002, K Dub Shine produced the soundtrack for &quot;The Sakura of Madness,&quot; a film chronicling three nationalistic youths in Shibuya who attack those they view as “ruining the sanctity of the streets” and become sucked into a yakuza war&quot; In an interview with Remix magazine in 2009, K Dub Shine openly expressed his right-wing views, including his belief that Japanese soldiers who died in World War II should be honored as fighting for the betterment of Japan. He compared the Occupation of Japan after World War II to the enslavement of black people in America, calling the two a &quot;shared experience&quot; of oppression, and described the Black Panthers as a right-wing organization.

==Group career==
The group&#x27;s debut album would help them launch solo careers with major labels. K DUB signed with Japanese music label juggernaut, avex, under their &quot;cutting edge&quot; imprint, releasing his solo album (Present Time) in 1997. ZEEBRA signed with Pony Canyon and released his debut album &quot;The Rhyme Animal&quot;, a moniker inspired by Chuck D of Public Enemy, the following year in 1998. Both artists would go on to sign their own artists under their group. K DUB SHINE already had his Atomic Bomb Crew (which was responsible for developing King Giddra), and ZEEBRA with UBG (Urbarian Gym) a wordplay in Japanese of (Tokai no Yabanjin/Barbarians of the city). Urbarian plays off the word &quot;urban&quot; and &quot;barbarian&quot;. Gym plays off the Japanese pronunciation of (jin) from which means &quot;people&quot;.

With the success of their respective solo ventures, the group would go on a long hiatus until the eventual release of their second, and possibly last album, &quot;The Ultimate Weapon&quot; (Saishuu Heiki). It was released in 2002. Unlike the debut album which saw beatmaking duties split largely between ZEEBRA and DJ OASIS, &quot;Saishuu Heiki&quot; was mostly produced by DJ OASIS.

The simultaneous release of two of their singles &quot;F.F.B.&quot; and &quot;UNSTOPPABLE&quot; saw commercial success with them reaching the 5th and 6th spot on the Oricon charts. They made their first and only appearance as a group to perform in the Japanese music shows, &quot;HEY!HEY!HEY! MUSIC CHAMP&quot; and &quot;MUSICSTATION&quot;. However both singles dealt with controversy. &quot;F.F.B.&quot; contained a line that offended people with HIV, while the song (Driveby) offended the gay community accusing it of discrimination. The original &quot;UNSTOPPABLE&quot; single [blue cover] was discontinued and re-released without the song &quot;Driveby&quot; [yellowed cover]. The track was replaced with their song, (Heisei Ishin/Heisei Restoration; a concept borrowed from the &quot;Meiji Restoration&quot;. Heisei being the present-day Japanese era). On September 11, 2002, they released their last single for the album &quot;911&quot;, exactly one year after the incident. King Giddra&#x27;s song &quot;911&quot; addressed America&#x27;s misguided &quot;war on terror,&quot; and the complicity of the Japanese media and the national government. The song reflects on ground zero and its aftermath in two eras: August 1945 and September 11, 2001. 
Their music video opens with an image of ground zero Hiroshima. The group song video uses images of Hiroshima&#x27;s ground zero after the bombing as a way of rethinking ground zero New York. According to Ian Condry the image, &quot;at the center of the picture, the government building now known as the Peace Dome figures prominently.&quot; 
The group lyricist raps about America&#x27;s hypocrisy in always telling Japan &quot;to follow the path of peace&quot; but then starts bombing Baghdad. On the other hand, they see the Japanese government as equally at fault because of their complicity. Also the first and third verses of the song appear on their 2002 video Saishuu Heiki, or the Ultimate Weapon (Defstar Records).
The song is inspiring because it great to see that some rappers from Japanese tackling issues of social opposition and bringing more voices to the call for peace.

The album was released in October and featured &quot;F.F.B.&quot; with edited lyrics, and the song (Koukai Shokei/Public Execution) which was a diss track. ZEEBRA airs out KJ from the group Dragon Ash, while K DUB SHINE&#x27;s verse aims at &quot;sell-out rappers&quot; and calls out Kick The Can Crew, and Rip Slyme through word play of their names, while allowing his point to flow through his verse:
(kiku to kan kuruu, RIRIKU tsurai, herikutsu RAIMU/ listening to it makes me mad as hell, annoying lyrics, pointless rhymes).

The song (Generation Next) is the album version of a song they contributed to the movie (Kyouki no Sakura/The Sakura of Madness), directed by Sonoda Kenji, who is the longtime music video director of King Giddra, as well as some of their solo work&#x27;s videos.

==Solo career of the members==
Upon the conclusion of the album&#x27;s tour, the group went their separate ways again, resuming their solo careers. While K DUB&#x27;s content remained consistent, ZEEBRA&#x27;s popularity and charisma saw him become more active in the entertainment industry, starring in a short series drama, developing his UBG label, producing for and featuring on high-profile jpop artists such as BoA, Namie Amuro, and EXILE, etc. Currently K DUB has released three studio albums (Genzai Jikoku, Ikiru/Live, and Riyuu/Reason). ZEEBRA has released five studio albums (The Rhyme Animal, Based on a True Story, Tokyo&#x27;s Finest, The New Beginning, and the recently released World of Music). DJ OASIS has released two studio albums ((Toukyou Sabaku/Tokyo Desert), and Waterworld). He has also formed a DJ group called The Axis with longtime King Giddra collaborator, UBG&#x27;s INOVADER to release mixtapes that combine American rap artists, old school and new school, and blending them with their own beats. K DUB SHINE and DJ OASIS also formed a group called Radio Aktive Project (wordplay associated with &quot;RAP&quot; and their label &quot;Atomic Bomb Records&quot;) designed to be similar to that of King Giddra, albeit without ZEEBRA.

<text>A is an unlined cotton summer kimono, worn in casual settings such as summer festivals and to nearby bathhouses. The name is translated literally as &quot;bathing cloth&quot; and originally were worn as bathrobes; their modern use is much broader, and are a common sight in Japan during summer. Though are traditionally indigo and white in colour, modern commonly feature multicoloured designs, and are designed to be machine washable. They are similar in appearance to the , a unisex short-sleeved kimono-like garment worn by guests at traditional inns.

==Techniques and textiles==
Yukata are made using various textiles and dyeing techniques. Traditionally they were made with a technique called Nagaita-Chugata, where fabric was dyed on both sides with stencils. As this technique is expensive, a technique called Chusen was developed in the late Edo period to replicate the double sided cloth.

==Construction and wear==

Men&#x27;s are distinguished by the shorter sleeve extension of approximately from the armpit seam, compared to the longer sleeve extension in women&#x27;s . A standard ensemble consists of a , and sandals or geta worn without socks. The outfit may be accessorised with a foldable or fixed hand fan and the addition of a traditional carry bag known as a , used by both men and women to carry cellphones and other small personal items.

<doc id="148878" wikidata="Q316249" url="?curid=148878" title="Mario Lemieux">
<text>Mario Lemieux (; ; born October 5, 1965) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played parts of 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Pittsburgh Penguins between 1984 and 2005, and he assumed ownership of the franchise in 1999. Nicknamed &quot;the Magnificent One&quot;, &quot;Le Magnifique&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario&quot;, Lemieux is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time for his combination of size, strength, athleticism, and creativity.

Drafted first overall by the Penguins in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, Lemieux led Pittsburgh to consecutive Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. Under his ownership, the Penguins won additional titles in 2009, 2016, and 2017. He is the only man to have his name on the Cup both as a player and owner. He also led Team Canada to an Olympic gold medal in 2002, a championship at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and a Canada Cup in 1987. He won the Lester B. Pearson Award as the most outstanding player voted by the players four times, the Hart Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP) during the regular season three times, the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s points leader six times, and the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP in 1991 and 1992. He is the only player to score one goal in each of the five possible situations in a single NHL game, a feat he accomplished in 1988. At the time of his retirement, he was the NHL&#x27;s seventh-highest career points scorer with 690 goals and 1,033 assists. He ranks second in NHL history with a 0.754 career goals-per-game average, behind Mike Bossy (0.762). He ranks second in NHL history with a 1.129 career assists-per-game average and a 1.883 points-per-game average, both behind Wayne Gretzky (1.320 and 1.921, respectively).

Lemieux was never able to play a full season, and only played in 70 or more games in a season on only six occasions during his career - four of which came before the age of 25. Lemieux&#x27;s career was plagued by health problems that limited him to 915 of a possible 1,430 regular season games between the opening of the 1984–85 campaign and the conclusion of the 2005–2006 campaign. Lemieux&#x27;s NHL debut was on October 11, 1984 and his final game took place on December 16, 2005. His numerous ailments included spinal disc herniation, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, chronic tendinitis of a hip-flexor muscle, and chronic back pain so severe that other people had to tie his skates. He retired on two occasions due to these health issues, first in 1997 after battling lymphoma before returning in 2000, and then a second and final time in 2006 after being diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Lemieux also missed the entire 1994–95 season due to Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. Despite his lengthy absences from the game, his play remained at a high level upon his return to the ice; he won the Hart Trophy and scoring title in 1995–96 after sitting out the entire previous season. He was on pace for 188 points, but only played in 70 games. He was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy when he made his comeback in 2000. In 1999, he bought the then-bankrupt Penguins and their top minor-league affiliate, the American Hockey League&#x27;s (AHL) Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and was the team&#x27;s principal owner until selling controlling interest in the team to Fenway Sports Group in 2021. However, he remains part-owner and chairman of the board.

The Hockey Hall of Fame inducted Lemieux immediately after his first retirement in 1997, waiving the normal three-year waiting period; upon his return in 2000, he became the third Hall of Famer (after Gordie Howe and Guy Lafleur) to play after being inducted. Lemieux&#x27;s impact on the NHL has been significant: Andrew Conte of the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; called him the saviour of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and after Lemieux&#x27;s retirement, Wayne Gretzky commented, &quot;You don&#x27;t replace players like Mario Lemieux ... The game will miss him.&quot; Bobby Orr called him &quot;the most talented player I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Orr, along with Bryan Trottier and numerous fans, speculated that if Lemieux had had fewer health issues, his on-ice achievements would have been much greater. In 2017, he was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot;. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2004, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Early years==
Lemieux was born in Montréal to Pierrette, a stay-at-home mom, and Jean-Guy Lemieux, an engineer. He and his older brothers Alain and Richard grew up in a working class family in the Ville-Émard district. He began playing hockey at age three in his basement; before using real equipment, he and his brothers used wooden kitchen spoons as hockey sticks and bottle caps as pucks. His father created a rink on the front lawn so that the boys could practice as much as possible, and according to family legend, the family sometimes packed snow onto the living room carpet so the brothers could practice indoors when it was dark.

The young Lemieux was a teammate to future NHLers Marc Bergevin and J. J. Daigneault on the same minor ice hockey team from Ville-Émard. Lemieux and Daigneault played together with RJ Donnelly and Gail Swann in the 1977 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament. Cornish and Swann also competed in the 1978 tournament.
Lemieux started his career with the Laval Voisins of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). When he was drafted at age 15, he declared that he would break league records. He made the request to coach Jean Bégin to play on a forward line with Jacques Goyette during the 1983–84 QMJHL season. The combination was successful, as Lemieux broke the league record for points in a season with 282 (133 goals, 149 assists) in 70 games. In his last game of the regular season, Lemieux needed three goals to tie Guy Lafleur&#x27;s record of 130 goals; he scored six and added six assists in a 16–4 victory. During the playoffs, he scored 29 goals and earned 52 points in 14 games, while leading his team to a berth at the 1984 Memorial Cup. His appearance at the Canadian junior ice hockey national championship was highly anticipated, but Lemieux was held to only two goals and three assists as the Laval Voisins lost all three games.

Although he played in the 1983 World Junior Hockey Championships, Lemieux did not play for the Canadian Juniors in 1984 because he disliked how coach Dave King treated him in the previous tournament. He also did not want to break up his junior season. He finished his QMJHL career with 562 points (247 goals, 315 assists) in only 200 games across three seasons. Before the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, Lemieux announced that he wanted to play for whoever drafted him. He and his agent were deadlocked with the Pittsburgh Penguins and could not negotiate a contract. Because of this, when the Penguins called his name as the first overall draft pick, he did not shake general manager Eddie Johnston&#x27;s hand nor don the Penguins jersey, which is NHL tradition. He claimed he was upset about the contract negotiation, and said that &quot;Pittsburgh doesn&#x27;t want [him] bad enough.&quot; Even though the draft was held in Montreal, over 3,000 fans viewed a broadcast in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Civic Arena; a typical Penguins game drew fewer than 7,000 fans at the time. After the draft, Johnston signed Lemieux to a two-year contract for $600,000 plus a $150,000 signing bonus.

==Playing career==

===1984–1988: Early career===
At the start of Lemieux&#x27;s career, the Penguins were in financial turmoil and there were rumors of relocation. The team had declared bankruptcy after the 1974–75 season, and by 1983, they were averaging fewer than 7,000 fans per game—less than half of the Civic Arena&#x27;s capacity. They had not made the playoffs since 1982, and had not had a winning season since 1979.

He debuted on October 11, 1984, against the Boston Bruins, and on his first shift, he stole the puck from Hall of Fame defenceman Ray Bourque and scored a goal with his first NHL shot against Pete Peeters. Later that season, Lemieux played in the NHL All-Star Game and became the first rookie to be named the All-Star Game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Despite missing seven games during the season, Lemieux scored 100 points and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the rookie of the year.

The next season, Lemieux finished second in league scoring with 141 points, behind Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s NHL-record 215 points. He won the Lester B. Pearson Award as the NHL&#x27;s best regular-season player as voted by his peers. Lemieux missed 17 games of the 1986–87 NHL season—his point production slipped, and the Penguins once again failed to make the playoffs. However, he played in the Canada Cup during the summer of 1987 and set a tournament record 11 goals in 9 games; his last goal, which clinched the Canadian victory, broke a tie with the Soviet team with 1:26 remaining in the third period. Lemieux cited his Canada Cup experience as the reason for his elevated play later on, stating, &quot;Remember, I was only 21 years old at the time. To be around guys like Wayne [Gretzky] and Mark Messier and Paul Coffey ... was a tremendous learning experience.&quot;

By the 1987–88 season, Wayne Gretzky already won seven consecutive Art Ross Trophies for leading the league in points. That season, fuelled by his Canada Cup experience, Lemieux scored 168 points and won his first NHL scoring title. He also won his first Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player to his team, and the All-Star Game MVP award after a record-setting six-point game. Despite Lemieux&#x27;s success, the Penguins finished one point out of the playoffs. They did, however, have their first winning record in nine years.

===1988–1992: 199 points===
In the 1988–89 season, Lemieux led the league with 114 assists (tied with Gretzky) and 85 goals for 199 points; he is the only player to approach Gretzky&#x27;s mammoth 200+ point seasons. Lemieux finished the season a close second to Gretzky in voting for the Hart Trophy, and set several milestones and records in the process, becoming the second player to score 70+ goals in two seasons, the fourth player to score 50 goals in 50 games, and the only player to score 13 shorthanded goals in one season. Buoyed in part by Lemieux&#x27;s performance, the Penguins made the playoffs for the first time in seven years.

Perhaps the defining moment of Lemieux&#x27;s season was on December 31, 1988, in a game against the New Jersey Devils. In that game, Lemieux scored eight points and became the only player in NHL history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game: even-strength, power-play, shorthanded, penalty shot, and empty-net. Lemieux had another five-goal, eight-point performance in a 10–7 victory during the postseason against the Philadelphia Flyers on April 25, 1989. He tied the NHL record for most goals and points in a postseason game, most goals in a postseason period (four in the first), and most assists in a postseason period (three in the second). However, the Penguins lost the series 4–3.

During the 1989–90 NHL season, Lemieux scored at least one point in 46 consecutive games before he ended the streak by leaving a game due to injury. The streak&#x27;s length was second only to Gretzky&#x27;s 51-game streak. Lemieux won his third All-Star Game MVP with a four-goal performance. Although he missed 21 games, he finished fourth in the league in scoring with 123 points (45 goals, 78 assists). The Penguins did not qualify for the playoffs.

Lemieux&#x27;s back injury progressed into a herniated disc, which subsequently developed an infection. On July 11, 1990, Lemieux underwent back surgery to fix the disk, and he missed 50 games in the 1990–91 NHL season. In his absence, the Penguins acquired players Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Ron Francis, and Ulf Samuelsson in hopes of becoming serious contenders for the Stanley Cup. Despite significant back pain, Lemieux scored 16 goals and 28 assists for the playoff lead, and led the Penguins over the Minnesota North Stars for their first Stanley Cup. Lemieux won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs&#x27; most valuable player. His 44 playoff points rank second only to Gretzky&#x27;s 47 in 1985.

One of the most famous goals in NHL history is the goal Lemieux scored in the second period of game two. Receiving the puck in the Penguins&#x27; zone, Lemieux skated solo into the North Stars&#x27; zone facing two defencemen and the goalie by himself. Lemieux skirted the puck through one of the defenders&#x27; (Shawn Chambers) legs, skated around him, forced the goaltender to commit left, then switched the puck to his backhand side and slid the puck in before crashing into the net himself. The brief video of the goal has been since featured on recent Stanley Cup promo ads by the NHL (played in reverse), as well as the opening montage of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcasts.

Lemieux played only 64 games in his injury-plagued 1991–92 season. Despite missing several games, he won his third Art Ross Trophy with 131 points. During the second game of the Patrick Division finals, the New York Rangers&#x27; Adam Graves slashed and broke Lemieux&#x27;s left hand; Lemieux missed five games, but still led the playoffs with 16 goals and 18 assists. The Penguins swept the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals to earn their second consecutive Stanley Cup, and Lemieux won the Conn Smythe Trophy for the second consecutive postseason. Lemieux racked up an astonishing 78 combined points during the 1991 and 1992 playoffs, a two-year total second only to Gretzky&#x27;s 82 points as his Oilers won their first and second Stanley Cup titles in 1984 and 1985.

===1992–1997: Cancer, return, and retirement===

The Penguins started the 1992–93 season well, and Lemieux set a franchise record with at least one goal in twelve consecutive games, from October 6 to November 1. He was on pace to challenge Gretzky&#x27;s records of 92 goals in one season (1981–82) and 215 points in one season (1985–86), until January 12, 1993, when he made the announcement that he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. He received aggressive radiation treatments which caused him to miss two months of play. When Lemieux returned, he was 12 points behind Buffalo&#x27;s Pat LaFontaine in the scoring race.

On the day of his last radiation treatment, Lemieux flew to Philadelphia to play against the Flyers, where he scored a goal and an assist in a 5–4 loss. Before the game Lemieux earned a standing ovation from Philadelphia fans—a rare occurrence for any visiting player, much less a rival Pittsburgh athlete. The Penguins won the President&#x27;s Trophy, and the team&#x27;s 119 points are still a franchise record. Lemieux scored at an incredible pace, notching an average 2.67 points per game—the third-highest points-per-game for a season, behind only Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 1983–84 and 1985–86 averages of 2.77 and 2.69 points per game, respectively. Lemieux won his second straight and fourth overall scoring title, finishing with 160 points (69 goals, 91 assists) in 60 games, beating out LaFontaine by 12 points despite playing in 24 fewer games. Throughout the season, Lemieux scored at least one point in 54 of his 60 games played.

The Penguins dispatched the New Jersey Devils in the first round in five games, but were upset by the New York Islanders in seven. After the season, Lemieux was awarded his second Hart Trophy, as well as the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, given to the player who best exemplifies perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey.

On July 23, 1993, Lemieux underwent his second back surgery, this time to repair a herniated muscle. He missed the first ten games of the season to recover from surgery and missed an additional 48 games due to the injury. After the season, he announced that he would take a leave of absence because of fatigue brought on by his radiation treatment. Lemieux returned for the 1995–96 season and on October 26, 1995, against the New York Islanders, he scored his 500th career goal in his 605th game. Lemieux reached 500 goals at the second fastest rate. Only Gretzky achieved the plateau faster scoring 500 goals in 575 games. Lemieux finished the season with 69 goals and 92 assists to lead the league and then became the seventh player to win three Hart Trophies and the fourth player to win five Art Ross Trophies. Despite his return, the Penguins fell to the Florida Panthers in the Eastern Conference Final in seven games.

The next season, Lemieux, playing against the Vancouver Canucks, scored his 600th career goal in his 719th game, and went on to put up his tenth career 100-point season, both the second-most in history after Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 600 goals in 718 games and fifteen 100-point seasons. In his last game against his hometown Montreal, Lemieux tied an NHL record for most goals in a period, with four goals in the third. Lemieux won his sixth scoring title with 122 points (50 goals, 72 assists). On April 6, 1997, Lemieux announced that he planned to retire following the playoffs. The Penguins were eliminated in five games by the Eric Lindros-led Philadelphia Flyers during the first round. Lemieux scored one goal and earned an assist in his final game. Despite the typically hostile Philadelphia crowd, Lemieux skated around the ice following the final horn and received a standing ovation. Upon his first retirement, Lemieux became the only player to retire from the NHL with a greater than 2 points per game average (1494 points in 745 games). On November 17, 1997, Lemieux was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, becoming the ninth player in history to have the mandatory three-year waiting period waived.

===1997–2000: Post-retirement===
The Penguins&#x27; free-spending ways of the early 1990s came at a high price. Through most of the 1990s, Penguins owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg mismanaged the team, owing over $90 million to various creditors. As a consequence, the Penguins asked Lemieux and other prominent players to defer their salaries. The team was also forced to make several trades to stop the bleeding, most of which backfired.

The situation became so dire that the Penguins were forced to declare bankruptcy in November 1998. For most of the 1998–99 NHL season, it looked like the Penguins would either move out of town or fold altogether. At this point, Lemieux stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team. Years of deferred salaries, adding up to $32.5 million, had made him the Penguins&#x27; largest creditor. He proposed to convert $20 million of his deferred salary into equity, with another $5 million in cash, enough to give him controlling interest. He also promised to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The U.S. bankruptcy court gave preliminary approval to Lemieux&#x27;s bid on June 24. Lemieux later said that he would have put in a bid even if he had not been owed the deferred salary. The NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors approved his application for ownership on September 1, 1999. Two days later, after Lemieux cut a deal with Fox Sports Pittsburgh (the Penguins&#x27; TV broadcaster) and Spectacor Management Group (which operated the Civic Arena), the court gave final approval to Lemieux&#x27;s reorganization plan, allowing him to formally assume control. This made the then-retired star the first former NHL player to become majority owner of his former team. Lemieux assumed the posts of president, chairman, and CEO of the Penguins.

Lemieux&#x27;s plan was designed to pay everyone the organization owed. In fact, the bankruptcy court approved his bid in part because of the prospect that the debt would be fully retired—a rare feat, considering that unsecured creditors typically get only pennies on the dollar. In his first season as principal owner Pittsburgh went from a loss of $16 million from the previous season into a small profit of $47,000. Ticket sales increased after Lemieux&#x27;s takeover and even more after his comeback in 2000, also improving team finances. In August 2005, the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; reported that the Penguins had indeed fully paid the principal it owed to each of its creditors, both secured and unsecured. Lemieux was given much of the credit, according to the article, for his insistence that everyone owed be paid. He later relinquished the president&#x27;s and CEO&#x27;s posts to Ken Sawyer, but remained chairman and principal owner. In January 2006, Lemieux confirmed the team was for sale, but would consider offers only from those who would keep the team in Pittsburgh.

===2000–2006: Out of retirement===

Late in 2000, there were rumours that Lemieux was attempting a comeback. Upon announcing his comeback, Lemieux also signed a &quot;career spanning deal&quot; with Nike to wear their equipment on the ice, and to endorse their products off the ice. This deal would include Lemieux endorsing their line of footwear and their golf equipment. It is said that the deal was worth $500,000 (US) a season and would remain in effect for the rest of his career. At the press conference confirming his return, Lemieux indicated part of his reason was that his only son Austin, then four, wanted to see his father play.

On December 27, 2000, he returned to the NHL against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The game was nationally broadcast on ESPN2 in the US and on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. Lemieux proved that his scoring touch had not disappeared by scoring a goal and three points, including an assist 33 seconds into the first shift of his return. While Jaromír Jágr remained captain of the Penguins, Lemieux was named captain of the North American All-Stars during the midseason All-Star game in Denver, Colorado. Despite playing in only 43 games in 2000–01, Lemieux scored 76 points to finish 26th in scoring, finishing the season with the highest points-per-game average that season among NHL players. In fact, he had the highest points-per-game average amongst NHL players for the entire period from his 2000–01 return until his final retirement in 2005–06. Lemieux was one of the three finalists for the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson NHLPA awards and earned a selection on the postseason NHL All-Star second team.

Lemieux led the Penguins in the postseason and led in playoff scoring for much of it. His team surprised many by going to the Eastern Conference finals, knocking off the higher-seeded Washington Capitals and Buffalo Sabres along the way in six and seven games, respectively. The Penguins lost in five games to the top-seeded New Jersey Devils, as their players held Lemieux and Jágr without a goal that series. Lemieux finished Game Five in the penalty box after slashing the Devils&#x27; John Madden; afterwards Lemieux signed his stick and handed it to a young fan.

Before the start of the 2001–02 season, Pittsburgh was forced to trade most of their expensive players, so the team plummeted to the bottom of the NHL and missed the playoffs in each of the next four seasons. Lemieux again resumed the captaincy, as Jaromír Jágr was sent to the Washington Capitals. However, Lemieux only appeared in 24 games, partially due to injuries that would also plague him for the next three seasons. He also skipped some Penguins games in 2001–02 so he could be in condition to play what would be his only chance at the Olympics in his career. However, Lemieux played only one more game after the Salt Lake City Olympics before being out for the rest of the season due to a nagging hip problem, leading one Pittsburgh columnist to demand that Lemieux apologize for making Team Canada his priority.

Radio show host Mark Madden said he would donate $6,600 to the Mario Lemieux Foundation if the hockey great ever scored off a faceoff. On December 23, 2002, the Penguins played the Buffalo Sabres in Pittsburgh and Lemieux, who was aware of the challenge, made good on it when he scored the game-winning goal right off a faceoff during the third period.

In 2002–03, at the age of 37, Lemieux led the NHL in scoring for most of the season but missed most of the games towards the end of the schedule and finished eighth in scoring with 91 points in only 67 games. Lemieux missed all but ten games during the 2003–04 season.

After the lock-out concluded, Lemieux returned to the ice for the 2005–06 season. Hopes for the Penguins were high due to the salary cap and revenue sharing, which enabled the team to compete in the market for several star players. Another reason for optimism was the Penguins winning the lottery for the first draft pick, enabling them to select Sidney Crosby. Lemieux opened up his home to Crosby to help the rookie settle in Pittsburgh, and served as Crosby&#x27;s mentor.

====Player/owner status====
Lemieux&#x27;s unique status as player and owner placed him in a potential conflict of interest with respect to NHL labour negotiations. Because he was also an owner, Lemieux was no longer a member of the National Hockey League Players Association, although he still paid union dues to maintain his pension. By agreement with the NHLPA, Lemieux was paid the average league salary of about $1.4 million and it was from this amount that his union dues were calculated and deducted. He did not vote in owners&#x27; meetings, delegating this role to a Penguins vice-president. He suggested that the NHL adopt a salary structure similar to the National Football League, which has a hard salary cap. Lemieux and fellow NHL team executive Gretzky brought the parties together in a last-ditch effort to save what remained of the 2004–05 season, but no agreement was reached and the season was lost.

==Post-playing career==
On January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second and permanent retirement from professional hockey at the age of 40. This followed a half-season in which he struggled not only with the increased speed of the &quot;new NHL&quot; but also with atrial fibrillation, which caused him to experience irregular heartbeats. Although he had put up points at a pace that most NHL forwards would be very content with (22 points in 26 games) in his last season, Lemieux still remarked that &quot;I can no longer play at a level I was accustomed to in the past.&quot;

In October 2006, Lemieux&#x27;s ownership group announced that it had reached an agreement to sell the Penguins to Research In Motion Chairman and Co-CEO Jim Balsillie. However, Balsillie unexpectedly rescinded his offer two months later after an apparent dispute with the NHL Board of Governors over purchasing conditions, despite Balsillie having earlier pledged to the Board that he would not relocate the team. Lemieux was offended that Balsillie had pulled out at last minute and initially refused to return Balsillie&#x27;s deposit, saying that it was in breach of their agreement.

On March 13, 2007, Lemieux&#x27;s ownership group announced a final agreement for a new multi-purpose arena, eventually to be named Consol Energy Center, to be built across the street from Mellon Arena. The deal keeps the Penguins in Pittsburgh for at least 30 years. Lemieux was instrumental in negotiating this deal, despite outside efforts to move the team to Kansas City. It was later revealed that Lemieux did visit Kansas City only to put pressure on the city and state to push through plans for the new arena.

The Penguins returned to the playoffs, losing in five games to the Ottawa Senators in 2007, and making the Finals in 2008 where they lost in six games to the Detroit Red Wings. On June 12, 2009, Lemieux won his third Stanley Cup title, this time as an owner as the Penguins won a rematch with the Red Wings in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals, in seven games. In 2015, Lemieux and Ron Burkle hired Morgan Stanley to explore the possibility of selling the Penguins. On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the San Jose Sharks in the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals, in six games, to give Lemieux his fourth Stanley Cup, his second as an owner. Almost exactly a year later, on June 11, 2017, Lemieux won his third Stanley Cup as an owner upon the Penguins six-game defeat of the Nashville Predators.

==International play==
Lemieux played for Canada in the 1983 World Junior Championships (bronze medal), 1985 World Championships (silver medal), 1987 Canada Cup (championship), 2002 Winter Olympics (captain, gold medal) and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey (captain, championship).

At the 2002 Winter Olympics, having been selected by Gretzky to captain the roster, the then-36-year-old Lemieux led the Canadian men&#x27;s team into Salt Lake City, United States. The team had failed to win a gold medal at the Olympics in fifty years but were still considered favourites to win. Lemieux was second to Joe Sakic in team scoring with six points in five games, and led the team to gold by defeating the United States 5–2 in the final game. Lemieux showcased his amazing hockey intelligence during the gold medal game against the United States. With Team Canada trailing 1–0 in the first period, Lemieux made one of the most famous and savvy plays in Olympic hockey history. After a cross-ice pass from Lemieux in the neutral zone, Canadian defenceman Chris Pronger carried the puck across the blue line into the American zone, and fired a pass across the zone. Lemieux then faked like he was receiving the pass and proceeded to take a shot at the net, all while letting the puck slide through his legs, knowing he had forward Paul Kariya streaking behind him. Lemieux&#x27;s fake caused American goalie Mike Richter to lunge in Lemieux&#x27;s direction, and thus created a wide-open net for Kariya to fire the puck in, as he received the pass from Pronger after Lemieux let it go to Kariya. During the tournament, his hip injury required several painkilling injections to keep him on the ice, and he only played one more NHL game after the Olympics before being lost for the season.

He would then play in his final international event, once again captaining Team Canada to victory in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, where he&#x27;d be Team Canada&#x27;s fourth leading scorer, despite being 38 years old, having injuries, and playing in just 10 NHL games that year. Lemieux was also selected by team Canada for the 2006 Winter Olympics, but declined due to health.

==Personal life==
Early in his career, Lemieux smoked, at one point consuming a pack of cigarettes daily. He gave up the habit, perhaps due to Hodgkin lymphoma. 

Lemieux married Nathalie Asselin on June 26, 1993. They have four children: Lauren (born April 1993), Stephanie (born 1995), Austin Nicholas (born 1996), and Alexa (born 1997). Austin was born prematurely, weighing just two pounds, five ounces, but he is perfectly healthy today, and played college hockey at Arizona State University. The family lives in the affluent Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickley. Lemieux also had a second home in Quebec near Mont-Tremblant which was built starting in 2009, costs US$20 million, and came to be known as the Chateau Fleur de Lys; he put the house up for sale in 2018.

Lemieux has opened his home to young Penguins stars such as Marc-André Fleury and Sidney Crosby until they settled into the Pittsburgh area, as he did with Jaromír Jágr following the 1990 NHL Entry Draft when he lived in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He is a naturalized American citizen, and on March 30, 2007, Lemieux, a registered Republican, contributed $2,300 to Democratic US Senator Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign fund. In the past, he has also made contributions to the re-election fund of Republican former US Senator Rick Santorum.

On June 17, 2009, Lemieux was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec (CQ) by then Quebec Premier Jean Charest.

In the 2010 Canadian honours, Lemieux was made an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) from then Governor General Michaëlle Jean.

Lemieux has been criticized for his involvement in multiple sexual assault scandals. In 1992, Lemieux was in the same room while his former teammate Dan Quinn allegedly raped a woman. In 2000, while Lemieux owned the team, the Penguins signed Billy Tibbetts, who was convicted of raping an unconscious 15-year-old girl when he was 17 years old. When asked about the signing, Lemieux said: &quot;I think that’s a great story. That kid faced so much adversity, did his time, came back after three and a half years. To find himself in the NHL is a great accomplishment.&quot; In 2021, Lemieux, Penguins assistant general manager Bill Guerin, and the Penguins were sued by Erin Skalde, the ex-wife of former Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins (WBS Penguins) coach Jack Skalde. Erin Skalde alleged that they attempted to cover up her being sexually assaulted by former WBS Penguins coach John Donatelli. Jack Skalde alleged that he was fired after complaining to the team, which he said was a violation of whistleblower laws.

==Charitable causes==
In 1993, the same year he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, Lemieux created the Mario Lemieux Foundation to fund medical research projects. Additionally, the foundation supports other organizations, including the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the Leukemia Society, the Lupus Foundation and the Children&#x27;s Home of Pittsburgh. In 2007, he was among the well-known athletes who founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.

With their son, Austin, being born prematurely in 1996, the Lemieux family spent quite a bit of time in the hospital with Austin, including 71 days after his birth. The family found that the older children didn&#x27;t have a place to play in the hospital. Using the Lemieux Foundation resources, driven by Nathalie&#x27;s idea and vision, founded a program called &quot;Austin&#x27;s Playroom Project&quot;. The project builds play rooms in various hospitals across the US to give both children who are patients and their healthy siblings a place to play and &quot;be kids&quot; and concentrate on being normal and healing. On January 31, 2014, the foundation announced the opening of the twenty-ninth Austin&#x27;s Playroom at the new Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, Camp Pendleton, California.

==Legacy==

A statue in his honour, created by sculptor Bruce Wolfe, was erected in Pittsburgh on March 7, 2012, outside the Consol Energy Center. The statue is modelled after a play in a 1988 game against the New York Islanders where Lemieux slipped in between Islanders defencemen Rich Pilon and Jeff Norton to score a goal in a 5–3 Penguins victory. Both Pilon and Norton (the latter of which would later play for the Penguins during Lemieux&#x27;s comeback season), as well as the Islanders, are unbranded on their portion of the statue.

In 1992, local confectioner D. L. Clark Company produced a Mario Bar, modelled on the caramel Bun Bar, featuring his image on the packaging and including collectors&#x27; trading cards.

<doc id="148879" wikidata="Q234425" url="?curid=148879" title="Ai Yazawa">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist and illustrator. Yazawa debuted as a manga artist with her short story &quot;Ano Natsu&quot; (1985). She gained mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s with her series &quot;Tenshi Nanka ja Nai&quot; (1991), &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot; (1995), &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; (1999), and &quot;Nana&quot; (2000), the latter being one of the best-selling manga series. Since June 2009, Yazawa has been focusing on illustration projects due to health concerns.

==Early life==

Yazawa started reading manga magazines when she was 10 years old, and when she was 12 years old, she attempted to draw manga and submitted it to &quot;Ribon&quot; Manga School, making it into the lowest class. Yazawa began training and submitting her works seriously around age 15, eventually making it into a higher class. As a student, she was a fan of Eikichi Yazawa, whose surname she adopted for her pseudonym.

At the time of her manga debut, Yazawa was 17 years old and in her final year of high school. Unsure of whether she would be able to make a living off of being a manga artist, Yazawa wound up attending to become a stylist. However, once &quot;Ribon&quot; decided to serialize her works, Yazawa dropped out of school to focus on drawing manga, a decision she describes as &quot;disappointing&quot; and &quot;painful&quot; at the time.

==Career==

===1985–1991: Debut and early works===
With the help of an editor, Yazawa debuted as a manga artist on her 10th submission to &quot;Ribon&quot; in 1985 with the short story &quot;Ano Natsu&quot;.

===1991–2009: Mainstream breakthrough===

From 1991 to 1995, Yazawa published &quot;Tenshi Nanka Ja Nai&quot; in &quot;Ribon&quot;, which became her breakthrough series. Following &quot;Tenshi Nanka Ja Nai&quot;, Yazawa went onto publish &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;. After the end of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;, Yazawa created &quot;Last Quarter&quot;.

Yazawa was later requested to draw two short stories to accompany the launch of &quot;Cookie&quot;. This led to the creation of &quot;Nana&quot;, as she decided to make the two stories related to each other so that they would be easier to read if they were later picked up for serialization. In 2003, Yazawa was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for &quot;Nana&quot;. Yazawa illustrated the cover of Rumi Shishido&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Rumi Roll&quot;, who she had been friends with since Shishido was cast as Mikako in the anime adaptation of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;.

In June 2009, Yazawa became hospitalized after contracting an illness, putting &quot;Nana&quot; on indefinite hiatus. She returned from the hospital in April 2010. In 2022, Yazawa stated she was still recovering from her illness and expressed interest in continuing &quot;Nana&quot; in the future.

===2009–present: &quot;Nana&quot; hiatus and illustration work===

Yazawa has focused on illustration work since putting &quot;Nana&quot; on hold. She provided artwork for singer Juju&#x27;s single &quot;Iiwake&quot; in 2017 and a celebratory illustration for &quot;Space Channel 5 VR: Kinda Funky News Flash&quot; in 2020, drew a mini-manga featuring characters from &quot;Tenshi Nanka ja Nai&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot; in 2016, contributed new images to the 2015 &quot;Nana&quot; calendar, and published a new &quot;Junko&#x27;s Room&quot; chapter, her first new manga in over three years, in 2013.

From July 20, 2022, to August 8, 2022, Yazawa held an art exhibit titled &quot;All Time Best&quot;, featuring original manga manuscripts and illustrations for &quot;Tenshi Nanka Ja Nai&quot; and her other series.

On January 31, 2024, Yazawa illustrated a promotional visual as part of a collaboration with fashion brand Lulu Felice, who created wedding dresses based on &quot;Nana&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;.

==Personal life==

Yazawa became hospitalized in June 2009 for an unspecified illness, which caused her to put &quot;Nana&quot; on hiatus. She was discharged in April 2010.

==Artistry and themes==

Yazawa cites manga artists and Ryo Ikuemi as her inspirations, as well as music from the singers Miyuki Nakajima and Yumi Matsutoya. In 2008, &quot;Japanese Visual Culture: Explorations in the World of Manga and Anime&quot; compared her to manga artist Taku Tsumugi for her play with depth and layering. &quot;Animefringe&quot; columnist Steve Diabo noted that Yazawa&#x27;s works feature her &quot;bizarre&quot; sense of humor, with Yazawa often making cameos in her own works.

While Yazawa initially started drawing manga using dip pens and brushes, after the conclusion of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot; in 1996, she began using drawing pens, oil pastels and markers. However, Yazawa also stated that she would return to use dip pens and brushes for &quot;Last Quarter&quot; as the tools helped her convey the mood of the series. For color manuscripts, Yazawa used color ink until working on &quot;Marine Blue no Kaze ni Dakarete&quot;, and after &quot;Tenshi Nanka ja Nai&quot;, Yazawa began using digital tools. Currently, she uses an iPad and MacBook to illustrate.

Yazawa&#x27;s work has been highlighted for its focus on Japanese alternative fashion; from 1998 to 1999, fashion magazine &quot;&quot; ran features on Mikako Komatsu, the main character of &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;, and produced sewing patterns based on Happy Berry, a fictional fashion brand by the character. In addition, Yazawa prominently features Vivienne Westwood in &quot;Nana&quot;, and some clothing featured in the show are based on clothing from her own personal collection. In 2024, through a survey of 100 people by &quot;TV Maga&quot; (a web magazine operated by ), &quot;Nana&quot; was voted no. 1 for most fashionable manga, along with Yazawa&#x27;s other works &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot; following at no. 2.

<doc id="148881" wikidata="Q696918" url="?curid=148881" title="JoJo's Bizarre Adventure">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was originally serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly manga magazine &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; in 2005. The series is divided into a total of nine story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the &quot;JoJo&quot; nickname. &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; is the largest ongoing manga series published by Shueisha by number of volumes, with its chapters collected in 136 volumes as of December 2024.

A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga&#x27;s third part, &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot;, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, &quot;Phantom Blood&quot;, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting &quot;Phantom Blood&quot; and &quot;Battle Tendency&quot; began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of December 2022, the studio has produced five seasons consisting of 190 total episodes adapting through the manga&#x27;s sixth part, &quot;Stone Ocean&quot;. A live-action film based on the fourth part, &quot;Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;, was released in Japan in 2017.

&quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; is well known for its art style and poses, frequent references to Western popular music and fashion, and battles centered around Stands, psycho-spiritual manifestations with unique supernatural abilities. The series had over 120 million copies in circulation by August 2023, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and it has spawned a media franchise including one-shot manga, light novels, and video games. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.
== Plot ==
The universe of &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings. In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a ; another significant form of energy is , a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. The narrative of &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. Each of the series&#x27; protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular &quot;JoJo&quot;. The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter three parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.

; Part 1: 
: Volumes 1–5, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century England, Jonathan Joestar, the young son of a wealthy landowner, meets his new adopted brother Dio Brando, who loathes him and plans to usurp his position as heir to the Joestar family. When Dio&#x27;s attempts are thwarted, he transforms himself into a vampire using an ancient Stone Mask and destroys the Joestar estate. Jonathan embarks on a journey, meets new allies, and masters the martial arts technique to stop Dio, who has made world domination his new goal.
; Part 2: 
: Volumes 5–12, 69 chapters. In 1938, German researchers discover three lifeforms called Pillar Men, powerful humanoids responsible for the creation of the Stone Mask. The Pillar Men awaken and escape in search of the Red Stone of Aja, which will turn them into invincible superbeings. Joseph Joestar, Jonathan&#x27;s grandson, unites with new allies and masters Hamon to defeat the Pillar Men and their leader Kars.
; Part 3: 
: Volumes 13–28, 152 chapters. In 1989, Dio Brando (now referred to as only &quot;DIO&quot;) awakens after his coffin is salvaged from the ocean. Because Dio had managed to take over Jonathan&#x27;s body, Stands awaken in Jonathan&#x27;s descendants, including Joseph, his daughter Holy Kujo, and his grandson Jotaro Kujo. Holy, however, is unable to control her own Stand, which begins to slowly kill her. Jotaro, Joseph, and their allies set out to defeat Dio before Holy&#x27;s Stand takes her life, fighting off Dio&#x27;s henchmen along the way.
; Part 4: 
: Volumes 29–47, 174 chapters. In 1999, the Joestar family learns that Joseph has an illegitimate son, Josuke Higashikata, who lives in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh. While visiting Morioh, Jotaro learns of a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands upon those struck by it. As they hunt down the Bow and Arrow, Josuke, Jotaro, and their allies are targeted by Stand-using serial killer Yoshikage Kira and his father Yoshihiro, who see them as a threat to the former&#x27;s peace and tranquility.
; Part 5: 
: Volumes 47–63, 155 chapters. Giorno Giovanna is the son of Dio, conceived while the vampire was in possession of Jonathan Joestar&#x27;s body. In 2001, in Naples, Italy, Giorno seeks to become a mafia boss in order to eliminate drug dealers who sell their wares to children. Finding a powerful ally in Bruno Bucciarati, Giorno and Bucciarati&#x27;s team rebel against the boss of the mafia to protect his daughter, Trish Una, whom he intends to kill in order to hide his identity.
; Part 6: 
: Volumes 64–80, 158 chapters. In 2011, near Port St. Lucie, Florida, Jotaro Kujo&#x27;s daughter Jolyne Cujoh is framed for murder and sent to prison. She works together with various allies to hunt down the person responsible for her framing: prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, a loyalist to Dio who seeks the creation of a new universe shaped to the late vampire&#x27;s will.
; Part 7:

== Production ==

For &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base before introducing modern elements. As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but uses surreal colors. Araki aimed to draw real spirits in &quot;JoJo&quot; resulting in him going to the Kappa River in Tōno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept. Araki was inspired by the art of the 1980s, shading techniques in Western art, and classical paintings; the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency, with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration. He also claimed that mystery is the central theme of the manga, as he was fascinated by it as a child. Furthermore, Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, resulting in various concepts such as Hamon and Stands. He said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men. For &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot; in particular, Araki was influenced by role-playing games in designing the characters&#x27; skills.

In creating the manga&#x27;s generational story, Araki thought much about death and the legacy people leave behind in their lives for their descendants, after the death of his grandfather. He took inspiration from &quot;&quot; and &quot;East of Eden&quot;. Araki focused on &quot;Roots&quot; for its family-centric story, and he took the idea of intertwined destiny and rivalry between two families from &quot;East of Eden&quot;. He thought highly of stories that were well-received after changing protagonists, which influenced Araki&#x27;s decision to kill Jonathan Joestar and write a generational story, passing on his &quot;Spirit&quot; to his own descendants.

None of the characters were modeled after anyone, except Jotaro Kujo, who was based on Clint Eastwood. Araki stated that he wanted to try a different type of main character for every part; for example, Part 1&#x27;s Jonathan Joestar was a serious and honest person, whereas Part 2&#x27;s Joseph Joestar was a trickster. Although their personalities are different, the two share a physical resemblance in order to have some continuity because it was unheard of in the 1980s for a main character to die in a &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; series. Araki&#x27;s consistent focus on the Joestar family was intended to give a feeling of pride as well as the wonder and mystery surrounding the lineage.

Araki originally planned the series as a trilogy, with the final confrontation taking place in present-day Japan. However, Araki did not want Part 3 to be a tournament affair, which was popular in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; at the time, and therefore decided to make it a &quot;road movie&quot; inspired by &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. With Part 4, Araki said that he moved away from &quot;muscle men&quot; as they fell out of popularity with readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion. When designing his characters&#x27; outfits, Araki considers both everyday fashion and &quot;cartoonish, bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life&quot;. For Part 6, Araki wrote a female protagonist for the first time which he found complicated, but also interesting due to the humanity she could possess. He later described Part 2&#x27;s much earlier supporting character Lisa Lisa as fresh and &quot;unheard of&quot; in both manga and society in general for its time, and said it was exciting to challenge people&#x27;s expectations with the female warrior-type. Having not specifically set out on creating a disabled character, Araki explained that Part 7&#x27;s paraplegic Johnny Joestar was a natural result of wanting to show a character who could grow, both physically and mentally, during a race where &quot;he would be forced not only to rely on other people, but horses as well.&quot;

Araki uses unique onomatopoeia and poses in the series, which he attributes to his love for heavy metal and horror films. The poses, which are known in Japan as , are iconic on his book covers and panels, and were inspired by Araki&#x27;s trip to Italy in his 20s and his studies of Michelangelo&#x27;s sculptures.

It ran until April 2011, and was collected in 24 volumes. &quot;JoJolion&quot;, the eighth part, was serialized from May 2011 to August 2021 and collected in 27 volumes. In the September 2021 issue of &quot;Ultra Jump&quot;, Araki stated in the author&#x27;s notes that part 9 of the series, tentatively titled &quot;JoJoLands&quot; and later finalized as &quot;The JoJoLands&quot;, would begin following a short break. It began on February 19, 2023.

Between November 2005 and December 2010, Viz published &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot;, the most well-known part in the series, in 16 volumes. However, the company changed the names of several characters and Stands due to legal concerns and censored certain scenes, including scenes of animal violence redrawn by Araki himself. In 2013, Viz expressed further interest in localizing the series, but explained its difficulties in doing so due to Araki&#x27;s numerous references to real musicians and fashion designers. Viz began publishing the JoJonium release of &quot;Phantom Blood&quot; digitally in September 2014, with a three-volume hardcover print edition following throughout 2015. &quot;Battle Tendency&quot; was published in four volumes in 2015 and 2016, and &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot; was published in ten volumes from 2016 to 2019.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===

It is one of the best-selling &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; series of all time.

According to &quot;ICv2&quot;, &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; was the eighth best-selling manga franchise of Q4 2021 (September–December) in the United States.

=== Critical reception ===
Reviewing the first volume, IGN named &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; a &quot;must read&quot;, declaring the artwork of &quot;a standard virtually unseen in most manga produced today.&quot; &quot;Otaku USA&quot;″s Joseph Luster called the series &quot;fun as hell&quot; and noted how the beginning is not filled with action like most &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; series, but instead has the tension of horror and thriller films. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network wrote that the first volume &quot;combines a fighting story with a solid emotional background, and will absolutely put hair on your chest.&quot; She called Dio an excellent villain that the readers can enjoy hating. However, she criticized the anatomy of characters, saying &quot;bodies are often twisted into impossible positions.&quot; &quot;Comics &amp; Gaming Magazine&quot;″s Cole Watson also strongly praised Dio as the highlight character of Part 1, stating that his eyes were glued to the page whenever he appeared, and described him as &quot;the literal embodiment of Satan in manga form.&quot; Watson gave &quot;Phantom Blood&quot; a 7.5 out of 10, writing that while there is a lot to enjoy, it primarily serves as Dio&#x27;s origin story and there are some moments that are &quot;agonizingly slow&quot;.

Silverman described Part 2 as &quot;less urgent&quot; than Part 1, which allows for more humor and insanity, while still letting the reader get attached to the characters. She felt positively about how strikingly different the protagonist Joseph is from Part 1&#x27;s Jonathan. However, she wrote that Araki&#x27;s art had gotten even more &quot;physically improbable&quot;, making it difficult to distinguish body parts. When discussing his views on having characters die in a series, writer Gen Urobuchi cited &quot;Battle Tendency&quot;″s Caesar Zeppeli as a character who became &quot;immortal&quot; thanks to his death.

Reviewing &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot;, Silverman enjoyed seeing Part 2&#x27;s Joseph team up with new protagonist Jotaro and was impressed that Araki was able to keep Dio out of Part 2 completely, only to bring him back for Part 3. She initially called the replacement of Hamon with Stands both understandable and a bit of a disappointment, since the &quot;insane physical abilities and contortions&quot; caused by the former were a large source of the fun in the first two parts. Silverman later described Stand battles as exciting and creative in subsequent reviews.

Anime News Network had both Silverman and Faye Hopper review the first volume of Part 4. Silverman called the beginning slower and not as instantly engrossing as the previous parts, but felt this allowed Josuke, whom she and Hopper both described as kinder than the previous protagonists, to develop as a character. Hopper stated that &quot;Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot; is sometimes criticized for a &quot;lack of a strong narrative throughline&quot; in comparison to other parts, but argued that this is one of its greatest strengths as it allows the main characters to &quot;simply be, lending them an amiable humanity that none of the over-the-top archetypes in the first 3 Parts ever had.&quot;

Both Screen Rant&#x27;s Steven Blackburn and Jordan Richards of AIPT Comics called &quot;Golden Wind&quot; a breath of fresh air for &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; by deviating from the basic formula and following Giorno, son of villain Dio Brando, as he looks to cement a reputation and build a criminal empire. Jenni Lada of Siliconera also praised the protagonist Giorno and said the first volume of Part 5 shows how skilled Araki is at getting people quickly invested in a character and story. She wrote, by giving readers a look at Giorno&#x27;s past and insights into the person he is now, it emphasizes why he is compelling; &quot;We&#x27;re introduced to his dream and see him take his first steps toward it.&quot; Despite calling the supporting cast a memorable bunch, Richards felt they were underdeveloped as of the first volume, but noted they had potential.

Heidi Kemps, also of &quot;Otaku USA&quot;, was mostly positive in her review of &quot;Rohan at the Louvre&quot;, praising the art for being drawn in full-color by hand, although noted that readers new to &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; might not fully understand the ending due to there being only a brief explanation of Rohan&#x27;s Stand power.

=== Accolades ===
For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; second on a list of the Top 10 Manga of all time. The series ranked tenth in a 2009 survey by Oricon on what manga series people want to see receive a live-action adaptation. The 2013 edition of &quot;Kono Manga ga Sugoi!&quot;, which surveys people in the manga and publishing industry, named &quot;JoJolion&quot; the twelfth best manga series for male readers. &quot;JoJolion&quot; won the grand prize for manga at the 2013 Japan Media Arts Festival. In November 2014, readers of &quot;Da Vinci&quot; magazine voted &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; as the fifth &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s greatest manga series of all time. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; ranked tenth.

=== Controversy ===
In May 2008, both Shueisha and studio A.P.P.P. halted manga/OVA shipments of &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; after a complaint had been launched against them from anonymous online Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, after noticing a scene in the OVAs that has the villain, Dio Brando, reading a book depicting pages from the Qur&#x27;an. This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, mosques for later printings of the series. Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009. Jason Thompson later included Shueisha&#x27;s changes to the manga on a list of &quot;The Greatest Censorship Fails&quot; in manga.

== Legacy and collaborations ==
The September 2007 issue of &quot;Cell&quot; had a cover drawn by Hirohiko Araki with a ligase represented as a &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; Stand. He also contributed artwork towards the restoration of Chūson-ji following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Araki contributed &quot;JoJo&quot;-inspired art for Sayuri Ishikawa&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;X -Cross-&quot;, where she performs one of the series&#x27; iconic poses and is drawn wearing jewelry from the manga. &quot;JoJo&quot;-style artwork has also been produced for other literature, such as for a 2008 collection featuring Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s short story &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; and a 2012 reprint of Tamaki Saitō&#x27;s &quot;Lacan for Surviving&quot;.

In 2009, Araki&#x27;s was one of five artists featured in the Louvre&#x27;s &quot;Le Louvre invite la bande dessinée&quot; (&quot;The Louvre Invites Comic-Strip Art&quot;) exhibition for his artwork of &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;. To commemorate this honor, he wrote a 123-page full color story starring Rohan Kishibe visiting the Louvre and discovering a cursed painting tied to his family. The following year it was published in France and ran in &quot;Ultra Jump&quot;, and in February 2012 was translated and released in North America by NBM Publishing.

From July 19 to August 18, 2019, the Tower Records store in Shibuya held an exhibit celebrating the finale of the fifth part of the series, &quot;Golden Wind&quot;, and to promote the release of two games, &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Pitter Patter Pop!&quot; and &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Last Survivor&quot;. The exhibit showed various concept art pieces from the series&#x27; artists as well as scripts from the show. Visitors could receive free items such as stickers, folders, and cards upon completion of various tasks, such as answering a quiz or buying a certain amount of items. Each floor of the Tower Records building had a character on display, as a cardboard cutout and on the elevator doors. On August 14, 2019, a panel was held with directors Hideya Takahashi and Yasuhiro Kimura, and producer Kasama.

Several video game characters, such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot;″s Guile and &quot;Tekken&quot;″s Paul Phoenix, were inspired by &quot;JoJo&quot;″s Polnareff. When they discovered a new species of &quot;Neostygarctus&quot; in 2013, scientists Shinta Fujimoto and Katsumi Miyazaki named it &quot;Neostygarctus lovedeluxe&quot; after a Stand from &quot;Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Bite the Dust&quot; by heavy metal band Lovebites was influenced by and named after a Stand from &quot;Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;.

=== Gucci ===

From September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur &quot;Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci&quot; Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, Araki, and the Japanese fashion magazine &quot;Spur&quot;. The exhibit celebrated the 90th anniversary of Gucci and featured a life-size figure of Rohan Kishibe, as well as numerous illustrations by Araki that included actual pieces of the brand&#x27;s own 2011–2012 fall/winter collection and his own original fashion designs. The October 2011 issue of &quot;Spur&quot; featured another one-shot manga titled in which Rohan goes to a Gucci factory to discover the secret behind a magical handbag with the characters wearing and using Gucci products. This was followed by another collaboration in the February 2013 issue of &quot;Spur&quot; with starring Jolyne Cujoh from Part 6. A free English translation of the latter was previously available on Gucci&#x27;s Facebook page. Again, Araki&#x27;s artwork was featured in Gucci&#x27;s storefront displays around the world.

=== 25th anniversary ===
There were several art exhibitions in 2012 in Japan for the manga&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The first was in Sendai, Araki&#x27;s birthplace, where a Lawson store was remodeled to look like the &quot;Owson&quot; store that appears in &quot;Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot; and &quot;JoJolion&quot;. The store was opened from July 28 to September 30, and contained exclusive goods with the Owson name. The second exhibition was held in Tokyo from October 6 to November 4 and hangouts were held on Google Plus to allow fans to view the gallery at night through the lens of , an original &quot;Stand&quot; Araki and his team created for the event. The exhibit was taken to Italy from June 28 to July 14, 2013, and shown at the Gucci showroom in Florence.

The October 2012 issue of &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; contained a special booklet titled &quot;25 Years With JoJo&quot; that also celebrated the anniversary; it featured messages and tribute art from well-known manga artists such as Akira Toriyama, Yoshihiro Togashi, Eiichiro Oda, Clamp, and 18 others. During the 25th anniversary celebrations, a special smartphone with a &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure-&quot;inspired UI was released.

To celebrate the release of the &quot;All Star Battle&quot; video game created for the 25th anniversary, a special JoJo-themed train traveled the Yamanote Line in Tokyo from August 29 to September 9, 2013. Illustrations and advertisements of the series littered the interior, with videos of the game shown on displays, while the exterior had 33 characters as .

<doc id="148882" wikidata="Q746573" url="?curid=148882" title="Harajuku">
<text>is a district in Shibuya, Tokyo. Harajuku is the common name given to a geographic area spreading from Harajuku Station to Omotesando, corresponding on official maps of Shibuya ward as Jingūmae 1 chōme to 4 chōme. In popular reference, Harajuku also encompasses many smaller backstreets such as Takeshita Street and Cat Street spreading from Sendagaya in the north to Shibuya in the south.

Harajuku is known internationally as a center of Japanese youth culture and fashion. Shopping and dining options include many small, youth-oriented, independent boutiques and cafés, but the neighborhood also attracts many larger international chain stores with high-end luxury merchandisers extensively represented along Omotesando.

Harajuku Station on the East Japan Railway (JR East) Yamanote Line and Meiji-jingumae &#x27;Harajuku&#x27; Station served by the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line and Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line also act as gateways to local attractions such as the Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park and Yoyogi National Gymnasium, making Harajuku and its environs one of the most popular destinations in Tokyo for both domestic and international tourists.

==History==
===Pre-Edo period===
In the pre-Edo period, the area that came to be known as Harajuku was a small post town on the Kamakura Highway. It was said that in the Gosannen War, Minamoto no Yoshiie mustered his soldiers in this area and the hill here is called Seizoroi-saka (current Jingūmae 2 chōme). It is said that as the &quot;Igagoe&quot; reward for delivering Ieyasu Tokugawa safely from Sakai to Mikawa in the 1582 Honno-ji Incident, Onden-mura (隠田村) together with Harajuku-mura (原宿村) were given to the Iga ninja in 1590.

In the Edo period, an Iga clan residence was put in Harajuku to defend Edo, due to its strategic location south of the Koshu Road. Other than the mansion of the Hiroshima Domain feudal lord Asano (current Jingūmae 4 and 5 chōme), there were many mansions of shogunate retainers.

The livelihood of the farmers consisted mainly of rice cleaning and flour milling with the watermill at the Shibuya River. However, due to the poor quality of the land, production never succeeded and the villages never prospered. It is said that local farmers often performed rain-making invocations at local shrines in an attempt to improve their fortunes. There are also the tales &quot;Oyama-Afuri Shrine of Tanzawa&quot; and &quot;Worship on the day trip to Mt Haruna&quot; remaining.

===Meiji Restoration to the end of the Second World War (1868–1945)===

At the start of the Meiji period in 1868, the land around Harajuku Village was owned by the shogunate. In November of the same year, the towns and villages of Shibuya Ward, including Harajuku Village, were placed under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo Prefecture.

In 1906, Harajuku Station was opened as a part of the expansion of the Yamanote Line. In 1919, with the establishment of Meiji Shrine, Omotesando was widened and reordered as a formal approach route.

In 1943, the Tōgō Shrine was built and consecrated in honor of Imperial Japanese Navy Marshal-Admiral Marquis Tōgō Heihachirō.

In the final period of the Pacific War in 1945, much of the area was burned to the ground during the Great Tokyo Air Raid.

===1945 to 1970===
During the postwar occupation, military housing in the area named Washington Heights was constructed on land now occupied by Yoyogi Park and the Yoyogi National Gymnasium. Shops that appealed to the US soldiers and their families, such as Kiddyland, Oriental Bazaar, and the Fuji Tori, opened along Omotesando during this period.

In 1964, swimming, diving, and basketball events for the Tokyo Olympics were held at nearby Yoyogi National Gymnasium.

In 1965, the name of the area in the Japanese address system was officially changed from Harajuku to Jingumae. The name Harajuku has persisted due to the earlier naming of the nearby JR East Harajuku Station. Prior to 1965, Onden, referred to the low-lying area close to Meiji Street and the Shibuya River while &quot;Harajuku&quot; referred to the northern end of Omotesando, the plateau around Aoyama, currently known as Jingu-mae block 2, a large area of Jingu-mae block 3, and the plateau extending behind Togo Shrine in Jingu-mae block 1. The area from Harajuku station to the area surrounding Takeshita Street was called &quot;Takeshita-cho&quot;.

===1970s and 1980s===

Coming into the 1970s, fashion-obsessed youth culture experienced a transition, from Shinjuku to Harajuku, then to Shibuya. Palais France, a building that sold fashion clothing and accessories, furniture, and other goods, was constructed on Meiji Street near the exit of Takeshita Street. In 1978, the fashion building Laforet Harajuku was opened; thus, Harajuku came to be widely known as a fashion and retail centre.

In the 1980s, Takeshita Street became known for teenage street dancing groups called takenoko-zoku.

From 1977, a Sundays-only pedestrian precinct was established by closing local roads. This produced a surge in people gathering close to entrances of Yoyogi Park to watch rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers and other new bands performing impromptu open-air gigs. In the peak period, crowds of up to 10,000 people would gather. In 1998, the Sundays-only pedestrian zone was abolished.

===1990s to present===

In the 1990s and 2000s, with the rise of fast fashion, there was an influx of international fashion brand flagship store openings including Gap Inc., Forever 21, Uniqlo, Topshop and H&amp;M. At the same time, new independent fashion trend shops spread into the previously residential areas of Jingumae 3 and 4 chome, with this area becoming known as Ura-Harajuku (the &quot;Harajuku Backstreets&quot;).

In 2006, Omotesando Hills opened, replacing the Dōjunkai apartments on Omotesando.

In 2008, the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line opened, providing alternative metro access linking Harajuku to Shibuya and Ikebukuro.

===2019 New Year&#x27;s Day terrorist attack===

During the early morning of January 1, 2019, a 21-year-old man named Kazuhiro Kusakabe drove his Kei car into the crowd of pedestrians celebrating New Year&#x27;s Day on Takeshita Street. The man claimed his actions were a terrorist attack, and later stated that his intention was to retaliate against the usage of the death penalty. The man attempted to flee from the scene but was soon apprehended by authorities in a nearby park.

==Sightseeing and local landmarks==
Harajuku is a retail fashion and dining destination in its own right, but still earns much of its wider reputation as a gathering place for fans and aficionados of Japanese street fashion and associated subcultures. Jingu Bashi, the pedestrian bridge between Harajuku Station and the entrance to the Meiji Shrine, used to act as a gathering place on Sundays to showcase some of the more theatrical styles. Another gathering place was the lower part of Omotesandō avenue, which used to be pedestrian-only (&quot;Hokosha Tengoku&quot;) on Sundays.

<text>or is a Japanese traditional celebration on the last day of the year. Traditionally, it was held on the final day of the 12th lunar month. With Japan&#x27;s switch to using the Gregorian calendar at the beginning of the Meiji era, it is now used on New Year&#x27;s Eve to celebrate the new year.

==Origins==
===Etymology===
The last day of each month of the Japanese lunisolar calendar was historically named . Originally, &quot;miso&quot; was written as 三十, indicating the 30th day, though &quot;misoka&quot; sometimes fell on the 29th due to the varying lengths of the lunar month. The last day in the 12th lunar month is called —with the 大 indicating it is the final last day of the month for that year—or the &quot;great thirtieth day&quot;. As part of the Meiji Restoration, Japan switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1873, and &quot;ōmisoka&quot; was set as December 31, or New Year&#x27;s Eve. The day is also known by the archaic pronunciation of . This is a shortened version of , meaning &quot;last day of the month&quot;.

===Activities===

Traditionally, important activities for the concluding year and day were completed in order to start the new year fresh. Some of these include house cleaning, repaying debts, purification (such as driving out evil spirits and bad luck), and bathing so the final hours of the year could be spent relaxing. Recently, families and friends often gather for parties, including the viewing of the over four-hour on NHK, or more recently to watch large mixed martial arts cards. This custom has its roots in the ancient Japanese culture surrounding or , which revolved around the practice of showing reverence toward the gods of the current and upcoming years.

About an hour before the New Year, people often gather together for one last time in the old year to have a bowl of &quot;toshikoshi soba&quot; or &quot;toshikoshi udon&quot; together—a tradition based on people&#x27;s association of eating the long noodles with &quot;crossing over from one year to the next&quot;, which is the meaning of &quot;toshi-koshi&quot;. While the noodles are often eaten plain, or with chopped scallions, in some localities people top them with tempura. Traditionally, families make osechi on the last few days of the year. The food is then consumed during the first several days of the new year in order to &quot;[welcome] the &#x27;deity of the year&#x27; to each household&quot; and &quot;[wish] for happiness throughout the year&quot;.

At midnight, many visit a shrine or temple for &quot;Hatsumōde&quot;, or the first shrine/temple visit of the year. Throughout Japan, Shinto shrines prepare &quot;amazake&quot; to pass out to crowds that gather as midnight approaches. Most Buddhist temples have a large bonshō (Buddhist bell) that is struck once for each of the 108 earthly temptations believed to cause human suffering. The bell ringing tradition is known as joya no kane (除夜の鐘). 

When seeing someone for the last time before the new year, it is traditional to say . The traditional first greeting after the beginning of the New Year is .

This celebration is the equivalent of New Year&#x27;s Eve in the Western world, and coincides with Saint Sylvester&#x27;s Day celebrated by some Western Christian churches.

<doc id="148895" wikidata="Q4414064" url="?curid=148895" title="Abstract impressionism">
<text>Abstract impressionism is an art movement that originated in New York City, in the 1940s. It involves the painting of a subject such as real-life scenes, objects, or people (portraits) in an Impressionist style, but with an emphasis on varying measures of abstraction. The paintings are often painted &quot;en plein air,&quot; an artistic style involving painting outside with the landscape directly in front of the artist. The movement works delicately between the lines of pure abstraction (the extent of which varies greatly) and the allowance of an impression of reality in the painting.

== History ==

=== Terminology ===
The coining of the term &quot;abstract impressionism&quot; has been attributed to painter and critic Elaine de Kooning in the 1950s. The introduction of this term and the associated artworks both preceded and legitimised its first exhibition in 1958, curated by Lawrence Alloway.

The term, after being coined by Elaine de Kooning, is considered to have been popularised by artist and critic Louis Finkelstein to describe the works of Philip Guston, in order to distinguish his art from that of the growing field of Abstract Expressionism. Phillip Guston&#x27;s rise within artistic and social spheres in the mid 1950s was a determining factor in the development and profiling of abstract impressionism. His paintings were considered by Finkelstein to be simultaneously extensions of Abstract Expressionism and also oppositions of, or alternatives to, the aggressiveness of Abstract Expressionism.

After applying the term to Guston, Finkelstein continued to use &quot;abstract impressionism&quot; to describe new artworks and artistic practices in the 1950s, in New York. He believed and purported that emerging forms of artmaking provided a unique opportunity to redefine and re-evaluate a series of artists who, despite being raised around the ideals and norms of Abstract Expressionism, were moving more towards reinvigorating the ideals of the traditional Impressionist movement.

=== Alloway&#x27;s exhibition ===
Lawrence Alloway&#x27;s exhibition, the first of its kind for abstract impressionism, featured 26 paintings by 23 artists. The idea for the exhibition came from the Fine Art Department of the University of Nottingham, and took place at the Arts Council Gallery in St. James&#x27; Square.

The artists featured were from England, France, and the United States, with their various works prefaced by a &quot;lengthy catalogue&quot; written by Alloway himself. Alan Bowness, a critic of the show, recalled Nicolas de Staël, Peter Lanyon, and Sam Francis to be participating artists in the exhibition.

=== Differentiation ===
Both the exhibition and the movement in general were considered by many to highlight a distinct differentiation from preceding movements, despite some critics, like Alan Bowness, arguing the works of the movement were not differentiated enough from previous works.

Despite this controversy, abstract impressionism has been considered an ideological opposition to the other post-war movements of the era- specifically its growing countermovements, Cubism and Futurism. Whilst Futurism focussed on rejecting the art of the past, abstract impressionism sought to incorporate techniques from numerous movements before it. This included both the Abstract and Impressionist movements of the early 1900s and the 1860s respectively. Additionally, abstract impressionists were unwilling to subscribe to the rationality and mathematic precision of Cubism. They rejected the idea of creating an image out of divided parts, and instead sought to create a mass of colour and imagery, that would only be recognisable as a whole.

Abstract impressionism has been considered a result from an artist deviation from the &quot;expressionistic aggressiveness of the forties&quot;, and the simultaneous embracing of both new abstraction techniques and more traditional roots of nature and lyrical appreciation.

In terms of distinguishing themselves from traditional Impressionist works, abstract impressionists deviate in a way that Elaine de Kooning describes as &quot;keep[ing] the Impressionist manner of looking at a scene, but [leaving] out the scene... thereby giving an old style a new subject&quot;. Simply put, they add abstraction onto Impressionism and take away the reliance on specificity and exactness.

== Criticism ==
=== Stylistic criticism ===
Abstract impressionism has been criticised for its legitimacy, and its inability to distinguish itself from other movements, by many art critics. After one of its early exhibitions at the Arts Gallery Council in St. James Square, Alan Bowness (a highly regarded art critic and historian) described abstract impressionism as &quot;just another &#x27;ism&quot;, without &quot;the catalogue for the adoption of this new term [being] very convincing&quot;. The main point of contention regards a difficulty separating the movement from other art periods, such as abstract expressionism, lyrical abstraction, or Post-Impressionism. Bowness says that in trying to discern &quot;particular qualities these pictures have in common, qualities that differentiate them from other paintings of a roughly similar type... the result is all together inconclusive&quot;.

A further issue has been the widely varying degrees of abstraction in the movement, that may make visual uniformity difficult. Bowness notes that he finds it difficult to comprehend any unity between the artworks, and concludes that there is no movement that could rightfully claim all of them.

=== Categorisation criticism ===
Another element of controversy within abstract impressionism comes in attempting to categorise its style within other movements. Art historians Simon Watney and Roger Fry debate over two places in which abstract impressionism may fit. They conclude to be unsure of whether it is a further development of Post-Impressionism, or if it is perhaps more related to the period of Bloomsbury Abstraction within the Abstract movement.

Additionally, many artists that the abstract impressionist movement has claimed- such as Milton Resnick, Sam Francis, Nicolas de Staël, or Jackson Pollock- are simultaneously considered to be members of other more widely recognised movements, such as Abstract Expressionism, whether by their own definition or the labelling of other art critics.

== Style ==
The style of abstract impressionism focusses on the portrayal of real life subjects- typically situated close to the artist themselves- through simplification and abstraction. This creates a work of art that lends itself towards the traditions of both Impressionism and Abstract art movements. The amount of abstraction varies greatly from painting to painting, which has been seen as a point of controversy in the movement as it disallows visual conformity between works.

=== Painting techniques ===

Like Impressionism, the artworks feature short brushstrokes with paint &quot;loaded&quot; onto the painting instrument. This technique involves piling paint onto an art tool, such as a brush or a palette knife, and layering the paint onto the canvas or paper to create a multi-layered and textured effect- or, an &quot;impression&quot;.

Abstract impressionists paintings have been described to resemble late-Impressionist pictures in their technique, like those of Monet, but without the representative content that usually defines Impressionism.

Abstract impressionist style also relies largely on the painting embracing the concept of en plein air. &quot;En plein air&quot; painting is an artistic style involving painting outdoors, with the landscape or subject directly in front of the artist. This technique is used primarily by Impressionists. However, abstract impression deviates from traditional &quot;en plain air&quot; artworks as the level of exactness or realism in the painting is seen to be less important than overall atmospheric effect.

=== Deviations from similar movements ===
Abstract impressionists have been described to be largely inspired by modern advances in and changing attitudes towards color theory. Traditional Impressionist work, in its reflection of reality, often used gentle, bright, and complementary colours to mirror the outdoor setting and light sources. Abstract impressionists, however, &quot;did not hesitate to apply innovative techniques to their painting, considered revolutionary at the time&quot;.

== Notable artists and artworks ==

=== Notable artists ===
As aforementioned, notable artists and artworks of this movement are subject to controversy and possible subjectivity.

<doc id="148898" wikidata="Q727928" url="?curid=148898" title="Asian Americans">
<text>Asian Americans are Americans with ancestry from the continent of Asia (including naturalized Americans who are immigrants from specific regions in Asia and descendants of those immigrants).

Although this term had historically been used for all the indigenous peoples of the continent of Asia, the usage of the term &quot;Asian&quot; by the United States Census Bureau denotes a racial category that includes people with origins or ancestry from East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. It excludes people with ethnic origins from West Asia, who will be categorized as Middle Eastern Americans starting from the 2030 census. Central Asian ancestries (including Afghan, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Turkmen, and Uzbek) were previously not included in any racial category but have been designated as “Asian” as of 2024.

The &quot;Asian&quot; census category includes people who indicate their race(s) on the census as &quot;Asian&quot; or reported entries such as &quot;Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi, Filipino, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani, Thai, and Other Asian&quot;. In 2020, Americans who identified as Asian alone (19,886,049) or in combination with other races (4,114,949) made up 7.2% of the US population.

Chinese, Indian, and Filipino Americans make up the largest share of the Asian American population with 5.5 million, 5.2 million, and 4.6 million people respectively. These numbers equal 23%, 20%, and 18% of the total Asian American population, or 1.5%, 1.2%, and 1.2% of the total US population.

Although migrants from Asia have been in parts of the contemporary United States since the 17th century, large-scale immigration did not begin until the mid-19th century. Nativist immigration laws during the 1880s–1920s excluded various Asian groups, eventually prohibiting almost all Asian immigration to the continental United States. After immigration laws were reformed during the 1940s–1960s, abolishing national origins quotas, Asian immigration increased rapidly. Analyses of the 2010 census have shown that, by percentage change, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States.

==Terminology==
As with other racial and ethnicity-based terms, formal and common usage have changed markedly through the short history of this term. Prior to the late 1960s, people of various Asian ancestries were usually referred to as &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Oriental&quot;, &quot;Asiatic&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Mongoloid&quot;, or &quot;Hindoo&quot;. Additionally, the American definition of &#x27;Asian&#x27; originally included West Asian ethnic groups, particularly Turkish Americans, Armenian Americans, Assyrian Americans, Iranian Americans, Kurdish Americans, Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern descent, and certain Arab Americans, although in modern times, these groups are now considered Middle Eastern American and grouped under White Americans in the census. The term &quot;Asian American&quot; was coined by historian-activists Yuji Ichioka and Emma Gee in 1968 during the founding of the Asian American Political Alliance, and they were also credited with popularizing the term, which meant to be used to frame a new &quot;inter-ethnic-pan-Asian American self-defining political group&quot;. This effort was part of New Left anti-war and anti-imperialist activism, directly opposing what was viewed as an unjust Vietnam War.

Prior to being included in the &quot;Asian&quot; category in the 1980s, many Americans of South Asian descent usually classified themselves as &quot;Caucasian&quot; or &quot;other&quot;. Changing patterns of immigration and an extensive period of exclusion of Asian immigrants have resulted in demographic changes that have in turn affected the formal and common understandings of what defines Asian American. For example, since the removal of restrictive &quot;national origins&quot; quotas in 1965, the Asian American population has diversified greatly to include more of the peoples with ancestry from various parts of Asia.

Today, &quot;Asian American&quot; is the accepted term for most formal purposes, such as government and academic research, although it is often shortened to &quot;Asian&quot; in common usage. The most commonly used definition of Asian American is the US Census Bureau definition, which includes all people with origins in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. This is chiefly because the census definitions determine many governmental classifications, notably for equal opportunity programs and measurements.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;Asian person&quot; in the United States is most often thought of as a person of East Asian descent. In vernacular usage, &quot;Asian&quot; is usually used to refer to those of East or Southeast Asian descent, with South Asians not included as often. This differs from the US census definition, and the Asian American Studies departments in many universities consider all those of East, South, or Southeast Asian descent to be &quot;Asian&quot;.

===Census definition===
In the US census, people with origins or ancestry in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia are classified as part of the Asian race; while those with origins or ancestry in parts of West Asia (Israelis, Turks, Persians, Kurds, Assyrians, Arabs, etc.) and the Caucasus (Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Chechens, Circassians, etc.) are classified under the &quot;Middle Eastern and North African&quot; race. As such, &quot;Asian&quot; and &quot;African&quot; ancestry are seen as racial categories only for the purpose of the census, with the definition referring to ancestry from parts of the Asian and African continents outside of parts of West Asia and North Africa.

In 1980 and before, census forms listed particular Asian ancestries as separate groups, along with &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black or negro&quot;. Asian Americans had also been classified as &quot;other&quot;. In 1977, the federal Office of Management and Budget issued a directive requiring government agencies to maintain statistics on racial groups, including on &quot;Asian or Pacific Islander&quot;. By the 1990 census, &quot;Asian or Pacific Islander (API)&quot; was included as an explicit category, although respondents had to select one particular ancestry as a subcategory. Beginning with the 2000 census, two separate categories were used: &quot;Asian American&quot; and &quot;Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander&quot;.

===Debates and criticism===
The definition of &quot;Asian American&quot; has variations that derive from the use of the word &quot;American&quot; in different contexts. Immigration status, citizenship (by birthright and by naturalization), acculturation, and language ability are some variables that are used to define &quot;American&quot; for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage. For example, restricting &quot;American&quot; to include only US citizens conflicts with discussions of Asian American businesses, which generally refer both to citizen and non-citizen owners. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey of Asian Americans found that 28% self-identify as &quot;Asian&quot;, with 52% preferring to refer to themselves by more specific ethnic groupings and 10% simply self-identifying as &quot;American&quot;.

In a PBS interview from 2004, a panel of Asian American writers discussed how some groups include people of Middle Eastern descent in the Asian American category. Asian American author Stewart Ikeda has noted, &quot;The definition of &#x27;Asian American&#x27; also frequently depends on who&#x27;s asking, who&#x27;s defining, in what context, and why... the possible definitions of &#x27;Asian-Pacific American&#x27; are many, complex, and shifting... some scholars in Asian American Studies conferences suggest that Russians, Iranians, and Israelis all might fit the field&#x27;s subject of study.&quot; Jeff Yang, of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, writes that the panethnic definition of Asian American is a unique American construct, and as an identity is &quot;in beta&quot;. The majority of Asian Americans feel ambivalence about the term &quot;Asian American&quot; as a term by which to identify themselves. Pyong Gap Min, a sociologist and Professor of Sociology at Queens College, has stated the term is merely political, used by Asian American activists and further reinforced by the government. Beyond that, he feels that South Asians and East Asians do not have commonalities in &quot;culture, physical characteristics, or pre-migrant historical experiences&quot;.

Scholars have grappled with the accuracy, correctness, and usefulness of the term Asian American. The term &quot;Asian&quot; in Asian American most often comes under fire for only encompassing some of the diverse peoples of Asia, and for being considered a racial category instead of a non-racial &quot;ethnic&quot; category. This is namely due to the categorization of the racially different South Asians and East Asians as part of the same &quot;race&quot;. Furthermore, it has been noted that West Asians (whom are not considered &quot;Asian&quot; under the US census) share some cultural similarities with Indians but very little with East Asians, with the latter two groups being classified as &quot;Asian&quot;. Scholars have also found it difficult to determine why Asian Americans are considered a &quot;race&quot; while Americans of Hispanic and Latino heritage are a non-racial &quot;ethnic group&quot;, given how the category of Asian Americans similarly comprises people with diverse origins. However, it has been argued that South Asians and East Asians can be &quot;justifiably&quot; grouped together because of Buddhism&#x27;s origins in South Asia and contemporary practice in East Asia.

In contrast, leading social sciences and humanities scholars of race and Asian American identity point out that because of the racial constructions in the United States, including the social attitudes toward race and those of Asian ancestry, Asian Americans have a &quot;shared racial experience&quot;. Because of this shared experience, the term Asian American is argued as still being a useful panethnic category because of the similarity of some experiences among Asian Americans, including stereotypes specific to people in this category. Despite this, others have stated that many Americans do not treat all Asian Americans equally, highlighting the fact that &quot;Asian American&quot; is generally synonymous with people of East Asian descent, thereby excluding people of Southeast Asian and South Asian origin. Some South and Southeast Asian Americans may not identify with the Asian American label, instead describing themselves as &quot;Brown Asians&quot; or simply &quot;Brown&quot;, due to the perceived racial and cultural differences between them and East Asian Americans.

==Demographics==

The demographics of Asian Americans describe a heterogeneous group of people in the United States who can trace their ancestry to one or more countries in East, South, Southeast, or Central Asia. Because they compose 7.3% of the entire US population, the diversity of the group is often disregarded in media and news discussions of &quot;Asians&quot; or of &quot;Asian Americans&quot;. While there are some commonalities across ethnic subgroups, there are significant differences among different Asian ethnicities that are related to each group&#x27;s history. The Asian American population is greatly urbanized, with nearly three-quarters of them living in metropolitan areas with population greater than 2.5 million. , California had the largest population of Asian Americans of any state, and Hawaii was the only state where Asian Americans were the majority of the population.

The demographics of Asian Americans can further be subdivided into, as listed in alphabetical order:
* East Asian Americans, including Chinese Americans, Hong Kong Americans, Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Macanese Americans, Mongolian Americans, Ryukyuan Americans, Taiwanese Americans, Tibetan Americans, and Uyghur Americans.
* South Asian Americans, including Baloch Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, Bhutanese Americans, Indian Americans, Indo-Caribbean Americans, Indo-Fijian Americans, Maldivian Americans, Nepalese Americans, Pakistani Americans, Pashtun Americans, and Sri Lankan Americans.
* Southeast Asian Americans, including Bruneian Americans, Burmese Americans, Cambodian Americans, Filipino Americans, Hmong Americans, Indonesian Americans, Iu Mien Americans, Karen Americans, Laotian Americans, Malaysian Americans, Singaporean Americans, Thai Americans, Timorese Americans, and Vietnamese Americans.
* Central Asian Americans, including Afghan Americans, Kazakh Americans, Kyrgyz Americans, Tajik Americans, Turkmen Americans, and Uzbek Americans.

This grouping is by country of origin before immigration to the United States, and not necessarily by ethnicity, as for example (nonexclusive), Singaporean and Malaysian Americans may be of Chinese, Indian, or Malay descent.

Asian Americans include multiracial or mixed race persons with origins or ancestry in both the above groups and another race, or multiple of the above groups.

===Proportion in each county===
===Ancestry===
According to estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey, the Asian American population was composed of the following groups: 
===Language===
In 2010, there were 2.8 million people (age 5 and older) who spoke one of the Chinese languages at home; after the Spanish language, it is the third most common language in the United States. Other sizable Asian languages are Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu), Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean, with all four having more than 1 million speakers in the United States.

In 2012, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Washington were publishing election material in Asian languages in accordance with the Voting Rights Act; these languages include Tagalog, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, Spanish, Hindi, and Bengali. Election materials were also available in Gujarati, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, and Thai. A 2013 poll found that 48 percent of Asian Americans considered media in their native language as their primary news source.

The 2000 census found the more prominent languages of the Asian American community to include the Chinese languages (Cantonese, Taishanese, and Hokkien), Tagalog, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Urdu, Telugu, and Gujarati. In 2008, the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese languages are all used in elections in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Washington state.

===Sexuality===
According to a Gallup survey conducted from June to September 2012, 4.3% of Asian Americans self-identify as LGBT, compared to 3.4% of the general American population. This makes the Asian-American population disproportionately over-represented within the LGBT community. In a Gallup survey conducted in 2017, 4.9 percent of Asian Americans identified as LGBT, representing the second-highest growth of LGBT representation in the United States, behind Hispanic Americans.

===Religion===
According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from July 5, 2022, to January 27, 2023, the religious landscape of Asian Americans is both diverse and evolving, encompassing Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and the unaffiliated. These religious identities often intersect with cultural practices, creating a unique blend of spirituality that varies significantly across subgroups. Beyond formal identification, many Asian Americans express cultural or ancestral connections to religious traditions, highlighting the multifaceted role of religion in their lives.

Christianity has experienced the largest decline, dropping from 42% in 2012 to 34% in 2023, reflecting increasing secularisation in the United States and immigration from countries in which Christianity is a minority religion (China and India in particular). This development has been accompanied by a rise in traditional Asian religions, with the people identifying with them doubling during the same decade.

====Christianity====

Christianity encompasses the largest tradition, accounting for 34% of Asian American adults. This group is evenly split by Catholics (17%) and Protestants (16%), including 10% who identify as evangelical Protestants. Beyond formal religious identification, an additional 18% report a cultural or familial closeness to Christianity. 

Filipino and Korean Americans display particularly strong affiliations with Christianity. Among Filipino Americans, 74% identify as Christian, and when considering those who feel culturally close to Christianity, this figure rises to 90%. Among Korean Americans, 59% identify as Christians, and 81% express some connection to the faith. Most Filipino Americans are Catholic (57%), whereas Korean Americans tend to be Protestant, with 34% identifying as evangelical Protestants.

====Unaffiliated====

The religiously unaffiliated encompasses individuals identifying as atheist, agnostic, or &quot;nothing in particular.&quot; The share of those who are religiously unaffiliated has increased from 26% in 2012 to 32% in 2023. Despite a lack of formal religious affiliation, a significant number of religiously unaffiliated Asian Americans maintain a connection to various religious or philosophical traditions due to cultural or ancestral reasons. In total, only 12% of Asian Americans report having no connection to any religious or philosophical tradition.

Among Asian Americans, Chinese and Japanese Americans are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated, with 56% and 47% respectively identifying as such. Both groups are also more likely to feel a cultural or ancestral connection to a faith tradition despite their lack of formal religious affiliation. Conversely, Indian, Filipino, and Vietnamese Americans are considerably less likely to be religiously unaffiliated and more likely to express some form of connection to a religious tradition.

==== Buddhism ====

According to a 2023 Pew Research Center report, approximately 11% of Asian American adults identify as Buddhists, a slight decline from 14% in 2012. Beyond formal identification, an additional 21% report feeling culturally or ancestrally connected to Buddhism, bringing the total with some affiliation to one-third of Asian Americans. Among Vietnamese Americans, 37% identify as Buddhist - the highest proportion among major Asian American subgroups.

Among Japanese and Chinese Americans, formal Buddhist affiliation is less pronounced, but cultural connections remain robust. For instance, while only 19% of Japanese Americans identify as Buddhist, a significant share feel a closeness to Buddhist traditions, reflecting its philosophical and cultural integration into their heritage. Notably, home-based worship through shrines or altars is prevalent, with 63% of Asian American Buddhists practising such rituals compared to lower attendance rates at formal religious services.

==== Hinduism ====

About 11% of Asian American adults identify as Hindu, which has been stable since 2012. Indian Americans constitute the largest group of Hindus, with nearly half (48%) identifying with this tradition. Moreover, an additional 19% of Asian Americans report feeling a cultural or ancestral connection to Hinduism, reflecting the interplay between religious and cultural identities. Altogether, two-thirds of Indian Americans express some form of affiliation with Hinduism, reflecting its central role within this community.

Hinduism among Asian Americans is notable for its private worship practices. Nearly 79% of Asian American Hindus use an altar, shrine, or religious symbol for worship at home - the highest percentage among Asian American religious groups. At the same time, 31% of Hindus also report attending religious services at least monthly.

==== Islam ====

Islam represents about 6% of Asian Americans, with an additional 3% expressing a cultural connection to the faith. South Asian Americans, predominantly those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, account for the largest share of Muslims followed by those of Indian origin.

For many Asian American Muslims, religion plays a central role in daily life. About 60% report that religion is very important to them, and 54% attend mosque services at least monthly. This group also emphasises communal practices, with a strong focus on maintaining religious traditions within family and community settings.

==History==

===Early immigration===
Because Asian Americans or their ancestors immigrated to the United States from many different countries, each Asian American population has its own unique immigration history.

Filipinos have been in the territories that would become the United States since the 16th century. In 1635, an &quot;East Indian&quot; is listed in Jamestown, Virginia; preceding wider settlement of Indian immigrants on the East Coast in the 1790s and the West Coast in the 1800s. In 1763, Filipinos established the small settlement of Saint Malo, Louisiana, after fleeing mistreatment aboard Spanish ships. Since there were no Filipino women with them, these &quot;Manilamen&quot;, as they were known, married Cajun and indigenous women. The first Japanese person to come to the United States, and stay any significant period of time was Nakahama Manjirō who reached the East Coast in 1841, and Joseph Heco became the first Japanese American naturalized US citizen in 1858.

Chinese sailors first came to Hawaii in 1789, a few years after Captain James Cook came upon the island. Many settled and married Hawaiian women. Most Chinese, Korean and Japanese immigrants in Hawaii or San Francisco arrived in the 19th century as laborers to work on sugar plantations or construction place. There were thousands of Asians in Hawaii when it was annexed to the United States in 1898. Later, Filipinos also came to work as laborers, attracted by the job opportunities, although they were limited. Ryukyuans would start migrating to Hawaii in 1900.

Large-scale migration from Asia to the United States began when Chinese immigrants arrived on the West Coast in the mid-19th century. Forming part of the California gold rush, these early Chinese immigrants participated intensively in the mining business and later in the construction of the transcontinental railroad. By 1852, the number of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco had jumped to more than 20,000. A wave of Japanese immigration to the United States began after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. In 1898, all Filipinos in the Philippine Islands became American nationals when the United States took over colonial rule of the islands from Spain following the latter&#x27;s defeat in the Spanish–American War.

===Exclusion era===
Under United States law during this period, particularly the Naturalization Act of 1790, only &quot;free white persons&quot; were eligible to naturalize as American citizens. Ineligibility for citizenship prevented Asian immigrants from accessing a variety of rights, such as voting. Bhicaji Balsara became the first known Indian-born person to gain naturalized US citizenship. Balsara&#x27;s naturalization was not the norm but an exception; in a pair of cases, &quot;Ozawa v. United States&quot; (1922) and &quot;United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind&quot; (1923), the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not &quot;white persons&quot;. Second-generation Asian Americans, however, could become US citizens due to the birthright citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; (1898).

From the 1880s to the 1920s, the United States passed laws inaugurating an era of exclusion of Asian immigrants. While the overall number of Asian immigrants was relatively small compared to those from other regions, their concentration in the West contributed to the rise of nativist sentiment, often referred to as the &quot;yellow peril.&quot; Congress passed restrictive legislation which prohibited nearly all Chinese immigration to the United States in the 1880s. Japanese immigration was sharply curtailed by a diplomatic agreement in 1907. The Asiatic Barred Zone Act in 1917 further barred immigration from nearly all of Asia, the &quot;Asiatic Zone&quot;. The Immigration Act of 1924 provided that no &quot;alien ineligible for citizenship&quot; could be admitted as an immigrant to the United States, consolidating the prohibition of Asian immigration.

===World War II===
President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, resulting in the internment of Japanese Americans, among others. Over 100,000 people of Japanese descent, mostly on the West Coast, were forcibly removed, in an action later considered ineffective and racist. Japanese Americans were kept isolated in military camps just because of their race including children, old person and young generation. &#x27;Issei:The first generation&#x27; and &#x27;Children of the camps&#x27; are two great documentaries to represent the situation of Japanese American&#x27;s during World War II.

===Postwar immigration===
World War II-era legislation and judicial rulings gradually increased the ability of Asian Americans to immigrate and become naturalized citizens. Immigration rapidly increased following the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965 as well as the influx of refugees from conflicts occurring in Southeast Asia such as the Vietnam War. Asian American immigrants have a significant percentage of individuals who have already achieved professional status, a first among immigration groups.

The number of Asian immigrants to the United States &quot;grew from 491,000 in 1960 to about 12.8 million in 2014, representing a 2,597 percent increase.&quot; Asian Americans were the fastest-growing racial group between 2000 and 2010. By 2012, more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America. In 2015, Pew Research Center found that from 2010 to 2015 more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America, and that since 1965; Asians have made up a quarter of all immigrants to the United States.

Asians have made up an increasing proportion of the foreign-born Americans: &quot;In 1960, Asians represented 5 percent of the U.S. foreign-born population; by 2014, their share grew to 30 percent of the nation&#x27;s 42.4 million immigrants.&quot; As of 2016, &quot;Asia is the second-largest region of birth (after Latin America) of U.S. immigrants.&quot; In 2013, China surpassed Mexico as the top single country of origin for immigrants to the US. Asian immigrants &quot;are more likely than the overall foreign-born population to be naturalized citizens&quot;; in 2014, 59% of Asian immigrants had US citizenship, compared to 47% of all immigrants. Postwar Asian immigration to the US has been diverse: in 2014, 31% of Asian immigrants to the US were from East Asia (predominantly China and Korea); 27.7% were from South Asia (predominantly India); 32.6% were from Southeast Asia (predominantly the Philippines and Vietnam); and 8.3% were from West Asia.

===Asian American movement===

Prior to the 1960s, Asian immigrants and their descendants had organized and agitated for social or political purposes according to their particular ethnicity: Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, or Asian Indian. The Asian American movement (a term coined by the Japanese American Yuji Ichioka and the Chinese American Emma Gee) gathered all those groups into a coalition, recognizing that they shared common problems with racial discrimination and common opposition to American imperialism, particularly in Asia. The movement developed during the 1960s, inspired in part by the Civil Rights Movement and the protests against the Vietnam War. &quot;Drawing influences from the Black Power and antiwar movements, the Asian American movement forged a coalitional politics that united Asians of varying ethnicities and declared solidarity with other Third World people in the United States and abroad. Segments of the movement struggled for community control of education, provided social services and defended affordable housing in Asian ghettoes, organized exploited workers, protested against US imperialism, and built new multiethnic cultural institutions.&quot; William Wei described the movement as &quot;rooted in a past history of oppression and a present struggle for liberation&quot;. The movement as such was most active during the 1960s and 1970s.

Increasingly Asian American students demanded university-level research and teaching into Asian history and interaction with the United States. They support multiculturalism and support affirmative action but oppose colleges&#x27; quota on Asian students viewed as discriminatory.

==Notable contributions==
===Arts and entertainment===




Asian Americans have been involved in the entertainment industry since the first half of the 19th century, when Chang and Eng Bunker (the original &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;) became naturalized citizens. Throughout the 20th century, acting roles in television, film, and theater were relatively few, and many available roles were for narrow, stereotypical characters. Bruce Lee (born in San Francisco, CA) only achieved movie stardom after leaving the United States for Hong Kong.

More recently, young Asian American comedians and film-makers have found an outlet on YouTube allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase among their fellow Asian Americans. There have been several Asian American-centric television shows in American media, beginning with &quot;Mr. T and Tina&quot; in 1976, and as recent as the TV series &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; in 2015.

In the Pacific, American beatboxer of Hawaii Chinese descent Jason Tom co-founded the Human Beatbox Academy to perpetuate the art of beatboxing through outreach performances, speaking engagements and workshops in Honolulu, the westernmost and southernmost major US city of the 50th US state of Hawaii.

===Business===
When Asian Americans were largely excluded from labor markets in the 19th century, they started their own businesses. They have started convenience and grocery stores, professional offices such as medical and law practices, laundries, restaurants, beauty-related ventures, hi-tech companies, and many other kinds of enterprises, becoming very successful and influential in American society. They have dramatically expanded their involvement across the American economy. Asian Americans have been disproportionately successful in the hi-tech sectors of California&#x27;s Silicon Valley, as evidenced by the Goldsea 100 Compilation of America&#x27;s Most Successful Asian Entrepreneurs.

Compared to their population base, Asian Americans today are well represented in the professional sector and tend to earn higher wages. The Goldsea compilation of Notable Asian American Professionals show that many have come to occupy high positions at leading US corporations, including a disproportionately large number as Chief Marketing Officers.

Asian Americans have made major contributions to the American economy. In 2012, there were just under 486,000 Asian American-owned businesses in the US, which together employed more than 3.6 million workers, generating $707.6 billion in total receipts and sales, with annual payrolls of $112 billion. In 2015, Asian American and Pacific Islander households had $455.6 billion in spending power (comparable to the annual revenue of Walmart) and made tax contributions of $184.0 billion.

Fashion designer and mogul Vera Wang, who is famous for designing dresses for high-profile celebrities, started a clothing company, named after herself, which now offers a broad range of luxury fashion products. An Wang founded Wang Laboratories in June 1951. Amar Bose founded the Bose Corporation in 1964. Charles Wang founded Computer Associates, later became its CEO and chairman. Two brothers, David Khym and Kenny Khym founded hip hop fashion giant Southpole in 1991. Jen-Hsun &quot;Jensen&quot; Huang co-founded the Nvidia corporation in 1993. Jerry Yang co-founded Yahoo! Inc. in 1994 and became its CEO later. Andrea Jung serves as chairman and CEO of Avon Products. Vinod Khosla was a founding CEO of Sun Microsystems and is a general partner of the prominent venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Steve Chen and Jawed Karim were co-creators of YouTube, and were beneficiaries of Google&#x27;s $1.65 billion acquisition of that company in 2006. Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom Video Communications, and Shahid Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars among others, are both in the US top 100 in terms of net worth, according to Forbes. In addition to contributing greatly to other fields, Asian Americans have made considerable contributions in science and technology in the United States, in such prominent innovative R&amp;D regions as Silicon Valley and The Triangle.

===Government and politics===

Asian Americans have a high level of political incorporation in terms of their actual voting population. Since 1907, Asian Americans have been active at the national level and have had multiple officeholders at local, state, and national levels. As more Asian Americans have been elected to public office, they have had a growing impact on foreign relations of the United States, immigration, international trade, and other topics. The first Asian American to be elected to the United States Congress was Dalip Singh Saund in 1957.

The highest ranked Asian American to serve in the United States Congress was Senator and President pro tempore Daniel Inouye, who died in office in 2012. There are several active Asian Americans in the United States Congress. With higher proportions and densities of Asian American populations, Hawaii has most consistently sent Asian Americans to the Senate, and Hawaii and California have most consistently sent Asian Americans to the House of Representatives.

The first Asian American member of the US cabinet was Norman Mineta, who served as Secretary of Commerce and then Secretary of Transportation in the George W. Bush administration. As of 2021, the highest ranked Asian American by order of precedence is Vice President Kamala Harris. Previously, the highest ranked Asian American was Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao (2017–2021), who had also been in the order of precedence as US Secretary of Labor (2001–2009).

There have been roughly &quot;about a half-dozen viable Asian-American candidates&quot; to ever run for president of the United States. Senator Hiram Fong of Hawaii, the child of Chinese immigrants, was a &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate at the Republican National Conventions of 1964 and 1968. In 1972, Representative Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii, a Japanese American, unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for president. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, the son of Indian immigrants, unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Entrepreneur and nonprofit founder Andrew Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. In January 2021, Kamala Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and an African father became the first Asian American Vice President of the United States.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1927–2016) was the first monarch to be born in the United States. He reigned the throne of Thailand from 1946 to 2016.

====Voting behavior====
Asian Americans were once a strong constituency for Republicans. In 1992, George H. W. Bush won 55% of Asian voters. However, by 2020, Asian Americans shifted to supporting Democrats, giving Joe Biden 70% support to Donald Trump&#x27;s 29%. Ethnic background and country of origin have determined Asian American voting behavior in recent elections, with Indian Americans and to a lesser extent Chinese Americans being strong constituencies for Democrats, and Vietnamese Americans being a strong constituency for Republicans.

Sixty eight percent of Filipinos surveyed for a 2023 survey said they identified politically with the Democratic Party and voted for Democrats.

===Journalism===
Connie Chung was one of the first Asian American national correspondents for a major TV news network, reporting for CBS in 1971. She later co-anchored the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; from 1993 to 1995, becoming the first Asian American national news anchor. At ABC, Ken Kashiwahara began reporting nationally in 1974. In 1989, Emil Guillermo, a Filipino American born reporter from San Francisco, became the first Asian American male to co-host a national news show when he was senior host at National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. In 1990, Sheryl WuDunn, a foreign correspondent in the Beijing Bureau of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, became the first Asian American to win a Pulitzer Prize. Ann Curry joined NBC News as a reporter in 1990, later becoming prominently associated with &quot;The Today Show&quot; in 1997. Carol Lin is perhaps best known for being the first to break the news of 9-11 on CNN. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is currently CNN&#x27;s chief health correspondent. Lisa Ling, a former co-host on &quot;The View&quot;, now provides special reports for CNN and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, as well as hosting National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;Explorer.&quot; Fareed Zakaria, a naturalized Indian-born immigrant, is a prominent journalist and author specializing in international affairs. He is the editor-at-large of Time magazine, and the host of Fareed Zakaria GPS on CNN. Juju Chang, James Hatori, John Yang, Veronica De La Cruz, Michelle Malkin, Betty Nguyen, and Julie Chen have become familiar faces on television news. John Yang won a Peabody Award. Alex Tizon, a Seattle Times staff writer, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1997.

===Military===
Since the War of 1812, Asian Americans have served and fought on behalf of the United States. Serving in both segregated and non-segregated units until the desegregation of the US Military in 1948, 31 have been awarded the nation&#x27;s highest award for combat valor, the Medal of Honor. Twenty-one of these were conferred upon members of the mostly Japanese American 100th Infantry Battalion of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of World War II, the most highly decorated unit of its size in the history of the United States Armed Forces. The highest ranked Asian American military official was Secretary of Veteran Affairs, four-star general and Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki.

===Science and technology===

Asian Americans have made many notable contributions to science and technology. In the technological sector, Asian Americans are the most influential. According to an article by website ideas.ted.com, over 40% of the high-tech companies are established by highly skilled Asian American people. It also states that AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islanders) has been contributing to remarkable technological innovations and scientific discoveries. For example, the co-founders of Yahoo, Zoom, YouTube, and LinkedIn are Asian American contributors. Intury In the 21st century, Asian Americans are building connections with other Asian countries, such as China, Korea, Bangladesh, and India. Another example could be the CEO of Microsoft, originally from India, Satya Nadella is an example of the contribution of Asian Americans in the technological fields. Asian Americans have a vital contribution not only in technology, and education but also in political aspects. An article by the US Department of Agriculture posted on their website is an example, stating that the birthright citizenship law passed in the US Supreme Court due to a year-long battle between Wong Kim Ark (a Chinese immigrant born in San Francisco) and the US Department of Justice. Kamala Harris, daughter of an Indian immigrant became the first Asian American vice president of the United States in 2021.

===Sports===
Asian Americans have contributed to sports in the United States through much of the 20th century. Some of the most notable contributions include Olympic sports, but also in professional sports, particularly in the post-World War II years. As the Asian American population grew in the late 20th century, Asian American contributions expanded to more sports. Examples of female Asian American athletes include Michelle Kwan, Chloe Kim, Miki Gorman, Mirai Nagasu, and Maia Shibutani. Examples of male Asian American athletes include Jeremy Lin, Tiger Woods, Hines Ward, Richard Park, and Nathan Adrian.

==Cultural influence==
In recognition of the unique culture, traditions, and history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the United States government has permanently designated the month of May to be Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month; before 2021 it was known as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Asian American parenting as seen through relationships between Chinese parents and adolescence, which is described as being more authoritarian and less warm than relations between European parents and adolescence, has become a topic of study and discussion. These influences affect how parents regulate and monitor their children, and has been described as Tiger parenting, and has received interest and curiosity from non-Chinese parents.

===Health and medicine===

Asian immigrants are also changing the American medical landscape through increasing number of Asian medical practitioners in the United States. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the US government invited a number of foreign physicians particularly from India and the Philippines to address the shortage of physicians in rural and medically underserved urban areas. The trend in importing foreign medical practitioners, however, became a long-term solution as US schools failed to produce enough health care providers to match the increasing population. Amid decreasing interest in medicine among American college students due to high educational costs and high rates of job dissatisfaction, loss of morale, stress, and lawsuits, Asian American immigrants maintained a supply of healthcare practitioners for millions of Americans. It is documented that Asian American international medical graduates including highly skilled guest workers using the J1 Visa program for medical workers, tend to serve in health professions shortage areas (HPSA) and specialties that are not filled by US medical graduates especially primary care and rural medicine. In 2020, of all the medical personnel in the United States, 17% of doctors were Asian Americans, 9% of physician assistants were Asian American, and more than 9% of nurses were Asian Americans.

Nearly one in four Asian Americans are likely to use common alternative medicine. This includes traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Due to the prevalence of usage, engaging with Asian American populations, through the practitioners of these common alternative medicines, can lead to an increase of usage of underused medical procedures.

===Education===
Among America&#x27;s major racial categories, Asian Americans have the highest educational qualifications. This varies, however, for individual ethnic groups. For example, a 2010 study of all Asian American adults found 42% have at least a college degree, but only 16% of Vietnamese Americans and only 5% for Laotians and Cambodians. It has been noted, however, that 2008 US Census statistics put the bachelor&#x27;s degree attainment rate of Vietnamese Americans at 26%, which is not very different from the rate of 27% for all Americans. Census data from 2010 show 50% of Asian adults have earned at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, compared to 28% for all Americans, and 34% for non-Hispanic whites. Taiwanese Americans have some of the highest education rates, with nearly 74% having attained at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2010. Asian Americans made up twelve to eighteen percent of the student population at Ivy League schools, larger than their share of the population. For example, the Harvard College Class of 2023 admitted students were 25% Asian American.

In the years immediately preceding 2012, 61% of Asian American adult immigrants have a bachelor or higher level college education.

In August 2020, the US Justice Department argued that Yale University discriminated against Asian candidates on the basis of their race, a charge the university denied.

===Popular media===
Asian American culture is referenced in a number of mainstream forms such as literature, TV shows, and movies. &quot;Crazy Rich Asians,&quot; directed by John M. Chu, follows Rachel Chu, a Chinese American economics professor. Min Jin Lee&#x27;s novel, &quot;Pachinko&quot;, is an intergenerational story that tells the story of Koreans who immigrate to Japan. Some of the popular Asian American plays are &quot;Chickencoop Chinaman&quot;, &quot;And the Soul Shall Dance&quot;, &quot;Paper Angels&quot;, &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;, and many more.

===Identity===
As of year 2023, a recent survey showed one out of five respondents said they do not identify as Asian to non-Asians. Most immigrants identify as Asian compared to American-born Asian Americans. People under the age 18 are more likely not to identify as Asian. People over the age of 65 are more likely to identify as Asian.

==Social and political issues==

===Media portrayal===

Because Asian Americans total about 7.2% of the entire US population, diversity within the group is often overlooked in media treatment.

===Bamboo ceiling===
This concept appears to elevate Asian Americans by portraying them as an elite group of successful, highly educated, intelligent, and wealthy individuals, but it can also be considered an overly narrow and overly one-dimensional portrayal of Asian Americans, leaving out other human qualities such as vocal leadership, negative emotions, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, and desire for creative expression. Furthermore, Asian Americans who do not fit into the model minority mold can face challenges when people&#x27;s expectations based on the model minority myth do not match with reality. Traits outside of the model minority mold can be seen as negative character flaws for Asian Americans despite those very same traits being positive for the general American majority (e.g., risk taking, confidence, empowered). For this reason, Asian Americans encounter a &quot;bamboo ceiling&quot;, the Asian American equivalent of the glass ceiling in the workplace, with only 1.5% of Fortune 500 CEOs being Asians, a percentage smaller than their percentage of the total United States population.

The bamboo ceiling is defined as a combination of individual, cultural, and organisational factors that impede Asian Americans&#x27; career progress inside organizations. Since then, a variety of sectors (including nonprofits, universities, the government) have discussed the impact of the ceiling as it relates to Asians and the challenges they face. As described by Anne Fisher, the &quot;bamboo ceiling&quot; refers to the processes and barriers that serve to exclude Asians and American people of Asian descent from executive positions on the basis of subjective factors such as &quot;lack of leadership potential&quot; and &quot;lack of communication skills&quot; that cannot actually be explained by job performance or qualifications. Articles regarding the subject have been published in &quot;Crains&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

===Illegal immigration===
In 2012, there were 1.3 million Asian Americans; and for those awaiting visas, there were lengthy backlogs with over 450,000 Filipinos, over 325,000 Indians, over 250,000 Vietnamese, and over 225,000 Chinese awaiting visas. As of 2009, Filipinos and Indians accounted for the highest number of alien immigrants for &quot;Asian Americans&quot; with an estimated illegal population of 270,000 and 200,000 respectively. Indian Americans are also the fastest-growing alien immigrant group in the United States, with an increase in illegal immigration of 125% since 2000. This is followed by Koreans (200,000) and Chinese (120,000). Nonetheless, Asian Americans have the highest naturalization rates in the United States. In 2015, out of a total of 730,259 applicants, 261,374 became new Americans. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, legal permanent residents or green card holders from India, Philippines, and China were among the top nationals applying for US naturalization in 2015.

Due to the stereotype of Asian Americans being successful as a group and having the lowest crime rates in the United States, public attention to illegal immigration is mostly focused on those from Mexico and Latin America while leaving out Asians. Asians are the second largest racial/ethnic alien immigrant group in the US behind Hispanics and Latinos. While the majority of Asian immigrants immigrate legally to the United States, up to 15% of Asian immigrants immigrate without legal documents.

===Race-based violence===
Asian Americans have been the targets of violence based on their race and or ethnicity. This violence includes, but is not limited to, such events as the Rock Springs massacre, Watsonville Riots, Bellingham Riots in 1916 against South Asians, attacks upon Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Korean American businesses targeted during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Attacks on Chinese in the American frontier were common. This included the slaughter of forty to sixty Chinese miners by Paiute Indians in 1866, during the Snake War, the Los Angeles Chinese massacre of 1871, and an attack on Chinese miners at the Chinese Massacre Cove by cowboys in 1887 which resulted in 31 deaths. In the late 1980s, assaults and other hate crimes were committed against South Asians in New Jersey by a group of Latinos known as the Dotbusters. In the late 1990s, the lone death that occurred during the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting by a white supremacist was a Filipino postal worker. On July 17, 1989, Patrick Edward Purdy, a drifter and former resident of Stockton, California, wen and opened fire on Cleveland Elementary School students in the playground who were mainly of southeast Asian descent. Within minutes, he fired dozens of rounds, although reports ranged. He was armed with two pistols and an AK-47 with a bayonet killing five students and shooting at least 37 others. After the shooting spree Purdy killed himself.

Even when it did not manifest as violence, contempt against Asian Americans was reflected in aspects of popular culture such as the playground chant &quot;Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees&quot;.

After the September 11 attacks, Sikh Americans were targeted, becoming the victims of numerous hate crimes, including murder. Other Asian Americans have also been the victims of race-based violence in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Bloomington, Indiana. Furthermore, it has been reported that young Asian Americans are more likely to be the targets of violence than their peers. In 2017, racist graffiti and other property damage was done to a community center in Stockton&#x27;s Little Manila. Racism and discrimination still persist against Asian Americans, occurring not only against recent immigrants but also against well-educated and highly trained professionals.

Recent waves of immigration of Asian Americans to largely African American neighborhoods have led to cases of severe racial tension. Acts of large-scale violence against Asian American students by their black classmates have been reported in multiple cities. In October 2008, 30 black students chased and attacked 5 Asian students at South Philadelphia High School, and a similar attack on Asian students occurred at the same school one year later, prompting a protest by Asian students in response.

Asian-owned businesses have been a frequent target of tensions between black and Asian Americans. During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, more than 2000 Korean-owned businesses were looted or burned by groups of African Americans. From 1990 to 1991, a high-profile, racially motivated boycott of an Asian-owned shop in Brooklyn was organized by a local black nationalist activist, eventually resulting in the owner being forced to sell his business. Another racially motivated boycott against an Asian-owned business occurred in Dallas in 2012, after an Asian American clerk fatally shot an African American who had robbed his store. During the Ferguson unrest in 2014, Asian-owned businesses were looted, and Asian-owned stores were looted during the 2015 Baltimore protests while African American-owned stores were bypassed. Violence against Asian Americans continue to occur based on their race, with one source asserting that Asian Americans are the fastest-growing targets of hate crimes and violence.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, concern has grown due to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment in the United States. In March 2020, President Donald Trump called the disease &quot;China Virus&quot; and &quot;Kung-Flu&quot;, based on its origin; in response organizations such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Western States Center, stated that doing so will increase anti-Asian sentiment and violence. &quot;Vox&quot; wrote that the Trump Administration&#x27;s use of the terms &quot;China Virus&quot;, &quot;Kung-Flu&quot;, and &quot;Wuhan virus&quot; would lead to an increase in xenophobia. The disease naming controversy occurred at a time when the Chinese Foreign Ministry was claiming that the disease originated in the United States. Violent acts, relating to the disease, against Asian Americans have been documented mostly in New York, California, and elsewhere. As of December 31, 2020, there were 259 reports of anti-Asian incidents in New York reported to Stop AAPI Hate. As of March 2021, there have been more than 3800 anti-Asian racist incidents. A notable incident was the 2021 Atlanta spa shootings, a fatal attack in which six of the eight casualties were of Asian descent. The shooter reportedly said &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill all Asians&quot;.

===Racial stereotypes===

Until the late 20th century, the term &quot;Asian American&quot; was mostly adopted by activists, while the average person who was of Asian ancestry identified with his or her specific ethnicity. The murder of Vincent Chin in 1982 was a pivotal civil rights case, and it marked the emergence of Asian Americans as a distinct group in United States.

Stereotypes of Asians have largely been collectively internalized by society and most of the repercussions of these stereotypes are negative for Asian Americans and Asian immigrants in daily interactions, current events, and governmental legislation. In many instances, media portrayals of East Asians often reflect a dominant Americentric perception rather than realistic and authentic depictions of true cultures, customs and behaviors. Asians have experienced discrimination and have been victims of hate crimes related to their ethnic stereotypes.

A study has indicated that most non-Asian Americans generally do not differentiate between Asian Americans who are of different ethnicities. Stereotypes of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are nearly identical. A 2002 survey of Americans&#x27; attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that 24% of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an Asian American, second only to African Americans; 23% would be uncomfortable supporting an Asian American presidential candidate, compared to 15% for an African American, 14% for a woman and 11% for a Jew; 17% would be upset if a substantial number of Asian Americans moved into their neighborhood; 25% had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general. The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as business people (77%); high value on education (67%).

There is a widespread perception that Asian Americans are not &quot;American&quot; but are instead &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot;. Asian Americans often report being asked the question, &quot;Where are you really from?&quot; by other Americans, regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in United States and been a part of its society. Many Asian Americans are themselves not immigrants but rather born in the United States. Many East Asian Americans are asked if they are Chinese or Japanese, an assumption based on major groups of past immigrants.

Discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans increased with the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, according to a study done at Washington State University (WSU) and published in &quot;Stigma and Health&quot;. The NYPD reported a 1,900% increase in hate crimes motivated by anti-Asian sentiment in 2020, largely due to the virus origins in Wuhan, China.

According to a poll done in 2022, 33 percent of Americans believe Asian Americans are &quot;more loyal to their country of origin&quot; than the US while 21 percent falsely believe Asian Americans are at least &quot;partially responsible&quot; for the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, only 29 percent of Asian Americans believe they &quot;completely agree&quot; with the statement that they feel they belong and are accepted in the US, while 71 percent say they are discriminated in the US.

===Model minority===

Asian Americans are sometimes characterized as a model minority in the United States because many of their cultures encourage a strong work ethic, a respect for elders, a high degree of professional and academic success, a high valuation of family, education and religion. Statistics such as high household income and low incarceration rate, low rates of many diseases, and higher than average life expectancy are also discussed as positive aspects of Asian Americans.

The implicit advice is that the other minorities should stop protesting and emulate the Asian American work ethic and devotion to higher education. Some critics say the depiction replaces biological racism with cultural racism, and should be dropped. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;the idea that Asian Americans are distinct among minority groups and immune to the challenges faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue for the community, which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like #ModelMinorityMutiny.&quot;

The model minority concept can also affect Asians&#x27; public education. By comparison with other minorities, Asians often achieve higher test scores and grades compared to other Americans. Stereotyping Asian American as over-achievers can lead to harm if school officials or peers expect all to perform higher than average. The very high educational attainments of Asian Americans has often been noted; in 1980, for example, 74% of Chinese Americans, 62% of Japanese Americans, and 55% of Korean Americans aged 20–21 were in college, compared to only a third of the whites. The disparity at postgraduate levels is even greater, and the differential is especially notable in fields making heavy use of mathematics. By 2000, a plurality of undergraduates at such elite public California schools as UC Berkeley and UCLA, which are obligated by law to not consider race as a factor in admission, were Asian American. The pattern is rooted in the pre-World War II era. Native-born Chinese and Japanese Americans reached educational parity with majority whites in the early decades of the 20th century. One group of writers who discuss the &quot;model minority&quot; stereotype, have taken to attaching the term &quot;myth&quot; after &quot;model minority&quot;, thus encouraging discourse regarding how the concept and stereotype is harmful to Asian American communities and ethnic groups.

The model minority concept can be emotionally damaging to some Asian Americans, particularly since they are expected to live up to those peers who fit the stereotype. Studies have shown that some Asian Americans suffer from higher rates of stress, depression, mental illnesses, and suicides in comparison to other groups, indicating that the pressures to achieve and live up to the model minority image may take a mental and psychological toll on some Asian Americans. The American Psychological Association has published a paper relying on 2007 data that takes issue with what is said are myths about the suicide rates of Asian Americans.

Alongside mental and psychological tolls that the model minority concept has on Asian Americans, they are also faced with the repercussions that it has on physical health and the desire for individuals to seek medical care more specifically cancer screening or treatment. Asian Americans, between the other racial/ethnic groups in the United States, are the only group with the leading cause of death being cancer while having significantly low rates of cancer screenings. Different pressures like alienation if diagnosed or the desire to conform to stereotypes of the image of a healthy lifestyle can deter individuals from seeking cancer screenings or treatment before the onset of symptoms.

The &quot;model minority&quot; stereotype fails to distinguish between different ethnic groups with different histories. When divided up by ethnicity, it can be seen that the economic and academic successes supposedly enjoyed by Asian Americans are concentrated into a few ethnic groups. Cambodians, Hmong, and Laotians (and to a lesser extent, Vietnamese) all have relatively low achievement rates, possibly due to their refugee status, and the fact that they are non-voluntary immigrants.

===Social and economic disparities===
In 2015, Asian American earnings were found to exceed all other racial groups when all Asian ethnic groups are grouped as a whole. Yet, a 2014 report from the Census Bureau reported that 12% of Asian Americans were living below the poverty line, while 10.1% of non-Hispanic White Americans live below the poverty line. A 2017 study of wealth inequality within Asian Americans found a greater gap between wealthy and non-wealthy Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic white Americans. Once country of birth and other demographic factors are taken into account, a portion of the sub-groups that make up Asian Americans are much more likely than non-Hispanic White Americans to live in poverty. Healthcare access varies greatly by race and ethnicity in the United States; some lifelong diseases and impairments affect Asian Americans more negatively compared to other US census-recognized racial groups. Research shows many health disparities among different racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

There are major disparities that exist among Asian Americans when specific ethnic groups are examined. For example, in 2012, Asian Americans had the highest educational attainment level of any racial demographic in the country. Yet, there are many sub groups of Asian Americans who suffer in terms of education with some sub groups showing a high rate of dropping out of school or lacking a college education. This occurs in terms of household income as well; in 2008 Asian Americans had the highest median household income overall of any racial demographic, while there were Asian sub-groups who had average median incomes lower than both the US average and non-Hispanic Whites. In 2014, data released by the US Census Bureau revealed that five Asian American ethnic groups are in the top ten lowest earning ethnicities in terms of per capita income in all of the United States.

<text>U.S. Route 12 or U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway, running from Aberdeen, Washington, to Detroit, Michigan, for almost . The highway has mostly been superseded by Interstate 90 (I-90) and I-94, but, unlike most U.S. Highways that have been superseded by an Interstate, US 12 remains intact as an important link for local and regional destinations. The highway&#x27;s western terminus in Aberdeen is at an intersection with US 101, while the highway&#x27;s eastern terminus in Downtown Detroit is at the corner of Michigan and Cass avenues, near Campus Martius Park.

===Washington===
The western terminus of US 12 is located in Aberdeen. The highway loosely follows the eastbound leg of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, between Wallula and Clarkston, thus being marked as part of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. The east end of the highway in the state is at Clarkston, where the highway crosses the Snake River into Idaho at Lewiston, Idaho.

The Washington section of US 12, other than a concurrency with I-5, is defined at Washington Revised Code § 47.17.055.

===Idaho===

US 12 enters the state at Lewiston, crossing the Snake River from Clarkston, Washington. It ascends the Clearwater River, running concurrently with US 95 for . It reduces to a two-lane undivided highway with signs that read &quot;winding road next &quot; and goes on to Orofino, continuing up the middle fork of that river to Lowell, the junction of the Lochsa and Selway rivers. It continues up the Lochsa and climbs to Lolo Pass at the Montana border. This portion of the highway is also designated as part of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Most of the highway in Idaho is within Clearwater National Forest. The eastern section of US 12, through remote mountain forest and up to Lolo Pass, was built in the early 1960s, making it the last U.S. Highway constructed. No services are available between Lowell and Powell, about further east.

===Montana===
US 12 in Montana has been defined as the Lewis and Clark Highway despite not being the route followed by Lewis and Clark across the state.

US 12&#x27;s through Montana&#x27;s mountains and plains is the greatest distance that US 12 traverses through any state. The highway enters Montana at Lolo Pass, southwest of Lolo Hot Springs in Lolo National Forest. After passing Lolo Peak to the south and traveling east for , it meets with US 93 at Lolo and continues as a concurrency northeast for , where US 93 heads due north on Reserve Street, toward Glacier National Park. US 12 continues northeast through Missoula&#x27;s downtown, eventually meeting I-90. It then overlaps I-90 for until Garrison, where it heads east toward Helena for . This two-lane section of the trip passes through Avon and Elliston winding through Helena National Forest, over the Continental Divide at MacDonald Pass, and then through Montana&#x27;s capital city, Helena. US 12 passes over I-15, at which point it joins US 287 south. US 12 overlaps US 287 and heads southeast, toward Townsend for , where it splits from US 287, which heads south for toward the intersection of I-90 near the town of Three Forks. US 12 heads east toward White Sulphur Springs for . The route joins US 89 for before entering White Sulphur Springs and for another east of town. US 89 splits north and US 12 continues east on its own for , until the junction with I-94 at Forsyth as a concurrency northeast for , to Miles City. At the east exit for Miles City, US 12 splits again from I-94 and heads almost directly east to the North Dakota border at a distance of .

===North Dakota===

US 12 is a two-lane undivided highway that runs , through Adams, Bowman, and Slope counties in southwest North Dakota. The speed limit is on rural segments, with slower posted speeds within the cities of Marmarth, Rhame, Bowman, Scranton, and Hettinger. US 12 meets with US 85 in Bowman, and the routes are concurrent for a short distance through the city.

===South Dakota===

US 12 enters South Dakota from North Dakota as a rural two-lane highway about west-northwest of Lemmon before entering the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. For approximately the next , US 12 runs parallel to the border of North Dakota, sometimes within less than . At Walker, US 12 heads southeast for , where it crosses the Missouri River at Mobridge, exiting the reservation. From there, it continues east for , until it meets with US 83 near Selby. It overlaps US 83 for . After leaving US 83, it turns due east and spends about as a rural two-lane highway again. A few miles before reaching Aberdeen, it becomes an at-grade expressway. After the junction with US 281, it goes back to being two lanes for a few miles through Aberdeen and past Aberdeen Regional Airport, before once again becoming a four-lane expressway, until before Waubay. East of Waubay, it becomes again an at-grade expressway until it meets with I-29 near Summit. The speed limit from Aberdeen to I-29 is except through the communities of Groton, Webster, and Waubay. From there, it heads southeast until Milbank. At Milbank, it continues east for , until it crosses into Minnesota at Big Stone City, just south of Big Stone Lake. The South Dakota section of US 12 is legally defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31 April 132.

===Minnesota===

From the South Dakota–Minnesota state line at Ortonville to Wayzata, US 12 is mostly a rural two-lane highway with a speed limit, with slower speed limits through towns and a four-lane surface arterial segment through the city of Willmar. From western Wayzata to I-394 in Minnetonka, US 12 is a six-lane freeway. East of I-494, US 12 is invisibly concurrent with I-394 and I-94 through Minneapolis and Saint Paul to the Minnesota–Wisconsin state line at Hudson.

The Minnesota section of US 12 is defined as Routes 149, 26, and 10 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.115(80) and 161.114(2).

===Wisconsin===
US 12 crosses the St. Croix River from Lakeland, Minnesota, into Hudson, running concurrently with I-94 before splitting just east of the city. It mainly follows a similar path to I-94 to the north, before crossing under I-94 into downtown Menomonie before continuing in an easterly direction through Eau Claire. In Fall Creek, US 12 turns southeasterly toward Fairchild, it then runs concurrently with US 10 going east for just before returning to its course southeast bound. US 12 eventually recrosses I-94 into Black River Falls and then parallels I-94 in a southeastward direction. US 12 also runs through Millston and Kirby. Afterward, it turns directly south to Tomah, where it becomes North Superior Avenue. It alternates between a four- and two-lane road on its way through downtown. It then turns east for , then parallels I-90/I-94 through Camp Douglas, New Lisbon, Mauston, and Lyndon Station before crossing under the pair of Interstates into downtown Wisconsin Dells. US 12 turns south to Baraboo and runs along the western edge of Devil&#x27;s Lake State Park. In Sauk City, US 12 turns southeast toward Madison and runs along the city&#x27;s western and southern edges. Here, it becomes a four- to eight-lane freeway with US 14 and US 18 known by the locals as &quot;The Beltline&quot;. On the southeast side of the city, it crosses I-39/I-90 toward Cambridge. It turns southeast here and runs through Fort Atkinson and Whitewater. In Elkhorn, US 12 becomes a four-lane freeway with a speed limit. It returns to a two-lane road at the Wisconsin–Illinois state line at Genoa City.

===Illinois===
In Illinois, US 12 is an arterial surface road that runs from Richmond, southeast to Des Plaines. It then turns due south, continuing through the Chicago metropolitan area, joining with US 45. In Stone Park, US 20 joins US 12/US 45. In Hickory Hills, US 45 continues south, while US 12/US 20 runs due east along 95th Street in the southwest suburbs. From Hickory Hills, US 12/US 20 runs east nearly to the Lake Michigan lakefront and then joins with US 41, as all three routes travel southeast into the state of Indiana.

US 12 is referred to as Rand Road in Chicago&#x27;s northwest suburbs. Rand is an original name for the area around Des Plaines, the location where the road resumes its westerly direction. South of Des Plaines, US 12 follows Mannheim Road, La Grange Road, and then 95th Street, before merging with US 41 on Ewing and Indianapolis avenues toward the Indiana state line.

===Indiana===

In Indiana, US 12 is a historically significant route, that winds along the southern coast of Lake Michigan. It runs from an interchange with the Indiana Toll Road, concurrent with US 20 and US 41 in Whiting, to Michiana Shores, at the Michigan state line. A large portion of this segment is known as the Dunes Highway.

===Michigan===

US 12 is now the only U.S. Highway still serving Downtown Detroit, whose street grid was laid by Augustus B. Woodward, to have a five-way intersection of the roads that would become US 12, US 10, US 16, US 112 and US 25. US 24 still travels through Detroit from Puritan to 8 Mile Road (M-102) on the far west side.

As from the earliest days of its existence, US 12 enters Michigan from Indiana, southwest of New Buffalo, and continues to the old junction of US 12 and US 112 in New Buffalo. It is now assigned between New Buffalo and Detroit (except through Ypsilanti), along what was US 112 until 1962.

On May 4, 2004, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) designated of US 12 from New Buffalo to Detroit as a Michigan Heritage Route. The east–west corridor traverses the counties of Berrien, Cass, St. Joseph, Branch, Hillsdale, Lenawee, Washtenaw, and Wayne.

==History==
Since the highway&#x27;s creation in 1926, the eastern terminus has always remained within a few blocks of Cadillac Square in Downtown Detroit, Michigan.
* 1926: Cadillac Square at the convergence with US 10, US 16, US 25, and US 112; US 12 ran along Grand River. The original ending was at Miles City, Montana.
* 1939: The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved a request to extend US 12 to Yellowstone National Park.
* 1956: US 12 was rerouted along the Lodge Freeway (M-10), ending on Jefferson Avenue; the terminus moved four blocks southeast, to the corner of Woodward Avenue (M-1/US 10) and Jefferson Avenue.
* 1959: Extended to Missoula, Montana.
* 1962: After I-94 was completed across Michigan, it was no longer cosigned with US 12. The US 12 route designation was moved to the former route of US 112, which was decommissioned. US 12 now runs along Michigan Avenue and again ends at Cadillac Square. It was extended to Lewiston, Idaho.
*1967: Extended to Aberdeen, Washington, to its present terminus at US 101.
* 1970: US 10 was rerouted from Woodward to the Lodge Freeway and Jefferson Avenue. At this time US 12 was apparently extended along Woodward, to again terminate with US 10 at Woodward and Jefferson avenues, though with the designations flipflopped from their 1956 routing.
* 2001: The City of Detroit and MDOT, in a series of jurisdictional transfers, moved the terminus back four blocks, to again be at Cadillac Square.
* 2005: In another transfer, the US 12 terminus was truncated another four blocks, to end at the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building, on the corner of Michigan and Cass avenues.

The western terminus was gradually extended westward, until it reached the Pacific Ocean.

===Former ferry crossing===
In 1925, US 12 in Michigan was originally proposed to run from Detroit to Ludington, across Lake Michigan, via the Pere Marquette Railway car ferry to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and then continuing into Wisconsin, on what later became US 10, in those two states. The 1974 &quot;Golden Anniversary Celebration&quot; reprint of the 1926 Rand McNally Road Atlas shows US 12 following what later became the route of US 10 through Michigan, from Detroit, through Flint, Saginaw, Midland, and Clare on its way to Ludington.

===Routing changes and proposals===
US 12 was proposed to enter Wyoming on the current route of US 212 from Mammoth Hot Springs to a point northwest of Clark before its route in Montana was rerouted. It was also proposed to enter Oregon on the current route of US 730 from east-southeast of Boardman to a point northeast of Cold Springs, but that was canceled.

In the 1960s, a portion of US 12 in Western Washington was moved north to the town of Morton, when Mossyrock Dam was built on the Cowlitz River in Lewis County. A large portion of old, two-lane US 12 in the Yakima Valley was replaced by I-82 and I-182 in the 1980s, between Yakima and the Tri-Cities, though the freeways are still cosigned with the US 12 designation. The old two-lane highway now bears the name Wine Country Road.

<text>Aquemini () is the third studio album by the American hip hop duo Outkast. It was released on September 29, 1998, by LaFace Records and Arista Records. The title is a portmanteau of the two performers&#x27; Zodiac signs: Aquarius (Big Boi) and Gemini (André 3000), which is indicative of the album&#x27;s recurring theme of the differing personalities of the two members. The group recorded the majority of the album in Bobby Brown&#x27;s Bosstown Recording Studios and Doppler Studios, both in Atlanta, Georgia.

Released as the follow-up to the duo&#x27;s commercially successful 1996 album &quot;ATLiens&quot;, &quot;Aquemini&quot; expands on the previous record&#x27;s outer space-inspired compositions by incorporating live instrumentation and drawing on 1970s funk, southern soul, gospel, country, psychedelic rock, and other influences. The album reflected a greater level of creative freedom for the group, which led to the members self-producing the majority of the tracks and employing a large number of session musicians who filtered in and out of the studio throughout its recording, exerting a major influence on the album&#x27;s compositional development. Featured guest artists include Raekwon, George Clinton, and Erykah Badu. Lyrically, &quot;Aquemini&quot; explores various subjects including individuality, human nature, addiction, self-inflicted struggles, technology, and interpersonal relationships, as well as blending science fiction concepts and urban narratives.

&quot;Aquemini&quot; received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, who praised the album&#x27;s musicality, eclectic sound, and unique lyrical themes. Like its predecessor, it was a commercial success, peaking at No. 2 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was certified platinum in November 1998, only two months after its release, and was certified double platinum on July 2, 1999, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Four of the album&#x27;s tracks were released as singles, although some were limited promotional releases and not available commercially. Since its initial release, &quot;Aquemini&quot; has gone on to be considered one of the greatest hip hop albums ever made, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 500 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In a 2020 updated list, it was moved up to number 49.

==Background==
In 1994, Outkast released their debut album, &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot;, which was recorded when the rappers Big Boi and André 3000 were 18. Bolstered by the success of &quot;Player&#x27;s Ball&quot;, the record established Outkast as prominent figures in the Southern hip hop scene. After the album was certified platinum, LaFace Records gave Outkast more creative control and advanced money for their 1996 follow-up album &quot;ATLiens&quot;. On &quot;ATLiens&quot;, André 3000 and Big Boi abandoned the &quot;hard-partying playa characters&quot; of their debut album in favor of personas that were more futuristic, and produced many of the songs on their own for the first time. Critics praised the group&#x27;s maturing musical style on the record, which debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold nearly 350,000 copies in its first 2 weeks of release. The single &quot;Elevators (Me &amp; You)&quot; reached number 12 and spent 20 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

After the release of &quot;ATLiens&quot;, André 3000 entered a relationship with the neo soul singer Erykah Badu, who was part of a burgeoning movement in the urban music scene described as &quot;more bohemian than ghetto&quot;. André 3000 adopted a more flamboyant style of dress during performances in promotion of &quot;ATLiens&quot; that included large glasses, blond wigs, and marching band uniforms. Badu gave birth to his first child in November 1997, which presented new artistic inspiration for the rapper.

==Recording==

Due to OutKast&#x27;s newfound commercial success and higher budget for the album, the group enjoyed a more relaxed schedule and &quot;could really just live&quot; at the studio. The duo and studio musicians lived and worked in the studio for weeks straight, with Big Boi noting, &quot;It usually takes us two to three years to make a record because we take our time; we ain&#x27;t giving you that fast food, trying to meet a deadline. It ain&#x27;t done until it&#x27;s done sonically.&quot; For &quot;Aquemini&quot;, the duo used live instrumentation and improvisation, bringing a baby grand piano into the studio and hiring musicians who played &quot;everything from stoner funk to prog rock&quot;. The producer Neal H. Pogue recalled, &quot;That was the beauty of making all those records – having musicians come in and out. It was almost like a Motown, that&#x27;s what we had. Or like a Stax Records thing. That&#x27;s what I loved about it. It brought back that whole feeling of making records. It was organic.&quot; Much of the music on &quot;Aquemini&quot; was formulated during jam sessions, in which one musician would begin with creating a chord pattern and the rest would incorporate their instruments following that sequence. While recording &quot;Aquemini&quot;, André 3000 drew influence from reggae music and listened to Bob Marley constantly during the sessions. After the musical aspects of a song were developed, André 3000 and Big Boi would then create lyrics that they felt would fit with the tone of the song.

For the record, André 3000 did most of the album&#x27;s production, while Big Boi crafted hooks for the songs. André 3000 and the producer Mr. DJ learned about beat creation through observing the members of Organized Noize at work, with Mr. DJ observing that despite André 3000&#x27;s normally frugal lifestyle, his enthusiasm for production led him to splurge on costly recording equipment. At one point, André 3000 attempted singing and modifying his voice with pitch-correction equipment, but Big Boi warned him that this would alienate the group&#x27;s urban audience. Another point of contention was the order of the track listing; Big Boi wanted to begin the album with &quot;Y&#x27;all Scared&quot; while André 3000 and the other producers and musicians wanted the first track to be &quot;Return of the G&quot;, preferring that the record start with a song with just the duo as opposed to one with multiple collaborators. Big Boi missed his flight to attend the album mastering session and by the time he arrived, the others had already settled on a cohesive track list for the record. After a long, heated discussion, Big Boi eventually agreed to opening the album with &quot;Return of the G&quot;. The album features the song &quot;West Savannah&quot;, which had been recorded during the &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; sessions, and was included on &quot;Aquemini&quot; to give listeners a &quot;bonus&quot; that had sentimental value for the duo, as well as to pay homage to Big Boi&#x27;s family living in Savannah.

==Musical style and lyrics==
Big Boi described the music on the album as &quot;very experimental&quot; noting that it featured live instrumentation that included horns, guitar, piano, and harmonica. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey detected the &quot;ethereal futurism&quot; of &quot;ATLiens&quot; in the music on &quot;Aquemini&quot;, but also noted that &quot;more often &quot;Aquemini&quot; plants its feet on the ground for a surprisingly down-home flavor&quot;. He also observed a &quot;Southern earthiness and simultaneous spirituality&quot; in Organized Noize&#x27;s production work on the record. According to Rashod D. Ollison of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, the album &quot;fus[es] organic soul and progressive rap with touches of electro-funk, dub and rock&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The Boombox&quot; writer Todd &quot;Stereo&quot; Williams says the music fuses their debut album&#x27;s raw funk with the &quot;futuristic soul&quot; of &quot;ATLiens&quot; for a sound that &quot;genre-hop[s] from southern rap odes (&#x27;West Savannah&#x27;) to flirtations with P-Funk (&#x27;Synthesizer&#x27;), hard rock guitars (&#x27;Chonkyfire&#x27;)&quot;, and collaborations beyond the duo&#x27;s core of Dungeon Family artists. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that the album draws from southern soul, gospel, and country, and noted that it &quot;favors live-band sounds without making the purist’s mistake of shunning synthetic ones,&quot; praising both &quot;Preston Crump’s mellow, sustained basslines and the swing-friendly drum tracks of Mr. DJ and Organized Noize.&quot;

Lyrically, much of &quot;Aquemini&quot; features introspection about the desolation of the human condition, and themes related to individuality and self-determination. Overarching themes addressed on the record include drug addiction, precarious relationships, and freedom from self-inflicted struggles. Other subjects include excessive reliance on technology and the Atlanta club scene. On the record, the group often shifts between science fiction-inspired topics and the harsh realities of urban life. Saul Austerlitz of the &quot;Yale Herald&quot; notes the central theme of the group&#x27;s &quot;ability to move between two worlds—the G-funk glamorized by the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur and the group&#x27;s own spacier, more poetic excursions&quot; in the album. Another theme is the duality of the two members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as &quot;the player&quot; and Andre 3000 as &quot;the poet&quot;, according to the album&#x27;s cover. Big Boi generally covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South and attractive women, while Andre 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes. In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, OutKast did not tone down the regional qualities, like the harmonica break on &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record, using &quot;relaxed, hyper, distorted, speedy and conversational presentations.&quot;

==Songs==

&quot;Aquemini&quot;″s opening track &quot;Hold On, Be Strong&quot; was written by the session guitarist Donny Mathis and originally conceived as a full song with verses, but the group preferred to only use the refrain. André 3000 played a kalimba on the song after purchasing the instrument at a flea market, drawing inspiration from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. &quot;Return of the G&quot; addresses concerns from fans who felt that the group&#x27;s style had changed too drastically since the release of &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot;, as well as those who make poor decisions in order to keep their street credibility. When discussing the lyrical content of the song, André 3000 explained, &quot;I was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn&#x27;t accept at the time. I started getting flak from some people, so they were like, &#x27;Either he&#x27;s gay or on drugs&#x27; ... &#x27;Return of the Gangsta&#x27; was trying to give them a sense of, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;m still a regular person.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; contains blues-influenced guitar work and folksy harmonies that &quot;announce OutKast&#x27;s distinctive style of Southern boogie. The groove goes into overdrive during a clapping, foot-stomping breakdown funkified by a fierce harmonica as the kick drum pounds incessantly.&quot;

The next track, &quot;Skew It On the Bar-B&quot;, features the Wu-Tang Clan rapper Raekwon and discusses the disappointment of the group&#x27;s debut album not achieving the coveted &quot;five-mic&quot; rating from &quot;The Source&quot;: &quot;I gotta hit the Source / I need my other half mic / because that &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmusik&quot; was a classic right?&quot;. &quot;Skew It On the Bar-B&quot; is followed by the title track, which has been compared to the music of the soul singer Isaac Hayes. Pogue experimented with delays and echos in his production to make the song &quot;dimensional, like you could actually put your hands through the song.&quot; &quot;Synthesizer&quot; contains elements of electrofunk and features the funk musician George Clinton. &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Synthesizer&quot; an &quot;electronic-leaning... spasm of technological paranoia.&quot; Emma Warren of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the track &quot;raw and woozy&quot;, dubbing it the &quot;weirdest moment of the record&quot;. On the seventh track, &quot;Slump&quot;, Big Boi is joined by two members of the Dungeon Family as they describe their experiences selling dope. This is one of the few tracks that does not have Andre on it. On &quot;West Savannah&quot;, Big Boi discusses his Southern roots, and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating &quot;You might call us country, but we&#x27;s only Southern&quot;.

&quot;Da Art of Storytellin&#x27; (Part 1)&quot; tells the story of a self-destructive childhood friend named Sasha Thumper who dies of a drug overdose. Commenting on the song&#x27;s lyrical content, author Mickey Hess remarks that André 3000 &quot;manages to walk the fine line between emotionalism and masculinity by articulating this highly emotional narrative with an almost emotionless tone.&quot; The next track, &quot;Da Art of Storytellin&#x27; (Part 2)&quot;, is an apocalyptic song that represents the group&#x27;s vision of &quot;the last song recorded in the world&quot;, with André 3000 commenting, &quot;I do remember thinking, &#x27;What if it was the end of the world and we had to get to the Dungeon on some X-Men superhero shit. I think I was vibing on some end-of-the-world, last-recorded-song shit&#x27;&quot;. Following is &quot;Mamacita&quot;, which features Dungeon Crew rapper Masada in a meditation on male-female relationships, inspired by an ex-girlfriend of André 3000 who began pursuing women after their breakup. &quot;SpottieOttieDopaliscious&quot; relates a story of ill-fated romance, with André 3000 describing the infatuation during an encounter with a woman at a club and Big Boi noting the hopelessness of the relationship as the song progresses.

&quot;Y&#x27;all Scared&quot; is a collaboration with three members of Goodie Mob and contains the chant &quot;If you scared, say you scared&quot; accompanied by prominent organ and guitar work. &quot;Nathaniel&quot; is an a cappella rap by the group&#x27;s close friend who at the time was an inmate in a Georgia prison, and the song is a recording of an actual collect call during his time in jail. The track is an introduction to &quot;Liberation&quot;. The eight-minute-long &quot;Liberation&quot; combines a variety of musical styles, including gospel, jazz, blues, and world music. The song is notable for not including rapped vocals and instead features vocal alternations between singing and spoken word styles. Lyrically, the track utilizes images of slavery to symbolize artistic freedom and not being concerned with the opinions of the public and record labels. The album closes with &quot;Chonkyfire&quot;, which features a fuzzy guitar riff and snippets from OutKast&#x27;s speech at the 1995 Source Awards in which the group emphasized the Southern hip-hop scene as a legitimate subgenre. &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Chonkyfire&quot; a track of &quot;bad-trip psychedelic rock.&quot;

==Release==
The group originally planned to create a film in conjunction with &quot;Aquemini&quot;, completing a script three months before the release of the record. OutKast met with MTV for the project, who, despite liking the idea for the film, hoped to instead buy the project and cast Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes instead, feeling they had more &quot;star power.&quot; Although the duo recalls being &quot;heartbroken&quot; at the time, André 3000 and Big Boi continued to work on ideas for a collaborative film, eventually resulting in the 2006 musical &quot;Idlewild&quot; starring the group. David Browne of &quot;The New York Times&quot; viewed the album art as an homage to blaxploitation films of the 1970s. The record&#x27;s title is a combination of the two members&#x27; zodiac signs, with André 3000 being a Gemini and Big Boi being an Aquarius. The packaging featured a sticker describing Big Boi as &quot;the playa&quot; and André as &quot;the poet&quot;.

&quot;Aquemini&quot; debuted behind Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life&quot; at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200, the same opening position of both &quot;ATLiens&quot; and the group&#x27;s next release, &quot;Stankonia&quot;. The record sold 227,000 copies in its first week of release, ahead of A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;The Love Movement&quot; and Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;. In Norway and Germany, the album peaked at numbers 39 and 66, respectively.

In 1999, civil rights activist Rosa Parks filed a lawsuit against OutKast for the song &quot;Rosa Parks&quot;, claiming that the song used her name without her permission, constituting false advertising and an infringement on her right to publicity, in addition to defamation of character. The lawsuit was dismissed on first amendment grounds that year by a federal judge, but the appeals court partially reinstated the suit in 2003, stating that the group must have an artistic reason for titling the song with her name. The case was settled in 2005 with OutKast and LaFace Records agreeing to create educational programs to &quot;enlighten today&#x27;s youth about the significant role Rosa Parks played in making America a better place for all races.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Aquemini&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey called it &quot;a stroke of brilliance&quot;. He praised the record for avoiding the &quot;hardcore clichés&quot; and summed up his review by saying that &quot;Aquemini&quot; is &quot;a virtuosic masterpiece, and a landmark hip-hop album of the late &#x27;90s&quot;. Robert Christgau also commented positively on the album, calling the record &quot;evolved G-funk with denser instrumental crosstalk&quot; and &quot;rap-rock every bit as heavy as the bohrium and dubnium compounds hardheads hyped circa the &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Soren Baker complimented OutKast&#x27;s &quot;intelligent hip-hop&quot; and commented that &quot;musically, the collection supplies some of the lushest tracks ever included on a hip-hop record&quot;, noting that the music will &quot;stimulate the mind, touch the soul and pack the dance floor.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; named it the group&#x27;s &quot;third best offering.&quot; Sia Michel of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;an impassioned state-of-hip-hop address&quot;. In a brief review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Cheo Tyehimba qualified &quot;Aquemini&quot; as the hip-hop album of the year.

S. H. Fernando Jr. of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;OutKast prove that you don&#x27;t have to sell out to sell records. Sporting plenty of live chops and soulful harmonies, &quot;Aquemini&#x27;s&quot; fresh, original feel defies rap&#x27;s coastal clichés.&quot; Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; commented that the duo&#x27;s &quot;molasses-smooth raps speak to the stark realities of urban streets.&quot; Tony Green of &quot;Spin&quot; said that although they are not as spiritual as Goodie Mob, Outkast&#x27;s &quot;streetcorner signifying&quot; offers listeners more than simple musical pleasure and that they &quot;have crafted some of the most seductive and dramadelic textures.&quot; Giving it a five out of five &quot;mic&quot;-rating, Charlie Braxton of &quot;The Source&quot; praised the duo for &quot;their superb use of the urban narrative.&quot; Braxton called &quot;Aquemini&quot; &quot;a brilliant record&quot; and commented that it &quot;possesses an uncanny blend of sonic beauty, poignant lyricism and spirituality that compels without commanding&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Tim Stelloh from &quot;PopMatters&quot; described the album as a &quot;loud, unpretentious, eclectic kick in the ass&quot;. He praised it for being &quot;full of both fear and curiosity, and those emotions were channeled through its production.&quot; Dave Hughes, writing in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, stated: &quot;Ten years on, &quot;Aquemini&quot; is the single strongest aspect of one of the art form&#x27;s deepest benches. Snappier and more experimental than the pair&#x27;s early work, and focused enough to feel comfortable in a sprawl, it&#x27;s the moment when OutKast came fully into itself.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Aquemini&quot; has been included in several publications&#x27; best album lists. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 500 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The staff explained the inclusion by stating: &quot;OutKast unleashed an explosive hip-hop that deployed live musicians, social commentary and a heavy dose of deep funk&quot;. The album was placed at number 11 on the list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Nineties&quot; by the same magazine. In 2020, they revised their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list and re-ranked the album at number 49, calling it &quot;the greatest record ever to come out of the Dirty South.&quot;

&quot;Paste&quot; called the album &quot;the best Atlanta hip-hop album of all time&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the record at number 50 on their &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot;, describing it as &quot;smooth and well-conceived&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; included it on three of their lists. They ranked it number 35 on the &quot;90 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; and number three on the &quot;Top 20 Albums of &#x27;98&quot;. The magazine also ranked it 76th on their 2010 list of &quot;The 125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Stylus&quot; ranked it 185th on their &quot;Top 101-200 Favourite Albums Ever&quot; list. In 2013, &quot;Vibe&quot; named it the 20th greatest album since 1993. &quot;Ego trip&quot; ranked it the second greatest hip hop album from 1980 to 1998, while &quot;Hip-Hop Connection&quot; ranked it the 11th greatest rap album from 1995 to 2005. &quot;New Nation&quot; named it the 80th best album by black artists. In 2017, &quot;The Boombox&quot; ranked it second on a list of the 50 greatest alternative hip hop albums. The album was also included on Apple Music&#x27;s 100 Best Albums list at number 41 in 2024.

The album was included in &quot;Blender&quot;″s &quot;500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die&quot; (2003), Continuum Books&#x27; &quot;33⅓: A Series of Books about Critically Acclaimed Albums&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot;″s &quot;The Ultimate Music Collection&quot; (2005). The lead single &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; was nominated in the category Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1999 Grammy Awards. The album&#x27;s twelfth track &quot;SpottieOttieDopaliscious&quot; was ranked at number 16 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s list of the top 200 tracks of the 1990s.

==Legacy==
Critics hailed the recording as OutKast&#x27;s most fully realized up to that time and one of the best of the 1990s. Steve Huey wrote: &quot;&quot;Aquemini&quot; fulfills all its ambitions, covering more than enough territory to qualify it as a virtuosic masterpiece, and a landmark hip-hop album of the late &#x27;90s&quot;. &quot;Ebony&quot; observed that &quot;Aquemini&quot; is &quot;perhaps OutKast&#x27;s best effort&quot; and &quot;a huge commercial and artistic success&quot;. Matt Wink concluded that OutKast with this album &quot;carved their place in the game and grabbed the world&#x27;s attention. No two people with a similar background could be more different and no two artists could have made this masterpiece.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; labeled the album &quot;OutKast&#x27;s third brilliant slice of hip-hop&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s reputation as hip-hop&#x27;s most avant-garde area code – the Long Island of the Nineties – was cemented&quot; with this effort, while Troy L. Smith of &quot;Cleveland.com&quot; said it was &quot;a true game-changer for [Southern hip hop] and Outkast&quot;. In a column for &quot;Jazz Times&quot;, Tony Green wrote that &quot;OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Aquemini&quot; dispels any notion that hip-hop is out of sonic ideas. If anything, it shows that the genre&#x27;s appetite for new sounds is as ravenous as ever.&quot; According to Emma Warren from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, this album is &quot;a high point of 90s hip-hop&quot; and proof that &quot;the old push and pull between the east and west coast of American hip-hop was over&quot;. Tim Stelloh of PopMatters felt that &quot;&quot;Aquemini&quot; far surpassed OutKast&#x27;s previous release &quot;A-tliens&quot; , and made the group one of those rare commercial anomalies—kind of like Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, or Public Enemy&quot;. Several reviewers of Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s &quot;Good Kid, M.A.A.D City&quot; (2012) perceived influence from &quot;Aquemini&quot; in the record&#x27;s production and aesthetic.

<text>James Harrison Coburn III (August 31, 1928 – November 18, 2002) was an American film and television actor who was featured in more than 70 films, largely action roles, and made 100 television appearances during a 45-year career.

Coburn was a perfect tough guy in numerous leading roles in Westerns and action films. He played supporting roles in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Hell Is for Heroes&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;Charade&quot; and &quot;Hard Times&quot; as well as the lead role in &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; and its sequel &quot;In Like Flint&quot;, &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot;, &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;, &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, and &quot;Cross of Iron&quot;. In 1998, Coburn won an Academy Award for his supporting role as Glen Whitehouse in &quot;Affliction&quot;. In 2002, he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries nomination for producing &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;.

During the New Hollywood era, he cultivated an image synonymous with &quot;cool&quot;.

==Early life==
James Harrison Coburn III was born in Laurel, Nebraska, on August 31, 1928, the son of James Harrison Coburn II and Mylet S. Coburn (&quot;née&quot; Johnson). His father and namesake was of Scots-Irish ancestry and his mother was an immigrant from Sweden. His father had a garage business in Laurel that was destroyed by the Great Depression. Coburn was raised in Compton, California, where he attended Compton Junior College.

In 1950, Coburn was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served as a truck driver and occasionally a disc jockey on an Army radio station in Texas. He also narrated Army training films in Mainz, West Germany. 

He attended Los Angeles City College, where he studied acting with fellow actor Jeff Corey under Stella Adler’s tutelage, and later made his stage debut at the La Jolla Playhouse in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot;.

==Career==
===Early television work===
Coburn&#x27;s first television appearance was in 1953 on &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;.

He was selected for a Remington Products razor commercial, where he was able to shave off 11 days of beard growth in less than 60 seconds while joking that he had more teeth to show on camera than the other 12 candidates for the part.

Coburn&#x27;s film debut came in 1959 as the sidekick of Pernell Roberts in the Randolph Scott Western &quot;Ride Lonesome&quot;. He soon got a job in another Western, &quot;Face of a Fugitive&quot; (1959). &quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;he made a terrific cowboy and was thus easily castable in the scores of Westerns being made for American TV at the time; indeed, Coburn guest starred in pretty much all of them.&quot; These included several episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bonanza&quot; and appearing twice each on three other NBC Westerns: &quot;Laramie&quot; with Robert Fuller,&quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; with Dale Robertson, one episode in the role of Butch Cassidy; and &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; with John Payne in &quot;The Pawn&quot; and &quot;The Way Back&quot;, the latter segment alongside &quot;Bonanza&quot;&#x27;s Dan Blocker. &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; aired in 1958. He played a rustler in The Rifleman - Season 1, Episode 13 - The Young Englishman.

Coburn&#x27;s third film was a major breakthrough for him, as the knife-wielding Britt in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), directed by John Sturges for the Mirisch Company. Coburn was hired on the recommendation of his friend Robert Vaughn. During the 1960–61 season, Coburn co-starred with Ralph Taeger and Joi Lansing in the NBC adventure/drama series &quot;Klondike&quot;, set in the Alaskan gold rush town of Skagway. When &quot;Klondike&quot; was cancelled, Taeger and Coburn were regrouped as detectives in Mexico in NBC&#x27;s equally short-lived &quot;Acapulco&quot;.

Coburn also made two guest appearances on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, both times as the murder victim, in &quot;The Case of the Envious Editor&quot; and &quot;The Case of the Angry Astronaut&quot;. In 1962, he portrayed Col. Briscoe in the &quot;Hostage Child&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Rawhide&quot;.
===Supporting actor in films===

Coburn had a good role in &quot;Hell Is for Heroes&quot; (1962), a war film with Steve McQueen. He followed it with another war film with McQueen, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), directed by Sturges for the Mirisches, where Coburn played an Australian POW. For the Mirisches, Coburn narrated &quot;Kings of the Sun&quot; (1963).

Coburn was one of the villains in &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. He followed that role playing a glib naval officer in Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot;, replacing James Garner, who had moved up to the lead role when William Holden withdrew from the production. As a result, Coburn was signed to a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. 

Coburn had another excellent supporting role as a one-armed Indian tracker in &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Charlton Heston.

At Fox, he was second-billed in the pirate film &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; (1965), supporting Anthony Quinn in the lead role. He had a cameo in the black comedy &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965).

===Stardom===
In December 1964 it was announced Coburn would star in Fox&#x27;s James Bond parody film &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; (1966), playing super agent Derek Flint. Producer Saul David commented, Coburn &quot;is undoubtedly one of the most interesting looking actors in the business today. I would describe him as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Jean Paul Belmondo - a true descendant of that bygone generation of character actors who became leading men by accident... Coburn has a fantastic effect on women filmgoers and I think it&#x27;s because ladies go more for masculinity and charm than prettiness in a male star.&quot;&quot; The movie was a big success at the box office on its release in 1966 and established Coburn as a star.

Coburn followed it with &quot;What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?&quot; (1966), a wartime comedy from Blake Edwards, which was made for the Mirisches; Coburn was top billed although the lead was Dick Shawn. It was a commercial disappointment. &quot;Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1966) was a crime movie made at Columbia.

Back at Fox, Coburn made a second Flint film, &quot;In Like Flint&quot; (1967), which was popular, but Coburn did not wish to make any more movies in that series. This has been called a &quot;mistake&quot; by Coburn as films in which he starred in where he did not play Flint were not as successful. He went over to Paramount for a Western comedy made through Edwards&#x27; company, &quot;Waterhole No. 3&quot; (1967) and the political satire &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot; (1967). Neither performed particularly well commercially, but over the years, &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot; has become a cult film. In 1967, Coburn was voted the 12th-biggest star in Hollywood.

Over at Columbia, Coburn was in a Swinging &#x27;60s heist film, &quot;Duffy&quot; (1968), which flopped. He was one of several stars who had cameos in &quot;Candy&quot; (1968), then played a hitman in &quot;Hard Contract&quot; (1969) for Fox, another flop.

Coburn tried a change of pace, an adaptation of a Tennessee Williams play, &quot;Last of the Mobile Hot Shots&quot; (1970) directed by Sidney Lumet, but the film was not popular.
In July 1970, Richard F Zanuck of Fox dropped the $300,000 option it had with Coburn.

In 1971, Coburn starred in the Zapata Western &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;, with Rod Steiger and directed by Sergio Leone, as an Irish explosives expert and revolutionary who has fled to Mexico during the time of the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century. In 1964, Coburn had said he would do &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; if they paid him $25,000, which was too expensive for the production&#x27;s tiny budget. &quot;Duck You Sucker&quot;, also called &quot;A Fistful of Dynamite&quot;, was not as highly regarded as Leone&#x27;s four previous Westerns, but was hugely popular in Europe, especially France.

Back in the US, Coburn made another film with Blake Edwards, the thriller &quot;The Carey Treatment&quot; (1972). It was badly cut by MGM and was commercially unsuccessful. So, too, was &quot;The Honkers&quot; (1972), where Coburn played a rodeo rider.

Coburn went back to Italy to make another Western, &quot;A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die&quot; (1973), or &quot;Massacre at Fort Holman&quot;. He then reteamed with director Sam Peckinpah for the 1973 film &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, playing Pat Garrett. In 1973, he was voted the 23rd-most popular star in Hollywood.

In 1973, Coburn was among the featured celebrities dressed in prison gear on the cover of the album &quot;Band on the Run&quot; made by Paul McCartney and his band Wings.

Coburn was one of the pallbearers at the funeral of Bruce Lee along with Steve McQueen, Bruce&#x27;s brother, Robert Lee, Peter Chin, Danny Inosanto, and Taky Kimura. Coburn gave a speech: &quot;Farewell, Brother. It has been an honor to share this space in time with you. As a friend and a teacher, you have given to me, have brought my physical, spiritual, and psychological selves together. Thank you. May peace be with you.&quot;

Coburn was one of several stars in the popular &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973). He then starred in a series of thrillers: &quot;Harry in Your Pocket&quot; (1974), the debut feature from &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; creator Bruce Geller, and &quot;The Internecine Project&quot; (1975). Neither was widely seen.

===Mid-career===
Coburn began to drop back down the credit list: he was third billed in writer-director Richard Brooks&#x27; film &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (1975) behind Gene Hackman and Candice Bergen. He co-starred with Charles Bronson in &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1975), the directorial debut of Walter Hill, but it was very much Bronson&#x27;s film. The movie was popular.

Coburn played the lead in the action film &quot;Sky Riders&quot; (1976), then played Charlton Heston&#x27;s antagonist in &quot;The Last Hard Men&quot; (1976). He narrated the official documentary film of the 1976 Innsbruck Winter Olympics, &quot;White Rock&quot;. He was one of the many stars in &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), then had the star role in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977) playing a German soldier. He finished directing the film because of Peckinpah&#x27;s constant drunkenness. This critically acclaimed war epic performed poorly in the United States, but was a huge hit in Europe. Peckinpah and Coburn remained close friends until Peckinpah&#x27;s death in 1984.

Coburn returned to television in 1978 to star in a three-part miniseries version of a Dashiell Hammett detective novel, &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;, tailoring his character to bear a physical resemblance to the author. During the previous year as a spokesman for the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, he was paid $500,000 to promote its new product in television advertisements by saying only two words: &quot;Schlitz Light.&quot; In Japan, his masculine appearance was so appealing, he became an icon for its leading cigarette brand. He also supported himself in later years by exporting rare automobiles to Japan. He was deeply interested in Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, and collected sacred Buddhist artwork. He narrated a film about the 16th Karmapa called &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot;.

Coburn starred in &quot;Firepower&quot; (1979) with Sophia Loren, replacing Charles Bronson when the latter pulled out. He had a cameo in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979) and had leading roles in &quot;Goldengirl&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Baltimore Bullet&quot; (1980). He was Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s husband in &quot;Loving Couples&quot; (1980) and had the lead in a Canadian film, &quot;Crossover&quot; (1980).

===Later years===
In 1981, Coburn moved almost entirely into supporting roles, such as those of the villains in both &quot;High Risk&quot; (1981) and &quot;Looker&quot; (1981). He hosted a TV series of the horror-anthology type, &quot;Darkroom,&quot; in 1981 and 1982. According to Mr. T, Coburn was slated to play the Hannibal character on the hit television series &quot;The A-Team&quot;, but NBC changed their mind and went with George Peppard. He supported Walter Mondale&#x27;s campaign in the 1984 presidential election. Coburn also portrayed Dwight Owen Barnes in the PC video game &quot;C.E.O.,&quot; developed by Artdink as a spin-off of its A-Train series.

Because of his severe rheumatoid arthritis, Coburn appeared in very few films during the 1980s, despite continuing to work during his final years. This disease had left Coburn&#x27;s body deformed and in pain. He told ABC News in a 1999 interview: &quot;You start to turn to stone. See, my hand is twisted now because tendons have shortened.&quot; For 20 years, Coburn tried a host of both conventional and unconventional treatments, but none of them worked. &quot;There was so much pain that...every time I stood up, I would break into a sweat,&quot; he recalled. Then, in 1996, Coburn tried methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), a sulfur compound available at most health food stores. The result, he said, was nothing short of miraculous. &quot;You take this stuff and it starts right away,&quot; said Coburn. &quot;Everyone I&#x27;ve given it to has had a positive response.&quot; Though the MSM did not cure Coburn&#x27;s arthritis, it did relieve his pain, allowing him to move more freely and resume his career.

Coburn was in a four-year relationship with British singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul from the late 1970s. They co-wrote her songs &quot;Losin&#x27; the Blues for You&quot; and &quot;Melancholy Melon&quot; that appeared on her album &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot;. Coburn resumed his film career in the 1990s, where he appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Eraser&quot;, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, &quot;Affliction&quot;, and &quot;Payback&quot;. His performance as Glen Whitehouse in &quot;Affliction&quot; earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. One of his final roles was in the Pixar animated film &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; as the voice of Henry J. Waternoose III.

==Cars==

Coburn&#x27;s interest in fast cars began with his father&#x27;s garage business and continued throughout his life, as he exported rare cars to Japan. Coburn was credited with having introduced Steve McQueen to Ferraris, and in the early 1960s, owned a Ferrari 250 GT Lusso and a Ferrari 250 GT Spyder California SWB. His Spyder was the 13th of just 56x built. Coburn imported the used car in 1964, shortly after completing &quot;The Great Escape.&quot;

Cal Spyder #2377 was repainted several times during Coburn&#x27;s ownership; it has been black, silver, and possibly red. He kept the car at his Beverly Hills-area home, where it was often serviced by Max Balchowsky, who also worked on the suspension and frame modifications on the Mustang GTs used in the filming of McQueen&#x27;s &quot;Bullitt&quot;. Coburn sold the Spyder in 1987 after 24 years of ownership. The car was restored, had several owners, and was sold in 2008 for $10,894,400 to English broadcaster Chris Evans. At that time, it set a new world record for the highest price ever paid for an automobile at auction.

Over time, he also owned a Ferrari Daytona, at least one Ferrari 308, and a 1967 Ferrari 412P sports racer. From 1998 until his death, Coburn did the voiceovers for Chevrolet&#x27;s Like a Rock commercials.

==Personal life==

Coburn was married twice. His first marriage was to Beverly Kelly, in 1959; they had two children together. The couple divorced in 1979 after 20 years of marriage.

He later married actress Paula Murad Coburn, on October 22, 1993, in Versailles, France; they remained married until Coburn&#x27;s death in 2002. The couple set up a charitable organization, the James and Paula Coburn Foundation.

In spite of his severe rheumatoid arthritis, Coburn was a martial arts student and a friend of fellow actor Bruce Lee. Upon Lee&#x27;s early death, Coburn was one of his pallbearers at the funeral on July 25, 1973.

==Death==
Coburn died from a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills on November 18, 2002, at the age of 74. His wife, Paula, said that he died in her arms when they were listening to music together. He was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Paula Coburn died from cancer less than two years later, on July 30, 2004, at the age of 48.

==Critical analysis==
In &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;, critic David Thomson states that &quot;Coburn is a modern rarity: an actor who projects lazy, humorous sexuality. He has made a variety of flawed, pleasurable films, the merits of which invariably depend on his laconic presence. Increasingly, he was the best thing in his movies, smiling privately, seeming to suggest that he was in contact with some profound source of amusement&quot;. Film critic Pauline Kael remarked on Coburn&#x27;s unusual characteristics, stating that &quot;he looked like the child of the liaison between Lt. Pinkerton and Madame Butterfly&quot;. George Hickenlooper, who directed Coburn in &quot;The Man from Elysian Fields&quot; called him &quot;the masculine male&quot;. Andy García called him &quot;the personification of class, the hippest of the hip&quot;, and Paul Schrader noted &quot;he was of that 50s generation. He had that part hipster, part cool-cat aura about him. He was one of those kind of men who were formed by the Rat Pack kind of style.&quot;

<text>Danielle Christine Fishel ( ; born May 5, 1981) is an American actress and director. She began her career in theater, appearing in community productions of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. She made her debut as an actress shortly after, making guest appearances in shows such as &quot;Full House&quot; and &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;. In 1993, Fishel was cast as Topanga Lawrence on the teen sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, which ran on ABC from 1993 to 2000, and reprised the role for its successor &quot;Girl Meets World&quot; on Disney Channel, which aired from 2014 to 2017.

During &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;, Fishel also began to transition to directing, and she has gone on to direct episodes for other series, including &quot;Raven&#x27;s Home&quot;, &quot;Coop &amp; Cami Ask the World&quot;, &quot;Sydney to the Max&quot;, &quot;Just Roll with It&quot;, &quot;The Villains of Valley View&quot;, &quot;Pretty Freekin Scary&quot;, and &quot;Lopez vs Lopez&quot;.

Fishel was the host of Style Network&#x27;s &quot;The Dish,&quot; and appears in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Dorm Daze,&quot; as well as its sequel. She was a spokeswoman for Nutrisystem, and is also a resident reporter on &quot;PopSugar&quot;, and on their spin-off YouTube channel, PopSugar Girls Guide.

==Early life==
Fishel was born in Mesa, Arizona, the daughter of Jennifer, a personal manager, and Rick Fishel, former president of Masimo Corporation. She is of partial Maltese descent. She graduated from Calabasas High School in Calabasas, California in 1999.

==Career==

=== 1991–1998: Career beginnings and debut ===

In 1991, at the age of 10, Fishel was discovered in a community theater where she performed in two productions, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. She quickly moved on to do voice-overs and commercials, including several as a Barbie Girl for Mattel. Soon after, she appeared on two episodes of the hit show &quot;Full House&quot;, guest starring as a character named Jennifer. She also had a small role on &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;, playing Jessica. Fishel&#x27;s mother became her full-time manager.

In 1993, at the age of 12, she began her role as Topanga Lawrence-Matthews on the ABC series &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. Originally written as a small part, Topanga became a recurring role. After a successful first year, Fishel became a show regular. Her character was a sparky, intelligent girl who was mature beyond her years; she replaced the nerdy Stuart Minkus as the brains of the class. The show ended in 2000 after seven years.

Fishel was on the cover of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine in December 1998. She won an award, the 1998 Young Star for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series. In June 1999, she was one of &quot;The 21 Hottest Stars Under 21&quot; in &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine. She was on the cover of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine&#x27;s hottest stars to watch in the October 1997 issue. She appeared in the music video for &quot;Until You Loved Me&quot; by Canadian music group The Moffatts.

=== 2003–2011: Films and television presenting ===

Following &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, she began to work heavily in television, and in 2003 co-hosted &quot;Say What? Karaoke&quot; on MTV for one season. She also appeared in several films, including &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Dorm Daze&quot;. In 2006, she appeared in three made-for-DVD releases: &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Dorm Daze 2&quot; (appearing again as &quot;Marla&quot; from the first film), the action film &quot;Gamebox 1.0&quot; (playing a dual role), and &quot;The Chosen One&quot;, an independent animated film in which she provides the voice of the lead female character.

In 2006, she appeared as a guest on &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; where she discussed her dramatic weight loss with the use of the Nutrisystems Diet. Following her appearance, she became a spokeswoman for Nutrisystem. She also became a special correspondent for &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot;, starting in early February 2007. By 2010, she had gained some of the weight back, and told &quot;People&quot; magazine she could not maintain her Nutrisystem weight.

From August 2008 to March 2011, Fishel hosted &quot;The Dish&quot; for the Style Network, which satirized pop culture in a format similar to sister network E!&#x27;s &quot;The Soup&quot;. She was also on Fuse TV as host of &quot;The Fuse 20&quot;, and was a guest star on the round table on an episode of &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;. In 2012, she became the host of MSN TV&#x27;s &quot;Last Night on TV&quot;.

=== 2013–present: Current work ===

In 2013, she starred in the drama &quot;Boiling Pot&quot; (released in 2015), which is based on true events of racism that occurred on college campuses across the country during the 2008 United States presidential election. The film also stars Louis Gossett Jr., Keith David, M. Emmet Walsh, and John Heard. Fishel plays an average college girl, naive regarding racism and unaware of its existence. In October 2013, she was featured in &quot;Clapping for the Wrong Reasons&quot;, a short film to promote Childish Gambino&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Because the Internet&quot;.

In 2014, she reprised her role of Topanga Lawrence-Matthews in the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;. The series premiered on Disney Channel on June 27, 2014, and features Topanga and her &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; love interest Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) married in their adult years with two children. The series follows Cory and Topanga&#x27;s daughter Riley (Rowan Blanchard) and her friend, Maya (Sabrina Carpenter) as she enters middle school and tries to navigate through life. The series ended on January 20, 2017, with Topanga declining a job offer that would have moved the family from New York to London.

In an episode that aired January 9, 2018, she competed against actor Jonathan Lipnicki on TBS&#x27;s &quot;Drop the Mic&quot;.

She has hosted the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; rewatch podcast &quot;Pod Meets World&quot; with Rider Strong and Will Friedle since 2022.

==Personal life==
At age 27, Fishel began attending California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), graduating in 2013. During her university studies, she became a math tutor, leading her to meet fellow student Tim Belusko. After over three years&#x27; dating, she became engaged to Belusko in May 2012. They married in Los Angeles on October 19, 2013, and Ben Savage and &quot;Home Improvement&quot; cast member Jonathan Taylor Thomas were said to be in attendance. In May 2016, it was reported that she had filed for divorce the previous year; this was final in March 2016.

On July 4, 2017, toward the end of episode #303 of his podcast &quot;Get Up On This&quot;, Jensen Karp announced that he was dating Fishel. On March 22, 2018, the couple were engaged and married on November 4. Their first son was born on June 24, 2019, arriving a month early. He spent three weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit. Fishel said that fluid was found in his lungs that had not been present prior to that. Fishel and Karp had a second son on August 29, 2021. 

On August 19, 2024, Fishel announced on her podcast, &quot;Pod Meets World&quot;, that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

<doc id="148911" wikidata="Q257272" url="?curid=148911" title="Separated sets">
<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, separated sets are pairs of subsets of a given topological space that are related to each other in a certain way: roughly speaking, neither overlapping nor touching. The notion of when two sets are separated or not is important both to the notion of connected spaces (and their connected components) as well as to the separation axioms for topological spaces.

Separated sets should not be confused with separated spaces (defined below), which are somewhat related but different. Separable spaces are again a completely different topological concept.

==Definitions==

There are various ways in which two subsets formula_1 and formula_2 of a topological space formula_3 can be considered to be separated. A most basic way in which two sets can be separated is if they are disjoint, that is, if their intersection is the empty set. This property has nothing to do with topology as such, but only set theory. Each of the following properties is stricter than disjointness, incorporating some topological information.

The properties below are presented in increasing order of specificity, each being a stronger notion than the preceding one.

The sets formula_1 and formula_2 are in formula_3 if each is disjoint from the other&#x27;s closure:

formula_7

This property is known as the . Since every set is contained in its closure, two separated sets automatically must be disjoint. The closures themselves do &quot;not&quot; have to be disjoint from each other; for example, the intervals formula_8 and formula_9 are separated in the real line formula_10 even though the point 1 belongs to both of their closures. A more general example is that in any metric space, two open balls formula_11 and formula_12 are separated whenever formula_13 The property of being separated can also be expressed in terms of derived set (indicated by the prime symbol): formula_1 and formula_2 are separated when they are disjoint and each is disjoint from the other&#x27;s derived set, that is, formula_16 (As in the case of the first version of the definition, the derived sets formula_17 and formula_18 are not required to be disjoint from each other.)

The sets formula_1 and formula_2 are if there are neighbourhoods formula_21 of formula_1 and formula_23 of formula_2 such that formula_21 and formula_23 are disjoint. (Sometimes you will see the requirement that formula_21 and formula_23 be &quot;open&quot; neighbourhoods, but this makes no difference in the end.) For the example of formula_29 and formula_30 you could take formula_31 and formula_32 Note that if any two sets are separated by neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated. If formula_1 and formula_2 are open and disjoint, then they must be separated by neighbourhoods; just take formula_35 and formula_36 For this reason, separatedness is often used with closed sets (as in the normal separation axiom).

The sets formula_1 and formula_2 are if there is a closed neighbourhood formula_21 of formula_1 and a closed neighbourhood formula_23 of formula_2 such that formula_21 and formula_23 are disjoint. Our examples, formula_8 and formula_46 are separated by closed neighbourhoods. You could make either formula_21 or formula_23 closed by including the point 1 in it, but you cannot make them both closed while keeping them disjoint. Note that if any two sets are separated by closed neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated by neighbourhoods.

The sets formula_1 and formula_2 are if there exists a continuous function formula_51 from the space formula_3 to the real line formula_53 such that formula_54 and formula_55, that is, members of formula_1 map to 0 and members of formula_2 map to 1. (Sometimes the unit interval formula_58 is used in place of formula_53 in this definition, but this makes no difference.) In our example, formula_8 and formula_9 are not separated by a function, because there is no way to continuously define formula_62 at the point 1. If two sets are separated by a continuous function, then they are also separated by closed neighbourhoods; the neighbourhoods can be given in terms of the preimage of formula_62 as formula_64 and formula_65 where formula_66 is any positive real number less than formula_67

The sets formula_1 and formula_2 are if there exists a continuous function formula_51 such that formula_71 and formula_72 (Again, you may also see the unit interval in place of formula_10 and again it makes no difference.) Note that if any two sets are precisely separated by a function, then they are separated by a function. Since formula_74 and formula_75 are closed in formula_10 only closed sets are capable of being precisely separated by a function, but just because two sets are closed and separated by a function does not mean that they are automatically precisely separated by a function (even a different function).

==Relation to separation axioms and separated spaces==
The &quot;separation axioms&quot; are various conditions that are sometimes imposed upon topological spaces, many of which can be described in terms of the various types of separated sets. As an example we will define the T2 axiom, which is the condition imposed on separated spaces. Specifically, a topological space is &quot;separated&quot; if, given any two distinct points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, the singleton sets {&quot;x&quot;} and {&quot;y&quot;} are separated by neighbourhoods.

Separated spaces are usually called &quot;Hausdorff spaces&quot; or &quot;T2 spaces&quot;.

==Relation to connected spaces==
Given a topological space &quot;X&quot;, it is sometimes useful to consider whether it is possible for a subset &quot;A&quot; to be separated from its complement. This is certainly true if &quot;A&quot; is either the empty set or the entire space &quot;X&quot;, but there may be other possibilities. A topological space &quot;X&quot; is &quot;connected&quot; if these are the only two possibilities. Conversely, if a nonempty subset &quot;A&quot; is separated from its own complement, and if the only subset of &quot;A&quot; to share this property is the empty set, then &quot;A&quot; is an &quot;open-connected component&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. (In the degenerate case where &quot;X&quot; is itself the empty set formula_77, authorities differ on whether formula_77 is connected and whether formula_77 is an open-connected component of itself.)

==Relation to topologically distinguishable points==
Given a topological space &quot;X&quot;, two points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are &quot;topologically distinguishable&quot; if there exists an open set that one point belongs to but the other point does not. If &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are topologically distinguishable, then the singleton sets {&quot;x&quot;} and {&quot;y&quot;} must be disjoint. On the other hand, if the singletons {&quot;x&quot;} and {&quot;y&quot;} are separated, then the points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; must be topologically distinguishable. Thus for singletons, topological distinguishability is a condition in between disjointness and separatedness.

<text>Strawberry Fields is a 2.5-acre (1.0 ha) landscaped section in New York City&#x27;s Central Park, designed by the landscape architect Bruce Kelly, that is dedicated to the memory of former Beatles member John Lennon. It is named after the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, written by Lennon. The song itself is named for the former Strawberry Field children&#x27;s home in Liverpool, England, located near Lennon&#x27;s childhood home.

==Description==

The entrance to the memorial is located on Central Park West at West 72nd Street, near where John Lennon was murdered outside The Dakota, the apartment building in which he lived. The memorial is a triangular piece of land falling away on the two sides of the park, and its focal point is a circular pathway mosaic of inlaid stones, with a single word, the title of Lennon&#x27;s most famous song &quot;Imagine&quot;. The mosaic, in the style of Portuguese pavement, is based on a Greco-Roman design. It was created by Italian craftsmen and was donated as a gift by the Italian city of Naples.

A &quot;floral border&quot; surrounds Strawberry Fields. Along the borders of the area surrounding the mosaic are benches which are endowed in memory of other individuals and maintained by the Central Park Conservancy. Along a path toward the southeast, a plaque on a low glaciated outcropping of schist lists the nations which contributed to building the memorial. Lennon&#x27;s widow Yoko Ono, who still lives in The Dakota, contributed over a million dollars for the landscaping and the upkeep endowment.

The mosaics at the heart of a series of open and secret glades of lawn and glacier-carved rock outcroppings, bounded by shrubs and mature trees and woodland slopes, all designated a &quot;quiet zone&quot;. A woodland walk winds through edge plantings between the glade-like upper lawn and the steep wooded slopes; it contains native rhododendrons and hollies, Carolina allspice (&quot;Calycanthus floridus&quot;), mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), viburnums, and jetbead. Wild shrub roses and a mature pink &quot;Magnolia × soulangeana&quot; flank the main walk. At the farthest northern tip of the upper series of lawns enclosed by woodland are three dawn redwood trees, which lose their needles but regain them every spring, an emblem of eternal renewal. The trees can be expected to reach a height of within 100 years, and eventually they will be visible from great distances in the park.

==History==

=== Creation ===
In April 1981, a patch of land in Central Park, near the Dakota Apartments where Lennon lived with Ono, was officially named &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; in his memory. That August, it was announced that Strawberry Fields would be completely renovated and landscaped, since at the time, Strawberry Fields was located in an isolated median between West Drive and two slip roads of 72nd Street. Yoko Ono requested that the rebuilt memorial be a &quot;living memorial&quot; rather than a statue; according to NYC Parks landscape architect Arne Abramowitz, Ono believed that &quot;there are enough statues in Central Park&quot;.

The memorial was designed by Bruce Kelly, the chief landscape architect for the Central Park Conservancy. Construction on the project started in April 1984. Strawberry Fields was dedicated on what would have been Lennon&#x27;s 45th birthday, October 9, 1985, by Ono and mayor Ed Koch. Speaking on behalf of the United Nations at the dedication was Marcela Pérez de Cuéllar, the UN first lady.

The &quot;Imagine&quot; mosaic was not placed on sufficient foundation and began to noticeably sink in 2007.

===Usage===
The memorial is often covered with flowers, candles in glasses, and other belongings left behind by Lennon&#x27;s fans. On Lennon&#x27;s birthday (October 9) and on the anniversary of his death (December 8), people gather to sing songs and pay tribute, staying late into what is often a cold night. The tributes usually run all night, but for a period through the late 1990s and early 2000s, mayor Rudy Giuliani enforced a curfew, which prohibited people from being inside Central Park after it closed each day at 1:00 a.m. Gatherings also take place on the birthdays of other Beatles. Impromptu memorial gatherings for other musicians, including Jerry Garcia and George Harrison, have occurred at the memorial. In the days following the September 11 attacks, candlelight vigils were held at the Imagine Circle to remember those killed.

On weekends, musicians often play for the enjoyment of thousands of fans from around the world who visit the site. These musicians formerly conflicted frequently with each other, but since at least 2016, had adhered to an informal code of conduct.

&quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;, an opera by Michael Torke to a libretto by A. R. Gurney, takes place at the memorial. Act II of a trilogy entitled &quot;Central Park&quot; jointly commissioned by Glimmerglass Opera, New York City Opera, and Great Performances, it was premiered by the Glimmerglass Festival on July 24, 1999, and was later produced by New York City Opera.

==&quot;Mayor of Strawberry Fields&quot;==

One of its best-known visitors was Gary dos Santos, a devoted Beatles fan who decorated the memorial in circles of different flowers and objects, often in the shape of a peace symbol. Born Ayrton &quot;Gary&quot; Ferreira dos Santos Jr., he was a performance artist who for 19 years installed flower designs around and within the &quot;Imagine&quot; mosaic here. His work has been documented in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Dos Santos&#x27; income came from the tips he received from tourists as a result of his work, and the three-minute monologue he delivered to tourists describing his work and the life of John Lennon and his family. Santos was the subject of a documentary film, &quot;The Mayor of Strawberry Fields&quot;, directed by Torre Catalano and distributed by Nehst Studios.

For almost 20 years, he daily attended the memorial with his girlfriend of 15 years, Lisa Page, and their dog, Mary Jane, and was well known by many long-time local residents. In September 2013 Santos was diagnosed with leukemia. After spending about nine weeks in the hospital, he died in November 2013.

<text>The Dakota, also known as the Dakota Apartments, is a cooperative apartment building at 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, United States. The Dakota was constructed between 1880 and 1884 in the German Renaissance style and was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh for businessman Edward Cabot Clark. The building was one of the first large developments on the Upper West Side and is the oldest remaining luxury apartment building in New York City. The building is a National Historic Landmark and has been designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The building is also a contributing property to the Central Park West Historic District.

The Dakota occupies the western side of Central Park West between 72nd and 73rd streets. It is largely square in plan and built around a central H-shaped courtyard, through which all apartments are accessed. Formerly, there was a garden to the west of the Dakota, underneath which was a mechanical plant serving the Dakota and some adjacent row houses. The facade is largely composed of brick with sandstone trim and terracotta detailing. The main entrance is a double-height archway on 72nd Street, which leads to the courtyard. The building&#x27;s design includes deep roofs with dormers, terracotta spandrels and panels, niches, balconies, and balustrades. Each apartment at the Dakota had a unique layout with four to twenty rooms. The building is divided into quadrants, each of which has a stair and an elevator for tenants, as well as another stair and another elevator for servants.

After Clark announced plans for an apartment complex at the site in 1879, work began in late October 1880. The building was not given its name until mid-1882, and Clark died before the Dakota was completed in October 1884. The Dakota was fully rented upon its completion. The building was managed by the Clark family for eight decades and remained largely unchanged during that time. In 1961, the Dakota&#x27;s residents bought the building from the Clark family and converted it into a housing cooperative. The Dakota has historically been home to many artists, actors, and musicians, including John Lennon, who was murdered outside the building on December 8, 1980. The building remained a cooperative into the 21st century.

== Site ==
The Dakota is at 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. The building occupies the western sidewalk of Central Park West (formerly Eighth Avenue) between 72nd Street to the south and 73rd Street to the north. The Dakota occupies a nearly square land lot with an area of . The land lot has frontages of along Central Park West and along 72nd and 73rd streets. Nearby locations include the Majestic apartment building immediately to the south, the Olcott Hotel to the west, the Langham apartment building to the north, and Central Park (including the Strawberry Fields memorial) to the east.

The Dakota&#x27;s developer Edward Cabot Clark, who headed sewing machine firm Singer Manufacturing Company, selected the building&#x27;s site based on several characteristics. The building is on the crest of the West Side plateau, which overlooks much of Manhattan. Additionally, 72nd Street is wide, making it one of several major crosstown streets in the Manhattan street grid. Clark also developed 27 row houses on 72nd and 73rd streets, adjacent to the Dakota, which are no longer extant. The two developments were part of Clark&#x27;s larger plan for a cohesive neighborhood; the row houses were in the middle of the block, where land values were lower, whereas the Dakota was built on the more valuable site next to Central Park. Clark developed another set of row houses at 13–65 and 103–151 West 73rd Street, some of which still exist. All of these houses were designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh.

The Dakota is one of several apartment buildings on Central Park West that are primarily identified by an official name. Even though a street address was sufficient to identify these apartment buildings, this trend followed a British practice of giving names to buildings without addresses. By contrast, buildings on Fifth Avenue, along the eastern side of Central Park, are mainly known by their addresses. Unlike other large apartment buildings on Central Park West, the Dakota was not named after a previous building on the site. Christopher Gray of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Dakota as one of several apartment buildings that were famous enough &quot;to maintain their names simply in common custom&quot;.

==Architecture==
The Dakota was designed by Hardenbergh for Clark and built between 1880 and 1884. The construction process involved several contractors including stonemason John L. Banta, plumber T. Brieu, iron supplier Post &amp; McCord, carpenter J. L. Hamilton, stonework supplier J. Gillis Se Son and Henry Wilson, and woodwork contractor Pottier &amp; Stymus. 

There is disagreement over the building&#x27;s architectural style. CNBC and writers Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl W. Condit described the building as being built in a German Renaissance Revival style, but a contemporary source described the building&#x27;s design as being patterned after &quot;the period of Francis I&quot;. The writer Elizabeth Hawes said in 1993 that the building had been characterized as &quot;Brewery Brick Victorian neo-Gothic Eclectic&quot;. The building&#x27;s design includes deep roofs with dormers, terracotta spandrels and panels, niches, balconies, and balustrades. The designs of the dormers, roofs, and windows were influenced by the Northern Renaissance style.

The Dakota is a nine-story building; most of the building is seven stories high, although there are also two-story gables. Some contemporary sources described the building as being ten stories high, including the raised basement, while others classify the Dakota as being eight stories high. The Dakota measures tall and was the tallest building in the neighborhood when it was constructed. Due to the apartments&#x27; high ceilings, the Dakota&#x27;s height was equivalent to that of a standard 15-story building.

===Courtyards===

==== Main courtyard ====

The building is largely square in plan and built around a central H-shaped courtyard. The space measures long and up to wide. The courtyard provides entry to all apartments and doubles as a light court for the interiors of each apartment. A writer for the &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot; described the Dakota&#x27;s courtyard and similar spaces in other buildings as &quot;a safe, pleasant and sheltered place, under the eye of the Janitor, where tenants can enter, but thieves cannot...&quot;. The writer also suggested that children could play within the courtyard, but other, unidentified observers believed such a usage attracted unsolicited attention. The apartments are accessed by four passageways, one from each corner of the courtyard. The main courtyard also functioned as a meeting area for residents, since the rest of the building was designed with &quot;the utmost in personal privacy&quot; as a consideration. Over the years, the courtyard has hosted events such as parties and Christmas carols.

A glass breezeway ran along the western portion of the courtyard. This breezeway had been installed during the 1920s to protect residents from inclement weather. When the courtyard was rebuilt in 2004, the sidewalk under the breezeway was reconstructed with bluestone pavers that measure up to long and thick. The Dakota&#x27;s courtyard originally contained two fountains, which doubled as skylights for the basement. Horse-drawn carriages, entering from 72nd Street, used the courtyard to turn around. After automobiles supplanted horse-drawn carriages, the Dakota banned automobiles from the courtyard because the space could not support the weight of modern vehicles. The deck of the courtyard was entirely replaced in 2004 because the steel beams that supported it had corroded severely. The modern courtyard is a reinforced-concrete slab, which is covered by granite pavers.

A service driveway also runs along the western side of the main courtyard. The driveway descends to the basement, where there is a lower courtyard with the same dimensions as the ground-level courtyard. This driveway was originally used to deliver goods and &quot;commodities of housekeeping&quot;, as well as remove garbage and ashes. All servants entered and exited the Dakota through this driveway. The Dakota&#x27;s distinct upper and lower courtyards differed from that of Hardenbergh and Clark&#x27;s earlier Van Corlear apartment house at Seventh Avenue and 55th Street, where residents and servants used the same courtyard.

==== Other spaces ====
To the west of the Dakota was another garden; both the Dakota and the adjacent row houses were served by a mechanical plant below the garden. The placement of the mechanical plant outside the building was a deliberate measure to reassure residents in case the machinery exploded. There were also tennis and croquet courts within the garden. Images show that the garden was surrounded by a fence, and the area above the mechanical plant was further enclosed by a hedge. The garden had become a parking lot by the 1950s, and the Mayfair apartment building was developed on the garden&#x27;s site in 1964.

The building is surrounded by a recessed areaway, also described as a dry moat. The areaway was intended to increase residents&#x27; safety, as well as allow natural light and air to enter the basement. An entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 72nd Street station, served by the , is built within this areaway. A cast-iron fence separates the areaway from the sidewalk. The sidewalk was originally made of bluestone slabs.

=== Facade ===

Each elevation of the facade is divided vertically into bays. There are 11 bays on 72nd Street to the south and Central Park West to the east; 13 bays on 73rd Street to the north; and 17 bays to the west. The Dakota&#x27;s raised basement is clad with sandstone. The remainder of the facade is made of buff brick, except on the west elevation, which is made of red brick; all of the brick is laid in common bond. The Dakota&#x27;s use of soft-hued buff brick contrasted with the facade of the Van Corlear, which was a &quot;harsh red&quot;. The facade also contains Nova Scotia sandstone trim and terracotta detailing. The materials and colors were selected to not only complement each other but also to soften the appearance of the building&#x27;s shadows and massing. The large amount of ornament created the impression of variety between different parts of the facade. The west elevation, facing the former yard, was sparsely ornamented. The exterior walls function as load-bearing walls, which measure up to thick. The exterior walls taper from on upper stories.

==== Entrances ====

The building&#x27;s main entrance is a double-height archway on 72nd Street to the south. It measures wide and tall. The archway is flanked by pedestals with metal urns, and there is a Diocletian window in the upper portion of the archway. There is also a security guard&#x27;s booth to the west of the main entrance. After midnight, residents and visitors are required to ring the security guard to enter the building. Portraits of a man and woman (probably Edward C. Clark&#x27;s partner Isaac Merritt Singer and Isaac&#x27;s wife Isabella Boyer Singer) are placed above the doorway.

The 72nd Street entrance is a &quot;porte-cochère&quot; large enough for horse-drawn carriages to drop off passengers. Many of the horse-drawn carriages were dispatched from the now-demolished Dakota Stables at 75th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, developed by Edward C. Clark&#x27;s son Alfred Corning Clark. Inside the archway is a groin-vaulted vestibule that leads to the courtyard. There are metal gates on either end of the vestibule. &quot;Architectural Record&quot; likened the 72nd Street entrance to a &quot;fortress entry&quot;.

A &quot;handsome doorway&quot;, measuring tall, also led from 73rd Street to the courtyard. The northern entrance on 73rd Street was seldom used except for funerals.

==== Upper stories ====
The 72nd Street elevation contains projecting turrets, which rise the entire height of the facade. A depiction of a Native American&#x27;s head is carved on the facade. Above the second story is a horizontal band course made of terracotta. The band course is decorated with a diaper pattern. Above the sixth story is a stone cornice, which separates the seventh story and the roof from the rest of the facade. The cornice is supported by large brackets and is topped by an ornate metal balustrade. 

The building is topped by gables at each of its corners. The 72nd Street elevation also has a gable above the central entrance. On Central Park West, the central section of the roof is a hip roof. Originally, arched balconies connected the gables. The roof is covered with slate tiles. Dormer windows and corbeled brick chimneys protrude from the roof at multiple locations. The dormer windows are arranged in two to four levels and alternately contain either stone or copper frames. There are also turrets, finials, and flagpoles along the roof.

===Structural features===

The Dakota was designed as a fireproof structure. According to construction plans, the foundation walls were made of bluestone blocks, extended deep, and measured thick. The perimeter walls tapered in thickness from at the first story to above the sixth story. The superstructure includes rolled steel beams on each floor, spaced every and measuring deep. Between these rolled beams were brick or terracotta arches. The floor surfaces consist of earthen subfloors above 9-inch-thick slabs of concrete. Partitions in the hallways are made of &quot;fireproof blocks&quot;, while partitions in other parts of the building are made of either &quot;fireproof blocks&quot; or brick. The thick walls, floor slabs, and partitions also provided noise insulation. The strength of the Dakota&#x27;s superstructure rivaled that of contemporary office buildings.

The mechanical plant to the west measured and contained electrical generators, steam boilers, and steam engines. The plant&#x27;s roof was constructed of brick arches and iron beams, and the garden was planted above it. The generators became obsolete in the 1890s after the neighborhood was connected to the city&#x27;s power grid, and the boilers and engines were relocated to the Dakota&#x27;s basement. The steam plant in the basement, as well as the building&#x27;s hydraulic elevators, were powered by water that was collected from the roof and from underneath each apartment&#x27;s radiators. The radiators in each apartment were placed under the window sills.

The basement had a coal bunker with a capacity of . From the beginning, the building was equipped with &quot;a complete system of electric communication&quot;, including electric bells that were used to request the elevators. The Dakota had telegraph wires leading to a florist&#x27;s shop, a fire station, a nearby stable, and the messenger&#x27;s and telegraph offices. There were 300 electric bells and 4,000 electric lights, all powered by the mechanical plant. The attic had six water tanks, each with a capacity of . The pumps could draw up to of water per day, and over of pipes delivered water to each apartment.

=== Interior ===

==== Hallways, elevators, and stairs ====
The passageways from the courtyard lead to ground-level spaces with wooden paneling and marble wainscoting. Between the first and second stories, the walls of the staircases are wainscoted with marble. The hallways on the upper stories are wainscoted in wood, while the ceilings and walls are made of plaster. Because the Dakota was one of the city&#x27;s earliest luxury apartment buildings, the floor plans resembled those of traditional row houses. Consequently, the hallways were generally long and narrow at the Dakota, compared with later developments such as 998 Fifth Avenue. In any case, because the Dakota had four entrances with their own elevators and stairs, there were very few public hallways on the upper stories. This gave residents a feeling of privacy, since tenants were largely separated both from each other and from servants.

The interior has eight elevators, four each for residents and servants. At each corner of the courtyard, four wrought-bronze staircases and four residents&#x27; elevators lead from the entrances to the upper stories. Each corner of the building has a brick shaft with one elevator and one staircase; this roughly divides the Dakota into quadrants. The tenants&#x27; staircases contained marble treads. The elevator cabs were manufactured by Otis Elevators and were finished in mahogany. In the original plans, each elevator served two apartments per floor. Each elevator served a small foyer on each floor that provided access to the two apartments. These foyers were intended to be &quot;almost as private and convenient&quot; as entrances to typical brownstone row houses. In some cases, an elevator served only one apartment on a floor, so the elevator doors opened directly into that tenant&#x27;s foyer.

In place of dumbwaiters, the building contains four service elevators and four iron staircases for servants. The service elevators and staircases are placed near the center of each side of the courtyard. Each service stair and elevator served two apartments per floor. The service elevators, among the first in the city, lead to the kitchens of the apartments. All of the elevators were originally hydraulic cabs with water tanks at the bottom.

==== Apartments ====

===== Layouts =====
Each of the Dakota&#x27;s apartments had a unique layout and contained four to twenty rooms. The initial plans had called for six or eight apartments of about equal size on each of the seven lowest floors. The largest apartments were on the lower floors, as elevators were still a relatively new technology, and Hardenbergh thought a lower-floor apartment would be more attractive to people who had moved from townhouses. As the building was being constructed, Clark changed the specifications to accommodate individual tenants, resulting in substantial changes to the formerly standardized floor layouts. &quot;Look&quot; magazine characterized the differing apartment layouts as a legacy of the &quot;rugged individualism&quot; that had been common when the Dakota opened. The Dakota&#x27;s construction drawings are no longer extant, so the original arrangement of the apartments is known only from written descriptions. Many floor plans for individual apartments have been published over the years, and the Dakota&#x27;s modern floor plans have been reconstructed based on these documents. Many of the original apartments have been subdivided, though the Dakota&#x27;s co-op board has endorsed numerous renovations that restored an apartment&#x27;s original floor plans.

There were either nearly 500 rooms or 623 rooms in total. While most of the building contained fully-equipped apartments, with their own entrances and service elevators/stairs, part of the second floor was divided into smaller apartments and guest rooms. Apartments had a reception area, a drawing room, a library, a kitchen, a pantry, a bath, four bedrooms, one full bathroom, and butlers&#x27; and maids&#x27; quarters. Larger apartments had up to nine bedrooms, as well as additional spaces like a billiards room, boudoir, or library. Some of the apartments also have balconies, which blend in with the building&#x27;s overall design. Clark&#x27;s apartment on the sixth floor had 18 rooms, including a drawing room that rivaled the design of the ground-floor dining room, in addition to 17 fireplaces. In the book &quot;New York 1880&quot;, architect Robert A. M. Stern and his co-authors wrote that Clark&#x27;s apartment was intended to attract row house occupants by &quot;dramatiz[ing] the value of height&quot;. 

====== Materials and dimensions ======
Ceiling heights ranged from at the first story to at the eighth story. The largest drawing room in the building was long and contained a classical fluted column instead of a partition. Parlors were generally either or . Typical antechambers in the Dakota measured ; drawing rooms, ; bedrooms, ; and dining rooms, .

Each apartment contained fixtures and materials that were similar to those in contemporary brownstone row houses. The kitchens and bathrooms contained modern fixtures, though other decorations such as moldings, woodwork, and floor surfaces were similar to those in many row houses. The parqueted floors are inlaid with mahogany, oak, and cherry, which are laid on top of the earthen subfloors and concrete slabs. Each apartment&#x27;s dining rooms, reception rooms, and libraries were wainscoted in oak, mahogany, and other woods. The kitchens had marble wainscoting and Minton tile, while the bathrooms contained porcelain bathtubs. Other decorations included wood-burning fireplaces with tiled hearths; brass fixtures; and carved mirrors and mantels. Some apartments had plaster ceilings. Some of the Dakota&#x27;s interior decorations, such as carved marble fireplace mantels, were uncommon even in mansions of the time. The decorations, along with the apartments&#x27; layouts, were intended to give the apartments a &quot;palatial&quot; feel.

Residents customized their apartments to fit their needs and, in some cases, their occupations. A &quot;Look&quot; magazine article in the 1960s described interior designer and antique dealer Frederick P. Victoria as having decorated his apartment with wood &quot;draperies&quot; and antique clocks. Artist Giora Novak occupied a minimalist space within the building&#x27;s former dining room, which he decorated with his own artwork, while interior designer Ward Bennett repurposed a servant&#x27;s living area under the roof as a studio. Dancer Rudolf Nureyev placed classical paintings in his living room and theatrical artwork in other rooms. Some units have been substantially redesigned; for example, a four-bedroom unit was renovated in the modern style in the 2010s.

==== Other features ====
The Dakota&#x27;s basement contained a laundry, storerooms, a kitchen, and the mechanical plant. The main section of the basement is directly under the courtyard and has an asphaltum floor. On one side of the basement were heated and illuminated storerooms in which tenants could store items for free. There was also a wine cellar, which was empty by the 1960s. The quarters of the house staff were in the basement and included bedrooms; bathrooms and dining rooms for men and women; and a smoking room and reading room for men. Residents could also order food from the basement kitchen to be delivered to their rooms. After World War II, the kitchen was closed and became a studio apartment for Giora Novak.

The building had several common areas for residents, including a dining room and a ballroom. The first floor contained the building&#x27;s main dining room, as well as a smaller private dining room and a reception room. The floors were made of inlaid tiles of marble, while the walls had English oak wainscoting, above which were bronze bas-reliefs. The ceiling was also made of carved English oak. On one side of the dining room was a fireplace with a Scotch brownstone mantel, giving the room the quality of an &quot;old English baronial hall&quot;. The original plans had called for the dining area to be accessible to the general public, but the plans were modified before the building opened, and the dining room only served residents. The Dakota also had a ladies&#x27; reception room with an artwork. There was a florist, a messengers&#x27; office, and a telegraph office for residents.

The Dakota&#x27;s in-house staff included a house manager, doormen, chambermaids, janitors, hall servants, and repairmen. In addition to the Dakota&#x27;s in-house staff, each tenant could employ up to five of their own servants on site, though residents typically had up to three servants. Other staff, such as laundry workers, manicurists, and hairdressers, did not live in the building. Servants employed by the residents, as well as visiting servants, occupied the eighth and ninth floors. The upper-story servants&#x27; quarters contained dormitories, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and dryer rooms. The servants&#x27; quarters had been converted into apartments by the 1950s. Beside servants&#x27; quarters, there was a playroom and a gymnasium on the roof, which was labeled as the &quot;tenth story&quot;.

==History==
The construction of Central Park in the 1860s spurred construction on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, but similar development on the Upper West Side was slower to come. This was in part because of the West Side&#x27;s steep topography and its dearth of attractions compared with the East Side. In the late 19th century, hundreds of empty lots were available along the west side of Central Park. Major developments on the West Side were erected after the Ninth Avenue elevated line opened in 1879, providing direct access to Lower Manhattan. A group of businessmen formed the West Side Association the same year. Edward C. Clark believed that the line&#x27;s presence would encourage the growth of a middle-class neighborhood on the West Side. At a speech in December 1879, Clark told the West Side Association: &quot;There are but few persons who are princely enough to wish to occupy an entire palace...but I believe there are many who would like to occupy a portion of a great building.&quot; In the decade before the Dakota was built, the city&#x27;s population had increased by at least 100 percent, but the Upper West Side contained only a few assorted saloons, inns, and other buildings. 

The modern-day Dakota Apartments was one of the first large developments on the Upper West Side, built at a time when large apartment blocks were still associated with tenement living. The Dakota is also New York City&#x27;s oldest surviving luxury apartment building, although it was not the first such structure to be built in the city. Only a few large apartment houses in the city predated the Dakota, including the Manhattan Apartments (built in 1880) and Windermere Apartments (built in 1883). During the early 19th century, apartment developments in the city were generally associated with the working class, but by the late 19th century, apartments were also becoming desirable among the middle and upper classes. Between 1880 and 1885, more than ninety apartment buildings were developed in the city.

=== Development ===

In 1879, Clark announced plans for an apartment complex at the intersection of 72nd Street and Eighth Avenue (the latter of which was renamed Central Park West in 1883). At the time, the vast majority of development on Manhattan Island was south of 23rd Street. Clark said he wanted &quot;to make money&quot; from the apartment building, even though it was a speculative development that was not being built with specific tenants in mind. Hardenbergh filed plans for an eight-story &quot;Family Hotel&quot; at the site in September 1880, at which point it was planned to cost one million dollars. Hardenbergh simultaneously designed several dozen low-rise row houses for Clark on 73rd Street. The row houses and the large apartment building were part of a larger plan that Clark had for the Upper West Side. John Banta was hired as the apartment house&#x27;s general contractor. In early October 1880, about two weeks before construction began, the &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; reported that the building was to be a &quot;residential hotel&quot; with between 40 and 50 suites, each with five to twenty rooms.

Construction commenced at the end of October 1880. The building initially did not have a name, even after the foundations were completed in early 1881. By that October, the building had been constructed to the second story, although the &quot;Real Estate Record&quot; wrote that &quot;it is hardly to be expected that it will be under roof before the winter sets in&quot;. As part of the project, Clark also excavated an Artesian well measuring about deep and wide. Work was slightly delayed by a labor strike in March 1882. The exterior walls were up to the sixth story by that May, and the builders estimated that the edifice would be completed in 18 months.

The building was renamed the &quot;Dakota&quot; by June 1882. At the time, the development was still within a rural part of Manhattan. One story claims that the name arose because it was remote like the Dakota Territory was. Though the Clark family never denied this story, its veracity is disputed, as contemporary publications did not discuss the building&#x27;s remoteness. The earliest recorded appearance of this claim was in 1933, when the Dakota&#x27;s longtime manager told the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;: &quot;Probably it was called &#x27;Dakota&#x27; because it was so far west and so far north&quot;. The more likely origin for the &quot;Dakota&quot; name was Clark&#x27;s fondness for the names of the then-new western states and territories. Back in 1879, Clark had proposed naming the Upper West Side&#x27;s north-south avenues after states or territories in the Western United States, though his suggestions had been ignored. The Dakota&#x27;s remoteness did directly give rise to the nickname &quot;Clark&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

Clark died in 1882 and bequeathed the apartment complex to his oldest grandson, Edward Severin Clark, who at the time was 12 years old. After Edward C. Clark&#x27;s death, Hardenbergh never designed another building for the Clark family; their final collaboration, the Ontiora at Seventh Avenue and 55th Street, was similar in design to the Dakota. Work on the Dakota was delayed in August 1883 when the plasterers went on strike to protest the employment of non-union laborers at the site. Other tradesmen joined the strike but returned to work within a month. The mechanical equipment was being installed in the building by March 1884. The &quot;Real Estate Record&quot; said the next month: &quot;The &#x27;Dakota&#x27; is at last near completion and is receiving its finishing touches prior to its opening in May, when it will be quite ready for dwelling purposes.&quot; In September 1884, the &quot;Real Estate Record&quot; reported that the Dakota &quot;will be ready for occupancy October 1&quot; at a yearly rent of $1,500 to $5,000 (equivalent to between $ and $ in ) and that one-quarter of the units had already been rented. Elizabeth Hawes wrote that Clark promoted the Dakota as offering &quot;convenience, a short-cut route to opulent living with none of the problems of upkeep, and at a fraction of the expense that went with owning a private house&quot;.

=== Clark family ownership ===

==== 1880s and 1890s ====
The Dakota was completed by the week of October 24–27, 1884. The building was fully rented upon its completion, though detractors considered the building to be isolated and criticized the Dakota as an &quot;intrusion&quot; onto Central Park&#x27;s landscape. According to historical records, the Dakota&#x27;s earliest residents were active in a variety of industries. The residents included lawyers, brokers, merchants, and clothiers, although they also included a cigar merchant, a coal-mine operator, and a stenographer. All of the Dakota&#x27;s residents were wealthy, although not particularly famous. None of the early residents were included in the &quot;Four Hundred&quot;, a list of prominent individuals in New York society during the Gilded Age. This was because of its remoteness; in the days before telephones became popular, people tended to make in-person social visits. It often took an hour just to reach the Dakota from the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District, which in the 1890s was the city&#x27;s commercial center.

A law, restricting the height of large apartment houses in New York City to , passed the year that the building was completed. The Dakota&#x27;s address was originally 301 West 72nd Street, since the address numbers of buildings on Manhattan&#x27;s west–east numbered streets were based on the building&#x27;s distances from Fifth Avenue. In 1886, house numbers on the Upper West Side were renumbered based on distance from Central Park West (Eighth Avenue), so the Dakota became 1 West 72nd Street. In its first two years, the Dakota was not profitable, and the surrounding blocks were still not developed, particularly the lots to the north. Even in 1890, the row houses on the same block were bringing more income than was the Dakota. By the early 1890s, there was a waiting list for vacant apartments.

According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), the Dakota, along with the American Museum of Natural History several blocks north, helped establish the &quot;early character&quot; of Central Park West. The Dakota&#x27;s completion spurred the construction of other large apartment buildings in the area, several of which were named after regions in the western United States. Other buildings, including a church, fire station, and rowhouses, also were developed nearby. Nonetheless, the Dakota remained the only large apartment building in the neighborhood until the end of the 19th century. A major reason was the lack of electricity in the area, since large apartment buildings needed electricity for their elevators, but the city did not install electric ducts along Central Park West until 1896. The Dakota had its own power plant, so the lack of municipal electric service did not affect the building.

==== 1900s to 1950s ====

The Clarks tried to sell off an adjacent plot to the north, between 73rd and 74th streets, in 1902 with the proviso that no building on that site be taller than the Dakota. The Clarks were unable to sell the plot with that restriction, and the Langham apartment building was erected on the site. Images show that, in the first decades of the 20th century, some dormer windows were added on the roof of the building. Through the early 20th century, the Clark family retained ownership of the Dakota. A &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; article in 1929 noted that the Clarks have &quot;for years resisted all attempts at purchase&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in the 1920s that the Dakota &quot;has always maintained its old-time popularity&quot;. Whereas the Dakota underwent few alterations in its first fifty years, the neighborhood changed dramatically during that period. The Dakota&#x27;s main entrance on 72nd Street originally faced some shacks and gardens, but the high-rise Majestic Apartments overlooked the main entrance by the early 1930s.

Edward S. Clark died in 1933, just before the Dakota&#x27;s 50th anniversary, and his brother Stephen Carlton Clark took over the building&#x27;s operation. Stephen Clark intended to continue operating the Dakota and preserve the garden to the west. At the time, two of the tenants had lived there since its opening, and four of the other original tenants had died in the preceding three years. For the next three decades, the Dakota remained largely unchanged, and the building even retained its original elevators. The Clarks were responsible for all repairs and maintenance and were subject to little, if any scrutiny.

By the 1950s, the servants&#x27; quarters on the upper stories had been converted to apartments. At the time, many tenants were diplomats, theatrical figures, or publishers. The building particularly appealed to theatrical figures because of its proximity to the Broadway Theater District, which was also on the West Side. There was also a long waiting list of potential tenants, and apartments rented for a relatively low $6,000 to $7,000 per year (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). Some tenants, most of whom were friends of Stephen Clark, did not pay rent at all. Residents tended to live in the building for several decades, leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to observe: &quot;It is reported that no Dakotan leaves the building permanently unless it is feet first&quot;.

=== Cooperative conversion ===

==== 1960s to 1980s ====

In January 1961, the Glickman Corporation paid $4.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the Dakota and an adjoining lot that contained the building&#x27;s boiler room. Glickman planned to build New York City&#x27;s largest apartment building on the combined site. The residents announced plans to buy the building from the Glickman Corporation in April 1961 for $4.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Glickman dropped its plans to redevelop the Dakota and instead sold the adjacent site in August. That November, the Dakota&#x27;s tenants bought the building, which became a cooperative. The Mayfair was completed on the adjacent site in 1964; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, no plans were ever filed for a larger building on the Dakota&#x27;s site. Under the co-op arrangement, the residents were obligated to share all maintenance and repair costs, which the Clark family had previously handled. The Dakota was one of twelve apartment buildings on Central Park West to be converted into housing cooperatives in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By the mid-1960s, members of the co-op had to pay fees of up to $14,400 a year (equivalent to $ in ), in addition to a one-time down payment of no more than $60,000 on their apartments (equivalent to $ in ). At the time, the building employed about 30 staff.

The Dakota&#x27;s board of directors announced in 1974 that the roof would need to be replaced, since the slate tiles had started to fall off and the copper trim had deteriorated. Since the building had been designated a New York City landmark five years prior, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) had to review every proposed modification to the exterior. The LPC hired experts who determined that a full restoration would cost $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), which amounted to an additional $10,000 assessment for each of the Dakota&#x27;s 95 tenants. The board of directors decided to instead conduct a smaller-scale renovation. The Joseph K. Blum Company added waterproofing to the Dakota&#x27;s roof for $160,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The Dakota&#x27;s board also voted in 1975 to ban the installation of air conditioners that protruded through the building&#x27;s facade, since the LPC would have to approve every air conditioner that was installed.

The Dakota gained attention when John Lennon, a resident and former member of the rock band the Beatles, was shot dead outside the building on December 8, 1980. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the Dakota became a makeshift memorial for Lennon, especially among fans of the Beatles. The murder also prompted concern among residents, who demanded more stringent security; all visitors were already required to pass through the security booth on 72nd Street. Years after Lennon&#x27;s death, the Dakota&#x27;s residents tended to eschew publicity. The Dakota&#x27;s board had rejected numerous high-profile personalities who had wanted to move into the building. By then, there were 93 apartments, and the original floor plans had been rearranged extensively. Residents generally continued to live in the building for prolonged periods. The recessed areaway around the Dakota was restored in the mid-1980s, and architectural firm Glass &amp; Glass began drawing up plans for a full restoration of the building. By the late 1980s, people in the financial industry comprised an increasing proportion of the Dakota&#x27;s residents; previously, many had worked in the arts.

==== 1990s to present ====
By 1992, the Dakota&#x27;s facade was being cleaned. New mortar had been applied to the brickwork in the facade, but the light color of the mortar contrasted sharply with the darkened bricks. The Dakota&#x27;s board decided to repair the most deteriorated bricks rather than replace the whole facade. The project was budgeted using unit pricing, since it was impossible to know how many bricks needed to be repaired until the entire facade had been examined. The repairs ultimately cost $5 million, amounting to an average assessment of $50,000 for each tenant. The LPC gave craftsmanship awards to the restoration architects, Ehrenkrantz &amp; Eckstut Architects and Remco, in 1994. The fireplaces were also restored in the late 1990s or early 2000s, requiring some of the fireplace flues to be replaced.

The Dakota&#x27;s maintenance expenses were shared among fewer residents and tended to be much higher than at other nearby co-ops. For instance, Lennon&#x27;s widow Yoko Ono paid a monthly fee of $12,566 for her apartment in 1996, while a similarly-sized apartment at the nearby San Remo had a monthly maintenance cost of $6,000. The Dakota&#x27;s board announced in 2002 that it planned to restore the interior courtyard, and it hired Higgins &amp; Quasebarth as a consulting architect. At the time, the upper level of the courtyard had severe leaks, and the breezeway on the western side of the courtyard was &quot;practically held up by paint&quot;. The LPC approved all aspects of the planned renovation. Some residents wanted the glass breezeway in the courtyard to be removed, citing aesthetic concerns; preservationists said the general public would have not been able to see the breezeway anyway, since security had been tightened after Lennon&#x27;s murder. The restoration of the courtyard started in February 2004 and was completed seven and a half months later.

High demand for units at the Dakota continued into the 21st century. The Dakota had 85 co-op units by the 2010s. Some of the smaller apartments had been combined over the years, and several units were restored to their original layouts. The building&#x27;s facade was again renovated starting in 2015. The project was completed two years later for $32 million.

==Residents==
According to a 1996 article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, many brokers classified the Dakota as one of five top-tier apartment buildings on Central Park West, largely because of its residents, large scale, and &quot;historical prestige&quot;. The others were 88 Central Park West, 101 Central Park West, the San Remo, and the Beresford. As at other luxury apartment buildings in New York City, some of the Dakota&#x27;s residents use their units as pieds-a-terre rather than as their primary residences.

The Dakota&#x27;s co-op board, which decides whether to allow prospective tenants, has a reputation for selectivity. In 2011, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; characterized the board as having &quot;high standards and aversion to notoriety&quot;. A CNBC report in 2012 noted that one set of prospective tenants had to pay several thousand dollars for a background check, as well as submit several years&#x27; worth of financial and tax documents, and that even these measures did not guarantee that the tenants would be accepted.

The Dakota&#x27;s board maintains a set of house rules for residents and their guests; in 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized several of the rules as appearing &quot;like they could have been drafted when the building opened&quot;. For example, &quot;domestic employees, messengers and trades people&quot; are required to use the service elevators, and healthcare and childcare providers must be accompanied by clients when they use the passenger elevators. Other rules include a restriction against leaving more than one car unattended in the driveway; a prohibition on &quot;dance, vocal or instrumental instruction&quot; in apartments; and a restriction on playing musical instruments or using a phonograph, radio, or TV loudspeaker between 11 p.m. and 9 a.m. Residents cannot throw away their apartments&#x27; original fireplace mantels or doors and must instead put them in a storage area in the basement.

On numerous occasions, the board has refused to allow high-profile personalities to move into the building, including musicians Gene Simmons, Billy Joel, Carly Simon, Madonna, and Cher, as well as baseball player Alex Rodriguez, and comedian Judd Apatow. In 2002, the board rejected corrugated cardboard magnate Dennis Mehiel; he was only allowed to move into the building 20 years later. Another prospective tenant sued the Dakota&#x27;s board in 2015 after the board prohibited him from moving into a unit he had bought 16 years prior. Former resident Albert Maysles, who had unsuccessfully tried to sell his unit to Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2005: &quot;What&#x27;s so shocking is that the building is losing its touch with interesting people. More and more, they&#x27;re moving away from creative people and going toward people who just have the money.&quot; Investor and resident Buddy Fletcher filed a lawsuit in 2011, claiming that the board had made racist remarks against would-be residents on numerous occasions, but a New York state judge dismissed Fletcher&#x27;s suit in 2015.

== Impact ==

=== Reception ===

Before The Dakota was completed, architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler was skeptical of the building&#x27;s potential, saying: &quot;At present, it is too isolated to come to anything like an immediate favor with the wealthy classes...&quot; By the time the Dakota opened, it was widely acclaimed. The &quot;New York Daily Graphic&quot; wrote that the building was &quot;one of the most perfect apartment houses in the world&quot;. The &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; wrote in 1884: &quot;The owners have been fortunate in their architect, and Mr. Hardenbergh has been fortunate in his clients.&quot; Two years later, H. W. Fabian referred to the Dakota as the &quot;most excellent of any of the kind in New York&quot;, and M. G. Van Rensselaer said the Dakota was the only apartment building she had ever seen that &quot;merits praise&quot;. Elizabeth Hawes said in her 1993 book &quot;New York, New York&quot; that the building looked &quot;both important and unlikely&quot; when it had been completed.

Schuyler, reappraising the building in 1896, said: &quot;The architectural results were so successful that it is a very considerable distinction to have designed the best apartment house in New York.&quot; &quot;Architectural Record&quot; spoke critically of the building&#x27;s high quality, saying in 1902 that the fact that the Dakota was the best-designed apartment house along Central Park West &quot;is not especially encouraging as an architectural sign of the times&quot;. On the Dakota&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; described the building as standing &quot;firmly on its unimpeachable foundations; somewhat shorter than its neighbors but immeasurably more impressive&quot;. 

Commentary continued in later years. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 1959 described the Dakota&#x27;s design as ranging &quot;Victorian Kremlin&quot; to &quot;Middle Eastern Post Office&quot;, while &quot;Look&quot; magazine called the building a &quot;maze of imaginative, distinctive living&quot;. Architect Robert A. M. Stern wrote in 1999: &quot;The Dakota was an undisputed masterpiece, far and away the grandest apartment house of the Gilded Age in New York and rivaling, if not exceeding, in logic and luxury any comparable building in Paris and London&quot;. Christopher Gray said in 2006 that &quot;The Dakota remains Mount Olympus in the mythology of New York apartment houses, its baronial majesty the gauge by which all others must be judged.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; referred to the Beresford, the Dakota, and the San Remo as the &quot;three grand dames of the West Side&quot;.

Contemporary critics also commented about specific architectural elements of the Dakota. The &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; dubbed the dining suite as &quot;the handsomest dining room in Manhattan&quot;. &quot;American Architect and Architecture&quot; wrote: &quot;the court-yard is symmetrically and handsomely shaped&quot;. &quot;American Architect&quot; had only one complaint: &quot;The service-entrances to the suites are situated upon the same court-yard, so that grocers&#x27; wagons and ice-carts are almost always to be seen standing about in the space which should be reserved exclusively for more fashionable equipages, and for the promenades of the tenants of the house.&quot; Hardenbergh, who remained involved in his designs after their completion, wrote a letter objecting to &quot;American Architect&quot; characterization of the courtyard.

=== Cultural impact and legacy ===

Though the Dakota had an unusual design for its time, only one other luxury &quot;communal palace&quot; followed it: the Osborne on 57th Street. After the Dakota was completed, ornamental-iron contractor Hecla Iron Works published advertisements of the building in &quot;Architectural Record&quot;. The building and its inhabitants have been detailed in numerous periodicals, including &quot;Look&quot; and &quot;Architectural Forum&quot;. Illustrations of the building appeared on several magazine covers, including the July 12, 1982, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine and the 1979 Christmas catalog for Brentano&#x27;s bookstore. Numerous replicas of the building have been created, including a model at Legoland Florida, as well as merchandise such as tissue boxes. The American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Dakota among the top 150 buildings in the United States.

The Dakota&#x27;s history is detailed in at least two books. Stephen Birmingham&#x27;s book &quot;Life at the Dakota&quot; was published in 1979, while historian Andrew Alpern&#x27;s book &quot;The Dakota: A History of the World&#x27;s Best-Known Apartment Building&quot; was published in 2015. Nonetheless, relatively little scholarly material about the Dakota has been published. According to Wilbur Ross, a former president of the Dakota&#x27;s board, a planned &quot;centennial art book&quot; about the building was canceled in 1984 because the Dakota was so poorly documented. The Dakota has also appeared in several popular media works, including Roman Polanski&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the &quot;building&#x27;s grim presence was introduced to most Americans&quot; in that film. The building was also depicted in Jack Finney&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Time and Again&quot;.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Dakota as a New York City landmark in February 1969. The Dakota was also added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1972 and was re-added to the NRHP as a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The Dakota is also part of the Central Park West Historic District, which was designated as an NRHP district in 1982, as well as the Upper West Side Historic District, which became a New York City historic district in 1990.

<text>The subway system of the United States Capitol Complex in Washington, D.C., consists of three underground electric people mover systems that connect the United States Capitol to several congressional office buildings – all of the Senate buildings and one of the House buildings.

==History==
The original subway line was built in 1909 to link the Russell Senate Office Building to the Capitol. In 1960, an operator-controlled monorail was installed for the Dirksen Senate Office Building. A two-car subway line connecting the Rayburn House Office Building to the Capitol was built in 1965. The Dirksen monorail, which had been extended to the Hart Senate Office Building in 1982, was replaced in 1993 by an automatic train.

==Network==
On the Senate side, two separate subway lines exist. The first is a crewed two-track system, with a single open-topped car operating on each track, connecting the Russell Senate Office Building and the Capitol. The other is a computer-controlled system with three enclosed trains of three cars each running on a 90-second schedule, connecting the Hart Senate Office Building, the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the Capitol. The train cars are unpowered; the train is propelled by a track-side linear motor. This line has two parallel tracks for most of its length, but at the Hart and Capitol stations the tracks converge into one, with a single side platform. This allows easy return travel on the opposite track. The Dirksen station features a side platform for Capitol-bound trains and an island platform for Hart-bound trains. All three of these stations feature platform screen doors. A small maintenance spur is located adjacent to the Hart station. 

On the House side, an older, crewed two-track system, with a single open-topped car operating on each track, shuttles passengers between the Rayburn House Office Building and the Capitol. The remaining four House office buildings are not serviced by the subway system; two (Cannon and Longworth) use a shared underground footpath tunnel while the other two (Ford and O&#x27;Neill) have no underground connection to the capitol.

The House and Senate subway systems do not terminate in the same location under the Capitol, but they are connected by a labyrinth of tunnels.

==Security==
The public can travel on the trains — usually during a tour of the Capitol Complex — but must be escorted by a staff member with proper identification. During votes, the House subway is restricted to congressional members. The Russell subway is restricted to members and staff during Senate votes.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, restrictions have been placed on visitors using the Senate subway between the Hart and Dirksen buildings.

===1947 shooting===
Senator John W. Bricker was shot at as he entered the Capitol subway tunnel by former Capitol Police officer William Louis Kaiser on July 12, 1947. Bricker survived as the shots did not hit him.

===2007 collision===
A collision occurred on October 2, 2007, in the Rayburn to Capitol subway line after a car failed to slow down when it reached the end of the track line. The operator was injured and taken to a hospital for observation.

<text>William Havergal Brian (29 January 187628 November 1972) was a prominent 20th-century English composer, librettist, and church organist. 

He is best known for having composed 32 symphonies, an unusually high number amongst his contemporaries, 25 of them after the age of 70. His best-known work is his Symphony No. 1, &quot;The Gothic&quot;, which calls for some of the largest orchestral forces demanded by a conventionally structured concert work. 

He also composed five operas and a number of other orchestral works, as well as songs, choral music and a small amount of chamber music. Brian enjoyed a period of popularity earlier in his career and rediscovery in the 1950s, but public performances of his music have remained rare and he has been described as a cult composer. He continued to be extremely productive late into his career, composing large works even into his nineties, most of which remained unperformed during his lifetime.

==Life==
===Early life===
William Havergal Brian was born on 29 January 1876 in Dresden, in the Potteries district of Staffordshire, near the Stoke-on-Trent suburb of Longton. He was one of a very small number of composers to originate from the English working class. Brian&#x27;s middle name Havergal, by which he went beginning at a young age, was named after Frances Ridley Havergal of the prominent Havergal hymn-writing family. 

Brian&#x27;s earliest musical education appears to have been as a choirboy; he sang in the choir at St James&#x27; church in Longton. In 1887 he and other choristers from his home town participated in a concert in Lichfield Cathedral marking the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This experience gave the boy an interest in large-scale musical effects. At the age of 12, after leaving the elementary school attached to the church, he started work (he tried a variety of trades). In his spare time, he continued to study music including the organ for which he showed talent at a young age; as a composer he was virtually self-taught. From 1896 he was organist of All Saints&#x27;, a Gothic Revival church in Odd Rode, just across the county border in Cheshire. The post involved playing at Sunday services; his main job at this time was with a timber company.

Around the time he started at All Saints&#x27;, he was influenced by hearing &quot;King Olaf&quot;, a composition for soloists, choir and orchestra by Edward Elgar. Now one of the composer&#x27;s lesser-known works, &quot;King Olaf&quot; was commissioned for the North Staffordshire Music Festival of 1896, where it was well received. Brian sent a sample composition to Elgar who gave him encouragement. Brian became a fervent enthusiast of the new music being produced by Richard Strauss and the British composers of the day. Through attending music festivals he began a lifelong friendship with composer Granville Bantock (1868–1946).

In 1898, Brian married Isabel Priestley, by whom he had five children. One of his sons was named Sterndale after the English composer Sir William Sterndale Bennett.

===Full-time composer===
In 1907 Brian was offered a yearly income of £500 (then a respectable lower-middle-class salary) by a local wealthy businessman, Herbert Minton Robinson, to enable him to devote all his time to composition. It seems Robinson expected Brian soon to become successful and financially independent on the strength of his compositions, and initially Brian indeed found success: his first &quot;English Suite&quot; attracted the attention of Henry J. Wood, who performed it at the London Proms in 1907. The work proved popular and Brian obtained a publisher and performances for his next few orchestral works, although this initial success was not maintained. For a while Brian worked on a number of ambitious large-scale choral and orchestral works, but felt no urgency to finish them, and began to indulge in pleasures such as expensive foods and a trip to Italy.

Arguments over the money and an affair with a young servant, Hilda Mary Hayward (1894-1980), led to the collapse of his first marriage in 1913. Brian fled to London and, although Robinson (who disapproved of the incident) continued to provide him with money until his own death, most of the allowance went to Brian&#x27;s estranged wife after 1913. The affair with Hilda turned into a lifelong relationship: Brian and she began living together as man and wife, and after Isabel&#x27;s death in 1933 they were married, by which point Hilda had already borne him another five children. No longer able to rely on Robinson&#x27;s support, in London Brian began composing copiously whilst living in poverty. On the outbreak of World War I he volunteered for the Honourable Artillery Company but saw no service before he was invalided out with a hand injury. He subsequently worked at the Audit Office of the Canadian Expeditionary Force until December 1915. The family then moved to Erdington, near Birmingham, Warwickshire, until May 1919 and then spent several years in various locations in Sussex. His brief war service gave him the material for his first opera &quot;The Tigers&quot;. In the 1920s he turned to composing symphonies, though he had written more than ten before one of them was first performed in the early 1950s. Brian eventually obtained work of a musical kind, copying and arranging, and writing for the journal &quot;The British Bandsman&quot;. In 1927, he became assistant editor of the journal &quot;Musical Opinion&quot; and moved back to London.

In 1940 he retired, living firstly in London, and then in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex. Freed from the requirement to work to make a living, he was able to devote all of his time to composition, and the bulk of his compositional output belongs to the last three decades of his life, including four of the five operas (composed between 1951 and 1957) and twenty-seven of the thirty-two symphonies (composed from 1948 onwards). Through most of the 1960s, Brian composed two or three symphonies each year.

This late flurry of activity coincided with something of a rediscovery, in part due to the efforts of Robert Simpson, himself a significant composer and BBC Music Producer, who asked Sir Adrian Boult to programme the Eighth Symphony in 1954. A number of Brian works received their public premieres during this time, including the &quot;Gothic Symphony&quot;. Written decades earlier between 1919 and 1927, it was premiered in a partly amateur performance in 1961 at Westminster Central Hall, conducted by Bryan Fairfax. A fully professional performance followed in 1966 at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted by Boult. The latter performance was broadcast live, encouraging considerable interest, and by his death six years later several of his works had been performed, along with the first commercial recordings of Brian&#x27;s music. For a few years after Brian&#x27;s death there was a revival of interest in Brian with a number of further recordings and performances; two biographies and a three-volume study of his symphonies appeared.

After having heard the &quot;Sinfonia Tragica&quot; (No. 6), the conductor Leopold Stokowski expressed his interest in conducting Brian&#x27;s music. The result was the world premiere in 1973 of the 28th Symphony, in a BBC broadcast produced by Robert Simpson in Maida Vale Studio 1, and played by the New Philharmonia Orchestra. Anthony Payne in his &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; review wrote: &quot;It was fascinating to contemplate the uniqueness of the event – a 91-year-old conductor learning a new work by a 91-year-old composer.&quot;

==Music==

Stylistically, Brian&#x27;s music could broadly be described as being in a late romantic idiom, exhibiting the influence of Gustav Mahler in his ambitious orchestration and progressive tonality. A Germanophile – the text of the Psalms in his fourth symphony is sung in German – Brian&#x27;s main musical influences are primarily Germanic composers like Wagner, Bruckner, Strauss, Mahler and Bach, as well as Elgar. Brian&#x27;s music is fundamentally tonal rather than atonal and shows little or no influence of dodecaphony; however, it is often punctuated with violent and occasionally dissonant passages.

Brian&#x27;s music has several recognisable hallmarks: the liking of extreme dotted rhythms, deep brass notes, and various uncharacteristic harp, piano and percussion timbres, and other unusual orchestral sounds and textures. Also typical are moments of stillness, such as the slow harp arpeggio that is heard near the beginning and ending of the Eighth Symphony. Arguably, his music&#x27;s most notable characteristic however is its restlessness: rarely does one mood persist for long before it is contrasted, often abruptly, with another. Even in Brian&#x27;s slow movements, lyrical meditation does not often structure the music for long before restless thoughts intrude. Although the fragmentary nature of his music militates against classical thematic unity, he often employs structural blocks of sound, where similar rhythms and thematic material allude to previous passages (as opposed to classical statement and recapitulation). However fragmentary Brian&#x27;s music is, he maintains symphonic cohesion by long-term tonal processes (similar to Carl Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;progressive tonality&quot;), where the music is aiming towards a key, rather than being in a home key and returning to it.

Like Bach and Bruckner, Brian was an organist, and the organ repertoire influenced his musical habits (and the organ appears in several of his symphonies). Other sources of influence are late Victorian street music, and particularly brass and military bands: although he composed little dedicated music for brass band, brass instruments are often prominent in Brian&#x27;s orchestral music, as are marches.

Although he wrote music in a range of forms, Brian is best known for his 32 symphonies. His first canonical symphony – an earlier &quot;Fantastic Symphony&quot; was withdrawn – is the colossal &quot;Gothic Symphony&quot;, a performance of which last almost two hours and requires enormous orchestral and choral forces. It was completed in 1927. Although the &quot;Gothic&quot; is by far Brian&#x27;s best-known work, and perhaps the work by which he has come to be defined, it is not representative of his symphonies as a whole. Few of Brian&#x27;s symphonies call for larger forces than a typical 20th-century symphony orchestra – although No. 4 (&quot;Das Siegeslied&quot;) calls for a large choir and soprano soloist – and a typical Brian symphony lasts approximately 20 minutes in performance. Brian usually alludes to the classical four-movement structure of the symphony, even in single-movement works. His sixth symphony was composed at the age of 72, and the majority of Brian&#x27;s symphonies were composed in rapid succession in the last two decades of his life, in his 80s and even into his 90s. Most were unperformed during Brian&#x27;s own life, although all 32 have since been recorded.

In addition to symphonies, Brian also composed several large operas in the 1950s. In 1997, Brian&#x27;s 1951 opera in eight scenes &quot;The Cenci&quot;, based on the 1819 play by Percy Bysshe Shelley, was premiered in a concert performance by the Millennium Sinfonia, conducted by James Kelleher, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London.

==Reception and legacy==
Brian&#x27;s musical influence was limited by the fact that so little of his music was performed or recorded until after his death, by which time his stylistic idiom could be considered anachronistic. Nonetheless, he was held in high regard by composers such as Robert Simpson and some of his contemporaries, such as Granville Bantock. His music has generally been championed by a small number of enthusiasts rather than enjoying a more general popularity, and continues to divide opinion. To Mark Morris, writing in his &quot;Guide to Twentieth Century Composers&quot;, in the &quot;Gothic Symphony&quot; Brian achieved &quot;one of the world&#x27;s artistic masterpieces, in vision, grandeur, and in the combination of complexity and luminosity worthy to stand alongside the great cathedrals of the age that inspired it... [it] is arguably, more than any other late-Romantic work, the climax of the Romantic age.&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 2016, Damian Thompson claimed that if Brian&#x27;s 30th symphony were premiered today as the work of a 25-year-old composer, it &quot;might even be hailed as the triumphant reinvention of tonality&quot;.

Others have been more critical, however. Reviewing the 2011 performance of the &quot;Gothic Symphony&quot; at the BBC Proms David Nice of &quot;The Arts Desk&quot; described the work as a &quot;terrible, inchoate mess&quot; and &quot;Big, long, and very short on great ideas&quot;; writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Andrew Clements described it as featuring &quot;moments of striking originality, particularly the sparer, more spectral ideas, but much more is either entirely unmemorable or simply grotesquely odd, and often hopelessly over-scored. Ideas come and go; for a work that lasts nearly two hours, the music is surprisingly short-winded.&quot;

In 2022 Brian&#x27;s &quot;Legend&quot; for violin and piano was featured in the BBC Proms.

==Recordings==
The first commercial recording of Havergal Brian&#x27;s music was made by the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra in 1972, when Symphonies Nos. 10 and 21, conducted by James Loughran and Eric Pinkett respectively, were recorded at the De Montfort Hall, Leicester. The producer was Robert Simpson. The LP was released by Unicorn Records in 1973. A special edition of the television programme &quot;Aquarius&quot; called &quot;The Unknown Warrior&quot; gave considerable coverage to the recording session and a camera crew joined members of the orchestra during a visit they made to the composer&#x27;s home in Shoreham.

During the 1970s a number of unofficial releases of Brian symphonies were made. These generally were of BBC recordings, and the recordings were released under fictitious names. Several have now had official releases.

In 1979, Cameo Classics embarked on a project to record all of Brian&#x27;s orchestral music in collaboration with the Havergal Brian Society. It started with the &quot;English Suite No. 1&quot;, &quot;Doctor Merryheart&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Variations on an Old Rhyme&quot;. In 1980 came the second LP containing &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, &quot;For Valour&quot;, and &quot;Festal Dance&quot;. The project was completed in 1981 with the recordings of &quot;Burlesque Variations on an Original Theme&quot;, and &quot;Two Herrick Songs&quot;, &quot;Requiem for the Rose&quot; and &quot;The Hag&quot;. The recordings were produced by David Kent-Watson with the Hull Youth Orchestra conducted by Geoffrey Heald-Smith. For the recording of Brian&#x27;s complete piano music, Cameo Classics employed digital technology. Peter Hill&#x27;s performances on a Bösendorfer Imperial at the Northern College of Music earned high praise from John Ogdon in his review for &quot;Tempo&quot;.

More of Brian&#x27;s works have been published since the 1980s and &#x27;90s, and the scarcity of well-rehearsed performances or mature interpretations that had previously made the quality of his music difficult to assess has been partially corrected through the series of professional recordings of many of Brian&#x27;s symphonies that have been issued by the Marco Polo record label on CD. Many of the original recordings on various labels are being reissued, and by the end of 2018 all of Brian&#x27;s symphonies had at least one official recording, although not necessarily in print.

In August 2010, the Dutton CD label issued three works taken from 1959 BBC broadcasts: the Comedy Overture &quot;Doctor Merryheart&quot; and 11th Symphony (with Harry Newstone conducting the London Symphony Orchestra) and the 9th Symphony (Norman del Mar and the LSO). This release followed on from Testament&#x27;s reissue of the live recording of the 1966 Boult performance in the Royal Albert Hall of Brian&#x27;s &quot;Gothic Symphony&quot;. In the 2011 Proms concert season the symphony was conducted by Martyn Brabbins in the Royal Albert Hall; the performance is now available on a commercial recording.

In July 2012, a documentary film, &quot;The Curse of the Gothic Symphony&quot; was released in Australian cinemas. Directed by Randall Wood, it is a dramatised documentary of the trials and tribulations of staging Brian&#x27;s Gothic Symphony in Brisbane, Queensland. Filmed over five years, the enormous task of gathering 200 musicians and 400 choristers came to fruition in 2010 in a triumphal performance and standing ovation in Brisbane&#x27;s Performing Arts centre.

===Recordings of the symphonies===

&amp;&amp;&amp;= released in a (pirated) LP box-set with (presumed) apocryphal attributions to John Freedman (conductor)/ Edinburgh Youth Symphony Orchestras
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;=recording from original BBC broadcast exists, not commercially released
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;=recording from BBC radio 3 exists, not commercially released; a pirated LP (Aries LP-1607) with apocryphal attributions to Horst Werner (conductor)/ Hamburg Philharmonic is reported and refers to this Stokowski performance
d=cd was made, but is now deleted from catalogue
e=recording is in the public domain and is available from the Havergal Brian Society webpage 
Both the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra recordings have been remastered and rereleased.
Many of the BBC recordings are freely available for download with registration.

<text>Warren Justin DeMartini (born April 10, 1963) is an American musician best known as the lead guitarist for glam metal band Ratt, which achieved international stardom in the 1980s.

== Early life ==
DeMartini was born on April 10, 1963, in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of five boys. He spent his early years in the suburb of River Forest, Illinois. The family later relocated to San Diego. DeMartini became interested in rock music due to the influence of his older brothers Bernard and James, whose band rehearsed in the family basement. His grandmother was also a musician, playing piano accompaniment to silent movies in Preston, Minnesota.

DeMartini&#x27;s mother bought him a guitar at his request when he was &quot;around seven or eight years old&quot;. According to Warren, he struggled early on learning to play it due to the tuning pegs being cheap, causing the instrument to constantly fall out of tune. As a result, he became frustrated and smashed the instrument as he had seen Pete Townshend of the Who do onstage. As a result, that was the last guitar he would receive as a gift. At age 14, he had to get himself a job in order to raise the money to purchase a new electric guitar, a Cimar Les Paul copy. The first song DeMartini learned was &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; by Cream, which he learned by ear.

Warren played his first concert with his band the Plague in front of a small crowd at San Diego&#x27;s La Jolla High School at the age of 15. By this time he was emerging as one of the San Diego area&#x27;s most talented and sought-after young guitar players. The first year he signed up, he won &quot;Best New Guitar Player in San Diego&quot; at &quot;Guitar Trader&quot; on Clairemont Mesa Blvd. He graduated from high school in 1981. DeMartini began taking classes at a local college, but in the first semester was invited up to Los Angeles to join Mickey Ratt, the band that would eventually become the highly successful 1980s metal band Ratt.

== Ratt ==
DeMartini replaced Jake E. Lee, who would be hired by Ozzy Osbourne in December 1982. When DeMartini was called up from San Diego to join RATT in Los Angeles, he lived with Lee to learn the songs on the band&#x27;s first album, and each greatly influenced the other&#x27;s styles.

DeMartini&#x27;s lead guitar became one of Ratt&#x27;s most recognizable aspects, and he would co-write several of the band&#x27;s best known songs, including &quot;Round and Round&quot;, &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, &quot;Dance&quot;, and &quot;Way Cool Jr.&quot;. Ratt would ultimately become one of the top-selling and most popular metal acts of the decade, issuing four consecutive platinum albums and one EP in the 1980s before disbanding in February 1992.

== Post-Ratt and returns ==
After Ratt broke up, DeMartini had a short stint with the band Dokken before briefly becoming a touring guitarist for hard rock band Whitesnake in 1994. In 1995, he released his debut solo song &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; as an EP featuring remixes of the title track, followed by his only full-length album to date, &quot;Crazy Enough to Sing to You&quot;, in 1996. Ratt reunited in 1996 and released two albums, &quot;Collage&quot; in July 1997, and a self-titled album in July 1999, which was a critical and commercial failure. In 2003, DeMartini was hired to replace guitarist Doug Aldrich in the band Dio but after several rehearsals he decided to leave the band due to musical differences with band leader Ronnie James Dio. Ratt reformed again in 2007 and began a tour in the summer of that year. In March 2018, it was widely rumored that DeMartini had lost interest with continuing forward with Ratt due to ongoing problems within the band. In July 2018, Ratt stated that DeMartini would no longer be involved with the current touring lineup as &quot;he didn&#x27;t want to go out there anymore.&quot;

== Technique ==
VH1 labeled him as one of the ten most underrated &quot;hair metal&quot; guitarists of the 80s.

Warren will sometimes use finger vibrato, similar in style to George Lynch. Allan Holdsworth often used the same technique, which achieves the periodic raising and lowering of the note by moving the fretting finger longitudinally, back and forth along the string, to alter the pitch, as opposed to bending the string across the frets. Moderate downward finger pressure and relatively light strings are necessary for friction of the fingertip against the string to facilitate such pushing and pulling, respectively lowering and raising the pitch, as well as frets to stop the strings, making such vibrato possible. (Violin-style vibrato requires moving the fingertip along the string&#x27;s length somewhat, more of a rolling approach, since the violin and family lack frets altogether.)

<doc id="148950" wikidata="Q823600" url="?curid=148950" title="Chesterfield, Derbyshire">
<text>Chesterfield is a market and industrial town in the county of Derbyshire, England. It is north of Derby and south of Sheffield at the confluence of the Rivers Rother and Hipper. In 2011, the built-up-area subdivision had a population of 88,483, making it the second-largest settlement in Derbyshire, after Derby. The wider Borough of Chesterfield had a population of 103,569 in the 2021 Census. In 2021, the town itself had a population of 76,402.

It has been traced to a transitory Roman fort dated to approximately AD 80-100. The name of the later Anglo-Saxon village comes from the Old English &quot;ceaster&quot; (Roman fort) and &quot;feld&quot; (pasture). It has a sizeable street market three days a week. The town sits on an old coalfield, but little visual evidence of mining remains since the closure of the final town centre mine nicknamed “The Green Room”. The main landmark is the crooked spire of the Church of St Mary and All Saints.

==History==
Chesterfield was in the Hundred of Scarsdale. The town received its market charter in 1204 from King John, which constituted the town as a free borough, granting the burgesses of Chesterfield the privileges of those of Nottingham and Derby. In 1266, the Battle of Chesterfield saw a band of rebel barons defeated by a royalist army.

Elizabeth I granted a charter in either 1594 or 1598, creating a corporation of a mayor, six aldermen, six brethren, and twelve capital burgesses. This remained its charter until the borough was reshaped under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. It originally consisted only of the township of Chesterfield but absorbed some surrounding townships in 1892. There was a major extension when the borough absorbed New Whittington and Newbold urban district in 1920. Chesterfield&#x27;s current boundaries date from 1 April 1974, when the Borough of Chesterfield was formed under the Local Government Act 1972 by amalgamating the municipal borough of Chesterfield, the urban district of Staveley and the parish of Brimington from Chesterfield Rural District.
Chesterfield benefitted much from the building of the Chesterfield Line – part of the Derby to Leeds railway (North Midland Line) begun in 1837 by George Stephenson. During the work, a sizeable seam of coal was discovered while the Clay Cross Tunnel was constructed. This and the local ironstone were exploited by Stephenson, who set up a company in Clay Cross to trade in the minerals.

During his time in Chesterfield, Stephenson lived at Tapton House, remaining there until his death in 1848. He is interred in Trinity Church. A statue of him was erected outside Chesterfield railway station in 2006.

==Governance==
Local government in Chesterfield has a two-tier structure. At the upper tier of services such as consumer protection, education, main roads and social services is provided by Derbyshire County Council. At the lower tier, housing, planning, refuse collection and burial grounds are provided by Chesterfield Borough Council. There are two civil parishes in the borough, Brimington and Staveley.

Derbyshire County Council has 64 county councillors and Chesterfield Borough Council 40 local councillors, both elected every four years.

=== Coat of arms ===
The borough council uses armorial bearings originally granted to the previous borough corporation by letters patent dated 10 November 1955. The blazon of the arms is as follows:

Gules a Device representing a Pomegranate Tree as depicted on the ancient Common Seal of the Borough the tree leaved and eradicated proper flowered and fructed Or &quot;and for the Crest on a Wreath of the Colours&quot; Issuant from a Mural Crown Gules Masoned Or a Mount Vert thereon a Derby Ram passant guardant proper.
&quot;Supporters&quot;: On the dexter side a Cock and on the sinister side a Pynot or Magpie proper each Ducally gorged Or

The shield is based on the borough&#x27;s ancient common seal, believed to date from the earlier 16th century. The seal depicts a stylised pomegranate tree. When the arms were formally granted, the College of Arms expressed the view that the plant had been adopted by the town as a symbol of loyalty to the crown, as it had been a royal badge used by Katherine of Aragon, Henry VIII and Mary Tudor. The crest depicts a Derby Ram, representing the county of Derbyshire, and a mural crown, suggestive of a town wall and thus borough status. The supporters represent the &quot;Cock and Pynot Inn&quot;, Old Whittington. The now &quot;Cock and Magpie Inn&quot; (53°16&#x27;13.1&quot;N 1°25&#x27;34.3&quot;W) is next to &quot;Revolution House&quot;, which was the site of a meeting between conspirators against James II in 1688. Among those meeting there were the Earl of Danby and Devonshire, marked by ducal crowns round the supporters&#x27; necks. The two birds stand on a compartment of rocks and moorland. The motto is &quot;Aspire&quot;, a punning reference to the crooked spire of the parish church.

===Combined authority===
In March 2016 the borough council began a bid to join the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority, which was due to receive devolved powers. Derbyshire County Council opposed this and sought legal advice. In June 2017 Chesterfield Council withdrew its application, but is now non-constituent partner.

==Geography==
Chesterfield lies at the confluence of the River Rother and River Hipper at the Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire Coalfield, in the eastern foothills of the Pennines. It is sometimes described as the &quot;Gateway to the Peak&quot;, with the Peak District National Park to the west of the town.

Nearby areas of the South and West Yorkshire Green Belt can serve to block urban sprawl. Other local greenfield frameworks include &quot;strategic gaps&quot; to maintain the openness and landscape qualities of large open areas, and &quot;green wedges&quot; penetrating urban areas with recreational facilities.

===Urban area===
The wider Chesterfield Urban Area had a population of 112,664 at the 2021 Census, this included the town of Chesterfield along with its surrounding suburbs and the outlying villages and towns of Wingerworth, Staveley, Cutthorpe and Holymoorside.

==Politics==
Chesterfield is part of the Chesterfield constituency; the Member of Parliament (MP) is Toby Perkins (Labour). The local council for Chesterfield 
is Chesterfield Borough Council.

==Economy==
Since the cessation of coal mining, the economy around Chesterfield has undergone major change. The employment base has moved from the primary and secondary sectors towards the tertiary. The area sits on an old, large coalfield which had many collieries, including those in outlying areas which were historically part of Chesterfield Rural District: Clay Cross, Arkwright Town, Bolsover, Grassmoor, North Wingfield and Holmewood.

Between 1981 and 2002, 15,000 jobs in the coal industry were lost and all collieries closed, although open cast mining took place at Arkwright Town for a few years from November 1993. Many mine sites were restored by a contractor for Derbyshire County Council. Little evidence of mining remains. A cyclists&#x27; and walkers&#x27; route, the &quot;Five Pits Trail&quot;, links some former mines; most are now indistinguishable from the surrounding countryside.

In the town, large factories and major employers have disappeared or relocated. Markham &amp; Co. manufactured tunnel boring machines such as the one used for the Channel Tunnel. It was bought out by Norway&#x27;s Kvaerner and later merged with Sheffield-based Davy. Its factory on Hollis Lane is now a housing estate; the former offices were turned into flats and serviced office suites. Dema Glass&#x27;s factory near Lockoford Lane closed; the site is now host to a Tesco supermarket and the Proact Stadium, the home of Chesterfield Football Club. GKN closed its factory and the site is being turned into a business park.

Other companies have downsized sharply. Robinson&#x27;s, makers of paper-based packaging, divested its health-care interests, which led to a marked fall in the workforce and facilities in Chesterfield. Trebor, once based on Brimington Road near Chesterfield railway station, merged with Bassetts sweets of Sheffield, was later taken over by Cadbury and relocated to a modern unit at Holmewood business park. The earlier factory site is now developed as part of a mixed residential and commercial site.

Manufacturing employment has fallen by a third since 1991, though the proportion of employees in manufacturing is still above the national average. Today, smaller firms are found on several industrial estates, the largest being at Sheepbridge. Business located on the estate includes SIG plc subsidiary Warren Insulations, Franke Sisons Ltd (founded in 1784 in Sheffield and among the first to manufacture stainless steel kitchen sinks in the 1930s), Rhodes Group and Chesterfield Felt.

Between the A61 and Brimington Road, there is a development site resulting from Arnold Laver relocating to a modern sawmill at Halfway, near Sheffield. The former sawmill has been demolished, and is now a mixed residential and commercial development called Chesterfield Waterside.

There is a Morrisons on the junction of Chatsworth Road (A619) and Walton Road (A632), a Sainsburys on Rother Way (A619 for Staveley), and a Tesco Extra on the junction of the A619 and A61 (known locally as &quot;Tesco Roundabout&quot;). The Institute of Business Advisers is based on Queen Street North. Chesterfield Royal Hospital is on the A632 towards Calow and Bolsover. It has the only accident and emergency department in Derbyshire outside Derby.

The Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Branch of the RSPCA is located in the town, and serves the North East Derbyshire area.

The Royal Mail&#x27;s Pensions Service Centre is near the town in Boythorpe Road, in Rowland Hill House, which also serves other administrative functions. There is a Post Office Ltd building in the town at West Bars called Future Walk. Formerly this was Chetwynd House, now demolished and replaced by the new building.

===Shopping, entertainment and leisure===

The town centre of Chesterfield has retained much of its pre-war plan. Chesterfield Market is one of the largest open-air markets in Britain, the stalls sitting either side of the Market Hall. In the middle of town, a collection of narrow medieval streets makes up The Shambles, which houses the &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, one of Britain&#x27;s oldest pubs.

Near Holywell Cross is what was (until 2013) Chesterfield&#x27;s largest department store, the Co-operative or Co-op. The main building opened in 1938, and now occupies the majority of Elder Way, including an enclosed bridge, and part of Knifesmithgate. Here the façade is in the mock-Tudor style fashionable in the 1930s, which still dominates the north side of Knifesmithgate. In 2001, the Chesterfield and District Co-operative Society was incorporated into a larger regional Midlands Co-operative Society Limited, now the biggest independent retail society in the UK. Owing to a decline in retail sales, the large home and fashion Co-op department store closed at the end of July 2013, The area has had some redevelopment with a Premier Inn and retail stores now open.

====The Pavements====
In the late 1970s the area between Low Pavement (in the Market Square) and New Beetwell Street was redeveloped to build &quot;The Pavements&quot; Shopping Centre, known by some as The Precinct. The existing buildings were demolished except for the façades on Lower Pavement. The shopping centre was opened in November 1981 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. It has entrances opposite Chesterfield Market and escalators leading down to New Beetwell St and the bus station. An enclosed bridge links the site to a multi-storey car park built at the same time, adjacent to the town&#x27;s coach station.

Chesterfield&#x27;s multi-storey library stands just outside The Pavements in New Beetwell St. The building was opened in 1985. In annual figures compiled by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy it ranked fifth in the UK for number of loans in 2008, rising one place on the previous year. The area beside the library was redeveloped, but retains the old narrow passageways while accommodating small shop units and offices.

On 27 June 2007, the Somerfield store in the Precinct was gutted in a fire in which the roof collapsed, a few shoppers suffering minor injuries. The fire reportedly started after a welding torch being used to repair flood damage had been left ignited. It started at 13:10 on 27 June and was not extinguished until 23:30 that day. After the fire, Somerfield decided to cease trading in Chesterfield. The unit re-opened in September 2008 as a Tesco Metro store.

====Vicar Lane====

Vicar Lane was redeveloped in 2000 as a pedestrianised open-air shopping centre creating two new shopping streets. This meant demolishing almost all of the existing buildings, including a Woolworths branch and a small bus station. It now includes major chains such as H&amp;M and Iceland. The development had been planned in the 1980s but delayed for economic reasons. A multi-storey car park on Beetwell St was added under the revised plan. The area lies between the Pavements Centre and markets and the crooked spire.

====Food and drink====
Nightlife is centred mainly in the Church Way, Holywell Street and Corporation Street areas. The Brampton Mile, west of the town centre is known for the number of public houses on a stretch of Chatsworth Road.

In February 2006, the first international gluten free beer festival was held in Chesterfield. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) hosted the event as part of its regular beer festival in the town.

====The arts====
The Winding Wheel, hitherto an Odeon Cinema, is a venue for concerts, exhibitions, conferences, dinners, family parties, dances, banquets, wedding receptions, meetings, product launches and lectures. Past notable performers include Bob Geldof, The Proclaimers and Paddy McGuinness. It also hosts performances of the Chesterfield Symphony Orchestra.

The &quot;Pomegranate Theatre&quot;, formerly the Chesterfield Civic Theatre and previously the Stephenson Memorial Theatre, is a listed Victorian building in what is now known as the Stephenson Memorial Hall. It has an auditorium that seats about 500 people. Shows are given throughout the year. Also in the Stephenson Memorial Hall is the Chesterfield Museum, opened in 1994. Until 1984 it was used as the town&#x27;s main library. The museum is owned by Chesterfield Borough Council, as are the Winding Wheel and the Pomegranate Theatre. The box office for both venues is located in the entrance area of the theatre.

The Royal Mail building, Future Walk, in West Bars, was once the site of Chetwynd House, referred to locally as the AGD. Here a work by sculptor Barbara Hepworth &quot;Curved Reclining Form&quot; or &quot;Rosewall&quot; was prominently displayed for many years and nicknamed &quot;Isaiah&quot; by local critics, as it resembled a crude human face with one eye higher than the other (&quot;eye&#x27;s &#x27;igher&quot;). The work was due to be sold in 2005, but reprieved as a work of national significance. Other artworks of note include &quot;A System of Support and Balance&quot; by Paul Lewthwaite, outside Chesterfield Magistrates&#x27; Court.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The town is bisected north-south by the A61, with a dual carriageway from the town centre right into Sheffield. The A617 links to Mansfield, the A619 provides an entry point to the Peak District (eventually joining the A6 near Bakewell) and the A632 connects Bolsover with Matlock.

The M1 motorway passes Chesterfield to the east, at a distance of to junction 29a. Three junctions provide access to the town:

* Junction 29 at Heath to the south, via the A617 dual carriageway.
* Junction 29a at Markham Vale in Duckmanton, via the A632
* Junction 30 to the north, via the A619.

===Buses and coaches===

Stagecoach East Midlands and Stagecoach Yorkshire are the predominant bus operators in Chesterfield; others include Hulleys of Baslow, Trent Barton and TM Travel.

Buses stop in several areas around the town centre, rather than at a central bus station. The Stagecoach depot at Stonegravels is notable for its size and many vehicles stored there are not in regular use; it was Chesterfield Corporation&#x27;s bus depot.

Chesterfield coach station opened in 2005, on the site of the old bus station; it is served by Stagecoach and National Express coaches. Routes connect the town with Bradford, Leeds, Leicester, London and Sheffield.

===Railways===
Chesterfield railway station lies on the Midland Main Line. It is served by three train operating companies:
* East Midlands Railway operates inter-city routes to London St Pancras, Derby, Sheffield, , Nottingham and Norwich
* CrossCountry runs long-distance inter-city services to Sheffield, , Newcastle, , Derby, Reading, Bournemouth, , Plymouth and Penzance
* Northern Trains operates a services between Leeds and Nottingham.

Chesterfield once had two other railway stations:
* Chesterfield Market Place had been the terminus of the Chesterfield–Lincoln line. It was built in 1897 by the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (LD&amp;ECR); it closed in 1951, due to the prohibitive cost of maintaining Bolsover Tunnel and the nearby Doe Lea Viaduct, which were both affected by mining subsidence. No original buildings remain. The site is now owned by the Post Office.
* Chesterfield Central closed in 1963, in conjunction with a general wind-down of passenger train activity on the Great Central Railway (GCR). Chesterfield&#x27;s inner relief road, part of the A61, now runs along some of the disused track bed. The station was demolished in 1973. Part of the railway tunnel under the town still exists off Dixon&#x27;s Road, the northern entrance has been sealed off.

The railways crossed each other at Horns Bridge, the Midland Main Line passing over the GCR loop into Chesterfield and the LD&amp;ECR passing both on a viaduct. Horns Bridge has been redeveloped since the last two railways closed. Horns Bridge roundabout on the A61 Derby Road and A617 Lordsmill Street now occupies the site. The viaduct was demolished in the 1970s.

Chesterfield tramway system was built in 1882 and closed in 1927.

===Taxis===
The main taxi ranks are in Elder Way, Knifesmithgate and outside the railway station. Chesterfield taxis are recognisably black with distinctive white bonnets and boots.

===Air===
The nearest licensed airfield is Netherthorpe Aerodrome, near Worksop in Nottinghamshire, but has only 553 metres of grass runway. Air passengers may use East Midlands, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Birmingham airports, all within two hours by road.

===Canal===
The Chesterfield Canal linked the town to a national network of waterways through the 19th century. Overtaken by rail and then road for freight transport, it fell into disuse, but has been partially restored since the mid-20th century for leisure use. However, the section through Chesterfield remains isolated from the rest of the waterway network.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter and local TV transmitter situated north of the town.

Radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Greatest Hits Radio North Derbyshire (formerly Peak FM), Hits Radio South Yorkshire and the local internet radio stations: S41 Radio, Elastic FM, Chesterfield Radio and Spire Radio.

==Religious sites==
Chesterfield is perhaps best known for the crooked spire of its Church of Saint Mary and All Saints and is why the local football team is known as &quot;The Spireites&quot;.

The spire is twisted 45 degrees and leans from its true centre. Folklore recounts that a Bolsover blacksmith mis-shod the Devil, who leapt over the spire in pain, knocking it out of shape. Realistically, the lean has been ascribed to an absence of skilled craftsmen just 12 years after the Black Death, the use of unseasoned timber or insufficient cross-bracing. Another explanation is that it was caused by heat expansion after the 17th-century addition of 33 tons of lead sheeting to the spire, resting on 14th-century bracing not designed to carry such weight.

The tower on which the spire sits contains ten bells cast in 1947 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London, replacing a previous ring. The heaviest weighs .

Also in Chesterfield is the Annunciation Church, founded by the Jesuits in 1854 and designed by Joseph Hansom.

Alderman T P Wood, Mayor of Chesterfield in 1886 proposed that local land be acquired by the Local Board to create a public park for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. It officially opened in 1893. The park includes a cricket field, pavilion, lake, conservatory, bandstand, and miniature railway.

<doc id="148951" wikidata="Q1282114" url="?curid=148951" title="Speech disorder">
<text>Speech disorders, impairments, or impediments, are a type of communication disorder in which normal speech is disrupted. This can mean fluency disorders like stuttering, cluttering or lisps. Someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered mute. Speech skills are vital to social relationships and learning, and delays or disorders that relate to developing these skills can impact individuals function. For many children and adolescents, this can present as issues with academics. Speech disorders affect roughly 11.5% of the US population, and 5% of the primary school population. Speech is a complex process that requires precise timing, nerve and muscle control, and as a result is susceptible to impairments. A person who has a stroke, an accident or birth defect may have speech and language problems.

==Classification==
There are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of a speech disorder and the proper treatment or therapy:
# Sounds the patient can produce
## Phonemic – can be produced easily; used meaningfully and constructively
## Phonetic – produced only upon request; not used consistently, meaningfully, or constructively; not used in connected speech
# Stimulate sounds
## Easily stimulated
## Stimulate after demonstration and probing (i.e. with a tongue depressor)
# Cannot produce the sound
## Cannot be produced voluntarily
## No production ever observed

===Types of disorder===
* Apraxia of speech may result from stroke or progressive illness, and involves inconsistent production of speech sounds and rearranging of sounds in a word (&quot;potato&quot; may become &quot;topato&quot; and next &quot;totapo&quot;). Production of words becomes more difficult with effort, but common phrases may sometimes be spoken spontaneously without effort.
* Cluttering, a speech and fluency disorder characterized primarily by a rapid rate of speech, which makes speech difficult to understand.
* Developmental verbal dyspraxia also known as childhood apraxia of speech. 
* Dysarthria is a weakness or paralysis of speech muscles caused by damage to the nerves or brain. Dysarthria is often caused by strokes, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, ALS, head or neck injuries, surgical accident, or cerebral palsy.
* Aphasia
* Dysprosody is an extremely rare neurological speech disorder. It is characterized by alterations in intensity, in the timing of utterance segments, and in rhythm, cadence, and intonation of words. The changes to the duration, the fundamental frequency, and the intensity of tonic and atonic syllables of the sentences spoken, deprive an individual&#x27;s particular speech of its characteristics. The cause of dysprosody is usually associated with neurological pathologies such as brain vascular accidents, cranioencephalic traumatisms, and brain tumors.
* Muteness is the complete inability to speak.
* Speech sound disorders involve difficulty in producing specific speech sounds (most often certain consonants, such as /s/ or /r/), and are subdivided into articulation disorders (also called phonetic disorders) and phonemic disorders. Articulation disorders are characterized by difficulty learning to produce sounds physically. Phonemic disorders are characterized by difficulty in learning the sound distinctions of a language, so that one sound may be used in place of many. However, it is not uncommon for a single person to have a mixed speech sound disorder with both phonemic and phonetic components.
*Stuttering (AKA “Dysphemia”) affects approximately 1% of the adult population.
* Voice disorders are impairments, often physical, that involve the function of the larynx or vocal resonance.

==Causes==
In some cases the cause is unknown. However, there are various known causes of speech impairments, such as hearing loss, neurological disorders, brain injury, an increase in mental strain, constant bullying, intellectual disability, substance use disorder, physical impairments such as cleft lip and palate, and vocal abuse or misuse. After strokes, there is known to be a higher incidence of apraxia of speech, which is a disorder affecting neurological pathways involved with speech. Poor motor function is also suggested to be highly associated with speech disorders, especially in children. Hereditary causes have also been suggested, as many times children of individuals with speech disorders will develop them as well. 20-40% individuals with a family history of a specific language impairment are likely to be diagnosed, whereas only 4% of the population overall is likely to be diagnosed. There are also language disorders that are known to be genetic, such as hereditary ataxia, which can cause slow and unclear speech.

==Treatment==

Many of these types of disorders can be treated by speech therapy, but others require medical attention by a doctor in phoniatrics. Other treatments include correction of organic conditions and psychotherapy.

In the United States, school-age children with a speech disorder are often placed in special education programs. Children who struggle to learn to talk often experience persistent communication difficulties in addition to academic struggles. More than 700,000 of the students served in the public schools&#x27; special education programs in the 2000–2001 school year were categorized as having a speech or language impairment. This estimate does not include children who have speech and language impairments secondary to other conditions such as deafness&quot;. Many school districts provide the students with speech therapy during school hours, although extended day and summer services may be appropriate under certain circumstances.

Patients will be treated in teams, depending on the type of disorder they have. A team can include speech–language pathologists, specialists, family doctors, teachers, and family members.
==Social effects==
Having a speech disorder can have negative social effects, especially among young children. Those with a speech disorder can be targets of bullying because of their disorder. This bullying can result in decreased self-esteem. Religion and culture also play a large role in the social effects of speech disorders. For example, in many African countries like Kenya cleft palates are largely considered to be caused by a curse from God. This can cause people with cleft palates to not receive care in early childhood, and end in rejection from society. For those with speech disorders, listeners reactions are often negative, which may correlate negative effects to self-esteem. It has also been shown that adults tend to view individuals with stutters in more negative ways than those without them.

==Language disorders==

Language disorders are usually considered distinct from speech disorders, although they are often used synonymously.

Speech disorders refer to problems in producing the sounds of speech or with the quality of voice, where language disorders are usually an impairment of either understanding words or being able to use words and do not have to do with speech production.

<text>The Porsche Cayenne is a series of automobiles manufactured by the German company Porsche since 2002. It is a luxury crossover SUV, and has been described as both a full-sized and a mid-sized vehicle. The first generation was known within Porsche as the Type 9PA (955/957) or E1. It was the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche&#x27;s first off-road variant vehicle since its Super and Junior tractors of the 1950s, as well as the first production Porsche with four doors. Since 2014, the Cayenne has been sold alongside a smaller Porsche SUV, the Macan.

The second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A or E2) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March. The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors, and electronics with the Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. It received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid version with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show. Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The third generation (Type 9YA or E3) was unveiled in 2017 in the German city of Stuttgart.


== First generation (E1 9PA; 2002) ==
The original Porsche Cayenne entered into the global market to a mixed reception, but it proved itself to have excellent performance for an SUV and had comparably good handling as well as powerful engines. The lineup initially consisted of the V8-powered Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo. Later in the model cycle, VR6 and diesel-powered versions joined the lineup. In the eight model years of the E1 generation, a total of 276,652 units were produced. The name Cayenne was coined by Manfred Gotta.

The base model Cayenne is powered by a 3.2-L VR6 engine producing . The intake manifold is unique to Porsche, but otherwise the engine is largely the same as the VW engine. Acceleration from is 9.1 seconds with the manual transmission and 9.7 seconds with the Tiptronic S.
===Cayenne S===
The S in the 955 pre-facelift 9PA is powered by a 4.5L V8 engine with a wet-sump lubrication system and variable valve timing. It produces and of torque. Acceleration from takes 6.9 seconds and the top speed is .

Introduced only for 2006 (as a pre-GTS concept), the Cayenne S Titanium Edition was a one-year exclusive, limited production SUV featuring a lightweight steel body, featuring an aluminium hood (lighter than the one equipped on the Cayenne S), titanium-painted accented body parts, side lower rocker body panels, Sport-Quad Tip Exhaust chrome tailpipes, 19&quot; titanium painted alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlights, two-tone interior upholstery, Porsche PCM 2.0 w/ trip computer navigation, MP3 audio and Bose cabin surround sound. Under the hood, improvements included sport-tuned suspension, an aerodynamic body package, low-range transfer case, locking differential and a 6-speed automatic Tiptronic S transmission. The Cayenne S Titanium Edition is powered by the same 4.5L V8 engine that powered the Cayenne S - still producing and of torque. Acceleration is even quicker than the regular Cayenne S from at 6.2 seconds and the top speed is .

In the updated 9PA chassis 957 Cayenne S introduced between 2008 and 2010, it featured a direct fuel injection (DFI) 4.8L V8 engine which produces and of torque. It had a 0– time of 6.6 seconds with a top speed of 250 km/h. The updated V8 engine featured VarioCam Plus which combine variable valve timing with two-stage valve lift on the inlet side.

===Cayenne GTS===
The E1 Gran-Turismo Sport (GTS) was only offered in the updated 9PA chassis between the year 2008 and 2010. It was the first Porsche of the modern era to feature the GTS abbreviation nameplate in its model designation. Its sporty chassis had been specially developed only for this model variant and it was powered with a performance tuned 4.8 L V8. It also featured a lowered sport suspension, sports exhaust system and high performance wheels as standard. It was much lighter than a normal Cayenne and had an aerodynamic wide body kit standard from factory. The Porsche Cayenne GTS had a 0– time of 6.1 seconds with a top speed of 253 km/h. A six-speed manual transmission was also offered in the GTS.

===Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S===

The first-generation 9PA Cayenne Turbo had , and can accelerate from 0– in 5.6 seconds. A Turbo S version was built in 2006 to compete with the Mercedes-Benz ML 63 AMG. The Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S include a low-range case, a locking differential, and height-adjustable, off-road suspension. The Turbo S is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.5 L V8 that produces and of torque; Acceleration from 0– takes 5.0 seconds and the top speed is ; It features a six-speed automatic Tiptronic S transmission.In 2008 an updated 9PA Turbo model, featuring a larger direct fuel injection 4.8-L V8 engine, was revealed at the Beijing Auto Show. It produces more power, and can accelerate from 0– in 4.9 seconds. Also revealed with the new Turbo, was a new Turbo S model. Acceleration from 0– for that car takes 4.7 seconds and it can be had with optional ceramic composite brakes.

===Cayenne Diesel===
The original Cayenne Diesel was only available in the facelift 9PA chassis, powered by a 3.0-L V6 VW TDI engine, since February 2009. The engine is rated at and of torque. The car was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. The diesel can accelerate from 0– in 8.2 seconds.

===Cayenne S Transsyberia===
The Cayenne S Transsyberia was originally a racing vehicle designed for the Transsyberia rally, in which only 285 were built.

The street version was later built to commemorate Porsche&#x27;s victory in the Transsyberia rally. It is only available in the 9PA chassis with the direct-inject 4.8-L V8 from the Cayenne GTS. Sales began in January 2009, with a targeted production run of 600 road vehicles worldwide (285 for North America), but far fewer were actually built (102 for USA, 17 for Canada including 3 which were 6 speed manual).

===Cayenne GTS Porsche Design Edition 3 (2010)===
In May 2009, a limited edition version based on the Cayenne GTS was introduced, designed by Porsche Design Studio and included a Porsche Design chronograph Type P&#x27;6612. Production was limited to 1000 units worldwide.

=== Cayenne Concepts ===
In April 2022, Porsche unveiled a concept open-top Cayenne for the first time to the public as a part of the 20th anniversary of the Porsche Cayenne. The Cayenne was proving successful, so in December 2002 Porsche designers wanted to assess the viability of more Cayenne body styles. They came up 3 alternate body shapes: a coupe style SUV, a convertible SUV and a longer wheelbase 3 row SUV. Porsche designers decided to continue with the idea of a convertible SUV, creating a two-door, non-drivable (due to a lack of strengthening added to the chassis to prevent the car from buckling without a fixed roof) convertible Cayenne that had two alternate designs on the rear. Additionally, its doors were 20 cm longer than the standard Cayenne and it had a shorter A-Pillar than the standard model. Due to the concerns surrounding head room, boot space and rear design the idea was scrapped. However, the coupe style SUV lead to the modern Cayenne Coupe. Moreover, the idea of a longer wheelbase 3 row SUV likely led to the large Porsche SUV which is currently in the prototype stages.

== Second generation (E2 92A; 2010) ==

The second-generation Porsche Cayenne 92A went on sale in April–May 2010 as a 2011 model, with an official debut at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. In preparation for the unveiling, the Cayenne production facility in Leipzig, Germany, closed in December 2009 to commence factory retooling for the new model, a process that took two to three months.

The 92A Porsche Cayenne was slightly larger than its predecessors, but featured a more slanted rear window, less upright windshield, a more sloping roofline, door-mounted mirrors, smaller windows at the rear of the vehicle, headlights inspired by the Carrera GT, taillights that extend onto the car&#x27;s tailgate, LED daytime running lights and a vastly redesigned interior much like the Panamera. The 2011 Cayenne is almost lighter than the previous models due to removing the low-range transfer case making it slightly more fuel efficient than the previous lineup. More use of aluminium and magnesium also helped shave weight. Despite its lower stance, the new vehicle&#x27;s off-road capabilities have been retained without compromising the street performance-oriented layout and design. In addition to a diesel offering, a hybrid version is available. Model year 2013–2016 diesel Porsche Cayennes are included in the Volkswagen emissions scandal.

Standard features of the 92A Porsche Cayenne included automatic air conditioning with dual-zone climate controls, interior air filter, tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, eight-way power front seats, outside-temperature indicator, and universal garage door opener in the base model. The Cayenne S adds a power sunroof and memory for the driver&#x27;s seat. The Cayenne GTS added an optional rearview camera, keyless access and start, and memory system. Finally, the most upscale Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S added a navigation system with voice recognition, optional four-zone climate controls, heated rear seats, premium sound system with six-disc CD changer.

The E2 Cayenne was powered by a 3.6-L VR6 engine producing , the Cayenne S features the same 4.8-L V8 in the Panamera S models producing and the Cayenne Turbo comes with Panamera Turbo&#x27;s 4.8 L twin turbo V8 producing . The Cayenne S Hybrid uses an Audi-sourced 3.0-L V6 engine producing , paired with a nickel metal hydride battery capable of , for a total of . A six-speed manual gearbox serves as the standard transmission system on the base Cayenne to 2014, with all other models featuring an eight-speed automatic (Tiptronic S) as standard equipment. The low-range transfer case found in the previous generation has been removed. All vehicles will feature about 10% less weight than their predecessors, 70 kg worth of standard equipment in excess of that found on the current model and a more heavily contoured rear bench.

Available Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active anti-roll bars, Adaptive air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM).

In September 2012 Porsche announced the Cayenne S Diesel. This model is fitted with the Audi 4.2 V8 TDI engine. In October 2012, Porsche confirmed the addition of a new Cayenne Turbo S.

In July 2014, Porsche launched a facelifted Cayenne range, with minor exterior alterations and new power-train options, including a plug-in E-Hybrid and downsizing of the S model&#x27;s 4.8-L V8 to a turbocharged 3.6-L V6.

===Hybrid===
At the IAA 2005, Porsche announced it would produce a hybrid version of the Cayenne before 2010 (Porsche Cayenne Hybrid). Two years later, at the IAA 2007, Porsche presented a functioning Cayenne Hybrid and demonstration model of the drivetrain.

Notable modifications to this car include an electric vacuum pump and hydraulic steering pump, allowing the car to function even when the engine is deactivated. A 288-volt nickel metal hydride battery is placed under the boot floor, occupying the space normally used for a spare tire.

The production version, called the &#x27;S&#x27; Hybrid, was launched in 2010, with a 3.0-L petrol V6 linked with an electric motor to achieve emissions of 193 g/km. The S Hybrid was launched in the U.S. market in November 2010.

===Plug-in hybrid===
In July 2014, Porsche announced the launch of the Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range between under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard. The plug-in model displaced the Cayenne S Hybrid from the line up, and it is part of the revised range. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid is the first plug-in hybrid in the premium SUV segment, allowing Porsche to become the first automaker with three production plug-in hybrid models. Deliveries in Germany were scheduled to begin in October 2014. Sales in the U.S. began in November 2014.

;EPA fuel economy ratings
The following are the official EPA ratings of the Cayenne S E-Hybrid compared with the others models of the 2015 line up available in the U.S.:

===Guinness World Record===
On 1 May 2017, a 2017 Porsche Cayenne S Diesel set the Guinness World Record for heaviest aircraft pulled by a production car. The Cayenne towed a 265-ton Air France Airbus A380 to a distance of 42 meters, breaking the previous 2013 record of a Nissan Patrol towing a 170-ton Ilyushin Il-76 to a distance of 50 meters. After the attempt Porsche repeated the test using a petrol-powered Cayenne Turbo S with 800 Nm of torque, 50 Nm less than the S Diesel, in an effort to prove the Cayenne&#x27;s remarkable ability.

== Third generation (E3 9YA/9YB; 2017) ==

The third-generation Porsche Cayenne was revealed on August 29, 2017, set to be put on sale in 2019. It is built on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform shared with several other luxury crossover SUVs produced by Volkswagen Group, including the Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, Audi Q8, Bentley Bentayga, and Lamborghini Urus.

For this generation, the Cayenne no longer shares the door design with the Volkswagen Touareg. According to Stephan Lenschow, the Cayenne body product manager, this allows Porsche to give the Cayenne a more &#x27;coke bottle&#x27; design. The Cayenne also received a redesigned front end with larger air intakes, more prominent creases along the bonnet, and a lower roofline to align its styling with the Porsche 911.

The wheelbase remains unchanged from the previous generation, but Porsche increased the Cayenne&#x27;s overall length slightly by about . The height is slightly lowered by and the coefficient of drag is rated at 0.35.

Despite a small increase in length, the third-generation Cayenne is lighter by around , depending on the configuration, due to the use of a lighter chassis. Aluminium is used extensively throughout the vehicle, including in the doors, roof, hood, rear hatch, as well as its body in white. The ratio of aluminium to high-strength steel is roughly 50-50, according to Lenschow. A lighter lithium-ion polymer starter battery that saves also contributes to its weight distribution, which in base configuration is nearly balanced with approximately 55 percent front and 45 percent rear.

All engine options of the third-generation Cayenne are turbocharged, while diesel engines are no longer offered. All Cayenne models in this generation are equipped with an updated eight-speed &quot;Tiptronic S&quot; transmission that is claimed to provide quicker shifts than before.

Porsche offers optional Porsche Surface Coated Brakes (PSCB), which consist of a cast-iron disc with 70 micrometers of tungsten-carbide coating. According to Karl Heess, Porsche director for product line SUV, PSCB reduce brake dust by as much as 50 percent over conventional iron brake discs), and extend the life of the disc by up to 35 percent. It is more expensive than iron discs while still being 50 percent less expensive than the ceramic brake option. Other innovations in this generation include staggered (different width) front and rear tires, and optional rear-axle steering to reduce the turning radius.

In the first quarter of 2022, Porsche sales declined by 5%, but the Cayenne remained the manufacturer&#x27;s best-selling car.

=== Cayenne Coupé ===
A model with a more rakish roofline dubbed the Cayenne Coupé became available in 2019. It was revealed during the Shanghai Auto Show in April 2019. At launch, there were two sub-models, the Cayenne Coupé and Cayenne Turbo Coupé.

The Cayenne Coupé is extensively reworked from the standard model, featuring a shallower front windshield and narrower A-pillar. The roof is lowered by , while new rear door panels and updated fenders extended the vehicle width by . The drag coefficient is rated at 0.34, which is 0.1 lower than the regular model. Every Cayenne Coupé is equipped with standard fixed-glass panoramic roof, while an optional contoured carbon roof is also available as an option.

=== Variants ===
At its introduction in August 2017, Porsche released two versions of the third-generation Cayenne, which are base and Cayenne S. The Cayenne Turbo was released a month later. The Cayenne S used the EA839 2.9 liter twin turbo V6 engine, with larger brake rotors and calipers compared with the base model.

==== Cayenne Turbo ====
In September 2017, Porsche added the Cayenne Turbo to the line-up. Introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the Cayenne Turbo is powered with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 rated at and of torque. Porsche claimed a acceleration figure of 4.1 seconds, or 3.9 seconds with the Sport Chrono package, and a top speed of The Porsche Surface Coated Brakes (PSCB) is a standard equipment.

==== Cayenne E-Hybrid ====
In May 2018, Porsche introduced the Cayenne E-Hybrid. Sharing the same plug-in hybrid system with the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid, the variant uses a 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine with an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic gearbox rated at and of torque. Porsche claims a time of 5.0 seconds and top speed of . The all-electric range is rated by Porsche at . It takes 7.8 hours to fully charge the 14.1 kWh battery with a 230-volt connection, or 2.3 hours if an optional 7.2 kW on-board charger is fitted.

==== Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid ====
In August 2019, the Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid was released for both regular and Coupé body styles. A plug-in hybrid model, it uses a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine rated at and a electric motor for a combined total of and of torque. A 14.1-kWh lithium-ion battery is used, and was said to offer 30 percent more capacity than the battery used in previous generation plug-in hybrid Cayenne models. Charging time is quoted at 2.4 hours when connected to a 240-volt, 50-amp source. Porsche claimed a acceleration figure of 3.6 seconds with a top speed of . Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB), Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV+), and Sport Chrono Package are standard equipment for the model.

==== Cayenne GTS ====
In June 2020, Porsche introduced the Cayenne GTS and Cayenne GTS Coupé for the 2021 model year, after a two-year hiatus. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 shared with the Panamera GTS, which is rated at and of torque. The new models are capable of reaching in 4.8 seconds or 4.5 seconds using Performance Start, which is included in the optional Sport Chrono Package (standard on Coupé). Sport Design package, 21-inch RS Spyder Design wheels, and Sport Exhaust are included as standard equipment.

==== Cayenne Turbo GT ====

In June 2021, Porsche introduced the Cayenne Turbo GT version. Based on the Cayenne Coupé, it uses a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine which Porsche claims to produce and claimed acceleration time in 3.3 seconds. It is equipped with 22-inch wheels with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres. Ride height is lowered by , while overall vehicle height is lower.

===2023 facelift===
In April 2023, the Cayenne was given a mid-cycle refresh for the 2024 model year. Notable changes include a new dashboard layout, similar to that of the Taycan, a fully digital 12.6-inch gauge cluster, and minor exterior restyling modifications for the hood, headlights, bumpers, fenders, and trunk.

Matrix LED headlamps are now equipped as standard equipment across the range, while HD Matrix LED units are optional. The HD Matrix LED features two high-definition modules and more than 32 000 pixels per headlamp, and the pixel accuracy of the headlamp units enables the selective blocking out of parts of the high beam.

The powertrains were also upgraded, with the base 3.0-litre V6 engine power output increasing by and of torque to produce and . The Cayenne S gained a V8 engine which it lost since the release of the third-generation Cayenne. It is a 4.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine that produces and of torque, representing an increase of output of and over the previous Cayenne S that is powered by a 2.9 dm3 twin-turbocharged petrol V6.

The electric motor from the E-Hybrid plug-in hybrid variant was increased from , and the battery increased to , up from previously, offering a pure electric driving range of up to 90 km on the WLTP test cycle.

Revisions to the chassis for this refreshed model included revised dampers with two-valve technology for separate compression and rebound sections, which Porsche claimed will help offer a wider range of performance between ride comfort and handling.

===Records===
In June 2021, a Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT lapped 7:38:925 at Nürburgring Nordschleife. The car was driven by test driver Lars Kern.

==Mechanical issues==
The Porsche Cayenne is known for some mechanical issues. This includes the failure of the center drive shaft carrier bearing. Cayenne engines using Lokasil or Alusil engine blocks, with exception of the VW-based VR6 six-cylinder engine which has a cast iron block, can suffer from cylinder bore scoring as well. Early V8 Cayenne models came equipped with plastic coolant pipes that would crack and fail, possibly causing the engine to overheat. Subsequent Cayenne S and Turbo engines were fitted with upgraded aluminum coolant pipes to rectify this issue. 958 Cayenne models except Hybrid and V6 Diesel suffer with transfer case problems, and Porsche issued a 10-year warranty on 958.1 (2011–2014) and a 7-year warranty on 958.2 (2015–2018), both with unlimited mileage.

== In popular culture ==
In 2021, a Chinese manufacturer introduced the Changan Uni-K, which bears a striking resemblance to the Porsche Cayenne, especially from the rear and side profiles. The car was sold for approximately 21,000 euros.

<doc id="148956" wikidata="Q275837" url="?curid=148956" title="Sports Illustrated">
<text>Sports Illustrated (SI) is an American sports magazine first published in August 1954. Founded by Stuart Scheftel, it was the first magazine with a circulation of over one million to win the National Magazine Award for General Excellence twice. It is also known for its annual swimsuit issue, which has been published since 1964, and has spawned other complementary media works and products.

Owned until 2018 by Time Inc., it was sold to Authentic Brands Group (ABG) following the sale of Time Inc. to Meredith Corporation. The Arena Group (formerly theMaven, Inc.) was subsequently awarded a 10-year license to operate the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;–branded editorial operations, while ABG licenses the brand for other non-editorial ventures and products. In January 2024, The Arena Group missed a quarterly licensing payment, leading ABG to terminate the company&#x27;s license. Arena, in turn, laid off the publication&#x27;s editorial staff.

In March 2024, ABG licensed the publishing rights to Minute Media in a 10-year deal, jointly announcing that the print and digital editions would be revived by rehiring some of the editorial staff.

In May 2024, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; failed to deliver a print copy of the publication for the month to its subscribers for the first time in the magazine&#x27;s 70-year history, according to the New York Post’s Josh Kosman (May 17, 2024). 
==History==
===Establishment===
There were two previous magazines named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; before the current magazine was launched on August 9, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with a target market of sportsmen. He published the magazine monthly from 1936 to 1942. The magazine focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1949 and this version lasted six issues before closing. Dell&#x27;s version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against &quot;Sports&quot; and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s, these magazines were monthly, which prevented them from cover current events. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that &quot;Time&quot; patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a sports fan, decided the time was right.

Luce and editors of the planned magazine met in 1954 at Pine Lakes Country Club, the oldest golf course in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The course&#x27;s pro shop has a plaque mentioning the meetings, and the plaque also states that the first issue was given to the course. It is on display there. Myrtle Beach Area Golf Course Owners Association executive director Tracy Conner credits the magazine with making Myrtle Beach a golf destination.

Many at Time-Life scoffed at Luce&#x27;s idea; in his Pulitzer Prize–winning biography, &quot;Luce and His Empire&quot;, W. A. Swanberg wrote that the company&#x27;s intellectuals dubbed the proposed magazine &quot;Muscle&quot;, &quot;Jockstrap&quot;, and &quot;Sweat Socks&quot;. Launched on August 9, 1954, it was not profitable (and would not be for 12 years) and not particularly well-run at first, but Luce&#x27;s timing was good. The popularity of spectator sports in the United States was about to explode, and that popularity came to be driven largely by three things: economic prosperity, television, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

The early issues of the magazine seemed caught between two opposing views of its audience. Much of the subject matter was directed at upper-class activities such as yachting, polo and safaris, but upscale would-be advertisers were unconvinced that sports fans were a significant part of their market.

===Color printing===
In 1965, offset printing began. This allowed the color pages of the magazine to be printed overnight, not only producing crisper and brighter images, but also finally enabling the editors to merge the best color with the latest news. By 1967, the magazine was printing 200 pages of &quot;fast color&quot; a year; in 1983, &quot;SI&quot; became the first American full-color newsweekly. An intense rivalry developed between photographers, particularly Walter Iooss and Neil Leifer, to get a decisive cover shot that would be on newsstands and in mailboxes only a few days later.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, during Gilbert Rogin&#x27;s term as Managing Editor, the feature stories of Frank Deford became the magazine&#x27;s anchor. &quot;Bonus pieces&quot; on Pete Rozelle, Woody Hayes, Bear Bryant, Howard Cosell and others became some of the most quoted sources about these figures, and Deford established a reputation as one of the best writers of the time.

===Expansion of sports coverage===
After more than a decade of steady losses, the magazine&#x27;s fortunes finally turned around in the 1960s when Andre Laguerre became its managing editor. A European correspondent for Time, Inc., who later became chief of the Time-Life news bureaux in Paris and London (for a time he ran both simultaneously), Laguerre attracted Henry Luce&#x27;s attention in 1956 with his singular coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, which became the core of &quot;SI&quot;&#x27;s coverage of those games. In May 1956, Luce brought Laguerre to New York to become the assistant managing editor of the magazine. He was named managing editor in 1960, and he more than doubled the circulation by instituting a system of departmental editors, redesigning the internal format, and inaugurating the unprecedented use in a news magazine of full-color photographic coverage of the week&#x27;s sports events. He was also one of the first to sense the rise of national interest in professional football.

Laguerre also instituted the innovative concept of one long story at the end of every issue, which he called the &quot;bonus piece&quot;. These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford, who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, &quot;He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that he made you want to please him, but he wanted you to do that by writing in your own distinct way.&quot;

Laguerre is also credited with the conception and creation of the annual &quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot;, which quickly became, and remains, the most popular issue each year.

In 1986, co-owned property HBO/Cannon Video had inked a pact to produce video versions of the magazine for $20 on the sell-through market, running just 30–45 minutes on the tape.

In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications to form the media conglomerate Time Warner. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; acquired FanNation.com in 2007 to compete in the Web 2.0 market; the site aggregated sports news and allowed user-generated content. In 2014, Time Inc. was spun off from Time Warner.

=== Sale to Authentic Brands Group, Maven ===
In 2018, the magazine was sold to Meredith Corporation by means of its acquisition of parent company Time Inc.. Meredith, however, planned to sell &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; due to not aligning with its lifestyle properties. Authentic Brands Group announced its intent to acquire &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; for $110 million the next year, stating that it would leverage its brand and other assets for new opportunities that &quot;stay close to the DNA and the heritage of the brand.&quot; Upon the announcement, Meredith would enter into a licensing agreement to continue as publisher of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; editorial operations for at least the next two years. In June 2019, the rights to publish the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; editorial operations were licensed to the digital media company theMaven, Inc. under a 10-year contract, with Ross Levinsohn as CEO. The company had backed a bid by Junior Bridgeman to acquire &quot;SI&quot;. In preparation for the closure of the sale to ABG and Maven, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that there would be &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; employee layoffs, which was confirmed after the acquisition had closed.

In October 2019, editor-in-chief Chris Stone stepped down. Later that month, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; announced its hiring of veteran college sports writer Pat Forde. In January 2020, it announced an editorial partnership with &quot;The Hockey News&quot;, focusing on syndication of NHL-related coverage.&quot;&quot; In 2021, it announced a similar partnership with &quot;Morning Read&quot; for golf coverage, with its website being merged into that of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. It also partnered with iHeartMedia to distribute and co-produce podcasts.

In September 2021, Maven, now known as The Arena Group, acquired the New Jersey–based sports news website &quot;The Spun&quot;, which would integrate into &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. In 2022, ABG announced several non-editorial ventures involving the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; brand, including an apparel line for JCPenney &quot;inspired by iconic moments in sports&quot; (it was not the brand&#x27;s first foray into clothing, as it launched a branded swimsuit line in conjunction with its &quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot; in 2018), and resort hotels in Orlando and Punta Cana. In September 2023, it delved deeper into the resort world through a new partnership with &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;.

On November 27, 2023, &quot;Futurism&quot; published an article alleging that &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was publishing AI-generated articles credited to authors who were also AI-generated; the latter practice apparently extended to their profile photos, which the website alleged were sourced from online marketplaces selling such photos. After &quot;Futurism&quot; reached out to The Arena Group, the magazine purportedly removed some of the implicated writers and republished their articles under other AI-generated authors with notes disclaiming its staff&#x27;s involvement. In response to the report, a spokesperson for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; claimed that the affected articles were product reviews written without the involvement of AI by AdVon Commerce, a third-party company who they claimed used pseudonyms to &quot;protect author privacy&quot; and had already severed ties with; meanwhile, writers and editors at the magazine sharply criticized the alleged practices.

On January 5, 2024, The Arena Group missed a $3.75 million quarterly licensing payment to Authentic Brands Group. Two weeks later, on January 19, Authentic Brands Group terminated its licensing agreement. As a result, The Arena Group fought back by announcing that it would lay off the entire &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; staff. In March 2024, Authentic Brands Group licensed the publishing rights to Minute Media in a 10-year deal, jointly announcing that the print and digital editions would be revived by rehiring some of the editorial staff. Minute converted the Fan Nation–branded team sites to &quot;On SI&quot;.

==Awards==
===American Sportswear Designer Award (ASDA Awards)===
In 1956, Sports Illustrated began presenting annual awards to fashion or clothing designers who had excelled in the field of sportswear/activewear. The first ASDAs of 1956, presented to Claire McCardell with a separate Designer of the Year award to Rudi Gernreich, were chosen following a vote of 200 American top retailers. The following year, the voting pool had increased to 400 fashion industry experts, including Dorothy Shaver and Stanley Marcus, when Sydney Wragge and Bill Atkinson received the awards. The Italian designer Emilio Pucci was the first non-American to receive the award in 1961. The awards were presented up until at least 1963, when Marc Bohan received the prize. Other winners include Jeanne S. Campbell, Bonnie Cashin, and Rose Marie Reid who formed the first all-women winning group in 1958.

===Performer of the Year===
Maya Moore of the WNBA&#x27;s Minnesota Lynx was the inaugural winner of the award in 2017.

===Sportsperson of the Year===

Since 1954, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has annually presented the Sportsperson of the Year award to &quot;the athlete or team whose performance that year most embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and achievement.&quot; Roger Bannister won the first-ever Sportsman of the Year award thanks to his record-breaking time of 3:59.4 for a mile, the first-ever time a mile had been run under four minutes. Both men and women have won the award, originally called &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; and renamed &quot;Sportswoman of the Year&quot; or &quot;Sportswomen of the Year&quot; when applicable; it is currently known as &quot;Sportsperson of the Year.&quot;

The 2017 winners of the award are Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt and Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve. Both athletes were recognized for their efforts in helping rebuild the city of Houston following Hurricane Harvey in addition to Altuve being a part of the Astros team that won the franchise&#x27;s first World Series in 2017.

The 2018 winners are the Golden State Warriors as a team for winning their third NBA Title in four years.

The 2021 winner is Tom Brady for his Super Bowl 55 win.

In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Muhammad Ali the Sportsman of the Century at the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s 20th Century Sports Awards in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden.

===&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award===
In 2015, the magazine renamed its Sportsman Legacy Award to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. The annual award was originally created in 2008 and honors former &quot;sports figures who embody the ideals of sportsmanship, leadership and philanthropy as vehicles for changing the world.&quot; Ali first appeared on the magazine&#x27;s cover in 1963 and went on to be featured on numerous covers during his storied career. His widow, Lonnie Ali, is consulted when choosing a recipient. In 2017, football quarterback Colin Kaepernick was honored with the Award, which was presented by Beyoncé. In 2018, WWE professional wrestler John Cena was honored with the award.
