<text>Sexual fetishism or erotic fetishism is a sexual fixation on an object or a body part. The object of interest is called the fetish; the person who has a fetish is a fetishist. A sexual fetish may be regarded as a mental disorder if it causes significant psychosocial distress for the person or has detrimental effects on important areas of their life. Sexual arousal from a particular body part can be further classified as partialism.

While medical definitions restrict the term &quot;sexual fetishism&quot; to objects or body parts, &quot;fetish&quot; can, in common discourse, also refer to sexual interest in specific activities, peoples, types of people, substances, or situations.

== Definitions ==
In common parlance, the word &quot;fetish&quot; is used to refer to any sexually arousing stimuli, not all of which meet the medical criteria for fetishism. This broader usage of &quot;fetish&quot; covers parts or features of the body (including obesity and body modifications), objects, situations and activities (such as smoking or BDSM). Paraphilias such as urophilia, necrophilia and coprophilia have been described as fetishes.

Originally, most medical sources defined &quot;fetishism&quot; as a sexual interest in non-living objects, body parts or secretions. The publication of the DSM-III in 1980 changed that, by excluding arousal from body parts in its diagnostic criteria for fetishism. In 1987, the revised DSM-III-R introduced a new diagnosis for body part arousal called &quot;partialism&quot;. The DSM-IV retained this distinction. Martin Kafka argued that partialism should be merged into fetishism because of overlap between the two conditions. The DSM-5 subsequently did so, in 2013.

==Types==
In a review of 48 cases of clinical fetishism in 1983, fetishes included clothing (58.3%), rubber and rubber items (22.9%), footwear (14.6%), body parts (14.6%), leather (10.4%), and soft materials or fabrics (6.3%).
A 2007 study counted members of Internet discussion groups with the word &quot;fetish&quot; in their name. Of the groups about body parts or features, 47% belonged to groups about feet (podophilia), 9% about body fluids (including urophilia, scatophilia, lactaphilia, menophilia, mucophilia), 9% about body size, 7% about hair (hair fetish), and 5% about muscles (muscle worship). Less popular groups focused on navels (navel fetishism), legs, body hair, mouth, and nails, among other things. Of the groups about clothing, 33% belonged to groups about clothes worn on the legs or buttocks (such as stockings or skirts), 32% about footwear (shoe fetishism), 12% about underwear (underwear fetishism), and 9% about whole-body wear such as jackets. Less popular object groups focused on headwear, stethoscopes, wristwear, pacifiers, and diapers (diaper fetishism).

Erotic asphyxiation is the use of choking to increase the pleasure in sex. The fetish also includes an individualized part that involves choking oneself during the act of masturbation, which is known as auto-erotic asphyxiation. This usually involves a person being connected and strangled by a homemade device that is tight enough to give them pleasure but not tight enough to suffocate them to death. This is dangerous due to the issue of hyperactive pleasure seeking which can result in strangulation when there is no one to help if the device gets too tight and strangles the user.

Devotism involves being attracted to disability or body modifications on another person that are the result of amputation for example. Devotism is only a sexual fetish when the person who has the fetish considers the amputated body part on another person the object of sexual interest.

== Cause ==

Fetishism usually becomes evident during puberty, but may develop prior to that. No single cause for fetishism has been conclusively established.

Some explanations invoke classical conditioning. In several experiments, men have been conditioned to show arousal to stimuli like boots, geometric shapes or penny jars by pairing these cues with conventional erotica. According to John Bancroft, conditioning alone cannot explain fetishism, because it does not result in fetishism for most people. He suggests that conditioning combines with some other factor, such as an abnormality in the sexual learning process.

Theories of sexual imprinting propose that humans learn to recognize sexually desirable features and activities during childhood. Fetishism could result when a child is imprinted with an overly narrow or incorrect concept of a sex object. Imprinting seems to occur during the child&#x27;s earliest experiences with arousal and desire, and is based on &quot;an egocentric evaluation of salient reward- or pleasure-related characteristics that differ from one individual to another.&quot;

Neurological differences may play a role in some cases. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran observed that the region processing sensory input from the feet lies immediately next to the region processing genital stimulation, and suggested an accidental link between these regions could explain the prevalence of foot fetishism. In one unusual case, an anterior temporal lobectomy relieved an epileptic man&#x27;s fetish for safety pins.

Various explanations have been put forth for the rarity of female fetishists. Most fetishes are visual in nature, and males are thought to be more sexually sensitive to visual stimuli. Roy Baumeister suggests that male sexuality is unchangeable, except for a brief period in childhood during which fetishism could become established, while female sexuality is fluid throughout life.

== Diagnosis ==
Under the DSM-5, fetishism is sexual arousal from nonliving objects or specific nongenital body parts, excluding clothes used for cross-dressing (as that falls under transvestic fetishism) and sex toys that are designed for genital stimulation. In order to be diagnosed as &quot;fetishistic disorder&quot;, the arousal must persist for at least six months and cause significant psychosocial distress or impairment in important areas of their life. In the DSM-IV, sexual interest in body parts was distinguished from fetishism under the name partialism (diagnosed as Paraphilia NOS), but it was merged with fetishistic disorder for the DSM-5.

The ReviseF65 project campaigned for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)’s fetish-related diagnoses to be abolished completely to avoid stigmatizing fetishists. On 18 June 2018, the WHO (World Health Organization) published ICD-11, in which fetishism and fetishistic transvestism (cross-dressing for sexual pleasure) are now removed as psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, discrimination against fetish-having and BDSM individuals is considered inconsistent with human rights principles endorsed by the United Nations and The World Health Organization.

== Treatment ==

According to the World Health Organization, fetishistic fantasies are common and should only be treated as a disorder when they impair normal functioning or cause distress. Goals of treatment can include elimination of criminal activity, reduction in reliance on the fetish for sexual satisfaction, improving relationship skills, reducing or removing arousal to the fetish altogether, or increasing arousal towards more acceptable stimuli. The evidence for treatment efficacy is limited and largely based on case studies, and no research on treatment for female fetishists exists.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is one popular approach. Cognitive behavioral therapists teach clients to identify and avoid antecedents to fetishistic behavior, and substitute non-fetishistic fantasies for ones involving the fetish. Aversion therapy and covert conditioning can reduce fetishistic arousal in the short term, but requires repetition to sustain the effect. Multiple case studies have also reported treating fetishistic behavior with psychodynamic approaches.

Antiandrogens may be prescribed to lower sex drive. Cyproterone acetate is the most commonly used antiandrogen, except in the United States, where it may not be available. A large body of literature has shown that it reduces general sexual fantasies. Side effects may include osteoporosis, liver dysfunction, and feminization. Case studies have found that the antiandrogen medroxyprogesterone acetate is successful in reducing sexual interest, but can have side effects including osteoporosis, diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, feminization, and weight gain. Some hospitals use leuprorelin and goserelin to reduce libido, and while there is presently little evidence for their efficacy, they have fewer side effects than other antiandrogens. A number of studies support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which may be preferable over antiandrogens because of their relatively benign side effects. Pharmacological agents are an adjunctive treatment which are usually combined with other approaches for maximum effect.

Relationship counselors may attempt to reduce dependence on the fetish and improve partner communication using techniques like sensate focusing. Partners may agree to incorporate the fetish into their activities in a controlled, time-limited manner, or set aside only certain days to practice the fetishism. If the fetishist cannot sustain an erection without the fetish object, the therapist might recommend orgasmic reconditioning or covert sensitization to increase arousal to normal stimuli (although the evidence base for these techniques is weak).

== Occurrence ==
The prevalence of fetishism is not known with certainty. Fetishism is more common in males. In a 2011 study, 30% of men reported fetishistic fantasies, and 24.5% had engaged in fetishistic acts. Of those reporting fantasies, 45% said the fetish was intensely sexually arousing. In a 2014 study, 26.3% of women and 27.8% of men acknowledged any fantasies about &quot;having sex with a fetish or non-sexual object&quot;. A content analysis of the sample&#x27;s favorite fantasies found that 14% of the male fantasies involved fetishism (including feet, nonsexual objects, and specific clothing), and 4.7% focused on a specific body part other than feet. None of the women&#x27;s favorite fantasies had fetishistic themes. Another study found that 28% of men and 11% of women reported fetishistic arousal (including feet, fabrics, and objects &quot;like shoes, gloves, or plush toys&quot;). 18% of men in a 1980 study reported fetishistic fantasies.

Fetishism to the extent that it is seen as a disorder appears to be rare, with less than 1% of general psychiatric patients presenting fetishism as their primary problem. It is also uncommon in forensic populations.

== History ==

The word &quot;fetish&quot; derives from the French , which comes from the Portuguese (&quot;spell&quot;), which in turn derives from the Latin (&quot;artificial&quot;) and (&quot;to make&quot;). A fetish is an object believed to have supernatural powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the attribution of inherent value or powers to an object. &quot;Fétichisme&quot; was first used in an erotic context by Alfred Binet in 1887. A slightly earlier concept was Julien Chevalier&#x27;s &quot;azoophilie&quot;.

=== Early perspectives on cause ===
Alfred Binet suspected fetishism was the pathological result of &quot;associations&quot;. He argued that, in certain vulnerable individuals, an emotionally rousing experience with the fetish object in childhood could lead to fetishism. Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis also believed that fetishism arose from associative experiences, but disagreed on what type of predisposition was necessary.

The sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld followed another line of thought when he proposed his theory of &quot;partial attractiveness&quot; in 1920. According to his argument, sexual attractiveness never originates in a person as a whole but always is the product of the interaction of individual features. He stated that nearly everyone had special interests and thus suffered from a healthy kind of fetishism, while only detaching and overvaluing of a single feature resulted in pathological fetishism. Today, Hirschfeld&#x27;s theory is often mentioned in the context of gender role specific behavior: females present sexual stimuli by highlighting body parts, clothes or accessories; males react to them.

Sigmund Freud believed that sexual fetishism in men derived from the unconscious fear of the mother&#x27;s genitals, from men&#x27;s universal fear of castration, and from a man&#x27;s fantasy that his mother had had a penis but that it had been cut off. He did not discuss sexual fetishism in women.

In 1951, Donald Winnicott presented his theory of &quot;transitional objects and phenomena&quot;, according to which childish actions like thumb sucking and objects like cuddly toys are the source of manifold adult behavior, amongst many others fetishism. He speculated that the child&#x27;s transitional object became sexualized.

== Other animals ==
Human fetishism has been compared to Pavlovian conditioning of sexual response in other animals. Sexual attraction to certain cues can be artificially induced in rats. Both male and female rats will develop a sexual preference for neutrally or even noxiously scented partners if those scents are paired with their early sexual experiences. Injecting morphine or oxytocin into a male rat during its first exposure to scented females has the same effect. Rats will also develop sexual preferences for the location of their early sexual experiences, and can be conditioned to show increased arousal in the presence of objects such as a plastic toy fish. One experiment found that rats which are made to wear a Velcro tethering jacket during their formative sexual experiences exhibit severe deficits in sexual performance when not wearing the jacket. Similar sexual conditioning has been demonstrated in gouramis, marmosets and Japanese quails.

Possible boot fetishism has been reported in two different primates from the same zoo. Whenever a boot was placed near the first, a common chimpanzee born in captivity, he would invariably stare at it, touch it, become erect, rub his penis against the boot, masturbate, and then consume his ejaculate. The second, a guinea baboon, would become erect while rubbing and smelling the boot, but not masturbate or touch it with his penis.

<doc id="156119" wikidata="Q662005" url="?curid=156119" title="Bernhard Hammer">
<text>Bernhard Hammer (3 March 1822, in Olten – 6 April 1907) was a Swiss politician.

He was the peloton leader of the Olten cadet military group.

In 1844, after studying sciences and law, Hammer settled in Solothurn as a lawyer and a notary, but he worked in Berlin, Zurich and Geneve too.

Elected president of the district court and 1856-68 as cantonal councillor of Solothurn, Hammer was soon regarded as leader of the old liberals and the opposition against the radical-liberal regiment of the Landammann Joseph Wilhelm Viktor Vigier von Steinbrugg. In the face of pure party interests, however, he shifted more to his military interests.

General Henri Dufour had already personally distinguished him in the Sonderbund campaign, and the General Staff officer Hammer was promoted to Major in 1858 and Supreme in 1862.

In 1861-68 he was chief instructor (chief of arms) of the artillery and afterwards until 1875 Switzerland envoy in Berlin.

He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 10 December 1875, and handed over office on 31 December 1890. He was affiliated with the Free Democratic Party.

H.&#x27;s reputation as an outstanding lawyer, military and diplomat paved the way for him into the Federal Council. He proved his worth in the reorganisation of the federal finances and the reorganisation of the previously unimportant Finance Department, in the question of the alcohol and banknote monopoly, in customs tariff negotiations and in the settlement of the Wohlgemuth affair. During his term of office, he also introduced the military duty substitute tax, created the Banknote Act and revised the Coinage Act. Moreover, H., who was intent on compensation, played an important mediating role behind the scenes in the settlement of the Kulturkampf.

After his resignation in 1890, Hammer served on the National Council for the Liberals until 1896. He owed this unusual career to his good health and financial and administrative skills. He also acted as the leading member of the Gotthard Railway&#x27;s Board of Directors.

He died in 1907.

== Summary ==
During his time in office he held the following departments:

*Department of Finance (1876–1878)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1879)
*Department of Finance (1880–1890)

He was President of the Confederation twice, in 1879 and 1889.

The portrait of Hammer was painted in 1889 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) and is signed Muller d&#x27;Uri. It was reproduced on the cover of the dust-wrapper and as the frontispiece of Eduard Fischer&#x27;s biography &#x27;Bundesrat Bernhard Hammer und Seine Zeit&#x27;, published in Solothurn in 1970. Its present whereabouts (2007) is unknown.

<doc id="156123" wikidata="Q735048" url="?curid=156123" title="Steve Waugh">
<text>Stephen Rodger Waugh (born 2 June 1965) is an Australian former international cricketer and twin brother of cricketer Mark Waugh. A right-handed batsman and a medium-pace bowler, Waugh is considered one of the greatest cricketers of all time. Waugh was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup. As Australian captain from 1997 to 2004, he led Australia to fifteen of their record sixteen consecutive Test wins, and to victory in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Waugh is considered the most successful Test captain in history with 41 victories and a winning ratio of 72%.

Born in New South Wales, where he began his first-class cricket career in 1984, he captained the Australian Test cricket team from 1999 to 2004, and was the most capped Test cricket player in history, with 168 appearances, until Sachin Tendulkar of India broke this record in 2010. Waugh was the world number 1 all-rounder in both Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket until back issues forced him to give up bowling. He concentrated only on batting and went on to become one of the leading batsmen of his time. He is one of only fourteen players to have scored more than 10,000 Test runs.

He was named Australian of the Year in 2004 for his philanthropic work, and inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in front of his home fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 2010.

Waugh has been included in a list of one hundred Australian Living Treasures by the National Trust of Australia, awarded the Order of Australia and the Australian Sports Medal. Known as an attacking and sometimes ruthlessly efficient captain, Described in 2003 as a &quot;cold-blooded, scientific&quot; leader, cricket columnist of &quot;The Times&quot; Simon Barnes noted that &quot;Waugh wants to defeat you personally.&quot; At the end of his final Test match, Waugh was carried by his teammates in a lap of honour around the Sydney Cricket Ground. In a fan poll conducted by the CA in 2017, he was named in the country&#x27;s best Ashes XI in the last 40 years.

==Early and personal life==

Born at Canterbury Hospital in Campsie, a suburb in South-Western Sydney on 2 June 1965, Waugh was one of twin boys born to Rodger and Beverley Waugh. He arrived four minutes before Mark, who went on to play cricket for Australia alongside him. Their father was a bank official and his mother was a teacher within the New South Wales Department of Education. The family settled in the South-Western Sydney suburb of Panania. The twins were later joined by two more brothers, Dean (who also went on to play first-class cricket in Australia) and Danny (who played first grade cricket for Sydney University Cricket Club). From an early age, the parents introduced their children to sport. By the age of six, the twins were playing organised soccer, tennis and cricket. In their first cricket match, the brothers were both dismissed for ducks.

The twins came from a sporting family. Their paternal grandfather Edward was a greyhound trainer. Raised in the North Coast town of Bangalow, Edward earned selection for the New South Wales Country team in rugby league. He was about to join Eastern Suburbs in the New South Wales Rugby League, but had to give up his career due to family reasons. Rodger was Edward&#x27;s only son and was promising tennis player, who was ranked eighth in Australia in his junior years and was the state champion at under-14 level. On the maternal side, Bev was a tennis player who won the under-14 singles at the South Australian Championships. Her eldest brother Dion Bourne was an opening batsman who played for Bankstown in Sydney Grade Cricket and remains the leading runscorer in the club&#x27;s history.

The twins made their first representative cricket team when they were selected for the Bankstown District under-10s at the age of eight. In 1976, the twins were the youngest ever to be selected in the New South Wales Primary Schools&#x27; soccer team. Playing for Panania Primary School, the twins swept their school to win the Umbro International Shield, a statewide knockout soccer competition, scoring all of their team&#x27;s three goals in the final. They were a key part of their school&#x27;s consecutive state cricket championships, and were part of the school tennis team that came second in the state in their final year. In his final year, Steve was the vice-captain of the cricket team and captained the state soccer team. The twins were instrumental in New South Wales winning the cricket carnival without a defeat, in one match combining in a partnership of 150.

By this time, the increasing time demands led to conflicts between the sports, and were in one case delisted from a team due to a conflict of commitments. The twins progressed to East Hills Boys Technology High School, which had a history of producing Australian international representatives in a number of sports.

Aged 13, the twins were invited by their uncle Bourne, then the captain of Bankstown&#x27;s first grade team, to trial for the club&#x27;s under-16 team for the Green Shield, and both were selected. Aged fourteen, both made their senior grade cricket debut in 1979–1980, playing in the Fourth XI. The twins broke into East Hills Boys First XI in the same season, and achieved the same level in soccer. In 1980–81 the brothers were elevated to the Third XI mid-season.

The brothers often formed a two-man team—in one match taking 16/85 between them. At the end of 1980, the twins were selected in the state under-16 team for the national carnival. The pair changed soccer teams to play in the reserve grade for Sydney Croatia in the state league being paid small amounts in the professional league. However, they quickly left as their cricket careers increasingly demanded more time.

The brothers were promoted to Bankstown&#x27;s Second XI, before being selected for the First XI in the 1982–83 season, aged 17, both making their debut against Western Suburbs. However, Waugh was dropped back to the Second XI, He was regarded as an aggressive player, something that characterised his early international career.

The twins finished high school at the end of 1983. In 1983–84, both were members of New South Wales Combined High Schools and the state under-19 team. Waugh made 170 against Great Public Schools. The brothers were then selected for Australia for the first time. They had been named in the national under-19 team to play a Test and ODI series against the touring Sri Lankan counterparts.

The under-19 series pitted several future international players against one another. Waugh scored 187 in the Third Test at Melbourne as Australia won 1–0. After leaving high school, Waugh enrolled in a teaching course, but withdrew after a few lectures. He made his maiden First XI century during the season with tons against Sydney University and Waverley.

At the start of the 1984–85 season, the brothers were included in the New South Wales state squad.

At the end of the season, the twins signed a contract to spend the Australian winter to play for Egerton Cricket Club in the Bolton League in Lancashire. Each club was allowed to have one professional; Steve was officially designated as such but would split the earnings with Mark. The twins were billeted with a local family.

However, during the year, an Australian rebel tour to South Africa was staged, breaking the boycott against the apartheid regime. Some players defected from the Australian Test team to play in South Africa. This resulted in Dave Gilbert being promoted to the national squad, forcing him to forfeit his Esso scholarship, which allowed him to play Second XI cricket in the County Championship. Steve was selected to replace Gilbert with Essex, leaving Mark as the lone professional.

In December 2017, his son, Austin Waugh, was named in Australia&#x27;s squad for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.

==Domestic career==
Waugh made his first-class debut for New South Wales (NSW) in 1984–85, batting at number nine and bowling medium pace. In the Sheffield Shield final that season, he scored 71 while batting with the tail to help NSW to victory.

==International career==
After ten first-class matches for NSW, he made his Test debut against India in the 1985–86 season, in the Second Test at Melbourne. He scored 13 and 5 and took 2/36 in the first innings. Failing to make a substantial score in the series (he tallied 26 runs in four innings), Waugh was retained for the subsequent tour of New Zealand. He had a good all-round match in the Second Test at Christchurch, making 74 and claiming 4/56, but his batting average was only 17.40 for the series, scoring 86 runs. Waugh had more success in the one-day format during the season. He made his debut against New Zealand at the MCG and took 1/13 and a catch. He did not bat as the match was washed out. He was retained for all of Australia&#x27;s 12 matches in the triangular tournament, scoring 266 runs at 38.00 with two half-centuries, including a top score of 81 in the Australia Day victory over India. He took seven wickets at 33.00. Waugh was retained for all four ODIs on the tour of New Zealand, scoring 111 runs at 27.75 and taking four wickets at 39.75.

The Australian selectors persisted with Waugh, and he toured India in 1986, despite having scored only 113 runs at 12.56 in his Test career. During the three Tests, Waugh had limited opportunities and scored 59 runs for once out and took two wickets. At this stage of his career, Waugh bore a heavy workload as a bowler although he was ostensibly selected for his batting. He played in all six ODIs on tour, scoring 111 runs at 55.50 and taking seven wickets at 35.86.

He bowled a long spell, taking 3/76, in the First Test against England at Brisbane in 1986–87, then scored 0 and 28 as Australia slumped to defeat. In the Second Test at Perth, he made 71 and had match figures of 5/159 including 5/69 in the second innings, then he scored 79 not out in the drawn Third Test at Adelaide. Scores of 49 and 73 in the last two Tests, gave him series figures of 310 runs (at 44.29) and ten wickets (at 33.60), a fighting effort in a team defeated 1–2. The win in the Fifth Test was the first time that Waugh was in a victorious Test team, in his 13th match. Waugh played in all of Australia&#x27;s 13 ODIs for the home season, scoring 372 runs at 37.20 with two half-centuries and taking 21 wickets at 21.80. Waugh regularly performed with both bat and ball. In a match against Pakistan, he scored 82 and then took 4/48 but could not stop the visitors taking a one-wicket victory from the second last ball. He then scored 83* and took 2/30 in an Australia Day victory against England. He was unable to maintain his form in the finals, scoring one and one and taking a total of 1/78 as England won 2–0.
Early in his international career, Waugh was a natural, uninhibited strokeplayer who liked to drive off the back foot. He could score quickly, but was inconsistent at Test level and seemed better suited to ODI cricket. In the shorter game, he often accelerated the scoring in the later overs of the innings. As a bowler, he was known for his astute change of pace and was the pioneer in inventing a carefully disguised slower ball bowled from the back of the hand, and regularly sent down the final overs, when his astute change of pace was difficult to score from. Allan Border often used Waugh as a final overs specialist in crunch situations and at his peak as a bowler, Waugh was the top slog overs specialist bowler for any conditions.

===1987 World Cup===
The 1987 World Cup, played on the Indian subcontinent, was the turning point of Waugh&#x27;s career. Having scored 19* in the death overs against India in the first match, Waugh&#x27;s tight bowling in the closing overs finished with his dismissal of Maninder Singh in the final over, which secured a one-run victory. In the following match against Zimbabwe, Waugh scored 45 before conceding only seven runs in six overs of bowling as the Australians won by 96 runs. In the following match against New Zealand, Waugh bowled the last over with the Kiwis requiring seven runs for victory: he restricted them to only three runs by taking two wickets in the over. He ended with 2/36.

In the second round robin rotation, Waugh took 1/59 and scored 42 in a 56-run loss to India, before taking 2/37 in a 17-run win over New Zealand. In Australia&#x27;s final group match, Waugh scored 10* before taking 1/9 from four overs in a 70-run win over Zimbabwe. Australia qualified for the semi-finals and faced co-hosts Pakistan on their home soil in Lahore. Batting first, Waugh hit 16 from the final over of the innings in a cameo of 32*, a match that Australia won by 18 runs. In the final, he scored an unbeaten five in a brief innings at the end of the innings. He was a key player as Australia defended a target of 254 against England at Kolkata. He claimed the wickets of Allan Lamb and Phillip DeFreitas in the 47th and 49th overs as England stumbled towards the end of the run-chase. Australia won by seven runs to claim the World Cup for the first time. Waugh compiled 167 runs at 55.66 and took 11 wickets at 26.18. These performances in tight situations earned him the nickname of &quot;Iceman&quot;.

===Breakthrough tour of England===
However, Waugh continued to be inconsistent in Test matches. He made only 194 runs at 32.33 in five Tests in 1987–88 against the touring New Zealand, England and Sri Lanka teams. His bowling helped to keep him in the team, with nine wickets at 29.67. Waugh&#x27;s ODI form remained strong, playing in all of Australia&#x27;s 11 ODIs for the season, scoring 226 runs at 32.29 and taking 18 wickets at 23.50. He scored one half-century and took a haul of 4/33 in one match against Sri Lanka.

A Test tour of Pakistan in late 1988 was unproductive, with 92 runs at 18.40 with one half century and two wickets at 108.00. In 1988–89 against the West Indies, Waugh mixed some batting failures with two entertaining innings of 90 and 91 on the faster pitches of Brisbane and Perth, respectively. He bowled a series of bouncers at Viv Richards at Brisbane and claimed 3/77 and 5/92 in the Third Test at Melbourne. Of Waugh&#x27;s spell at Brisbane, Bill O&#x27;Reilly wrote:
The most significant incident of the Brisbane Test ... was the salutation young Steve Waugh served up, in the form of three consecutive bouncers, to visiting captain Viv Richards ... I took it immediately as an uncompromising message to the opposing skipper that Waugh was sick to death of the bouncer policy that the West Indies have for so long adopted as their standard method of attack.

Waugh continued to perform strongly in the ODIs, scoring 270 runs as 38.57 and taking seven wickets at 49.42. His highest score and best bowling analysis occurred in the same match, taking 3/57 before scoring 54 against West Indies in Melbourne. Despite this, Australia still lost the match.

Heading into the 1989 Ashes series, Waugh&#x27;s batting average was 30.52 from 26 Tests. In the three-match ODI series that preceded the Tests, Waugh scored 113 runs at 37.66 and took three wickets at 54.00.

Waugh finally scored his maiden Test century, 177 not out in the First Test at Leeds. It was a free flowing innings marked by square driving, in just over five hours of batting which helped Australia set the platform for a win with a large first innings. He followed this with an unbeaten 152 in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, adeptly shepherding his tailend partners to help Australia set up a winning 242 run lead in the first innings. He was not dismissed until the first innings of the Third Test for 43, by which time he had amassed 393 runs. Waugh scored 92 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in another win. He did not pass 20 in either of the last two Tests and finished the series with 506 runs at 126.5. He bowled less frequently, with only two wickets in the six Tests. It was on this tour that he first experienced back problems that would hinder his bowling. On the brief tour of India for the Nehru Cup ODI tournament that followed the Ashes series, Waugh played as a specialist batsman for the first time. He scored 88 runs at 22.00 and did not bowl a ball.

As Australia returned home for the 1989/90 international season. He scored 378 runs at 37.8 in the six Tests in Australia and the one-off Test in New Zealand. The highlight was an unbeaten 134 against Sri Lanka in the Second Test in Hobart. This followed twin half centuries in the First Test. His focus on batting saw him aggregate only 1/19 with the ball for the seven Tests. Thereafter his Test form tapered off.

The ODIs followed a similar pattern. Australia played ten ODIs on home soil during the season, followed by five in New Zealand. After taking two wickets at 38.50 in the first three ODIs, Waugh did not bowl again for the season. After scoring only 99 runs at 19.80 in the first nine ODIs in Australia, Waugh was dropped for the Second Final against Pakistan, which Australia won. He played in all five ODIs in New Zealand, making only 72 runs at 18.00. He returned to the bowling crease in the Sharjah tournament, taking four wickets at 28.00 and scoring 98 runs at 49.00.

In 1990, Waugh joined his twin brother Mark in an unbeaten partnership of 464 in 407 minutes for NSW against Western Australia (WA) at the WACA Ground, setting a world first-class record. Both teams were at full strength and WA&#x27;s attack included Test bowlers Terry Alderman, Bruce Reid and Chris Matthews. The twins ended with 216 and 229 respectively.

===Omission===
He suffered a form slump during the 1990–91 Ashes series in Australia, and was dropped for the Fourth Test at Adelaide after making only 82 runs at 20.50. He was replaced by his twin Mark, who scored a century on debut.

However, Waugh remained a regular in the ODI team, playing in all ten ODIs, scoring 141 runs at 35.25 and taking seven wickets at 49.42.

Recalled for the Third Test in Trinidad during the 1991 tour of the Caribbean, he and Mark became the first twins to play in a Test match together. However, he failed to post a significant score and was dropped for the Fifth Test, Australia&#x27;s only win for the series.

He played in all five ODIs and scored 86 runs at 28.66 and took five wickets at 30.60.

Waugh remained out of the Test team for eighteen months and did not see action in the five-day format in 1991–92 season. Nevertheless, Waugh played in all 18 ODIs for the season. In the triangular series, he scored only 146 runs at 18.25 but consistently took wickets, with 16 scalps at 19.00. As a result, he retained his position in the team for all eight of Australia&#x27;s group matches in the subsequent 1992 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand. He scored 187 runs at 26.71 and took eight wickets at 34.63. He scored 55 and took 2/28 in a 128-run win over Zimbabwe as Australia failed to progress beyond the group stage.

He returned as number three batsman for the 1992–93 home Test series against the West Indies, but his form was again moderate. His 228 runs at 25.33 was bolstered by a score of 100 in the Third Test in Sydney. Waugh called this &quot;probably the most important hundred of my Test career ... word had reached me that if I didn&#x27;t get runs, then I was going to be dropped&quot;. He continued to be a fixture in the ODI team, playing in all ten matches and scoring 213 runs at 23.66 with one half-century and taking nine wickets at 39.22.

Solid performances on the tour of New Zealand, where he scored 178 Test runs at 44.50, enabled Waugh to hold his position on the 1993 Ashes tour of England. He completed his tour with 120 runs at 30.00 and three wickets at 57.66 in the five ODIs. The three-match ODI series in England preceded the Tests and Waugh scored 41 runs at 20.50 and took five wickets at 30.20.

During the Test series, Michael Slater became the regular opener and Boon returned to the middle order. Waugh gained the number six position ahead of two promising Western Australians, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn. In the Fourth Test at Headingley, Waugh&#x27;s 157 not out earned comparisons to his efforts in 1989 and he shared an unbroken stand of 332 with Allan Border. He also scored half-centuries in the First and Fifth Tests and ended with 416 at 83.2 from limited opportunities – he played nine innings, only five of which were completed. Australia&#x27;s top order batting dominated the English attack, and the tourists retained the Ashes 4–1.

===New approach===
Returning to Australia, he solidified his position by scoring an unbeaten 147 against New Zealand in an innings victory in the Third Test at Brisbane, ending the series with 216 runs once dismissed. He missed part of the 1993–94 triangular ODI tournament with New Zealand and South Africa due to a hamstring injury in late December, as well as the first two Tests against the South Africans. He returned for the end of the ODIs and ended with 141 runs at 23.50 and taking four wickets at 54.50. Waugh played in the Third Test at Adelaide Oval in late January with Australia trailing 1–0. He scored a 160 and took 4/26 as Australia won the Test and levelled the series. He was named as the international player of the [Australian] season.

He took 5/28 and scored 86 in the Second Test of the return series in South Africa at Newlands, Cape Town to help Australia level the series 1–1 after losing the first at Wanderers in Johannesburg. Another half century saw him end with 195 runs at 65.00 and his bowling was at its most productive in five years, with 10 wickets at 13.00. In the ODI series, he received the player of the series for his all-round efforts, which hauled Australia back from a deficit of 2–4 to draw the series at 4–4. Waugh took 2/48 in the final match as Australia levelled the series by one run. He ended with 291 runs at 48.50 and five wickets at 56.40.

At the conclusion of the tour, the Australian Cricket Board interviewed Waugh, along with David Boon, Mark Taylor and Ian Healy to discern their opinions on the direction of the team after the impending retirement of Allan Border as captain. In spite of Waugh&#x27;s greater experience, Taylor was granted the captaincy, while Healy was made vice-captain.
The new leadership took the team to Sri Lanka for the Singer World Series ODI tournament and then on a Test-playing tour of Pakistan. Waugh scored 53 runs at 17.66 and took five wickets in 16.20. On the latter tour, Waugh made 73 in the First Test, which Australia agonisingly lost by one wicket. His 98 in the Second Test at Rawalpindi was notable for his survival against a hostile barrage of short-pitched bowling from Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. He eventually fell when a bouncer struck his body and rolled onto the stumps. A shoulder injury forced him out of the final Test, which Australia drew and therefore lost the series. Waugh scored 153 runs at 38.25 with two half-centuries and took two wickets at 72.00 as Australia won the ODI tournament.

During the 1994–95 Ashes series against England, he narrowly missed centuries in the Second and Fifth Test in Melbourne and Perth respectively, when he was 94 and 99 not out respectively when the last wicket fell. In the second instance, his brother Mark was run out after a mix-up while running for the injured Craig McDermott. It was an uneven series performance, scoring 94* and 26* in the Second Test and 99* and 80 in the Fifth, but not passing 20 in the six innings of the other three Tests. He ended the series with 345 at 49.28 and did not bowl for the entire series. Waugh played only one ODI for the season, scoring a duck and not bowling a ball. The season ended with short ODI tournament in New Zealand, which Australia won. Waugh scored 81 runs at 27.00 in four matches and did not bowl.

===Frank Worrell Trophy regained in 1995===
The West Indies had been the &quot;&quot; of Australian cricket since winning the Frank Worrell Trophy in 1978. At the beginning of Australia&#x27;s 1995 tour of the Caribbean, the West Indies had not lost a Test series since 1980, and had not lost a Test series to Australia at home since 1973. The Tests were preceded by an ODI series that was lost 1–4. Waugh scored 164 runs at 32.80 and took three wickets at 41.00. In a low-scoring, four-Test series, Waugh compiled 429 runs at an average of 107.25 and claimed five wickets (for 62 runs) to win the player of the series award; his twin Mark was the next best batsman with 240 runs at 40 average.
Waugh was at the centre of a controversy during the First Test at Barbados when he claimed a low catch from Brian Lara in the first innings. Television replays were inconclusive, but suggested that the ball may have hit the ground. Lara, noted for accepting the word of the fielder without question, left the field. Following his dismissal, the West Indies&#x27; batting collapsed, and Australia went on to win by ten wickets. Waugh later faced accusations of dishonesty and cheating over the incident.

After scoring 65 not out in the drawn Second Test at Antigua, Waugh defied the Caribbean pacemen on a green pitch at Trinidad suited to their hostile bowling during the Third Test. In the first innings, he scored an unbeaten 63 of Australia&#x27;s 128 and had a mid-pitch confrontation with Curtly Ambrose. After Waugh had evaded a bouncer from Ambrose, the pair exchanged glares. Waugh swore and told Ambrose to return to his bowling mark. An angry Ambrose had to be physically dragged away by his captain: a photograph of this moment has become one of the iconic images of cricket in the 1990s. It symbolised the point when Australia was no longer intimidated by the West Indies. Waugh &quot;showed he was prepared to put it all on the line&quot;, said Justin Langer, &quot;in the toughest conditions [...] against probably the best fast bowler of our time. To stand up to him [Ambrose] and go toe to toe [...] gave us a huge boost.&quot;

Nevertheless, the West Indies won the match and levelled the series. In the decider in Jamaica, Waugh took 2/14 in the West Indies&#x27; first innings of 265 and then arrived at the crease with Australia at 73 for three in reply. He compiled a long partnership of 231 runs with his brother Mark, who was eventually out for 126. Waugh was the last man to go, out for 200 after nine hours of batting. &quot;Steve had made up his mind to bat and bat&quot;, wrote Paul Reiffel, &quot;to stay out there and anchor the proceedings. [... H]e copped a lot of blows on his arms, chest and ribs. When he came back to the dressing room at the end of day two, we could see the spots and bruises on his body [...]. I remember when I walked in [...] he didn&#x27;t say anything to me, but then he didn&#x27;t need to. We all pretty much knew that we just had to support him.&quot;

&quot;He was in a trance-like state. [... I]n the wee hours of the second morning, a security guard was found rifling through Steve&#x27;s kit bag. That incident [...] didn&#x27;t affect his concentration. It all [...] just went to show how strong a character he was.&quot;

Waugh played patiently and reached his double century with an all-run four to fine-leg off a quicker ball from Carl Hooper. He was the last man out. With a large lead on first innings, Australia dismissed the opposition for a low score to win a crushing victory.

After some post-win wassailing, Waugh retired to bed in his cricket whites, socks and baggy green. &quot;[Y]ou could say that Steve&#x27;s legacy gained a lot of momentum from his efforts at Jamaica&quot;, wrote Reiffel.

===No 1 batsman===
Waugh started the 1995–96 Australian season ranked as the world&#x27;s leading Test batsman. He made an unbeaten 112 as Australia defeated Pakistan in the First Test at Brisbane and scored 200 runs at 50.00 for the series. Suffering an injury in December, he missed the First Test against Sri Lanka and part of the triangular ODI tournament, then returned for the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne to score 131 not out. Waugh returned during the latter stages of the triangular tournament, playing in the last four matches after missing the first six. He scored his maiden ODI century, ten years after his ODI debut, with an unbeaten 102 against Sri Lanka in Melbourne. Despite this, Australia lost by three wickets. Waugh ended with 128 runs at 42.66 and did not take a wicket, bowling only four overs on his comeback from injury. He helped Australia to a 3–0 result in the Test series by scoring 170 and 61 not out at Adelaide to end the series with 362 runs for once out. He also took 4/34 in the Third Test.

During the 1996 Cricket World Cup on the subcontinent, Waugh scored 82 and featured in a 207-run partnership with his brother during Australia&#x27;s first match against Kenya: an Australian record partnership at the World Cup. He made an unbeaten half-century in the quarter-final against New Zealand at Madras, sealing a successful run chase. However, he was less effective in the semi-final and final, failing to pass 20 on either occasion. Australia lost the final to Sri Lanka at Lahore.
After the World Cup, Geoff Marsh replaced Bob Simpson as coach. The Australians started the new era with two ODI tournaments in Sri Lanka and India. Waugh scored 366 runs at 40.66 with three half-centuries and took five wickets at 37.40 across nine matches. The tour ended with a solitary Test against India in Delhi, where Waugh was the only Australian to make a half-century in a defeat.

Waugh failed to make a century in the five Tests of the 1996–97 Australian season against the West Indies, scoring 255 runs at 36.42 with three half centuries. He also missed the Second Test against the West Indies after injuring his groin while bowling in the First.

The injury meant that Waugh was only available for six of Australia&#x27;s eight ODI matches in the annual triangular tournament. Waugh managed only 159 runs at 26.50 and only bowled three overs without taking a wicket as he came back from injury as Australia missed the finals.

Waugh returned to form on the 1997 tour of South Africa, averaging 78.25. He scored 160 in the First Test at Johannesburg, compiling a 385-run partnership with Greg Blewett. They batted for the entire third day&#x27;s play to set up an innings victory. Waugh then top scored with half-centuries in both innings of the Third Test, which Australia lost. After the team&#x27;s vice-captain Ian Healy was suspended for throwing his bat after his dismissal, Waugh replaced him as Mark Taylor&#x27;s deputy. Waugh continued his strong run in the seven ODIs, scoring 301 runs at 50.16 with four half-centuries. After scoring 50 and 50* in the first two matches, he scored 89 in a run chase in the sixth match as Australia sealed the series 4–2 with one over in hand. He then scored 91 in the last match in a vain run chase.

On the 1997 Ashes tour, Australia started poorly with a 0–3 loss in the ODI series, with Waugh managing only 60 runs at 20.00.

This continued as Australia lost the First Test by nine wickets, drew the Second Test, then won the toss in the Third Test at Manchester. Gambling on batting first on green pitch, Australia slumped to 3/42 in the first hour when Waugh came out to bat. He made 108. Similarly, he began his second innings with Australia on 3/39 and scored 116. These two centuries in a low-scoring match won the game. Australia levelled the series and regained the initiative, retaining the Ashes with a 3–2 result. Waugh&#x27;s only other notable score was 75, scored in the Fifth Test win at Nottingham, and he finished with 390 runs at 39 average for the series.

==Captaincy==
===ODI captain===
Waugh took over the captaincy of the one-day side in 1997–98, after captain Mark Taylor and vice-captain Ian Healy, the two oldest players in the team were dropped following Australia&#x27;s failure to qualify for the Australian tri-nations tournament in the 1996–97 season. Planning began for a more modern team for the 1999 Cricket World Cup, with the batting prowess of new wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist to prove critical. The new team made a difficult start, losing all four of its preliminary matches against South Africa as Michael di Venuto, Tom Moody and Stuart Law were all tried as Mark Waugh&#x27;s new opening partner. Waugh himself struggled, scoring only 12 runs, including three ducks in his first six innings before scoring 45* in the last round-robin match to ensure Australia qualified for the finals ahead of New Zealand.

However, with Gilchrist&#x27;s elevation to opener in the finals series, Australia defeated the South Africans 2–1. Waugh scored 53 and 71 in his two innings, and ended the series with 181 runs at 22.63. He bowled only four overs and took a solitary wicket in the series, which was his first ODI wicket in over a year.
Waugh scored steadily in the 1997–98 Test season against New Zealand and South Africa, getting to 80 three times in six Tests without going on to a century and averaging 40.89; Australia won both series. He bowled more often than in the preceding few years and took six wickets at 17.33.

The southern hemisphere season ended with Waugh leading his first overseas tour, a four-match ODI tour of New Zealand. He scored 112 runs at 37.33 and took three wickets at 42.00 as the series was drawn 2–2.

On the 1998 tour of India, he hit 80 in the Second Test at Calcutta, but missed the following Test due to injury. He ended with 152 runs at 38.

He recovered to lead in the triangular tournament in India. Australia won both games to Zimbabwe but lost both to India. However, Waugh&#x27;s men turned the tables in the final to beat the Indians by four wickets. Waugh contributed with bat and ball, taking 2/42 and scoring 57. This was followed by a triangular tournament in Sharjah, where Australia won all four group matches against India and New Zealand. This time, the Indians turned the table to win the final by six wickets despite Waugh&#x27;s 70. Waugh totalled 254 runs at 28.22 and eight wickets at 33.50 for the two tournaments.

Later in the year, he top scored with 157 in the First Test against Pakistan at Karachi, enabling Australia to force an innings victory and gain their first victory in the country for 39 years. It formed the basis of Australia&#x27;s 1–0 series win, in which Waugh scored 235 runs at 58.75.

Waugh led the ODI team in a 3–0 sweep of Pakistan after the Tests, but he managed only 40 runs at 13.33.

The following season, Waugh suffered hamstring injuries and missed the majority of the ODI tournament. In the two matches in which he played, Waugh made only a duck and 20 and Australia lost both matches. Shane Warne led Australia to victory in his absence, winning eight of the remaining 10 matches.

Waugh began the Ashes series with centuries in the First Test at Brisbane (112) and the Third Test at Melbourne but was criticised for taking singles off the first ball of the over, and exposing the tail-end batsmen to the strike. Stuart MacGill and Glenn McGrath fell to Darren Gough after one such instance as Australia collapsed in the second innings whilst chasing a small target. This criticism could be considered more than a little unfair, however, given his strong record overall of batting well with lower order batsman such as Merv Hughes, Jason Gillespie, Ian Healy, Shane Warne and even Glenn McGrath precisely by putting his faith in them. In the Fifth Test of the season, Waugh was involved in a century partnership with brother Mark for the second consecutive year. Again however, he fell within sight of triple figures for 96, while his brother reached his century. Australia won the Test and the series 3–1.

===Struggles in the Caribbean===
Mark Taylor retired at the end of the 1998–99 season and Waugh replaced him as Test captain, beginning with a tour of the Caribbean. Australia was expected to win as the West Indies had just been whitewashed 5–0 by South Africa. After easily winning the First Test, Australia was stymied by West Indies skipper Brian Lara, who batted with Jimmy Adams for the entire second day of the Second Test. This led to a victory for the home side, and in the Third Test, Lara batted for the entire final day to secure an unlikely win by one wicket. This result placed Waugh under immense pressure and he made a controversial decision to drop Shane Warne from the team for the final Fourth Test. Australia won the final Test despite a third consecutive century from Lara, and retained the Frank Worrell Trophy 2–2.

The subsequent ODI series between the two teams was drawn 3–3. The series was notable for two incidents. In the fifth match at Georgetown, Guyana, Waugh was facing the bowling of Keith Arthurton with his team needing four runs from the final over to win. He struck the last ball of the match into the outfield, and attempted three runs to tie the match. A crowd invasion resulted in all the stumps being removed, with Waugh out of his ground when the ball was returned by the fielder. The match was declared a tie. During the West Indies run-chase in the final match in Barbados, local batsman Sherwin Campbell was run out after he fell over because of a collision with the bowler (Brendon Julian) who was attempting to field the ball. This resulted in a crowd riot and Waugh was nearly struck in the head with a glass bottle. The match continued after Campbell was reinstated, but Waugh criticised the security and questioned the integrity of the match.

Waugh struggled in the lead-up to the World Cup, scoring 135 runs at 22.50 and taking two wickets at 33.00.

===1999 World Cup victory===
Australia then had a slow start to the 1999 World Cup in England. After a scratchy win against Scotland, Australia suffered defeats to New Zealand and Pakistan, so they had to win their two remaining group matches (against Bangladesh and the West Indies), then all three &quot;Super Six&quot; matches to progress to the semi-finals: this meant seven consecutive matches without defeat to win the World Cup. After defeating Bangladesh, Waugh and Michael Bevan were criticised for deliberately batting slowly in order to minimise damage to the net run rate of the West Indies. This would enhance Australia&#x27;s chances: if the West Indies&#x27; run rate remained high, they would qualify ahead of New Zealand. Since the Australians had lost to New Zealand, it would be the Kiwis that carried two points through to the next phase if the West Indies was eliminated. If the West Indies proceeded, then Australia would carry over two points from the win.

When questioned about the ethics of this manipulation at a press conference, Waugh retorted, &quot;We&#x27;re not here to win friends mate&quot;. Having beaten India and Zimbabwe in their first two Super Six matches, Waugh saved his best for two must-win games against South Africa: he scored an unbeaten 120 against South Africa in the &quot;Super Six&quot; phase and 56 in the semi-final. The latter match was tied and Australia progressed to the final, where they crushed Pakistan by eight wickets to win the trophy.

The World Cup victory did not immediately turn around Waugh&#x27;s fortunes in the Test arena. The following tour to Sri Lanka continued the difficulties, when Australia lost the First Test in Kandy, a result exacerbated by a horrific fielding collision between Waugh and Jason Gillespie. Waugh&#x27;s nose made contact with Gillespie&#x27;s shin as both attempted a catch. Gillespie suffered a broken leg that sidelined him for 15 months, and Waugh had his nose broken. Although Waugh returned for the following match, the last two Tests were drawn due to interruptions from monsoonal weather. Waugh had a lean series with 52 runs at 17.33. Waugh&#x27;s team then travelled an inaugural Test against Zimbabwe at Harare. Australia won by ten wickets and Waugh&#x27;s 151 not out was the first century in Tests between the nations. After the team&#x27;s return home, John Buchanan replaced Geoff Marsh as team coach.

===World record of 16 consecutive Test victories===
The 1999–2000 Test season, his first as captain in a home series, saw further change as Gilchrist ousted Healy from the wicket-keeper&#x27;s position. With Gilchrist averaging over 50, the team went on to claim a clean-sweep of both Test series, 3–0 against Pakistan and India respectively. Waugh had a lean stretch during the Pakistan series, scoring 58 runs at 14.50, but his team won by margins of ten wickets, four wickets and an innings respectively. Waugh returned to form in the First Test against India at the Adelaide Oval, scoring 150 in the first innings. Waugh only passed fifty once more in the series to end with 276 runs at 55.20. Australia won all three Tests by comfortable margins of 285 runs, 180 runs and an innings respectively.

After losing their first match, his team proceeded to win the season&#x27;s triangular ODI tournament without further defeat. They then toured New Zealand and won the ODI series 5–1, losing their final match, which ended a world record of 14 consecutive ODI victories. They then swept the Tests against New Zealand 3–0 in early 2000, taking the Tests by 62 runs, six wickets and six wickets respectively. Waugh led the way in the Second Test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington with an unbeaten 151 but otherwise did not pass 20, totalling 214 runs at 53.50. His men had won all nine of their Tests during the southern hemisphere summer.

His team continued their winning streak with an undefeated home season in 2000–01 when the West Indies were white-washed 5–0. The first two Tests were won by an innings, and the Second Test at the WACA brought a twelfth consecutive Test victory, surpassing the record held by the 1980s West Indies team led by Clive Lloyd. Waugh missed the Third Test with injury and Gilchrist led the team in his absence and kept the winning streak alive. Waugh returned for the last two Tests and scored centuries in the first innings of both Tests with 121* and 103 respectively, which Australia won by 352 runs and six wickets respectively. Waugh compiled 349 runs at 69.80.

Waugh then led the Australians undefeated in the triangular ODI tournament against the West Indies and Zimbabwe, despite employing a rotation system which saw the team often understrength with players rested.

===Failure in India===

The only significant result that Australia had failed to achieve during Waugh&#x27;s international career was victory in a Test series in India. Waugh began calling this the &quot;Final Frontier&quot; as Australia had not won there since 1969–70. Australia easily won the First Test at Mumbai by ten wickets to extend the winning sequence to 16. India, looked set for defeat in the Second Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata after conceding a first innings lead of 274. Waugh top-scored in the first innings with 110. Waugh chose to enforce the follow-on, the only time that Australia had chosen to do so for more than five years. However, VVS Laxman (281) and Rahul Dravid (180) batted for the entire fourth day&#x27;s play and set Australia a target of 384 on a dusty, spinning wicket. The Australians were unable to cope with the spin of Harbhajan Singh on the final day, and became only the third team to lose a Test after enforcing the follow-on. Starting the final Test well, Australia&#x27;s batting collapsed on the second morning, losing 6/26 after Waugh became the sixth batsman to be given out handled the ball—he pushed a ball from Harbhajan away from the stumps after being hit on the pads. Waugh&#x27;s pair of 47s was not enough as Harbhajan finished with 15 wickets in the match to lead India to a two-wicket win in another thrilling finish.

Waugh&#x27;s team regrouped and won a 4–1 series victory over England during the 2001 Ashes tour. He scored 105 in the First Test at Edgbaston as the Australians started the series with an innings victory. Waugh did not pass 50 in the next two Tests, but Australia won both by eight and seven wickets respectively to retain the Ashes. However, Waugh pulled a calf muscle and missed the Fourth Test at Headingley which Australia lost. In his final Test innings on English soil at The Oval, he combined with brother Mark (120) in a partnership of 197, and scored 157 not out. Australia won by an innings to seal the series 4–1, with Waugh scoring 321 runs at 107.00.

He was unable to maintain this form during the 2001–02 Australian season, failing to score a century in the six Tests against New Zealand and South Africa; The first two Tests against New Zealand were drawn due to rain, and the Third also ended in a draw. Waugh failed to pass double figures until scoring 67 in the second innings of the final Test, finishing the series with 78 runs at 19.50.

Australia then went on to face South Africa, who were the second-ranked Test team in the world and were seen as the leading challengers to Australian supremacy.

Waugh managed only eight and 13 in the First Test, but Australia managed to win by 246 runs in any case. His best score of the series was 90 in the Second Test at the MCG. His innings was ended by a run out decision, which the umpire did not refer to the video umpire. Waugh attracted criticism for not leaving the ground until he had watched a replay of the incident on the stadium&#x27;s video screen. Australia powered to a nine-wicket win and then polished off a 3–0 sweep with a ten-wicket triumph in the Third Test at the SCG, with Waugh scoring 30.

===ODI captaincy changed===

Australia made an uncertain start to the 2001–02 VB Series, losing the first three of its preliminary matches. A rotation policy designed to ease the workload on older players while giving younger players experience appeared to unsettle the team, and was scrapped. Following this decision, Australia won four of the last five matches, but failed to qualify for the finals for only the third time in 23 years. In their final match, Australia needed a win and a bonus point against South Africa as New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, in retaliation to Waugh&#x27;s tactics in the World Cup, had conceded a bonus point to South Africa in the previous match. The team&#x27;s performance caused a reaction similar that of 1997. With an eye toward the next World Cup, the selectors dropped the Waugh brothers and handed the captaincy to Ricky Ponting. Waugh made his displeasure at the decision public and stated a desire to regain his place in the side.

Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led the team to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia&#x27;s ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media questioning over his playing future. Waugh&#x27;s reply was, &quot;We&#x27;ve just beaten the next best team in the world 5–1, and all you want to talk about is getting me out of the team.&quot;

The speculation continued about the future of both Waugh brothers in the lead up to the Test series against Pakistan played in mid-2002. The matches were hosted in the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka, due to security concerns following a bomb blast inside Pakistan. Australia had a crushing 3–0 win, winning the two latter matches by an innings, but the Waughs had little influence on the result. However, Steve hit 103 not out in his last innings of the series, after scoring consecutive ducks. This may have saved his career; his brother was dropped for the 2002–03 Ashes series and promptly announced his retirement from international cricket.

Despite his team being well on top, Waugh struggled in the early part of the Ashes series and he scored only 106 runs in four innings in the first three Tests. It mattered little to the match results; Australia crushed England in the First Test by 384 runs and proceeded to record consecutive innings victories. In the Fourth Test at the MCG, he scored 77 in the first innings and took his first Test wicket in four years; he did not bowl himself often as captain. However, his score of 14 in the second innings was characterised by many inside edges and false strokes led to increased speculation that he would be dropped. Australia managed to reach their target with five wickets down, despite a stumble on the final morning.

The Fifth Test in his hometown Sydney started with speculation that it would be Waugh&#x27;s last Test unless he reversed his ongoing form slump. Asked before the final Test to nominate the defining moment of a career likely to soon be over, Waugh made a prediction rather than reflecting, stating: &quot;It might be yet to come&quot;. On the second day of the match he then fulfilled this prophecy, scoring a chanceless century – bringing up three figures with a cover driven boundary from the last ball of the day (bowled by off-spinner Richard Dawson). Waugh left the ground to a standing ovation, having equalled Sir Donald Bradman&#x27;s then Australian record of 29 Test centuries, as well as saving his own Test career. In the second innings, Australia faced a large target and slumped to a heavy defeat by 225 on a deteriorating pitch, its only loss of the series. When he was dismissed cheaply in the second innings, Waugh ran off the field, as the crowd gave him a standing ovation amidst speculation he may choose to retire after what was regarded as a fairytale century.

The 2003 World Cup came and Waugh&#x27;s desire to return for a fifth World Cup was denied. A chance for a last minute reprieve came when all rounder Shane Watson was injured before the tournament. Waugh had been using his newspaper column to promote his bowling abilities and had been increasingly using himself as a bowler in an attempt to strengthen his case for a recall. However, his successor Ricky Ponting publicly called for the inclusion of then out of form Andrew Symonds. Ponting got his wish, and although the selection was regarded as being highly controversial at the time, Symonds established himself at international level with a series of match winnings innings.

During the April 2003 tour to the West Indies, Waugh made 25 in the First Test and did not bat in the Second, before scoring 115 in the Third Test victory. Australia won all three Tests by nine wickets, 118 runs and nine wickets respectively. He scored 41 and 45* in the Fourth Test to end the series with 226 runs at 75.33. It was in this match, that Australia lost as the home team broke the record for the highest successful Test run chase. Waugh received some criticism over claims he refused to control his players. This came after a heated confrontation between Glenn McGrath and West Indian batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan as the hosts headed towards their target.

The Australian winter of 2003 saw Waugh score consecutive unbeaten centuries of 100 and 156 as Australia took a 2–0 sweep over Bangladesh with innings victories. The Australian summer started in late-2003 and after scoring 78 and 61 in the two Tests against Zimbabwe, which Australia won by an innings and nine wickets respectively, Waugh announced that the 2003–04 series against India would be his last.

===Farewell season===

In the First Test, Waugh was involved in a controversial run out when he had a mix up with Damien Martyn and both players ended up at the same end. Martyn, who had established himself at the crease, sacrificed himself by walking out of his ground for Waugh, who had yet to score. This generated criticism that Waugh&#x27;s farewell series was being put ahead of team victory. With long bowling spearheads Shane Warne and McGrath unavailable due to drugs suspension and injury respectively, Australia struggled to bowl out the Indian batsmen. After a rain affected draw in the First Test, the next two Tests were shared and Australia needed a win to reclaim the Border–Gavaskar Trophy in the final Fourth Test at Waugh&#x27;s home ground at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Promoters paid tribute to Waugh by handing out giant red handkerchiefs to incoming spectators; Waugh had always used a red handkerchief to wipe perspiration while he was batting. Any hope of a win for Waugh&#x27;s Australians disappeared when India batted into the third morning and amass 7/705 (with Sachin Tendulkar smashing 241*), obliging Australia to chase 449 with just over one day&#x27;s play. Waugh&#x27;s highest Test score of the season was his last: 80 in the Fourth Test at Sydney, which secured a draw for Australia. After an obdurate start to his innings, he took a more aggressive style once Australia had moved into a position of safety, striking several fours. It was the highest fourth innings score of his Test career. When he passed 50, several ferries on Sydney Harbour sounded their horns in acknowledgement. A record fifth-day SCG crowd turned out to watch Waugh&#x27;s final day as an Australian player.

==Legacy==

Steve Waugh&#x27;s approach led to a succession of victories and a record run of 16 consecutive Test match wins, beating the previous record of 11 by the West Indies. His 168 Test matches was the record for Test matches played until 2010; of these he captained Australia on 57 occasions, the fourth highest of all time, and Australia&#x27;s 41 victories under his leadership, was the most of any Test captain, until Ricky Ponting surpassed him in December 2009. He holds the record of having scored over 150 runs in one innings against each Test playing nation at the time.
* He holds the record for scoring the most career centuries in test history when batting at number 5 position (24)

==Career best performances==

==Playing style==
A shot that Waugh gradually developed (during the 1998 Commonwealth Games specifically) against spin bowling, the &quot;slog sweep&quot; is theoretically technically unsound, but has proven highly effective against the spinners and even against faster bowlers at times. What was also noticeable about Waugh (particularly in the Test arena) on his return to the side was his reluctance (and eventual refusal) to play, what he viewed as, the &#x27;risky&#x27; hook shot, rather simply to either play defensively on the back foot, sway or duck out of the way. With this shot removed from Waugh&#x27;s repertoire his batting developed a safer more reliable look and his Test match batting average steadily rose to around 50 for the remainder of his Test career.

Waugh&#x27;s ability to continue to play despite a back injury that largely prevented him bowling further enhanced his reputation. He contributed to many one day victories but, often batting in the middle order, his first one-day hundred did not come until his 187th match, for Australia against Sri Lanka at Melbourne in 1995–96.

As a bowler and all-rounder early in his career, he had a great leg cutter that is full length and aims at off stump that tempts batsmen to hit over mid-wicket or right down the ground against middle order batsmen, or aiming outside off to tempt lower-order batsmen to drive into the infielders.

==Outside cricket==
Waugh helps to raise funds for a leper children&#x27;s colony, Udayan, in Kolkata. He reportedly also encouraged his players to learn about and enjoy the countries they visited and played in.

Waugh is a keen photographer and has produced several &quot;tour diaries&quot; which feature his images. In his latter years as a cricketer, he wrote for a number of newspapers. He insists on writing them himself rather than with the assistance of professional journalists. He is a prolific author and has written numerous tour diaries, leadership and self-help books such as &quot;Never Say Die&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Luck&quot;. as well as an autobiography, &quot;Out of my Comfort Zone&quot;.

Waugh was named Australian of the Year in 2004, in recognition of both his sporting achievements and charity work. Waugh is married to Lynette with three children and was named Australian Father of the Year in 2005. Following retirement, Waugh established the Steve Waugh Foundation. The foundation is aimed at children who have a disease, an illness or an affliction that does not meet the set criteria of other charitable organisations.

Waugh has stated that he has declined &quot;a number of&quot; approaches by the Australian Labor Party to run for political office, expressing the view that he is not suited to politics.

==Honours==
* He was named as the captain in Australia&#x27;s &quot;greatest ever ODI team.&quot; 
* On 3 February 2009 Steve Waugh became the 30th cricketer inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.
* Waugh was awarded the Australian Sports Medal on 14 July 2000.
* He was awarded the Allan Border Medal by the CA in 2001.
* Waugh was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2003 Birthday Honours &quot;for service to cricket as a leading player, and to the community, particularly through the Udayan children&#x27;s home.&quot;
* He was awarded the Australian of the Year award in 2004, for his cricketing feats also for his work with charities, most noticeably, Udayan Home in Barrackpore, India, helping children suffering with leprosy.

<text>Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name the Rock, is an American actor and professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on a part-time basis. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Johnson was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era. He wrestled for the WWF full-time for eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over in North America and over worldwide, making him one of the world&#x27;s highest-grossing and highest-paid actors. He is a co-owner of the United Football League, a member of the board of directors of TKO Group Holdings—the parent company of UFC and WWE—and co-founder of Seven Bucks Productions.

After accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, Johnson was a member of the 1991 national championship team but was largely a backup player. Despite aspirations to professional football, he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being cut in his first season. In 1996, his father assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF. Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004; he returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013 and made sporadic appearances from thereon until his retirement in 2019; in 2023, he returned once again on a part-time basis. A 10-time world champion—including the promotion&#x27;s first of African-American descent—he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE&#x27;s sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined multiple pay-per-view events, including WWE&#x27;s flagship event WrestleMania six times (15, 16, 17, 28, 29 and 40) which includes the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania 28) and main evented the most watched episodes of WWE&#x27;s flagship television series (&quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;).

Johnson&#x27;s first film role was in &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role in the action fantasy film &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. He has since starred in family films &quot;The Game Plan&quot; (2007), &quot;Race to Witch Mountain&quot; (2009), &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; (2010), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2019), and &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot; (2021), and the action films &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot; (2012), &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot; (2013), &quot;Hercules&quot; (2014), &quot;Skyscraper&quot; (2018), &quot;San Andreas&quot; (2015) and &quot;Rampage&quot; (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films &quot;Get Smart&quot; (2008), &quot;Central Intelligence&quot; (2016), &quot;Baywatch&quot; (2017), and &quot;Red Notice&quot; (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; films, beginning with &quot;Fast Five&quot; (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest grossing in film. He joined the DC Extended Universe by playing the title role in &quot;Black Adam&quot; (2022). He is also known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film &quot;Moana&quot; (2016), and its sequel &quot;Moana 2&quot; (2024).

Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series &quot;Ballers&quot; (2015–2019) and the autobiographical sitcom &quot;Young Rock&quot; (2021–2023). His autobiography, &quot;The Rock Says&quot;, was released in 2000 and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In 2016 and 2019, &quot;Time&quot; named him as one of the world&#x27;s most influential people.

==Early life and education==
Johnson was born in Hayward, California, on May 2, 1972, the son of Mataniufeagaimaleata &quot;Ata&quot; Fitisemanu (née Maivia) and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). Growing up, he briefly lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother&#x27;s family, where he played rugby and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.
Johnson&#x27;s father was a Black Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry and his mother is Samoan. His father and Tony Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983. Johnson&#x27;s uncle Ricky was also a wrestler. His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler. Johnson&#x27;s maternal grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband&#x27;s death in 1982 and managing it until 1988. Through his maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoaʻi wrestling family. In 2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.

Johnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, and then moved to Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle School. He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, Tennessee, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the state, where he graduated in 1990.

At Freedom High School, Johnson initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks for fighting. An article in the local newspaper labeled him &quot;a troubled teenager with a history of run-ins with police&quot;. But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in Johnson, and recruited him to join the school&#x27;s football team, where he played defensive tackle, an experience that proved to be a significant personal transformation for Johnson. &quot;My thought process started to change. That&#x27;s when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish&quot;, he has since said about his high school football experience. In addition to playing football, Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School&#x27;s track and field and wrestling teams.

By his senior year at Freedom High School, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic scholarship offer from the University of Miami, whose football program was beginning to emerge as one of the nation&#x27;s top-level NCAA Division 1 teams.

==Football career==
===College career===

As he did in high school, Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami, where he was a member of the Miami Hurricanes 1991 team, which won that year&#x27;s national championship. Despite playing four years there, however, Johnson found himself behind elite players on the depth chart, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp, and appeared mostly in backup roles. In his time at Miami, Johnson played in 39 games with one start. He recorded 4.5 sacks and 77 tackles.

In 1995, Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of General Studies and a dual major in criminology and physiology. He was also one of the university&#x27;s most prolific student speakers in the Miami-area community, frequently delivering positive messages about his own struggles and encouraging students to remain in school and avoid the dangers of drug use.

===Canadian Football League===
After graduating, Johnson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Calgary moved him from defensive tackle to linebacker. He was assigned to Calgary&#x27;s practice roster, but was cut two months into Calgary&#x27;s 1995 season.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== Early career (1996) ===

After being cut by Calgary, Johnson began his professional wrestling career the next year, in 1996. Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson secured several tryout matches for Johnson with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. Wrestling at first under his real name, Johnson defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10 and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart. After wrestling at Jerry Lawler&#x27;s United States Wrestling Association under the name Flex Kavana and winning the USWA tag team championship twice with his partner Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson was signed to a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment ===
==== Intercontinental Champion (1996–1997) ====
Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather&#x27;s ring names, although announcers acknowledged his real name. He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross. He was given the nickname &quot;The Blue Chipper&quot;, and to play up his lineage, he was hyped as the WWF&#x27;s first third-generation wrestler. A clean-cut face character, Maivia was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; as a member of Marc Mero&#x27;s entourage on November 4, 1996. His first match came at Survivor Series on November 17, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust. On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on a Thursday edition of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four on February 16.

Johnson&#x27;s first WrestleMania match came at WrestleMania 13 on March 23, where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company. He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF and refused to be booked to take the title from him. On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of &quot;die, Rocky, die&quot; and &quot;Rocky sucks&quot; being heard during his matches.

After losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Maivia suffered a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind in June and spent several months recovering.

==== Nation of Domination (1997–1998) ====

Upon returning in August, Maivia turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining Faarooq, D&#x27;Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination. He then refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, though he would still be billed as &quot;The Rock&quot; Rocky Maivia until 1998. The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his promos.

At D-Generation X: In Your House on December 7, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated The Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship. The next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to The Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;. The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998. On January 19, 1998, at the Royal Rumble, The Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental Championship. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at WrestleMania XIV, he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply &quot;The Nation&quot;.

The Rock and the Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X (DX), with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which The Rock won. At King of the Ring on June 28, The Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House on July 26 for the Intercontinental Championship, which The Rock retained in controversial fashion. This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam on August 30, where The Rock lost the title to Triple H.

In the latter half of 1998, The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support. He also started consolidating his famous persona during this time, which would last until 2000. His popularity caused him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members Mark Henry and D&#x27;Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated The Rock at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18 after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.

==== WWF Champion and rise to superstardom (1998–2000) ====
The Rock was then entered into the &quot;Deadly Game&quot; tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series on November 15, where The Rock defeated Vince McMahon&#x27;s associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship. A &quot;double turn&quot; then occurred as The Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind. On December 13, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, The Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when The Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since The Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.

In the main event of the January 4, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Mankind defeated The Rock for the championship after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin. Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, The Rock regained the title in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says &quot;I quit&quot; on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious streak in The Rock&#x27;s character, The Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being risky (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the fifth shot, Mankind was still ringside instead of two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot, which knocked Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying &quot;I Quit&quot; from an earlier interview was played over the public address system. On January 31, during an episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, The Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned The Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF Championship. The two faced off again, at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House on February 14, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, when The Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf. The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV on March 28.

The Rock&#x27;s popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House on April 25. The next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot; The Rock was fired from The Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, a term derived from one of The Rock&#x27;s catchphrases. In the episode, The Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge on May 23, which The Rock won, and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring on June 27, which The Rock lost. The Rock then lost a number one contender&#x27;s match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded on July 25, after interference from &quot;Mr. Ass&quot; Billy Gunn. The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam on August 22. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston).

Shortly after SummerSlam, The Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection. They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. The two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from The Rock&#x27;s past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have The Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a &quot;Raw&quot; segment. The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and won them back from them on the September 20 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. The Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The Rock and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;.

At the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a &quot;false finish&quot;, Big Show intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before The Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before reentering the ring as the winner. But The Rock&#x27;s feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt, though those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing it and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock&#x27;s number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out on February 27, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered. The Rock then defeated Big Show on the March 13 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, in a Fatal Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.

Due to his image at the time, a &quot;&quot; deck archetype was named after him.

==== Record-breaking world champion (2000–2002) ====

In the following weeks, The Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30, at Backlash, after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf. The following night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Rock successfully defended his title against Shane McMahon in a Steel Cage match. On May 21, at Judgment Day, The Rock faced Triple H in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. With the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, The Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6–5 win and the title. The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned. The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit on July 23 at Fully Loaded. The next month, he successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam on August 27. The Rock had another successful title defense against Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker on September 24 at Unforgiven.

The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Kurt Angle at No Mercy on October 22, 2000. The next month, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series on November 19. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship at Armageddon on December 10, which Angle won to retain the title. On the December 18 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, before losing the titles back to Edge and Christian the next night at a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taping. The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title to at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 after Austin allied with Vince McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night&#x27;s &quot;Raw is War&quot;, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H attacked The Rock, allying with McMahon and Austin and helping Austin retain the championship. Austin and Triple H then formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. Johnson used this time off to act in &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;.
The Rock returned in late July when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during what is known as The Invasion storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed The Alliance to compete with the WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated Booker T at SummerSlam on August 19 to win the WCW Championship for the first time. He later lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy on October 21. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; for his second WCW Championship.

As part of the WWF&#x27;s battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a &quot;winner takes all&quot; five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series on November 18 where the losing team&#x27;s company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance&#x27;s team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock&#x27;s WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded &quot;World Championship&quot; following the Alliance&#x27;s loss. At the next pay-per-view, Vengeance on December 9, The Rock lost the World Championship to Jericho, who would then unify the WWF and World titles later that night. The Rock then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002.
At the next pay-per-view, No Way Out on February 17, The Rock defeated The Undertaker in a singles match. The event also saw the WWF debut of the famed WCW faction New World Order (nWo), which at the time consisted of &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall. This later led to a match between The Rock and Hogan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17. The match was billed as &quot;icon versus icon&quot;, with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately The Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8 to win the match. Despite The Rock portraying a heroic character and Hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the SkyDome was rooting heavily for Hogan. In an interview in 2013, Hogan said he and The Rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd&#x27;s response. After the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the WWF held a &quot;draft lottery&quot; on the March 25, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. The Rock was the number one overall pick, going to the SmackDown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.

The Rock made a surprise return on a June episode of &quot;Raw&quot; before going to his assigned brand of SmackDown!. There, he was named the number one contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at Vengeance on July 21, by defeating Kurt Angle and then-champion The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match. The Rock successfully defended the title at the Global Warning event on August 10 against Triple H and Brock Lesnar after pinning Triple H. On August 25, at SummerSlam, The Rock lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998. In 2018, writing for &quot;ESPN.com&quot;, Sean Coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8, The Rock &quot;started to see a dip in fan support&quot; and &quot;that dip turned into a plunge&quot; by the time The Rock had his match with Lesnar at SummerSlam because fans knew he was leaving WWE to pursue an acting career, as evidenced by the negative crowd response during his match with Lesnar. After SummerSlam ended, The Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans booed him. He eventually cut a short promo, declaring that &quot;sing-along with The Rock is over!&quot; The Rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.

==== Hollywood Rock (2003) ====

The Rock returned on the January 30, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to set up another match with Hulk Hogan at No Way Out on February 23. Because of negative fan reaction during previous matches as a result of his budding acting career, The Rock turned heel for the first time since 1999. He also started a new persona that has been called &quot;Hollywood Rock&quot;, with a new look and a shaved head. The Rock defeated Hogan at No Way Out before moving to the Raw brand. There, he had various small feuds, including one with The Hurricane. He also began performing &quot;Rock Concerts&quot;, segments in which he played the guitar and mocked WWE performers and fans in song.

After failing to win a number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won. The Rock won after delivering three consecutive &quot;Rock Bottoms&quot;, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin&#x27;s final match, until WrestleMania 38. The next night, &quot;Raw&quot; was billed as &quot;The Rock Appreciation Night&quot;, in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg. At Backlash on April 27, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then briefly left WWE to film &quot;Walking Tall&quot;.

==== Final feuds and departure (2003–2004) ====
On the June 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock joined the Highlight Reel and attacked Christian and Chris Jericho with Booker T, turning face once again. He would later return on the December 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to help Mick Foley against La Résistance. In 2004, The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution, leading to a reunion of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection. They lost against Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, when Orton pinned Foley after an &quot;RKO&quot;. This was Johnson&#x27;s final wrestling match until November 2011. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He made returns to provide support for Eugene against Jonathan Coachman and made a cameo in his hometown of Miami, where he confronted Randy Orton. On the August 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search, and ended the segment by giving Coachman a &quot;People&#x27;s Elbow&quot;. The Rock&#x27;s contract with WWE then ended and he started his full-time acting career.

==== Non-wrestling appearances (2007–2009) ====
On March 12, 2007, the Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during &quot;Raw&quot;. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump&#x27;s and Vince McMahon&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; Hair vs. Hair match. On March 29, 2008, Johnson inducted his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia into the WWE Hall of Fame. His next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on October 2, 2009, during the &quot;Decade of SmackDown&quot;.

===Independent circuit (2009)===
On September 30, 2009, the Rock appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the professional wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his longtime friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka.

=== Return to WWE ===
==== Feud with John Cena (2011–2013) ====

On February 14, 2011, The Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on &quot;Raw&quot; for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans and started a feud with John Cena. After numerous appearances via satellite, The Rock appeared live on the &quot;Raw&quot; before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena. After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked The Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot;.
On April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, The Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, The Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a double countout. As revenge for the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; Cena had given him on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock hit Cena with the &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, The Rock attacked The Miz and hit him with the &quot;People&#x27;s Elbow&quot;. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson.

The Rock appeared live on &quot;Raw&quot; in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday. On September 16, WWE announced The Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November. But on the October 24 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Cena instead suggested The Rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against The Miz and R-Truth, a team called Awesome Truth, which Rock agreed to the next week. On November 14, during the special &quot;Raw Gets Rocked&quot;, The Rock appeared live, delivering &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;s to Mick Foley, who had been hosting a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;-style segment for Cena, and later both members of Awesome Truth. The Rock and Cena defeated Awesome Truth on November 20 at Survivor Series, when The Rock pinned The Miz. After the match, The Rock gave Cena a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;.
Leading up to WrestleMania, The Rock and Cena had several verbal confrontations on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;. On the March 12, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, The Rock hosted his first &quot;Rock Concert&quot; segment since 2004, mocking Cena in his songs. On April 1, at WrestleMania XXVIII, The Rock defeated Cena in the main event after countering Cena&#x27;s attempt at a &quot;People&#x27;s Elbow&quot; into a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and pinning Cena. This event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. The following night on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, The Rock praised Cena, calling their match &quot;an honor&quot;. He then vowed to once again become WWE Champion.

On July 23, at &quot;Raw 1000&quot;, The Rock announced he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. During the show, he encountered then-reigning WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. The Rock later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be laid out by CM Punk. On the January 7, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock returned to confront his Royal Rumble opponent CM Punk. On January 11, he made his first &quot;SmackDown&quot; appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with Team Rhodes Scholars, resulting in him delivering a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; to Damien Sandow and a &quot;People&#x27;s Elbow&quot; to Cody Rhodes. The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, on January 14, with one of his &quot;Rock Concerts&quot;, leading to a brawl with CM Punk. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked the Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship.
On January 27, at the Royal Rumble, CM Punk would seemingly defeat The Rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked The Rock. Vince McMahon then came out and was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at The Rock&#x27;s request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in The Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship. Punk received a title rematch with The Rock, at Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2013, with the added stipulation that if The Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the WWE Championship. The Rock would pin Punk to defeat him and retain the championship. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his &quot;Brahma Bull&quot; logo. The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, who won that year&#x27;s Royal Rumble to set up a rematch of the previous WrestleMania match between the two at WrestleMania 29, only this time with the WWE Championship on the line.

On April 7, at WrestleMania 29, The Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days. Despite being advertised for &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania, where it was stated that The Rock was still entitled a rematch for the WWE Championship, The Rock did not appear because of a real injury sustained during his match with Cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis. Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons. Post surgery, it made his abdomen look far less muscular than the rest of his body, notably his arms.

==== Part-time appearances (2014–2023) ====

In April 2014, the Rock appeared in the opening segment of WrestleMania XXX along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan. On the October 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Rock made a surprise appearance to confront Rusev and Lana; this resulted in the Rock clearing Rusev from the ring.

The Rock appeared at the 2015 Royal Rumble event on January 25, 2015, during the main event match, where he helped his relative Roman Reigns fend off Big Show and Kane after Reigns eliminated them from the match. Reigns then won the match and the Rock endorsed him in the ring. The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, alongside Ronda Rousey, getting into an in-ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Rock and Rousey prevailed after he attacked Triple H and she overpowered McMahon. On June 27, the Rock appeared at a live event in Boston, where he confronted Bo Dallas and gave him a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;.
On the January 25, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Rock was in a segment that saw him converse with The Miz, Big Show, Lana and Rusev before he and his relatives, The Usos, got into an altercation with then-WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day. The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, where he announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock got into a verbal back-and-forth with Bray Wyatt before having an impromptu match with Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan. The Rock won after giving Rowan a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and pinning him in six seconds, which set the record for the fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by a returning John Cena to fend off Wyatt, Rowan and Braun Strowman.

On the February 20, 2017, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Rock made an untelevised appearance after the broadcast had gone off the air, where he promoted and filmed a scene for his then-upcoming film &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot;. On August 3, 2019, the Rock officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling. On September 30, 2019, after weeks of speculation, the Rock announced that he would appear on &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s 20th Anniversary on October 4, 2019, marking his first appearance on &quot;SmackDown&quot; since October 2014 and his first televised appearance since April 2016. At the event, he cut a promo with Becky Lynch before they were interrupted by King Corbin. After attacking Corbin, the Rock and Lynch celebrated in the ring.

On September 15, 2023, the Rock made a surprise return to SmackDown, in a segment with Pat McAfee and Austin Theory, who Rock took out within the segment. This marked his first televised appearance in WWE since October 4, 2019.

==== The Final Boss (2024–present) ====
It was teased that a former WWE Champion would be appearing on the Day 1 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; on January 1, 2024; the unidentified champion was at first revealed to be Jinder Mahal, who insulted the crowd before being interrupted by The Rock in his first live appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; since 2016. The two brawled and The Rock emerged victorious, after which he asked the crowd if he should sit at &quot;the head of the table&quot; in a direct reference to Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, his relative whose nickname is &quot;The Head of the Table&quot;. The Rock also appeared on the February 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where he confronted Reigns after Royal Rumble winner Cody Rhodes decided against choosing Reigns as his WrestleMania 40 opponent to allow The Rock to face Reigns. This was met by intense backlash from fans who wanted Rhodes to face Reigns; the WrestleMania XL media event on February 8 thus saw The Rock align himself with Reigns, chastise Rhodes for reversing his decision not to choose Reigns as his WrestleMania opponent, and slap Rhodes for speaking out against the Anoaʻi family (of which The Rock and Reigns are both members), thus turning heel for the first time since 2003. As WWE&#x27;s chief creative officer Triple H was being interviewed backstage over what had just transpired, The Rock and Reigns walked by and told him to &quot;fix it&quot; or they would, though Triple H would later appear on &quot;SmackDown&quot; to stand by Rhodes&#x27; decision.
On the February 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, The Rock officially joined Reigns&#x27; faction The Bloodline; he also debuted a new persona that incorporated facets of his arrogant &quot;Hollywood Rock&quot; incarnation from 2003, such as insulting the audience, wearing gaudy expensive clothes, and entering the arena to a new entrance theme that began with his heroic character&#x27;s music before transitioning into his &quot;Hollywood Rock&quot; music. He then appeared on the March 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where he gave his new character the nickname of &quot;The Final Boss&quot; and issued a challenge to Rhodes and Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins: if they beat him and Reigns in a tag team match at WrestleMania Night 1, Rhodes&#x27; championship match against Reigns on Night 2 would be free of interference from The Bloodline, but if Rhodes and Rollins lost, the championship match would be contested under &quot;Bloodline Rules&quot;. On the March 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock attacked Rhodes backstage, leaving him beaten and bloody in the parking lot. During the 2024 WWE Hall of Fame, The Rock received a &quot;People&#x27;s Championship&quot; from Muhammad Ali&#x27;s wife Lonnie, which he would begin carrying over his shoulder whenever he appeared onscreen. In the Night 1 main event of WrestleMania XL, The Rock and Reigns defeated Rhodes and Rollins. During the Night 2 main event between Reigns and Rhodes, multiple people interfered on behalf of both men; The Rock appeared and hit John Cena with a Rock Bottom after the two stared each other down, but The Undertaker then appeared and chokeslammed The Rock. Rhodes went on to defeat Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock interrupted Rhodes&#x27; celebration to congratulate him and reveal that he would be leaving for a while, but would be coming after Rhodes when he returns; this allowed Johnson time off to film the biopic &quot;The Smashing Machine&quot;. During his hiatus, Solo Sikoa became the new leader of The Bloodline, starting the Bloodline Civil War.

Six months later, in the main event of Bad Blood on October 5, Rhodes and Reigns teamed up to face members of The Bloodline (Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu) from which Reigns had been ousted, defeating Sikoa and Fatu with the help of a returning Jimmy Uso. Following the match, The Rock returned and stood at the top of the entrance ramp, where he silently counted to three and made a throat slashing gesture to Reigns, Rhodes, and Uso before leaving.

By the early 2020s, Johnson faced increasing criticism for consistently portraying similar characters, often described as charismatic, larger-than-life figures who are both physically imposing and possess a dry wit.

Johnson will co-produce and star in &quot;The King&quot;, a film about king Kamehameha Kūnuiākea, founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The project will be directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script by Randall Wallace. The movie will be comparable to &quot;Braveheart&quot; in tone, given Wallace&#x27;s work on both films, and will depict the king&#x27;s role in resolving the wars among the islands of Hawaiʻi. &quot;The King&quot; was scheduled to begin production in 2020, but was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Malle () is a municipality located in the Campine region of the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality comprises the villages of Oostmalle and Westmalle. In 2021, Malle had a total population of 15,620. The total area is 51.99 km2.

==History==

===Early history===

The origin and meaning of the word Malle is uncertain: on the one hand it could refer to an extended plain, border or stop, but more likely it refers to a place which was used by the Franks for legal matters. A &quot;Mallum&quot; was a general court session presided by the count. In Irish, the name &quot;Ó Maoileoin&quot;, means a devotee of St. John.

A record of the name Malle emerges for the first time in 1194, when the bishop of Kamerijk donated the altar of Malle and Vorsele to the &quot;Chapter of Our Kind Lady of Antwerp&quot;. Originally Oostmalle, Westmalle and Zoersel were joined into one domain: Malle, which was part of the County Toxandria.

The origin of Oostmalle dates back to the Roman era, when a settlement was built along the Roman road from &quot;Trajectum ad Rhenum&quot; (Utrecht) to Bavay (now approximately the &quot;Lierselei&quot; and the &quot;Hoogstraatsebaan&quot;).

During the Middle Ages (476–1492), Oostmalle was part of the Duchy of Brabant, governed by lords like Jan Van Hesselbeke and Jan Volckaert (around 1300). The &quot;lower&quot; feudal rights belonged to the House of Breda, the &quot;higher&quot; rights belonged to the Duke of Brabant.

Westmalle&#x27;s origin dates to before 1100, when the place of residence (&quot;Mansus&quot;) of the representative (&quot;Villicus&quot; or &quot;Meier&quot;) of the Duke of Brabant was mentioned in historical record. The history of Westmalle Castle reflects the history of the governing families of Westmalle. Henry I, Duke of Brabant granted some feudal rights to the abbot of the Abbey of Villers on the condition that a monastery would be built in Westmalle. However, the monastery was built in Hemiksem instead.

===Separation of Malle===

In the first half of the 13th century Malle was separated when the County of Strijen was divided; Oostmalle came to belong to the County of Breda, Westmalle and Zoersel remained with the Duchy of Brabant. Westmalle was governed by a local &quot;Meier&quot; belonging subsequently to the families van der Moelen, de Cotereau en Powis and also by the Abbot of the Abbey of Villers. About 1300 the feudal rights of Oostmalle were divided between Jan van Hesselbeke and Jacobus van Dworp. Jan Volkaert I, was married with the daughter of the Jan van Hesselbeke. He owned half of the feudal rights of Oostmalle, while the other half was owned by his brother-in-law Jacob van Couree. Later on the feudal rights went to the Lords of Berchem. Between 1431 and 1464 Willem van Berchem built a castle in Oostmalle. By the end of the 16th century, from 1602 onwards, during the entire Ancien Régime, all feudal rights of Oostmalle belonged to the family &quot;van Renesse&quot; (French: de Renesse), descendants of Jan van Renesse.

===16th to 18th century===

Almost continuously the Campine villages were plundered and besieged; foreign troops caused severe havoc, and also brought with them diseases like the Bubonic plague. Oostmalle suffered most from the plague between 1575 and 1605.

In 1542, during the wars of Charles of Guelders against Charles V, Oostmalle and Renesse Castle were destroyed by the troops of Maarten van Rossum. The entire region suffered severely during the Eighty Years War, between the Protestant north of the Low Countries and the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands.

During the 1580s, only 23 families survived in Westmalle and they had to hide for four years at Westmalle Castle because of the Spanish troops, who were ravaging the region. During the 17th century the region suffered from several attacks from the Dutch Republic. Around 1620, Croatian (In old Flemish: &quot;Krawaten&quot;) soldiers of the Spanish army occupied Malle. In 1626 a &quot;Chapel of Saint Anthony&quot; was built in Salphen for people from Oostmalle who fled their village to escape the plague. At the end of the 17th century, during the Dutch War (1672–1678) Westmalle was almost entirely burned to ashes.

At the start of the 18th century, the region suffered during the War of the Spanish Succession when French troops occupied Malle in 1703. Following the French Revolutionary Wars the Austrian Netherlands were invaded and annexed by the First French Republic in 1792. Shortly after the invasion of the French army, an epidemic of dysentery hit Malle.

===Modern era===

After the defeat of Napoleon I of France in 1814, Cossacks occupied Malle and plundered the village.
Only after the Dutch rule during the period of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830) and the establishment of the kingdom of Belgium, came a period of increasing prosperity for the region. In 1885 Oostmalle became the centre for the Tram network of the region, which would last until 1962. During World War I and World War II Malle escaped severe damage. On 25 June 1967, Oostmalle was hit by a tornado which destroyed the church and 135 houses.

On 1 January 1977 Oostmalle and Westmalle were reunited, first under the name Westmalle, and since 30 June 1979 under the original name Malle.

==Tourism==
Important curiosities in Malle include the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle and its brewery, Renesse Castle, the Scherpenberg mill, Westmalle Castle which dates back to 1100, and the Castle of Blommerschot. The Chapel of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (Dutch: Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Bijstand) at the Herentalsebaan was built by Leonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies in 1837. In 1930 a Lourdes cave was added to the chapel (inaugurated on 7 May 1933), and in 1934 a Stations of the Cross was added in remembrance of King Albert I of Belgium. The sculptor of the latter was Simon Gossens.

Malle has three churches: the Church of Saint Lawrence (Dutch: Sint Laurentius, Oostmalle), the Church of Saint Paul (Dutch: Sint Paulus, Westmalle) and the Church of Saint Martin (Dutch: Sint Martinus, Westmalle). The most important local festival is called &quot;Salphenkermis&quot;, which is held in the hamlet Salphen in honor of Saint Anthony.

The forests of Herenbos, Molenbos (Drieboomkesberg), Bruulbergen and Schrabbenbos are also worth a visit.

==Economy==

===History===
Malle is located in the Campine (Dutch: Kempen) region, which historically was not densely populated, and consisted of enormous heaths and marshlands, interrupted by woods and swampland. Since the Middle Ages the majority of the land in the Campine has been cultivated.

Until the 18th century Oostmalle was known for its black pottery, such as &quot;Lollepotten&quot; which were small stoves used for room heating in winter.

===Modern era===
Nowadays, Malle is a regional economic centre. It is home to several companies like ETAP Lighting, ETAP Yachting, Ecover, and Meubelfabrieken Karel Mintjens (among the TOP500 of the Belgian Companies).

On 5 April 1943, the Minerva car factory, then used to repair Luftwaffe planes, was the target of a bombing raid by the USAAF. Most bombs missed the target and hit a residential area instead, resulting in the deaths of 936 civilians, including 209 children, exceeding the civilian death toll of the Guernica raid which modern estimates put at 400.

The last V2 launched against Antwerp also fell in Mortsel, killing 27 people, on 27 March 1945.

<text>Schoten () is a municipality located in Antwerp Province, Belgium. The municipality only comprises the town of Schoten proper. As of 1 January 2020 Schoten has a total population of 34,311. The total area is which gives a population density of . Schoten borders the Antwerp districts Merksem to the west and Deurne to the south west. Neighboring municipalities include Brasschaat to the north, Brecht to the north east, Schilde to the east, and Wijnegem to the south.

==History==
===Early Middle Ages===
The history and usage of the name Schoten may have come from the name given to the wooden dividing walls (&quot;schot&quot; in Dutch) that were driven in the ground to separate private property. The Christianization of the area dates from the end of the 7th century, under the influence of Abbot Ursmarus, of Lobbes Abbey, which owned property here.

In the 12th century, the territory was under the political authority of the lords of Breda, then of the lords of Bergen-op-Zoom. Religiously, it was administered by the Villers Abbey.

===16th century until today===
Already by the beginning of the 16th century, well-off burghers and merchants from neighboring Antwerp built castles in Schoten as secondary residences. The local community succeeded, however, in maintaining its rural Campine character until well into the 19th century. Industry first developed on the border with Merksem, later along the Albert Canal. Much of the rest of the town&#x27;s territory was kept green and was again used by neighboring Antwerp residents for building extensive villas such as &quot;Koningshof&quot; and &quot;Schotenhof&quot;. Today about 30% of Schoten&#x27;s territory still consists of forested areas, a great achievement given its location only away from the center of Antwerp.

==Main sights==

*The water-encircled Schoten castle started as a farm in the 13th century, and is now converted into a local cultural centre.
*The main square is lined with a Gothic Revival city hall and adorned with a Till Eulenspiegel fountain.
*The Villers castle also dates from the 13th century, while the Gothic-style church of St-Cordula dates from the 15th century.
*Schoten also has a number of nature reservations and wooded areas, such as the Peerdsbos, the Vordensteyn domain, &#x27;t Asbroek, Wijtschot or the municipal park.
*Schotenhof is an area of Schoten located in the north-east of the municipality. It was created in the beginning of the 20th century, a time when in several wood-rich municipalities around Antwerp the local castles were divided into lots to allow for the building of residential houses and vacation cottages.

==Events and Sports==
*The World Festival of Folklore Schoten, a folk dance festivity founded in 1959, takes place annually in the summer.
*The Scheldeprijs, an annual cycling race taking place in April, starts in Antwerp and finishes in Schoten.
*The local football club is the KFC Schoten SK.

==Politics==
===Municipal council===
The municipal council, per the outcome of the 2018 local elections, is a coalition of NV-A (16 seats) and Open-VLD (1 seat), a total of 17 out of 31 seats.

===Council of Mayor and Aldermen===

<doc id="156150" wikidata="Q244690" url="?curid=156150" title="Zwijndrecht, Belgium">
<text>Zwijndrecht () is a former municipality located in the Flemish province of East Flanders, in Belgium. On January 1, 2025, it fused with the municipalities of Beveren and Kruibeke to form the new municipality of Beveren-Kruibeke-Zwijndrecht, which resulted in it moving from the province of Antwerp to that of East Flanders. As well as Zwijndrecht proper, the former municipality includes the village of Burcht. In 2021, Zwijndrecht had a total population of 19,263.

==History==
===Origin of the name===

The name Zwijndrecht is derived from the old Germanic words &quot;swina drifti.&quot; The words &quot;swina&quot; and &quot;drifti&quot; are synonyms and both mean creek. &quot;Drifti&quot; evolved from to ; the suffix – appears frequently in place-names north of the river Scheldt, where streams and creeks are abundant.

===Early history===
While very little archaeological excavation has been done in the municipality of Zwijndrecht itself, numerous findings have been documented in the surrounding region, which is referred to as the Waasland. These have indicated occupation in the area from as early as the end of the Neolithic Period (-1800 B.C.). Numerous indications of Roman occupation have also been uncovered in the Waasland area.

In the early Middle Ages, Zwijndrecht-Burcht was sparsely populated, its landscape consisting mainly of wet woodland and small settlements separated by forests. This situation remained until the latter half of the 11th century, when an increase in population necessitated changes in land use: the forests between settlements were cleared and fields were formed into communal agricultural spaces, using a three-course crop rotation system. These were referred to as &quot;kouters&quot; or ploughshares. Raised paths through the wetlands evolved into dikes, and by the 14th century, polders were in use.

=== Feudal Period ===

On 15 April 1281 the Count of Flanders, Gwijde van Dampierre, granted manorial rights to Nikolaas van Kets, making him Lord of Zwijndrecht. The seat of the Lords of Zwijndrecht was a manor house called the Kraaienhof (the ruins of which were demolished in the mid-20th century), which was located in what is now the village of Burcht. The van Kets held the manorial rights until 1445, when Wouter van Kets sold them to Jan Vilain. They passed by inheritance to the van Montmorency family. Due to financial pressures, the heir Filips II de Montmorency, Count of Horne (1524-1568) was forced to sell the title, property and rights to a conglomeration of four cities, Brugge, Gent, Ieper and the Brugse Vrije, known as the &quot;Vier Leden&quot; (four members). After rebelling against Spanish rule during the Eighty Years War, the Vier Leden were forced to forfeit the property to the Spanish crown in 1585, but it was later returned to them. The dikes and infrastructure were so badly damaged and neglected during the Eighty Years War, that the Vier Leden were forced to loan money for repairs and restoration from Jan van Hove. When the Vier Leden defaulted on the loan, the property, rights and title defaulted to Jan van Hove, making him the new Lord of Zwijndrecht-Burcht. Van Hove held the property until 1621, when the Staten van Vlaanderen (formerly the Vier Leden) was able to pay its debts and reacquire it. After regaining the property, the Staten van Vlaanderen promptly auctioned it off to the highest bidder, an Italian businessman named Jacomo Antonio Carenna, who then became Lord of Zwijndrecht and Burcht. In 1666, he divided the property between his two sons, Jan Francisco Carenna (Zwijndrecht) and Ignacius Carenna (Burcht). Burcht and Zwijndrecht became separate villages and remained so until they were reunited as the municipality of Zwijndrecht in 1977.

For the further history specifically of Burcht, see the article on Burcht.

Paulo Carenna, Lord of Zwijndrecht and grandson of Jacomo Carenna, auctioned off the property and title on Antwerp&#x27;s historical Vrijdagmarkt in 1699. It was purchased by Jacques de Lannoy. It passed by inheritance through his daughter Anne Marie de Lannoy to his son-in-law, Daniel Gerardo Melijn in 1732. Daniel Malijn&#x27;s heir was also a daughter, Anna Marie Isabella Melijn, and therefore her husband Louis Balthasar de Heuvel became Lord of Zwijndrecht. Louis Balthasar de Heuvel&#x27;s son, Louis Charles Joseph de Heuvel, fought for his mother&#x27;s inheritance in court as his father did not want to give it up to him. However, before the case could be resolved, the French Revolution and the resultant dissolution of feudal rights and titles made their legal conflict moot. At this point Louis Charles Joseph, who had become broken and paranoid of his father&#x27;s wrath, became a vagabond. He died in a French prison in 1800.

===Industrialization: the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries===
Geographically and historically, Zwijndrecht and Burcht were originally part of the province of East Flanders, which fell under the jurisdiction of the Count of Flanders. However, in 1923, the two villages were transferred to the Province of Antwerp. The villages were primarily agrarian, but by the middle of the nineteenth century, Burcht had become the site of heavy industry. The fertile land in Borgerweert (part of Burcht) was filled in with dredged slurry from the river Scheldt to accommodate the building of factories. Among the industries established there at the time were a guano factory, a linoleum factory, a cement factory, a pots and pans factory, and a lard processing plant. It is currently the seat of the Ytong plant, which manufactures building blocks. The Lt. Thoumsin military base, which houses the 11th Battalion of Engineers of the Belgian army, is also located in Burcht.

In the nineteenth century, Zwijndrecht became a bedroom community for Antwerp, while mostly maintaining its agrarian character. It became heavily industrialized in the twentieth century, becoming the location for numerous industries, most of which are clustered around harbors on the Scheldt.

===World Wars===

During World War I, Zwijndrecht and Burcht and its two forts were part of the Belgian defensive line. By 1914, the two villages were full of Belgian soldiers, and orders were issued to reinforce the Fort of Zwijndrecht and the Fort of Kruibeke. Local civilian residents were recruited for the reinforcement work, soldiers were quartered in private homes and factories, farmers were required to loan their horses and carts for military use, and food and goods were confiscated for the military. In spite of all efforts, Belgium fell to the Germans in October 1914 and Burcht and Zwijndrecht, like all the German-occupied communities in Belgium, suffered greatly for the next four years from food shortages. By the end of the war, 80 young people from Zwijndrecht and Burcht had perished on the front. 82 civilian unemployed civilians from Burcht as well as 99 non-unemployed citizens had been deported to Germany as forced labor. In addition, 5 civilians were deported to Germany for political reasons. A total of 8 citizens from Burcht died as a result of these deportations. Zwijndrecht counted 155 forced laborers and civilian prisoners deported to Germany, of which 5 did not survive. Three of these, Jan Baptist Wathy and Jozef and Frans Van Gaever died when the ship transporting them was torpedoed.

By 1939, Zwindrecht and Burcht were once again preparing for war with Germany. On 18 May 1940 the Swastika flag had already been raised on the Antwerp Cathedral. Although retreating Belgian troops attempted to blow up the two tunnels leading to the left bank of the Scheldt to prevent the Germans from crossing easily, the explosives in the pedestrian tunnel failed to detonate completely, allowing the German troops to cross the river. During the resulting battle on the streets of Zwijndrecht, 16 German and 29 Belgian soldiers died, in addition to 32 civilians.

After years of Nazi occupation, the British army liberated Antwerp in September 1944. In an attempt to prevent the Allies from being able to use the Port of Antwerp, the Germans bombarded the harbor with V-1 and V-2 rockets. However, most of the rockets missed their intended target (the port) and fell instead in the surrounding areas, including Burcht and Zwijndrecht. A total of 76 V-bombs fell on Zwijndrecht-Burcht between 25 October 1944 and 28 March 1945. In Zwindrecht, a total of 19 civilians were killed and 48 were wounded by the V-rockets and 85 houses were rendered uninhabitable. In Burcht, 14 citizens were killed. 50 houses were destroyed completely, and more than 250 houses were badly damaged.
=== Contemporary ===

The 3M factory located in Zwijndrecht has caused toxic levels of PFOS pollution that is expected to impact agriculture in a 15 kilometers radius. Large amounts of PFOS were discovered in 2018 in the ground near the 3M site, where it had produced this substance until 2002, when the construction of Oosterweel Link, a massive construction project to complete the R1 Antwerp Ring Road, began.

<doc id="156154" wikidata="Q645917" url="?curid=156154" title="Chinese culture">
<text>Chinese culture () is one of the world&#x27;s oldest cultures, originating thousands of years ago. The culture prevails across a large geographical region in East Asia with Sinosphere in whole and is extremely diverse, with customs and traditions varying greatly between counties, provinces, cities, towns. The terms &#x27;China&#x27; and the geographical landmass of &#x27;China&#x27; have shifted across the centuries, before the name &#x27;China&#x27; became commonplace in modernity.

Chinese civilization is historically considered a dominant culture of East Asia. With China being one of the earliest ancient civilizations, Chinese culture exerts profound influence on the philosophy, virtue, etiquette, and traditions of Asia. Chinese characters, ceramics, architecture, music, dance, literature, martial arts, cuisine, arts, philosophy, etiquette, religion, politics, and history have had global influence, while its traditions and festivals are celebrated, instilled, and practiced by people around the world.

==Identity==
As early as the Zhou dynasty, the Chinese government divided Chinese people into four classes: gentry, farmer, craftsman, and merchant. Gentry and farmers constituted the two major classes, while merchant and craftsmen were collected into the two minor. Theoretically, except for the position of the Emperor, nothing was hereditary.

China&#x27;s majority ethnic group, the Han Chinese, are an East Asian ethnic group and nation. They constitute approximately 92% of the population of China, 95% of Taiwan (Han Taiwanese), 76% of Singapore, 23% of Malaysia, and about 17% of the global population, making them the world&#x27;s largest ethnic group, numbering over 1.3 billion people.

In modern China, there are 56 officially labelled ethnic groups. Throughout Chinese history, many non-Han foreigners like the Indo-Iranians became Han Chinese through assimilation, other groups retained their distinct ethnic identities, or faded away. At the same time, the Han Chinese majority has maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions throughout the ages. The term &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; () has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general. Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name.

==The characteristics of Chinese culture==

The chapter discusses the contemporary situations in Chinese culture that relate to social structure, sociocultural change, and the relationship of these factors to the current state of mental health of the Chinese people. The chapter focuses on the issues of mind, body, and behavior. The cultural framework is of central concern to Chinese participants, whether they are social scientists, humanists, or clinical psychiatrists. Chinese culture appears to affect the state of body and health, parent–child interaction, social relationships, individual and group aspirations, models of health care services, and the patterns of disorders and methods of coping under the impact of migration, industrialization, and urbanization. The chapter focuses on the importance of the impact of cultural tradition upon perception, behavioral orientation, pathology, coping, and help-seeking. The mental health concerns that are relevant to the population of mainland China are related to the recent dramatic socialist revolution and particularly to the 10-year period of the Cultural Revolution.

==Abstract==
Chinese civilization is the only one that has preserved its historical continuity among the world&#x27;s “cradles for four ancient civilizations.” In the long process of civilization evolution, the Chinese people, in the spirit of “continuous self-renewal,” “self-discipline and social commitment,” “inclusiveness to diversity,” and “realism and adaptation to changes,” created cultural traditions of abundant contents, sophisticated structures, and various forms. These traditions have since been nourishing, nurturing, and shaping the Chinese people and become internalized in the blood and soul of the Chinese nation.

==Regional==


During the 361 years of civil war after the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), there was a partial restoration of feudalism when wealthy and powerful families emerged with large amounts of land and huge numbers of semi-serfs. They dominated important civilian and military positions of the government, making the positions available to members of their own families and clans. The Tang dynasty extended the imperial examination system as an attempt to eradicate this feudalism. Traditional Chinese culture covers large geographical territories, where each region is usually divided into distinct sub-cultures. Each region is often represented by three ancestral items. For example, Guangdong is represented by chenpi, aged ginger and hay. The ancient city of Lin&#x27;an (Hangzhou), is represented by tea leaf, bamboo shoot trunk, and hickory nut. Such distinctions give rise to the old Chinese proverb: &quot;十里不同風, 百里不同俗/十里不同風&quot;: &quot;praxis vary within ten &quot;li&quot;, customs vary within a hundred &quot;li&quot;&quot;. The 31 provincial-level divisions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China are grouped by its former administrative areas from 1949 to 1980, and are now known as traditional regions.

==Social structure==

Since the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period, some form of Chinese monarch has been the main ruler above all. Different periods of history have different names for the various positions within society. Conceptually each imperial or feudal period is similar, with the government and military officials ranking high in the hierarchy, and the rest of the population under regular Chinese law. From the late Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) onwards, traditional Chinese society was organized into a hierarchic system of socio-economic classes known as the four occupations.

However, this system did not cover all social groups and the distinctions between the groups became blurred after the commercialization of Chinese culture in the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). Ancient Chinese education also has a long history; ever since the Sui dynasty (581–618 CE), educated candidates prepared for the imperial examinations and exam graduates were drafted into government as scholar-bureaucrats. This led to the creation of a meritocracy, although success was available only to males who could afford test preparation. Imperial examinations required applicants to write essays and demonstrate mastery of the Confucian classics. Those who passed the highest level of the exam became elite scholar-officials known as &quot;jinshi&quot;, a highly esteemed socio-economic position. A major mythological structure developed around the topic of the mythology of the imperial exams. Trades and crafts were usually taught by a shifu. The female historian Ban Zhao wrote the &quot;Lessons for Women&quot; in the Han dynasty and outlined the four virtues women must abide by, while scholars such as Zhu Xi and Cheng Yi would expand on this. Chinese marriage and Taoist sexual practices are some of the rituals and customs found in society.

With the rise of European economic and military power beginning in the mid-19th century, non-Chinese systems of social and political organization gained adherents in China. Some of these would-be reformers totally rejected China&#x27;s cultural legacy, while others sought to combine the strengths of Chinese and European cultures. In essence, the history of 20th-century China is one of experimentation with new systems of social, political, and economic organization that would allow for the reintegration of the nation in the wake of dynastic collapse.

==Spiritual values==

Most spiritual practices are derived from Chinese Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. The relative influence of each school of practice is a subject of debate and other practices, such as Neo-Confucianism, Buddhism and others, have been introduced. Reincarnation and other rebirth concepts are a reminder of the connection between real-life and the after-life. In Chinese business culture, the concept of &quot;guanxi&quot;, indicating the primacy of relations over rules, has been well documented. While many deities are part of the tradition, some of the most recognized holy figures include Guan Yin, the Jade Emperor and Buddha.

Chinese Buddhism has shaped some Chinese art, literature and philosophy. The translation of a large body of foreign Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and the inclusion of these translations, together with works composed in China, into a printed canon had far-reaching implications for the dissemination of Buddhism throughout China. Chinese Buddhism is also marked by the interaction between Indian religions, Chinese folk religion, and Taoism.

===Religion===
During the Xia and Shang dynasties, Chinese religion was oriented to worshipping the supreme god Shang Di, with the king and diviners acting as priests and using oracle bones. The Zhou dynasty oriented religion to worshipping the broader concept of heaven. A large part of Chinese culture is based in the belief in a spiritual world. Countless methods of divination have helped answer questions, even serving as an alternative to medicine. Folklores have helped fill the gap between things that cannot be explained. There is often a blurred line between myth, religion and unexplained phenomenon. Many of the stories have since evolved into traditional Chinese holidays. Other concepts have extended beyond mythology into spiritual symbols such as Door god and the Imperial guardian lions. Along with the belief in the divine beings, there is belief in evil beings. Practices such as Taoist exorcism fighting mogwai and jiangshi with peachwood swords are just some of the concepts passed down from generations. A few Chinese fortune telling rituals are still in use today after thousands of years of refinement.

Taoism, a religious or philosophical tradition of Chinese origin, emphasizes living in harmony with the &quot;Tao&quot; (, literally &quot;Way&quot;, also romanized as &quot;Dao&quot;). The &quot;Tao&quot; is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order. Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize &quot;wu wei&quot; (effortless action), &quot;naturalness&quot;, simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: 慈 &quot;compassion&quot;, 儉/俭 &quot;frugality&quot;, and 谦 &quot;humility&quot;. The roots of Taoism can be traced back to at least the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of China&#x27;s oldest texts, the &quot;Yijing&quot;, which expounds a philosophical system of human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The &quot;Legalist&quot; Shen Buhai may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi (), is widely considered the keystone work of the Taoist tradition, together with the later writings of Zhuangzi.

===Philosophy and legalism===
Confucianism, also known as Ruism, was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China&#x27;s history, and mastery of Confucian texts was the primary criterion for entry into the imperial bureaucracy. A number of more authoritarian strains of thought have also been influential, such as Legalism.There was often conflict between the philosophies, e.g. the Song dynasty Neo-Confucians believed Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of New Confucians (not to be confused with Neo-Confucianism) have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian &quot;Asian values&quot;.

Confucianism is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life. Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of the values of the Zhou dynasty golden age of several centuries before. In the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the &quot;proto-Taoist&quot; Huang-Lao, as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism.

===Hundred Schools of Thought===

The Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophies and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BC, during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period of ancient China. While this period was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it was an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China. It came to be known as the Golden Age of Chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and could be freely discussed. This phenomenon has been called the &quot;Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought&quot; (百家爭鳴/百家争鸣; &quot;bǎijiā zhēngmíng&quot;; &quot;pai-chia cheng-ming&quot;; &quot;hundred schools contend&quot;). The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in China and across East Asia. The intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy. This period ended with the rise of the imperial Qin dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent. A traditional source for this period is the &quot;Shiji&quot;, or &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian. The autobiographical section of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, the &quot;Taishigong Zixu&quot; (太史公自序), refers to the schools of thought described below.

Mohism was an ancient Chinese philosophy of logic, rational thought and science developed by the academic scholars who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (–). The philosophy is embodied in an eponymous book: the &quot;Mozi&quot;. Another group is the School of the Military (兵家; &quot;Bingjia&quot;) that studied warfare and strategy; Sunzi and Sun Bin were influential leaders. The School of Naturalists was a Warring States era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements; Zou Yan is considered the founder of this school. His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth).

==Language==

The ancient written standard was Classical Chinese. It was used for thousands of years, but was mostly used by scholars and intellectuals in the upper class society called &quot;shi da fu (士大夫)&quot;. It was difficult, but possible, for ordinary people to enter this class by passing written exams. Calligraphy later became commercialized, and works by famous artists became prized possessions. Chinese literature has a long past; the earliest classic work in Chinese, the &quot;I Ching&quot; or &quot;Book of Changes&quot;, dates to around 1000 BC. A flourishing of philosophy during the Warring States period produced such noteworthy works as Confucius&#x27;s &quot;Analects&quot; and Laozi&#x27;s &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. (See also: Chinese classics) Dynastic histories were often written, beginning with Sima Qian&#x27;s seminal &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, written from 109 BC to 91 BC. The Tang dynasty witnessed a poetic flowering, while the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature were written during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Printmaking in the form of movable type was developed during the Song dynasty. Academies of scholars sponsored by the empire were formed to comment on the classics in both printed and handwritten form. Members of royalty frequently participated in these discussions.

Chinese philosophers, writers and poets were highly respected and played key roles in preserving and promoting the culture of the empire. Some classical scholars, however, were noted for their daring depictions of the lives of the common people, often to the displeasure of authorities.

===Varieties of dialect and writing system===

At the start of the 20th century, most of the population were still illiterate, and the many languages spoken (Mandarin, Wu, Yue (Cantonese), Min Nan (Ban-lam-gu), Jin, Xiang, Hakka, Gan, Hui, Ping etc.) in different regions prevented spoken communication with people from other areas. However, the written language made communication possible, such as passing on official orders and documents throughout the entire region of China. Reformers set out to establish a national language, settling on the Beijing-based Mandarin as the spoken form. After the May 4th Movement, Classical Chinese was quickly replaced by written vernacular Chinese, modeled after the vocabulary and grammar of the standard spoken language.

==Calligraphy==


Chinese calligraphy is a form of writing (calligraphy), or, the artistic expression of human language in a tangible form. There are some general standardizations of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, &quot;Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients.&quot; Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including seal carving, ornate paperweights, and inkstones.

In China, calligraphy is referred to as &quot;Shūfǎ&quot; (書法/书法), literally &quot;the way/method/law of writing&quot;. In Japan it is referred to as &quot;Shodō&quot; (), literally &quot;the way/principle of writing&quot;; and in Korea as &quot;Seoye&quot; (서예; 書藝) literally &quot;the skill/criterion of writing&quot;. Chinese calligraphy is normally regarded as one of the &quot;arts&quot; (Chinese 藝術/艺术 ) in the countries where it is practised. Chinese calligraphy focuses not only on methods of writing but also on cultivating one&#x27;s character (人品) and taught as a discipline (書法; , &quot;the rules of writing Han characters&quot;).

==Literature==

The Zhou dynasty is often regarded as the touchstone of Chinese cultural development. Concepts covered in the Chinese classic texts include poetry, astrology, astronomy, the calendar, and constellations. Some of the most important early texts include the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the &quot;Shujing&quot; within the Four Books and Five Classics. Many Chinese concepts such as Yin and Yang, Qi, Four Pillars of Destiny in relation to heaven and earth were theorized in the pre-imperial periods. By the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese culture had embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for the common citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were considered pioneers in modern literature at that time. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the study of Chinese modern literature gradually increased. Modern-era literature has influenced modern interpretations of nationhood and the creation of a sense of national spirit.

===Poetry in the Tang dynasty===
Tang poetry refers to poetry written in or around the time of, or in the characteristic style of, China&#x27;s Tang dynasty (18 June 618 – 4 June 907, including the 690–705 reign of Wu Zetian) or that follows a certain style, often considered the Golden Age of Chinese poetry. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone. This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. Two of the most famous poets of the period were Li Bai and Du Fu. Tang poetry has had an ongoing influence on world literature and modern and quasi-modern poetry. The &quot;Quantangshi&quot; (&quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot;) anthology compiled in the early eighteenth century includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors.

The &quot;Quantangwen&quot; (全唐文, &quot;Complete Tang Prose&quot;), despite its name, contains more than 1,500 &quot;fu&quot; and is another widely consulted source for Tang poetry. Despite their names, these sources are not comprehensive, and the manuscripts discovered at Dunhuang in the twentieth century included many &quot;shi&quot; and some &quot;fu&quot;, as well as variant readings of poems that were also included in the later anthologies. There are also collections of individual poets&#x27; work, which generally can be dated earlier than the Qing anthologies, although few earlier than the eleventh century. Only about a hundred Tang poets have such collected editions extant. Another important source is anthologies of poetry compiled during the Tang dynasty, although only thirteen such anthologies survive in full or in part. Many records of poetry, as well as other writings, were lost when the Tang capital of Changan was damaged by war in the eighth and ninth centuries, so that while more than 50,000 Tang poems survive (more than any earlier period in Chinese history), this still likely represents only a small portion of the poetry that was actually produced during the period. Many seventh-century poets are reported by the 721 imperial library catalog as having left behind massive volumes of poetry, of which only a tiny portion survives, and there are notable gaps in the poetic œuvres of even Li Bai and Du Fu, the two most celebrated Tang poets.

===&quot;Ci&quot; in Song dynasty===
Ci (辭/辞) are a poetic form, a type of lyric poetry, done in the tradition of Classical Chinese poetry. &quot;Ci&quot; use a set of poetic meters derived from a base set of certain patterns, in fixed-rhythm, fixed-tone, and variable line-length formal types, or model examples: the rhythmic and tonal pattern of the &quot;ci&quot; are based upon certain, definitive musical song tunes. They are also known as &quot;Changduanju&quot; (長短句/长短句, &quot;lines of irregular lengths&quot;) and &quot;Shiyu&quot; (詩餘/诗馀, &quot;that which is beside poetry&quot;).Typically the number of characters in each line and the arrangement of tones were determined by one of around 800 set patterns, each associated with a particular title, called &quot;cípái&quot; 詞牌/词牌. Originally they were written to be sung to a tune of that title, with set rhythm, rhyme, and tempo. The Song dynasty was also a period of great scientific literature, and saw the creation of works such as Su Song&#x27;s &quot;Xin Yixiang Fayao&quot; and Shen Kuo&#x27;s &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;. There were also enormous works of historiography and large encyclopedias, such as Sima Guang&#x27;s &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; of 1084 or the &quot;Four Great Books of Song&quot; fully compiled and edited by the 11th century.

Notable Confucianists, Taoists and scholars of all classes have made significant contributions to and from documenting history to authoring saintly concepts that seem hundreds of years ahead of time. Although the oldest surviving textual examples of surviving &quot;ci&quot; are from 8th century CE Dunhuang manuscripts, beginning in the poetry of the Liang dynasty, the &quot;ci&quot; followed the tradition of the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; and the &quot;yuefu&quot;: they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs into a sophisticated literary genre; although in the case of the &quot;ci&quot; form some of its fixed-rhythm patterns have an origin in Central Asia. The form was further developed in the Tang dynasty. Although the contributions of Li Bo (also known as Li Po, 701 – 762) are fraught with historical doubt, certainly the Tang poet Wen Tingyun (812–870) was a great master of the &quot;ci&quot;, writing it in its distinct and mature form. One of the more notable practitioners and developers of this form was Li Yu of the Southern Tang dynasty during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. However, the &quot;ci&quot; form of Classical Chinese poetry is especially associated with the poetry of the Song dynasty, during which it was indeed a popular poetic form. A revival of the &quot;ci&quot; poetry form occurred during the end of the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the Qing dynasty which was characterized by an exploration of the emotions connected with romantic love together with its valorization, often in a context of a brief poetic story narrative within a &quot;ci&quot; poem or a linked group of &quot;ci&quot; poems in an application of the &quot;chuanqi&quot; form of short story tales to poetry.

===&quot;Qu&quot; in Yuan dynasty===
The &quot;Qu&quot; form of poetry is a type of Classical Chinese poetry form, consisting of words written in one of a number of certain, set tone patterns, based upon the tunes of various songs. Thus Qu poems are lyrics with lines of varying longer and shorter lengths, set according to the certain and specific, fixed patterns of rhyme and tone of conventional musical pieces upon which they are based and after which these matched variations in lyrics (or individual Qu poems) generally take their name. The fixed-tone type of verse such as the Qu and the &quot;ci&quot; together with the &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; forms of poetry comprise the three main forms of Classical Chinese poetry. In Chinese literature, the Qu () form of poetry from the Yuan dynasty may be called &quot;Yuanqu&quot; (元曲 P: &quot;Yuánqǔ&quot;, W: &quot;Yüan-chü&quot;). Qu may be derived from Chinese opera, such as the &quot;Zaju&quot; (雜劇/杂剧), in which case these Qu may be referred to as &quot;sanqu&quot; (散曲). The &quot;San&quot; in &quot;Sanqu&quot; refers to the detached status of the &quot;Qu&quot; lyrics of this verse form: in other words, rather than being embedded as part of an opera performance the lyrics stand separately on their own. Since the &quot;Qu&quot; became popular during the late Southern Song dynasty, and reached a special height of popularity in the poetry of the Yuan dynasty, therefore it is often called &quot;Yuanqu&quot; (元曲), specifying the type of &quot;Qu&quot; found in Chinese opera typical of the Yuan dynasty era. Both &quot;Sanqu&quot; and &quot;Ci&quot; are lyrics written to fit a different melodies, but &quot;Sanqu&quot; differs from &quot;Ci&quot; in that it is more colloquial, and is allowed to contain &quot;Chenzi&quot; (襯字/衬字 &quot;filler words&quot; which are additional words to make a more complete meaning). &quot;Sanqu&quot; can be further divided into &quot;Xiaoling&quot; (小令) and &quot;Santao&quot; (散套), with the latter containing more than one melody.

===The novels in Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty===
The Four Great Classical or Classic Novels of Chinese literature are the four novels commonly regarded by Chinese literary criticism to be the greatest and most influential of pre-modern Chinese fiction. Dating from the Ming and Qing dynasties, they are well known to most Chinese either directly or through their many adaptations to Chinese opera and other forms of popular culture. They are among the world&#x27;s longest and oldest novels and are considered to be the pinnacle of China&#x27;s literary achievement in classic novels, influencing the creation of many stories, plays, movies, games, and other forms of entertainment across other parts of East Asia.

Chinese fiction, rooted in narrative classics such as &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;, &quot;Sou Shen Ji&quot;, &quot;Wenyuan Yinghua&quot;, &quot;Da Tang Xiyu Ji&quot;, &quot;Youyang Zazu&quot;, &quot;Taiping Guangji&quot;, and official histories, developed into the novel as early as the Song dynasty. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th to 18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and were more historically minded. They appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, and relative emphasis on collective behavior and the welfare of the society.

The rise of a money economy and urbanization beginning in the Song era led to a professionalization of entertainment which was further encouraged by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy, and education. In both China and Western Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late Ming dynasty and early Qing dynasty was varied, self-conscious, and experimental. In China, however, there was no counterpart to the 19th-century European explosion of novels. The novels of the Ming and early Qing dynasties represented a pinnacle of classic Chinese fiction. The scholar and literary critic Andrew H. Plaks argues that &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot;, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Lotus&quot; collectively constituted a technical breakthrough reflecting new cultural values and intellectual concerns. Their educated editors, authors, and commentators used the narrative conventions developed from earlier story-tellers, such as the episodic structure, interspersed songs and folk sayings, or speaking directly to the reader, but they fashioned self-consciously ironic narratives whose seeming familiarity camouflaged a Neo-Confucian moral critique of late Ming decadence. Plaks explores the textual history of the novels (all published after their author&#x27;s deaths, usually anonymously) and how the ironic and satiric devices of these novels paved the way for the great novels of the 18th century. Plaks further shows these Ming novels share formal characteristics.

==Fashion and clothing==

China&#x27;s fashion history covers hundreds of years with some of the most colorful and diverse arrangements. Different social classes in different eras boast different fashion trends, the color yellow was usually reserved for the emperor during China&#x27;s Imperial era.

===Pre-Qing===

From the beginning of its history, Han clothing (especially in elite circles) was inseparable from silk, supposedly discovered by the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s consort, Leizu. The dynasty to follow the Shang, the Western Zhou dynasty, established a strict hierarchical society that used clothing as a status meridian, and inevitably, the height of one&#x27;s rank influenced the ornateness of a costume. Such markers included the length of a skirt, the wideness of a sleeve and the degree of ornamentation. In addition to these class-oriented developments, Han Chinese clothing became looser, with the introduction of wide sleeves and jade decorations hung from the sash which served to keep the &quot;yi&quot; closed. The &quot;yi&quot; was essentially wrapped over, in a style known as &quot;jiaoling youren&quot;, or wrapping the right side over before the left, because of the initially greater challenge to the right-handed wearer (people of Zhongyuan discouraged left-handedness like many other historical cultures, considering it unnatural, barbarian, uncivilized, and unfortunate). The Shang dynasty ( – 1046 BC), developed the rudiments of Chinese clothing; it consisted of a &quot;yi&quot;, a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called &quot;chang&quot;, worn with a &quot;bixi&quot;, a length of fabric that reached the knees. Vivid primary colors and green were used, due to the degree of technology at the time.

===Qipao===
During the Qing dynasty, China&#x27;s last imperial dynasty, a dramatic shift of clothing occurred, examples of which include the cheongsam (or qipao in Mandarin). The clothing of the era before the Qing dynasty is referred to as Hanfu or traditional Han Chinese clothing. Many symbols such as phoenix have been used for decorative as well as economic purposes. Among them were the &quot;Banners&quot; (&quot;qí&quot;), mostly Manchu, who as a group were called &quot;Banner People&quot; ( pinyin: &quot;qí rén&quot;). Manchu women typically wore a one-piece dress that retrospectively came to be known as the &quot;qípáo&quot; (, Manchu: &quot;sijigiyan&quot; or &quot;banner gown&quot;). The generic term for both the male and the female forms of Manchu dress, essentially similar garments, was &quot;chángpáo&quot; (/长袍). The &quot;qipao&quot; fitted loosely and hung straight down the body, or flared slightly in an A-line. Under the dynastic laws after 1636, all Han Chinese in the banner system were forced to adopt the Manchu male hairstyle of wearing a queue as did all Manchu men and dress in Manchu &quot;qipao.&quot; However, the order for ordinary non-Banner Han civilians to wear Manchu clothing was lifted and only Han who served as officials were required to wear Manchu clothing, with the rest of the civilian Han population dressing however they wanted. Qipao covered most of the woman&#x27;s body, revealing only the head, hands, and the tips of the toes. The baggy nature of the clothing also served to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of age. With time, though, the &quot;qipao&quot; were tailored to become more form fitting and revealing. The modern version, which is now recognized popularly in China as the &quot;standard&quot; &quot;qipao&quot;, was first developed in Shanghai in the 1920s, partly under the influence of Beijing styles. People eagerly sought a more modernized style of dress and transformed the old &quot;qipao&quot; to suit their tastes. Slender and form fitting with a high cut, it had great differences from the traditional &quot;qipao&quot;. It was high-class courtesans and celebrities in the city that would make these redesigned tight fitting &quot;qipao&quot; popular at that time. In Shanghai it was first known as &quot;zansae&quot; or &quot;long dress&quot; (長衫—Mandarin Chinese: chángshān; Shanghainese: &quot;zansae&quot;; Cantonese: &quot;chèuhngsāam&quot;), and it is this name that survives in English as the &quot;cheongsam&quot;. Most Han civilian men eventually voluntarily adopted Manchu clothing while Han women continued wearing Han clothing. Until 1911, the changpao was required clothing for Chinese men of a certain class, but Han Chinese women continued to wear loose jacket and trousers, with an overskirt for formal occasions. The &quot;qipao&quot; was a new fashion item for Han Chinese women when they started wearing it around 1925.The original &quot;qipao&quot; was wide and loose. As hosiery in turn declined in later decades, cheongsams nowadays have come to be most commonly worn with bare legs.

==Arts==
Chinese art is visual art that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists. The Chinese art in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and that of overseas Chinese can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and Chinese culture. Early &quot;Stone Age art&quot; dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple pottery and sculptures. After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling dynasties of Chinese emperors, most of which lasted several hundred years.

Chinese art has arguably the oldest continuous tradition in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the Renaissance as the decorative arts are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in Chinese ceramics.

Different forms of art have swayed under the influence of great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political figures. Chinese art encompasses all facets of fine art, folk art and performance art. Porcelain pottery was one of the first forms of art in the Palaeolithic period. Early Chinese music and poetry was influenced by the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;, and the Chinese poet and statesman Qu Yuan.

Chinese painting became a highly appreciated art in court circles encompassing a wide variety of Shan shui with specialized styles such as Ming dynasty painting. Early Chinese music was based on percussion instruments, which later gave away to stringed and reed instruments. By the Han dynasty papercutting became a new art form after the invention of paper. Chinese opera would also be introduced and branched regionally in addition to other performance formats such as variety arts.

===Chinese lantern===
The Chinese paper lantern (紙燈籠, 纸灯笼) is a lantern made of thin, brightly colored paper. Paper lanterns come in various shapes and sizes, as well as various methods of construction. In their simplest form, they are simply a paper bag with a candle placed inside, although more complicated lanterns consist of a collapsible bamboo or metal frame of hoops covered with tough paper. Sometimes, other lanterns can be made out of colored silk (usually red) or vinyl. Silk lanterns are also collapsible with a metal expander and are decorated with Chinese characters and/or designs. The vinyl lanterns are more durable; they can resist rain, sunlight, and wind. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. The gold paper on them will soon fade away to a pale white, and the red silk will become a mix between pink and red. Often associated with festivals, paper lanterns are common in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and similarly in Chinatowns with large communities of Overseas Chinese, where they are often hung outside of businesses to attract attention. In Japan the traditional styles include &quot;bonbori&quot; and &quot;chōchin&quot; and there is a special style of lettering called &quot;chōchin moji&quot; used to write on them. Airborne paper lanterns are called sky lanterns, and are often released into the night sky for aesthetic effect at lantern festivals.

The Chinese sky lantern (天燈, 天灯), also known as &quot;Kongming lantern&quot;, is a small hot air balloon made of paper, with an opening at the bottom where a small fire is suspended. In Asia and elsewhere around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities. The name &quot;sky lantern&quot; is a translation of the Chinese name but they have also been referred to as &quot;sky candles&quot; or &quot;fire balloons&quot;. The general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 cm to a couple of metres across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30 cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the flame source and to keep it away from the walls. When lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground.

===Chinese hand fan===

The oldest existing Chinese fans are a pair of woven bamboo, wood or paper side-mounted fans from the 2nd century BCE. The Chinese character for &quot;fan&quot; (扇) is etymologically derived from a picture of feathers under a roof. A particular status and gender would be associated with a specific type of fan. During the Song dynasty, famous artists were often commissioned to paint fans. The Chinese dancing fan was developed in the 7th century. The Chinese form of the hand fan was a row of feathers mounted in the end of a handle. In the later centuries, Chinese poems and four-word idioms were used to decorate the fans by using Chinese calligraphy pens. In ancient China, fans came in various shapes and forms (such as in a leaf, oval or a half-moon shape), and were made in different materials such as silk, bamboo, feathers, etc.

===Carved lacquer===
Carved lacquer or &quot;Qīdiāo&quot; () is a distinctive Chinese form of decorated lacquerware. While lacquer has been used in China for at least 3,000 years, the technique of carving into very thick coatings of it appears to have been developed in the 12th century CE. It is extremely time-consuming to produce, and has always been a luxury product, essentially restricted to China, though imitated in Japanese lacquer in somewhat different styles. The producing process is called Diāoqī (/彫漆, carving lacquer).Though most surviving examples are from the Ming and Qing dynasties, the main types of subject matter for the carvings were all begun under the Song dynasty, and the development of both these and the technique of carving were essentially over by the early Ming. These types were the abstract &quot;guri&quot; or Sword-Pommel pattern, figures in a landscape, and birds and plants. To these some designs with religious symbols, animals, auspicious characters &quot;(right)&quot; and imperial dragons can be added. The objects made in the technique are a wide range of small types, but are mostly practical vessels or containers such as boxes, plates and trays. Some screens and pieces of Chinese furniture were made. Carved lacquer is only rarely combined with painting in lacquer and other lacquer techniques.

Later Chinese writers dated the introduction of carved lacquer to the Tang dynasty (618–906), and many modern writers have pointed to some late Tang pieces of armour found on the Silk Road by Aurel Stein and now in the British Museum. These are red and black lacquer on camel hide, but the lacquer is very thin, &quot;less than one millimeter in thickness&quot;, and the effect very different, with simple abstract shapes on a plain field and almost no impression of relief. The style of carving into thick lacquer used later is first seen in the Southern Song (1127–1279), following the development of techniques for making very thick lacquer. There is some evidence from literary sources that it had existed in the late Tang. At first the style of decoration used is known as &quot;guri&quot; (/曲仑) from the Japanese word for the ring-pommel of a sword, where the same motifs were used in metal, and is often called the &quot;Sword-Pommel pattern&quot; in English. This style uses a family of repeated two-branched scrolling shapes cut with a rounded profile at the surface, but below that a &quot;V&quot; section through layers of lacquer in different colours (black, red and yellow, and later green), giving a &quot;marbled&quot; effect from the contrasted colours; this technique is called &quot;tìxī&quot; (/剃犀) in Chinese. This style continued to be used up to the Ming dynasty, especially on small boxes and jars with covers, though after the Song only red was often used, and the motifs were often carved with wider flat spaces at the bottom level to be exposed.

===Folding screen===
A folding screen () is a type of free-standing furniture. It consists of several frames or panels, which are often connected by hinges or by other means. It can be made in a variety of designs and with different kinds of materials. Folding screens have many practical and decorative uses. It originated from ancient China, eventually spreading to the rest of East Asia, Europe, and other parts of the world. Screens date back to China during the Eastern Zhou period (771–256 BCE). These were initially one-panel screens in contrast to folding screens. Folding screens were invented during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). Depictions of those folding screens have been found in Han-era tombs, such as one in Zhucheng, Shandong Province.

Folding screens were originally made from wooden panels and painted on lacquered surfaces, eventually folding screens made from paper or silk became popular too. Even though folding screens were known to have been used since antiquity, it became rapidly popular during the Tang dynasty (618–907). During the Tang dynasty, folding screens were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy on. Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the folding screen. There were two distinct artistic folding screens mentioned in historical literature of the era. One of it was known as the &#x27; () and the other was known as the &#x27; (). It was not uncommon for people to commission folding screens from artists, such as from Tang-era painter Cao Ba or Song-era painter Guo Xi. The landscape paintings on folding screens reached its height during the Song dynasty (960–1279). The lacquer techniques for the Coromandel screens, which is known as &quot;&quot; ( &quot;incised colors&quot;), emerged during the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and was applied to folding screens to create dark screens incised, painted, and inlaid with art of mother-of-pearl, ivory, or other materials.

===Chinese jade===
Chinese jade (玉) refers to the jade mined or carved in China from the Neolithic onward. It is the primary hardstone of Chinese sculpture. Although deep and bright green jadeite is better known in Europe, for most of China&#x27;s history, jade has come in a variety of colors and white &quot;mutton-fat&quot; nephrite was the most highly praised and prized. Native sources in Henan and along the Yangtze were exploited since prehistoric times and have largely been exhausted; most Chinese jade today is extracted from the northwestern province of Xinjiang. Jade was prized for its hardness, durability, musical qualities, and beauty. In particular, its subtle, translucent colors and protective qualities caused it to become associated with Chinese conceptions of the soul and immortality. The most prominent early use was the crafting of the Six Ritual Jades, found since the 3rd-millennium BC Liangzhu culture: the &quot;bi&quot;, the &quot;cong&quot;, the &quot;huang&quot;, the &quot;hu&quot;, the &quot;gui&quot;, and the &quot;zhang&quot;. Although these items are so ancient that their original meaning is uncertain, by the time of the composition of the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;, they were thought to represent the sky, the earth, and the four directions. By the Han dynasty, the royal family and prominent lords were buried entirely ensheathed in jade burial suits sewn in gold thread, on the idea that it would preserve the body and the souls attached to it. Jade was also thought to combat fatigue in the living. The Han also greatly improved prior artistic treatment of jade. These uses gave way after the Three Kingdoms period to Buddhist practices and new developments in Taoism such as alchemy. Nonetheless, jade remained part of traditional Chinese medicine and an important artistic medium. Although its use never became widespread in Japan, jade became important to the art of Korea and Southeast Asia.

== Mythological beings ==

===Loong===
Loongs, also known as Chinese Dragon, are legendary creatures in Chinese mythology, Chinese folklore, and East Asian culture. Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. They traditionally symbolize potent and powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it. During the days of Imperial China, the Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength. They are also the symbol and representative for the Son of Heaven, the Mandate of Heaven, the Celestial Empire and the Chinese Tributary System during the history of China.

===Fenghuang ===
Fenghuang (鳳凰) are mythological birds found in Chinese and East Asian mythology that reign over all other birds. The males were originally called feng and the females huang but such a distinction of gender is often no longer made and they are blurred into a single feminine entity so that the bird can be paired with the Chinese dragon, which is traditionally deemed male. The fenghuang is also called the &quot;August Rooster&quot; () since it sometimes takes the place of the Rooster in the Chinese zodiac. In the Western world, it is commonly called the Chinese phoenix or simply Phoenix, although mythological similarities with the Western phoenix are superficial.

===Qilin===

The Qilin (; ), or Kirin in Japanese, is a mythical hooved chimerical creature in Chinese culture, said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a sage or illustrious ruler. Qilin is a specific type of the &quot;lin&quot; mythological family of one-horned beasts. The earliest references to the &quot;qilin&quot; are in the 5th century BC &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. The &quot;qilin&quot; made appearances in a variety of subsequent Chinese works of history and fiction, such as Feng Shen Bang. Emperor Wu of Han apparently captured a live &quot;qilin&quot; in 122 BC, although Sima Qian was skeptical of this.

=== Xuanwu ===

Xuanwu (Chinese:玄武) is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations. Despite its English name, it is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake. It is known as Genbu in Japanese and Hyeonmu in Korean. It represents the north and the winter season. In Japan, it is one of the four guardian spirits that protect Kyoto and it is said that it protects the city on the north. Represented by the Kenkun Shrine, which is located on top of Mt Funaoka in Kyoto. The creature&#x27;s name is identical to that of the important Taoist god Xuanwu, who is sometimes (as in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;) portrayed in the company of a turtle and snake.

==Music, instruments and dancing==


Music and dance were closely associated in the very early periods of China. The music of China dates back to the dawn of Chinese civilization with documents and artifacts providing evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122 BCE – 256 BCE). The earliest music of the Zhou dynasty recorded in ancient Chinese texts includes the ritual music called &quot;yayue&quot; and each piece may be associated with a dance. Some of the oldest written music dates back to Confucius&#x27;s time. The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was exemplified through the popularization of the &quot;qin&quot; (plucked instrument with seven strings) during the Tang dynasty, although the instrument is known to have played a major role before the Han dynasty.

There are many musical instruments that are integral to Chinese culture, such as the Xun (Ocarina-type instrument that is also integral in Native American cultures), Guzheng (zither with movable bridges), guqin (bridgeless zither), sheng and xiao (vertical flute), the erhu (alto fiddle or bowed lute), pipa (pear-shaped plucked lute), and many others.

Dance in China is a highly varied art form, consisting of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. There are also 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China, and each ethnic minority group in China also has its own folk dances. The best known Chinese dances today are the Dragon dance and the Lion Dance.

==Architecture==


Chinese architecture is a style of architecture that has taken shape through the ages and influenced the architecture of East Asia for many centuries. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of East Asia such as Japan and Korea. Chinese architecture, examples for which can be found from more than 2,000 years ago, is almost as old as Chinese civilization and has long been an important hallmark of Chinese culture. There are certain features common to Chinese architecture, regardless of specific regions, different provinces or use. The most important is symmetry, which connotes a sense of grandeur as it applies to everything from palaces to farmhouses. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden&#x27;s composition is to create enduring flow, to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself. Feng shui has played a very important part in structural development. The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature. A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.

===Chinese palace===


The Chinese palace is an imperial complex where the royal court and the civil government resided. Its structures are considerable and elaborate. The Chinese character &quot;gong&quot; (宮; meaning &quot;palace&quot;) represents two connected rooms (呂) under a roof (宀). Originally the character applied to any residence or mansion, but it was used in reference to solely the imperial residence since the Qin dynasty (3rd century BC). A Chinese palace is composed of many buildings. It has large areas surrounded by walls and moats. It contains large halls (殿) for ceremonies and official business, as well as smaller buildings, temples, towers, residences, galleries, courtyards, gardens, and outbuildings. Apart from the main imperial palace, Chinese dynasties also had several other imperial palaces in the capital city where the empress, crown prince, or other members of the imperial family dwelled. There also existed palaces outside of the capital city called &quot;away palaces&quot; (離宮/离宫) where the emperors resided when traveling. Empress dowager Cixi (慈禧太后) built the Summer Palace or Yiheyuan (頤和園/颐和园 – &quot;The Garden of Nurtured Harmony&quot;) near the Old Summer Palace, but on a much smaller scale than the Old Summer Palace.

===Paifang===
&quot;Paifang&quot;, also known as a &quot;Pailou&quot;, is a traditional style of Chinese architectural arch or gateway structure that is related to the Indian &quot;Torana&quot; from which it is derived. The word &quot;paifang&quot; () was originally a collective term for the top two levels of administrative division and subdivisions of ancient Chinese cities. The largest division within a city in ancient China was a &quot;fang&quot; (), equivalent to a current day ward. Each fang was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night. Each fang was further divided into several &quot;pai&quot; (), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community. Each pai, in turn, contained an area including several hutongs (alleyways). This system of urban administrative division and subdivision reached an elaborate level during the Tang dynasty, and continued in the following dynasties. For example, during the Ming dynasty, Beijing was divided into a total of 36 fangs. Originally, the word &quot;paifang&quot; referred to the gate of a fang and the marker for an entrance of a building complex or a town; but by the Song dynasty, a paifang had evolved into a purely decorative monument.

===Chinese garden===

The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over the years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature. A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings. The earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the Yellow River, during the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown. Early inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;pu&quot; and &quot;yuan&quot;. &quot;You&quot; was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while pu was a garden for plants. During the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), &quot;&quot; became the character for all gardens.

The old character for &quot;yuan&quot; is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree. According to the &quot;Shiji&quot;, one of the most famous features of this garden was the &quot;Wine Pool and Meat Forest&quot; (酒池肉林). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste. During the Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), in 535 BC, the &quot;Terrace of Shanghua&quot;, with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by King Jing of the Zhou dynasty. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the &quot;Terrace of Gusu&quot;, was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated. From the highest terrace, a view extended as far as Lake Tai, the Great Lake.

== Physical culture ==
=== Martial arts ===

China is one of the main birthplaces of Eastern martial arts. Chinese martial arts, often named under the umbrella terms &quot;kung fu&quot; and &quot;wushu&quot;, are the several hundred fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as &quot;families&quot; (家; ), &quot;sects&quot; (派; ) or &quot;schools&quot; (门/門; ) of martial arts. Examples of such traits include &quot;Shaolinquan&quot; () physical exercises involving Five Animals () mimicry, or training methods inspired by Old Chinese philosophies, religions and legends. Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called &quot;internal &quot;(內家拳/内家拳; ), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called &quot;external&quot; (外家拳; ). Geographical association, as in &quot;&quot;northern&quot;(&quot;北拳; ) and &quot;southern&quot; (南拳; ), is another popular classification method.

Chinese martial arts are collectively given the name Kung Fu (gong) &quot;achievement&quot; or &quot;merit&quot;, and (fu) &quot;man&quot;, thus &quot;human achievement&quot;) or (previously and in some modern contexts) Wushu (&quot;martial arts&quot; or &quot;military arts&quot;). China also includes the home to the well-respected Shaolin Monastery and Wudang Mountains. The first generation of art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art. Over time, some art forms have branched off, while others have retained a distinct Chinese flavor. Regardless, China has produced some of the most renowned martial artists including Wong Fei Hung and many others. The arts have also co-existed with a variety of weapons including the more standard 18 arms. Legendary and controversial moves like Dim Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture.
Martial arts schools also teach the art of lion dance, which has evolved from a pugilistic display of Kung Fu to an entertaining dance performance.

==Leisure==
A number of games and pastimes are popular within Chinese culture. The most common game is Mahjong. The same pieces are used for other styled games such as Shanghai Solitaire. Others include pai gow, pai gow poker and other bone domino games. Weiqi and xiangqi are also popular. Ethnic games like Chinese yo-yo are also part of the culture where it is performed during social events.

Qigong is the practice of spiritual, physical, and medical techniques. It is as a form of exercise and although it is commonly used among the elderly, any one of any age can practice it during their free time.

==Cuisine==
Chinese cuisine is a very important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial, royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time. The most praised &quot;Four Major Cuisines&quot; are Chuan, Lu, Yue and Huaiyang, representing West, North, South and East China cuisine correspondingly. Modern &quot;Eight Cuisines&quot; of China are Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang cuisines. Color, smell and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food, as well as the meaning, appearance and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised from ingredients used, cuttings, cooking time and seasoning. It is considered inappropriate to use knives on the dining table. Chopsticks are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut and pick up food.

===Tea culture===
The practice of drinking tea has a long history in China, having originated there. The history of tea in China is long and complex, for the Chinese have enjoyed tea for millennia. Scholars hailed the brew as a cure for a variety of ailments; the nobility considered the consumption of good tea as a mark of their status, and the common people simply enjoyed its flavour. In 2016, the discovery of the earliest known physical evidence of tea from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi&#x27;an was announced, indicating that tea from the genus &quot;Camellia&quot; was drunk by Han dynasty emperors as early as 2nd century BC. Tea then became a popular drink in the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties.

Although tea originated in China, during the Tang dynasty, Chinese tea generally represents tea leaves which have been processed using methods inherited from ancient China. According to popular legend, tea was discovered by Chinese Emperor Shen Nong in 2737 BCE when a leaf from a nearby shrub fell into water the emperor was boiling. Tea is deeply woven into the history and culture of China. The beverage is considered one of the seven necessities of Chinese life, along with firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce and vinegar. During the Spring and Autumn period, Chinese tea was used for medicinal purposes and it was the period when the Chinese people first enjoyed the juice extracted from the tea leaves that they chewed.

Chinese tea culture refers to how tea is prepared as well as the occasions when people consume tea in China. Tea culture in China differs from that in European countries such as Britain and other Asian countries like Japan in preparation, taste, and the occasions when people consume tea. Even today, tea is consumed regularly, both at casual and formal occasions. In addition to being a popular beverage, tea is used in traditional Chinese medicine, as well as in Chinese cuisine. Green tea is one of the main teas originating in China.

===Food culture===
Imperial, royal and noble preference played a role in the changes in Chinese cuisines over time. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures were integrated into Chinese cuisines over time. The overwhelmingly large variety of Chinese cuisine comes mainly from the practice of the dynastic periods, when emperors would host banquets with over 100 dishes per meal. A countless number of imperial kitchen staff and concubines were involved in the food preparation process. Over time, many dishes became part of the everyday citizen&#x27;s cuisine. Some of the highest quality restaurants with recipes close to the dynastic periods include Fangshan restaurant in Beihai Park Beijing and the Oriole Pavilion. Arguably all branches of Hong Kong eastern style are in some ways rooted from the original dynastic cuisines.

&quot;Manhan Quanxi&quot;, literally &quot;Manchu Han Imperial Feast&quot; was one of the grandest meals ever documented in Chinese cuisine. It consisted of at least 108 unique dishes from the Manchu and Han Chinese culture during the Qing dynasty, and it is only reserved and intended for the emperors. The meal was held for three whole days, across six banquets. The culinary skills consisted of cooking methods from all over Imperial China. When the Manchus conquered China and founded the Qing dynasty, the Manchu and Han Chinese peoples struggled for power. The Kangxi Emperor wanted to resolve the disputes so he held a banquet during his 66th birthday celebrations. The banquet consisted of Manchu and Han dishes, with officials from both ethnic groups attending the banquet together. After the Wuchang Uprising, common people learned about the imperial banquet. The original meal was served in the Forbidden City in Beijing.

==Major subcultures==
Chinese culture consists of many subcultures. In China, the cultural difference between adjacent provinces (and, in some cases, adjacent counties within the same province) can often be as big as than that between adjacent European nations. Thus, the concept of &quot;Han Chinese subgroups&quot; (漢族民系/汉族民系, literally &quot;Han ethnic lineage&quot;) was born, used for classifying these subgroups within the greater Han ethnicity. These subgroups are, as a general rule, classified based on linguistic differences.

Using this linguistic classification, some of the well-known subcultures within China include:

<text>John Pym (20 May 1584 – 8 December 1643) was an English politician and administrator who played a major role in establishing what would become the modern English Parliamentary system. One of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 was a major step in sparking the First English Civil War, his use of procedure to outmanoeuvre opponents was unusual for the period. Though this meant he was respected by contemporaries rather than admired, in 1895 historian Goldwin Smith described him as &quot;the greatest member of Parliament that ever lived&quot;.

Pym&#x27;s father died when he was seven months old, and he was raised by his stepfather Sir Anthony Rous, from whom he inherited his Puritan views and deep opposition to the reforms of Archbishop William Laud. He was also a leading member of the Providence Island Company, which attempted to establish a Puritan colony in Central America.

Described as &#x27;a true revolutionary&#x27;, he led the opposition to arbitrary rule first under James I, then Charles I. His leadership in the early stages of the war was essential to the Parliamentarian cause, particularly his role in negotiating the Solemn League and Covenant with the Scots Covenanters; his death from cancer in December 1643 was considered a major blow.

Originally buried in Westminster Abbey, after the Stuart Restoration in 1660, his body was dumped in a pit at nearby St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster along with those of other Parliamentary leaders. Though his reputation later suffered in comparison to less complex figures like John Hampden and Viscount Falkland, he is now viewed as an astute politician and effective speaker. Many of his ideas were adopted by Patriots during the American Revolution and 19th-century American liberals.

==Personal details==
His father, Alexander Pym (1547–1585), was a member of the minor gentry, from Brymore, Somerset. He was a successful lawyer in London, where John was born in 1584. Alexander died seven months later and his mother, Philippa Colles (died 1620), married a wealthy Cornish landowner, Sir Anthony Rous. A close friend and executor of Sir Francis Drake, Sir Anthony instilled in his stepson a strong dislike of Spain, a zealous belief in Puritanism, and opposition to both the Catholic Church, and the rival Protestant theology of Arminianism.

The Rous were a large and close-knit family, often wedding relatives and friends. In May 1604, Pym married Anne Hooke, a daughter of Barbara Rous and John Hooke, and aunt of the scientist Robert Hooke. Before her death in 1620, they had seven children, of whom four survived into adulthood; Philippa (1604–1654), Charles (1615–1671), Dorothy (1617–1661), and Catherine.

==Career==
Pym was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford, then known as Broadgates and famous for &#x27;advanced Protestantism&#x27;. Since legal knowledge was considered part of an education, he subsequently attended the Middle Temple in 1602; while he does not appear to have formally graduated from either, he made a number of lifelong friends, the most important of which being William Whitaker.

In June 1605, he was appointed collector of taxes for the Exchequer in Hampshire, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire; this gave him a broader range of connections than many contemporaries, who were often confined to family or county networks. Whitaker&#x27;s father had been Member of Parliament for Westbury, Wiltshire, and in 1621, Pym was elected for the nearby seat of Calne.

===Forced Loan and Petition of Right===

Pym&#x27;s diary shows he viewed Parliamentary legislation as a whole, not just issues of interest to himself; combined with an ability to explain them clearly, it led to his appointment to numerous committees. Since direct criticism of the king was considered treason, the only way to express opposition was by attacking his advisors, using the process of impeachment. Pym argued it was for the Commons to decide guilt or innocence, leaving the Lords only to determine the penalty; this would become significant in his future Parliamentary career.

Even in an era when it was common, he was notable for his anti-Catholicism, and opposition to alleged Catholic practices in the Church of England. One reason for this was the close links in the 17th-century between religion and politics, with alterations in one viewed as implying alterations in the other. Many contemporaries fought in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and were concerned at the apparent failure of James to defend his own son-in-law and Protestant Europe as a whole.

Following the dissolution of Parliament in 1621, Pym was arrested, and brought before the Privy Council, but released in August 1622. In 1624, he was elected for Tavistock, a seat controlled by Earl of Bedford, which he retained for the rest of his career. In 1626, he led an attempt to impeach the Duke of Buckingham, an action which led to Parliament being dissolved. Only Buckingham&#x27;s assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt, while Pym supported the presentation of the Petition of Right to Charles I in 1628.

Pym, his stepbrother Francis Rous, and John Hampden, also led the Parliamentary attack on Roger Maynwaring and Robert Sibthorpe, two clergymen who published sermons supporting the Caroline precepts of the divine right of kings, and passive obedience. Though censured by Parliament for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of Personal Rule that continued until 1640.

Pym became treasurer of the Providence Island Company in 1630, a role that increasingly consumed his time, and he relinquished his Exchequer position in 1639. Participation in the colonial movement was common among Puritan leaders, while company meetings later provided cover for co-ordinating political opposition. Many of these became leaders of the Parliamentary opposition in 1642, among them Hampden, Rous, Henry Darley, Lord Saye, William Waller, and Lord Brooke.

===Leader of the opposition; 1640 to 1641===
Following defeat in the first of the Bishops Wars, Charles recalled Parliament in April 1640. When the Short Parliament refused to vote him taxes without political concessions, he dissolved it after only three weeks. When the Treaty of Ripon imposed by the Scots after a second defeat forced him to hold fresh elections in November, Pym became the unofficial leader of the opposition. 

Historians like Tim Harris argue that, with the exception of a few extremists, by 1640 there was general consensus attempts to rule without Parliament had gone too far. This changed after the Grand Remonstrance in November 1641, when constitutional monarchists like Clarendon switched sides, arguing Parliament now wanted too much.

Where Pym differed from Clarendon, and many of his own colleagues, was recognising Charles would not keep commitments he felt had been forced from him. Even during negotiations with Parliament, he and Henrietta Maria openly told foreign ambassadors any concessions were temporary, and would be retrieved by force if needed. These suspicions increased after October 1641, when Irish Catholic rebels claimed his approval for their actions. Many believed them, given previous attempts by Charles to use Irish troops against the Scots, and his initial refusal to condemn the rebellion.

However, Pym was hampered by the fact Charles was essential to a stable government and society. Regardless of religion or political belief, in 1642 the vast majority believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated; where they disagreed was what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; Parliamentarians believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations.

Puritan was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or &#x27;purify&#x27;, the Church of England, and contained many different sects. Presbyterians were the most prominent, and included leaders like Pym and John Hampden, but there were many others, such as Congregationalists, often grouped together as Independents. Close links between religion and politics added further complexity; one reason for opposition to bishops was their presence in the House of Lords, where they often blocked Parliamentary legislation. Their removal by the Clergy Act 1640 was a major step along the road to war.

Most Presbyterians were political conservatives, who believed in a limited electorate, and wanted to keep the Church of England, but as a reformed, Presbyterian body, similar to the Church of Scotland. In general, England was a structured, socially conservative, and largely peaceful society, while the devastation caused by the Thirty Years&#x27; War meant many wanted to avoid conflict at any cost. Pym was one of the few who believed only military defeat would force Charles into agreeing meaningful reforms.

===Road to war; 1641 to 1643===
Shortly after the Long Parliament assembled, it was presented with the Root and Branch petition; signed by 15,000 Londoners, it demanded England follow the Scots, and expel bishops. This reflected widespread concerns about &#x27;Catholic practices&#x27;, or Arminianism in the Church of England, given weight by Charles&#x27; apparent willingness to make war on the Protestant Scots, but not assist his nephew Charles Louis regain his hereditary lands. Many feared Charles was about to sign an alliance with Spain, a view shared by experienced diplomatic observers like Venice, and even France.

This meant ending Charles&#x27; arbitrary rule was not only important for England, but the Protestant cause in general. Since respect for the institution of monarchy prevented direct attacks on Charles, the traditional route was to prosecute his &#x27;evil counsellors.&#x27; Doing so made it clear that although the king was above the law, his subordinates were not, and he could not protect them; the intention was to make others think twice about their actions. Archbishop William Laud was impeached in December 1640 and held in the Tower of London until his execution in 1645; Strafford, former Lord Deputy of Ireland and organiser of the 1640 Bishops War, was attainted and executed in May 1641.

The Commons also passed a series of constitutional reforms, including the Triennial Acts, abolition of the Star Chamber, and an end to levying taxes without Parliament&#x27;s consent. Voting as a block, the bishops ensured all these were rejected by the Lords. In June 1641, Pym secured passage of the Clergy Act in the Commons; one of its key provisions was to remove bishops from the Lords, which therefore rejected it. The growing political tension was brought to head in October with the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion. both Charles and Parliament supported raising troops to suppress it, but neither trusted the other with their control, fearing any army would be used against them first.

Pym helped draft the Grand Remonstrance, presented to Charles on 1 December 1641; unrest culminated in 23 to 29 December with widespread riots in Westminster, led by the London apprentices. Suggestions Pym and other Parliamentary leaders helped organise these have not been proved, but as a result, bishops stopped attending the Lords. On 30 December, John Williams, Archbishop of York and eleven other bishops, signed a complaint, disputing the legality of any laws passed by the Lords during their exclusion. Viewed by the Commons as inviting Charles to dissolve Parliament, all twelve were imprisoned for treason.

In response to the growing unrest, on 4 January Charles made an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members, one of whom was Pym. Having failed to do so, he left London accompanied by many Royalist MPs and his supporters in the Lords, a major tactical mistake as it gave the opposition majorities in both houses. When the First English Civil War began in August, Pym headed the Committee of Safety; his reputation for integrity and ability to keep a diverse coalition of interests together was crucial to surviving the first 18 months of the conflict.

By early August 1643, a series of Royalist victories combined with the death of the popular John Hampden in June meant the Parliamentarian cause seemed close to collapse. At this crucial point, it was saved by Pym&#x27;s leadership and determination, which led to a renewed commitment to win the war. He created the foundations of victory by ensuring Parliament had sufficient financial and military resources, one of his last acts being to negotiate the Solemn League and Covenant that secured Scottish support. Amidst the escalating tensions, one particular step Pym took played a major role in consolidating Parliament&#x27;s authority. He orchestrated the expulsion of Henry Marten, a fellow Parliamentarian known for his radical views and outspoken criticism of the monarchy. Marten had publicly advocated for the deposition of King Charles I, a stance deemed too extreme by many in Parliament. Pym seized upon this opportunity to remove Marten, demonstrating his commitment to maintaining a more moderate and unified Parliamentarian front. Historian David Como believes this maneuver underscores Pym&#x27;s political acumen and his influence within Parliament during this critical period.

He died, probably of cancer, at Derby House on 8 December 1643; Parliament agreed to pay off the debts he incurred as a result of neglecting his private business interests, although they were still being disputed in 1665. Buried in Westminster Abbey, his remains were exhumed after the Stuart Restoration in 1660 and re-buried in a common pit at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

His chief opponent, the Earl of Clarendon, a senior advisor to Charles during the First English Civil War, later wrote; &#x27;he had a very comely and grave way of expressing himself...and understood the temper and affections of the kingdom as well as any man’. Pym&#x27;s reputation suffered in comparison to less complex figures like Hampden and Viscount Falkland, especially during the Victorian era which romanticised the Royalist cause. One exception was the historian Goldwin Smith, who described him as &quot;the greatest member of Parliament that ever lived&quot;. He is now generally viewed as an astute politician who laid the foundations of modern Parliamentary democracy and effective speaker, whose ideas and language were adapted by Patriots during the American Revolution and 19th century American liberals.

<text>Berlaar () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality comprises the towns of Berlaar proper and . In 2021, Berlaar had a total population of 11,710. The total area is 24.57 km2.

==History==
The current municipality of Berlaar was founded on 1 January 1965. Berlaar is actually a fusion of the former municipality Gestel and the Core of Berlaar itself. Berlaar is a part of the Belgische Kempen.

According to legend, the citizens of the early Middle Ages couldn&#x27;t agree on where the church had to be built. They let fate decide and let two bears fight over it. Where the one bear killed the other, that would be the location the church should be built. Hence the exceptional position of the church at the end of the village square and not in the centre as usual.

<doc id="156165" wikidata="Q615109" url="?curid=156165" title="Duffel">
<text>Duffel () is a municipality in the Belgian province of Antwerp.

The municipality comprises the town of Duffel proper. On 1 January 2020, Duffel had a total population of 17,664. The total area is 22.71 km2 which gives a population density of 778 inhabitants per km2.

The area is the eponym of a coarse woolen cloth, manufactured in this area from the 11th century, mainly used to make blankets, outdoor (army) coats, and tote bags. Duffel became a household name during and after World War II in the meaning of a coat designed with toggle-and-loop fastening and roomy hood.

The etymology of Duffel is from &quot;dubro&quot; and &quot;locus&quot;, from the Gaulish &quot;dubrum&quot;, &quot;dubron&quot; – &quot;water&quot;.

In 1836, the Duffel railway station opened on the Brussels-North to Antwerp railway line.

==Duffel cloth==
The town gives its name to a type of heavy woolen cloth generally used to make blankets and overcoats, especially for the armed forces, and a type of luggage. In the Middle Ages, an important part of the region&#x27;s industry was the manufacturing of &quot;Flemish laken&quot; (a broadcloth), while the cloth produced in Duffel was a thicker variation. The manufacturing process was brought to England by Flemish emigrants in the 1500s. The name for the cloth was so well-known, a type of overcoat made from the cloth and manufactured in England received the name Duffel coat.

<doc id="156166" wikidata="Q910951" url="?curid=156166" title="Finder (software)">
<text>The Finder is the default file manager and graphical user interface shell used on all Macintosh operating systems. Described in its &quot;About&quot; window as &quot;The Macintosh Desktop Experience&quot;, it is responsible for the launching of other applications, and for the overall user management of files, disks, and network volumes. It was introduced with the Macintosh 128K—the first Macintosh computer—and also exists as part of GS/OS on the Apple IIGS. It was rewritten completely with the release of Mac OS X in 2001.

In a tradition dating back to the Classic Mac OS of the 1980s and 1990s, the Finder icon is the smiling screen of a computer, known as the Happy Mac logo.

==Features==
The Finder uses a view of the file system that is rendered using a desktop metaphor; that is, the files and folders are represented as appropriate icons. It uses a similar interface to Apple&#x27;s Safari browser, where the user can click on a folder to move to it and move between locations using &quot;back&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; arrow buttons. Like Safari, the Finder uses tabs to allow the user to view multiple folders; these tabs can be pulled off the window to make them separate windows. There is a &quot;favorites&quot; sidebar of commonly used and important folders on the left of the Finder window.

The classic Mac OS Finder uses a spatial metaphor quite different from the more browser-like approach of the modern macOS Finder. In the classic Finder, opening a new folder opens the location in a new window: Finder windows are &#x27;locked&#x27; so that they would only ever display the contents of one folder. It also allows extensive customization, with the user being able to give folders custom icons matching their content. This approach emphasizes the different locations of files within the operating system, but navigating to a folder nested inside multiple other folders fills the desktop with a large number of windows that the user may not wish to have open. These must then be closed individually. Holding down the option key when opening a folder would also close its parent, but this trick was not discoverable and remained under the purview of power users.

The modern Finder uses macOS graphics APIs to display previews of a range of files, such as images, applications and PDF files. The Quick Look feature allows users to quickly examine documents and images in more detail from the finder by pressing the space bar without opening them in a separate application. The user can choose how to view files, with options such as large icons showing previews of files, a list with details such as date of last creation or modification, a Gallery View (replacing the previous Cover flow in macOS Mojave), and a &quot;column view&quot; influenced by macOS&#x27;s direct ancestor NeXTSTEP.

The modern Finder displays some aspects of the file system outside its windows. Mounted external volumes and disk image files can be displayed on the desktop. There is a trash can on the Dock in macOS, to which files can be dragged to mark them for deletion, and to which drives can be dragged for ejection. When a volume icon is being dragged, the Trash icon in the Dock changes to an eject icon in order to indicate this functionality. Finder can record files to optical media on the sidebar.

From Yosemite onwards, the Finder is updated to include a refreshed user interface with updated typography and translucency, along with a new icon. Functionally, it also contains official support for extensions, allowing synchronization and cloud storage applications such as Dropbox to display sync status labels inside the Finder display.

macOS Big Sur introduces a complete graphical redesign of the Finder, along with the rest of the user interface, sporting the removal of the brushed metal interface elements, a full-height sidebar and all new iconography. Big Sur also slightly modifies the Finder icon with rounded corners.

==Reception==
Stewart Alsop II in 1988 said &quot;It is testimony to either the luck or vision of the original designers&quot; of Finder that &quot;the interface has been able to survive tremendous evolution without much essential damage&quot; from 1984. He praised its spatial file manager as &quot;probably a more complete definition of a PC-based universe than any&quot; competitor, with users able to seamlessly use floppies, local and remote hard disks, and large and small file servers. Alsop said that even if Apple had stolen Xerox&#x27;s technology for Finder, it was now very different. While criticizing the lack of a right mouse button and MultiFinder&#x27;s clumsiness, he concluded that &quot;Apple remains the king of user interfaces. Finder is the only interface with 1.5 million people sitting in front of it daily. Apple is spending tremendous amounts of money on both development and basic research to remain the leader&quot;.

Introducing Mac OS X in 2000, Steve Jobs criticized the original Finder, saying that it &quot;generates a ton of windows, and you get to be the janitor.&quot;

&quot;Ars Technica&quot; columnist John Siracusa has been a long-standing defender of the spatial interface of the classic Mac OS Finder and a critic of the new design. Daring Fireball blog author John Gruber has voiced similar criticisms. In a 2005 interview he said that the Finder in version 10.3 of Mac OS X had become &quot;worse than in 10.0&quot; and that &quot;the fundamental problem with the OS X Finder is that it&#x27;s trying to support two opposing paradigms at once – the browser metaphor ... and the spatial metaphor from the original Mac Finder ... and it ends up doing neither one very well.&quot; Reviewing the same version of Mac OS X, Siracusa comments that the Finder &quot;provides exactly the same self-destructive combination of spatial and browser-style features as all of its Mac OS X predecessors&quot;.

==Finder replacements==
Third-party macOS software developers offer Finder replacements that run as stand-alone applications, such as ForkLift, Path Finder, Xfile, and XtraFinder. These replacements are shareware or freeware and aim to include and supersede the functionality of the Finder. After Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger the UNIX command line file management tools understand resource forks and can be used for management of Mac files.

==Timeline==
There are minor differences between Finder versions and Classic OS to System 7. From System 6 onward, the version numbers are unified.

Since the introduction of Mac OS X, the largest rewrite of the Finder was with the 2009 release of Mac OS X 10.6, into the Cocoa API, though little change was visible to the user.

<text>Heist-op-den-Berg () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality comprises Heist-op-den-Berg proper (including the hamlets: Heist-Goor, Heist-Station, Zonderschot, Heist-Centrum and Bruggeneinde), the villages of (including the hamlet Pijpelheide), , , and .

==History==
The 48-meter-high hill on which Heist would later be built (hence the adjunct name &quot;op-den-Berg&quot; meaning &quot;on the hill&quot;) was formed during the early part of the Ice age. As can be appreciated from the artifacts shown at the regional museum on the city&#x27;s main square, this area was already populated in prehistoric times. Soon after the Romans yielded this land to the invading Germanic peoples in the 3rd and 4th century, Christianization followed. The village of Itegem, located right on the Nete River, was most likely the first hamlet to be founded, as suggested by a document dating from 976. Chapels in Hallaar and Itegem were built in the 12th century. This century also marked the beginnings of the Duchy of Brabant, of which this whole area was a part.

Around the year 1200, a military fort was built at the current location of the &quot;Ter Laken&quot; castle, on Booischot&#x27;s territory. Schriek, which was founded in 1125, got its own chapel in 1260 while the main church at Heist was built in 1340. These two religious buildings were heavily damaged during the wars of religion around 1600. During most of the Middle Ages, agriculture was driving the economy and several huge farming domains were built, some of which still subsist today (e.g., &quot;Wimpelhoeve&quot; in Wiekevorst, traces of which date from the 12th century, and &quot;Pandoerenhoeve&quot; in Schriek, dating from 1624). During the 17th and 18th century, the miraculous wooden statue of the Virgin and Child in the Hallaar church became an object of pilgrimage.

The current city hall was built in 1844, fourteen years after the foundation of Belgium as an independent country. Today, the city is mostly a residential centre, which offers services to the surrounding communities.

==Events==
*Heistse Pijl, cycling race
*Heist-op-den-Berg is well known for its Sunday morning flea market.

==Sights==

*The historical heart of the city is the church square (&quot;Kerkplein&quot;), where one of the city&#x27;s many old water pumps can be seen, and where a train museum (&quot;Treinmuseum&quot;) and a regional farming museum (&quot;Heemmuseum&quot;) can be visited.
*An old windmill, the last one in the Mechelen area, churches and chapels, and farms, many with their original water pumps, dot the landscape around the city.
*Heist-op-den-Berg (especially Itegem) also houses several castles, most of which are privately owned and therefore not open to the public.

<text>Mechelen (; ; historically known as &quot;Mechlin&quot; in English) is a city and municipality in the province of Antwerp in the Flemish Region of Belgium. The municipality comprises the city of Mechelen proper, some quarters at its outskirts, the hamlets of Nekkerspoel (adjacent) and Battel (a few kilometers away), as well as the villages of Walem, Heffen, Leest, Hombeek, and Muizen. The river Dyle (Dijle) flows through the city, hence it is often referred to as the &quot;Dijlestad&quot; (&quot;City on the Dyle&quot;).

Mechelen lies on the major urban and industrial axis Brussels–Antwerp, about from each city. Inhabitants find employment at Mechelen&#x27;s southern industrial and northern office estates, as well as at offices or industry near the capital and Brussels Airport, or at industrial plants near Antwerp&#x27;s seaport.

Mechelen is one of Flanders&#x27; prominent cities of historical art, with Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven. It was notably a centre for artistic production during the Northern Renaissance, when painters, printmakers, illuminators and composers of polyphony were attracted by patrons such as Margaret of York, Margaret of Austria and Hieronymus van Busleyden.

==History==

===Origins===
Archaeological proof of habitation during the La Tène era in the triangle Brussels–Leuven–Antwerp, mainly concentrated around Mechelen, which originated in wetlands, includes an canoe cut from an oak tree trunk and a settlement of about five wooden houses, at Nekkerspoel.

The area of Mechelen was settled on the banks of the river during the Gallo-Roman period as evidenced by several Roman ruins and roads. Upon Rome&#x27;s declining influence during 3rd–4th centuries, the area became inhabited by Germanic tribes. A few centuries later, it was christianized, assumedly by the Irish or Scottish missionary St Rumbold (), who was also said to have built a monastery. Work on the cathedral that is dedicated to the saint started around 1200.

Antwerp lost profitable &quot;stapelrechten&quot; (rights as first seller) for wool, oats and salt to Mechelen in 1303 when John II, Duke of Brabant, granted city rights to the town. This started a rivalry between these cities that would last well into the 20th century.

===15th–18th centuries===

In the 15th century, the city came under the rule of the Dukes of Burgundy, marking the beginning of a prosperous period. In 1473, Charles the Bold moved several political bodies to the city, and Mechelen served as the seat of the Superior Court until the French Revolution. In 1490, a regular postal service between Mechelen and Innsbruck was established.

The highly lucrative cloth trade gained Mechelen wealth and power during the Late Middle Ages and it even became the capital of the Low Countries (very roughly the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) in the first half of the 16th century under Archduchess Margaret of Austria.

During the 16th century, the city&#x27;s political influence decreased dramatically, due to many governmental institutions being moved to Brussels in 1530 and after the gunpowder magazine explosion of 1546. Mechelen compensated for this by increasing prominence in the religious arena: in 1559 it was proclaimed the Archdiocese of Mechelen, seat of religious authority over the territory that would eventually become Belgium. In 1961, &quot;Brussels&quot; was added to the title, resulting in the current Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels.

Mechelen also retained further relevance as the Great Council of Mechelen remained the supreme court of the territory until the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1572, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the city was burned and sacked by the Spanish during the Spanish Fury at Mechelen. After this pillaging, the city was rebuilt. It was sacked again in 1580 during the English Fury at Mechelen. It was during this time that the tradition of furniture making, still seen today, began.

In 1718, a major rebellion took place in the city, angry mobs entered the Town Hall. During this time Lord Pierre de Romrée was mayor of Mechelen. The chaos ended when the Emperor formally requested the President of the Great Council to restore peace. On 18 June, Christophe-Ernest de Baillet received a full list of the people who led the troubles. The President received the support of multiple regiments that had been sent by imperial command. After negotiations de Baillet restored peace and order in the city.
In 1781, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, ordered the destruction of the city&#x27;s fortified walls – their former location however continues to be referred to in the Latin terms &quot;intra muros&quot; (within the walls) and &quot;extra muros&quot; (outside), and meanwhile the site became that of the inner ring road.

===19th century and beyond===
The city entered the industrial age in the 19th century. In 1835, the first railway on the European continent linked Brussels with Mechelen, which became the hub of the Belgian railway network. This led to a development of metalworking industries, among others the central railway workshops which are still located in the town today. During the Second World War, the extensive Mechlinian railway structure had caused the Nazi occupation forces to choose Mechelen for their infamous transit camp. Over 25,000 Jews and Roma were sent by rail to Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp from Mechelen. The site of the transit camp and a purpose-built complex across the public square, now house the Kazerne Dossin Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights.

Several famous meetings on the Christian religion are connected to the name of the city. One in 1909 is thought to have inaugurated the Liturgical Movement. Between 1921 and 1925, a series of unofficial conferences, known as the Malines Conversations, presided over by Cardinal Mercier and attended by Anglican divines and laymen, including Lord Halifax, was the most significant of early attempts at the reconciliation between the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches.

==Folklore==
Most cities in Flanders have a mock name for their inhabitants. Since 1687, for their heroic attempt to fight the &quot;fire&quot; high up in the Saint-Rumbold&#x27;s Tower, where the gothic windows had shown the flaring of only the moon between clouds, Mechlinians have been called &quot;Maneblussers&quot; (moon extinguishers).

Once every 25 years, a parade, the Ommegang, commemorates both the arrival of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, father of Archduchess Margaret of Austria, and also other major events of the city&#x27;s past. The &quot;Ommegang&quot; had an extra edition in 2000 for the 500th anniversary of the birth of Charles V. This cortege shows the city&#x27;s six 15th–17th-century processional giants and other serious and humoresque puppets and carts, all typically made on a huge scale, and has been UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity since 2005.

The city&#x27;s 17th-century wooden mascot, which since 1775 has been called &quot;Opsinjoorke&quot; &#x27;the doll&#x27;, is pulled about on a sheet as part of the Ommegang. Nowadays, it is the replica that is so pulled around the city. A recent bronze statue depicting the &quot;Opsinjoorke&quot; stands in front of the Belfry.

The annual parade of carts decorated with flowers (comparable to that of Blankenberge for Mechlinian florists still prepare up to half of decorations), and with vegetables—all of which are local to the area—has been indefinitely canceled since the beginning of the 21st century due to lack of financing by the city.

In spring, a legendary holy statue of Our Lady is the main feature in the Procession of Hanswijk. 

Mechelen used to have its own newspaper called &quot;de Krijgstrompet&quot;, which was the official newspaper of the army.

==Dialect==
Informally, many Mechlinians (Dutch &quot;Mechelaars&quot;, locally pronounced &quot;Mecheleirs&quot;) speak Mechlinian (&quot;Mechels&quot;), a Dutch dialect which is distinct from other Brabantic dialects.

Since 1995, a subscribers&#x27; quarterly, &quot;De Mecheleir&quot;, shows old photographs of Mechelen and has stories on the local history, as well as a few columns written mimicking the dialect, for which there is no standard spelling.

==Specialties==

Historically famous Mechlinian trades include &quot;laken&quot; (woollen cloth), tapestries, cordwain, Mechlin lace (precious bobbin lace, already from the early 18th century), wood carving and sculpturing, and furniture.

Mechelen was at the heart of the revival of the carillon in the early 20th century, and hosts its principal school in the world to this day.

The area around Mechelen is famous for the cultivation of vegetables, among which are Belgian endive (&quot;witloof&quot;), asparagus, and cauliflower. Founded in the city, the &quot;Mechelse Veilingen&quot; in neighbouring Sint-Katelijne-Waver is the largest co-operative vegetable auction in Europe.

One of the four breeds of the Belgian Sheepdog is the local Malinois. The &quot;Mechelse koekoek&quot; is a local poultry breed, fleshy chickens with black and white feathers which extend on the birds&#x27; legs, with colours reminiscent of a cuckoo, hence the name.

Mechelsen Bruynen was allegedly the emperor Charles V&#x27;s favourite beer. A version is still brewed in the city at Het Anker brewery, one of the oldest breweries in Belgium.

==Climate==
Mechelen has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). Mechelen has a narrow temperature range between seasons for its high latitude, despite its inland position. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, whereas winters usually remain above freezing. Similar to Belgium as a whole, the climate is relatively cloudy and receives frequent rainfall, often light.

==Sports==
Home of two old Belgian football clubs, founded in 1904: K.R.C. Mechelen and K.V. Mechelen. The latter contributed to the international glamour of the city by winning the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the European Super Cup in 1988. The number of lesser local teams shows this sport&#x27;s popularity: Rapid Leest, Sporting Mechelen, Leest Utd., VV Leest, Walem, SK.Heffen, Zennester Hombeek, FC Muizen. In 1985, the city hosted the Canoe Sprint World Championships.

Home of the rugby union club Mechelen RFC. Also the Ultimate club Freespect is located in Mechelen.

==Main sights==

There are several important cathedrals and churches in Mechelen. Most famous is Sint-Romboutskathedraal (St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral) with its dominating tower, which was consecrated in 1312 and is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site. The domed, baroque Basiliek van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-van-Hanswijk, a famous place of pilgrimage in Belgium, was designed by native architect Lucas Faydherbe, some of whose sculptures can also be found in the cathedral, and was completed in 1876. The Kerk van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-over-de-Dijle (Church of Our Lady across the river Dijle) and the Sint-Janskerk exhibit work from Rubens, including &#x27;The Adoration of the Magi&#x27; and &#x27;The Miraculous Draught of Fishes&#x27; respectively. Other important churches in Mechelen include the baroque Begijnhofkerk (Church of the Beguines, dedicated to St. Alexis and St. Catherine); the former Jesuit church Sint-Pieter en Pauluskerk (Saints Peter and Paul); and the present Jesuit Church of Our Lady of Leliendaal.

Other religious buildings in Mechelen include the Palace of the Archbishop of the Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussels, still in use for its original purpose by the current Archbishop De Kesel. These palaces may not be open to the public in general but do offer a good external view. The Klein Begijnhof and the Groot Begijnhof (Small and Large Beguinages), which house lay religious women, form part of the Flemish Béguinages World Heritage Site. The grounds of the Theravada Buddhist place of worship Wat Dhammapateep (Temple of the Flame of Truth or Reality as taught by the Enlightened One) has since 2005 housed a green granite Buddha, sculptured in China, seated on a dark green granite socle – the tallest granite Buddha in Europe.

The Refuge of Grimbergen, the Refuge of Villers, the Refuge of Rozendaal, the Refuge of Sint-Truiden and the Refuge of Tongerlo, are retreat mansions for distant abbeys, the latter now housing the Manufacturer De Wit which restores the finest tapestries, for which Flanders was famous in the 16th century.

The Lakenhal (a cloth hall) and the 14th-century Belfry beside it are now incorporated with the modern City Hall complex on the main square. The hall and belfry are part of the Belfries of Belgium and France World Heritage Site for their civic importance and architecture. 

The Brusselpoort, the last remaining of the city&#x27;s twelve gates was built in the 13th century. Along with the Schepenhuis, the oldest stone-built city hall in Flanders and the historical seat of the &#x27;Grote Raad&#x27; (Great Council or Supreme Court), and the gothic-renaissance Hof van Busleyden where Hieronymus van Busleyden received Erasmus, Thomas More, and the later Pope Adrian VI, now house the City Museum. The Vismarkt (former fish market) is a 16th-century square located near the heart of the city along the river Dijle.

Many famous people resided in Mechelen in the 16th-19th centuries, and their houses still remain today. The Hof van Savoye was built for Margaret of Austria while she was regent of the Netherlands and in it she raised the later Charles Quint. It is one of the first Renaissance buildings north of the Alps and was converted to the meeting place of for courts of justice in 1609. In addition, Mechelen contains the &quot;Hof van Nassau&quot;, a 15th-century building which served as temporary court of Margaret of York when she arrived in Mechelen after her marriage with Charles the Bold, as well as the palace she resided in after Charles&#x27;s death.

Other notable houses from the time period include:
* The &quot;Hof van Hoogstraten&quot;, 16th-century palace of Antoon I van Lalaing
* The &quot;Hof van Cortenbach&quot;, 16th-century building
* The &quot;Hof van Coloma&quot;, 18th-century palace of Jean Ernest Coloma, Baron of St-Pieters Leeuw and member of the Coloma family

Mechelen also contains many museums, parks, and zoos:
* The Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance in a wing of the former Casern Dossin, built in the 18th century by Queen Maria Theresa of Austria, ruler of the Austrian Netherlands.
* Technopolis, center for hands-on Science and Technology.

Mechelen also contains the Royal Carillon School &quot;Jef Denyn&quot; where carillonneurs come from around the world to study the carillon and to play the instrument.

Other sites in Mechelen include:
*&#x27;t Groen Waterke, a picturesque small remnant of bygone canals – in particular of the Melaan, of which a longer stretch was after more than a century uncovered in 2007.
*A stone pillar &quot;De Mijlpaal&quot;, now prominent in front of the station, had marked the nearby destination point of the first passenger train ride on the continent. The name was adopted by the railway workers&#x27; club for miniature model trains, and by a small museum housed in one of the oldest railroad buildings commemorates the historical event and consequent local industry of national importance.

There are over 300 protected monuments in Mechelen.

==Police==
The city of Mechelen uses ANPR cameras since September 2011 to check all inbound and outbound cars against a database of stolen, non-insured and cars listed for other reasons. In case of a positive match, an alarm is generated in the dispatching room, enabling the police to quickly intercept the car. Mechelen was one of the first cities in Belgium to use ANPR on this scale. As of early 2012, 1 million cars per week are checked in this way. Mechelen started this project with SAIT Zenitel.

Mechelen and Willebroek formed a unified local police zone on 1 January 2015; it was extended with Puurs-Sint-Amands and Bornem on 1 January 2023, the zone now being called .

<doc id="156172" wikidata="Q908546" url="?curid=156172" title="Puurs">
<text>Puurs () is a former municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. It is located in the Flemish Region. The municipality comprised the towns of Breendonk, Liezele, , Ruisbroek (old spelling: &quot;Ruysbroeck&quot;) and Puurs proper. There is also the hamlet of Kalfort. In 2021, Puurs had a total population of 17,684. The total area is .

Puurs sits about 5 meters above mean sea level. Its geography shows only minor elevation differences. Puurs is mainly rural, with some low intensity industry development in the North alongside the N16 expressway. However, because of its proximity to the cities of Antwerp and Brussels (both within a radius) and its excellent accessibility, Puurs is developing increasingly into a residential town.

Effective 1 January 2019, Puurs and Sint-Amands were merged into the new municipality of Puurs-Sint-Amands.

==History==
Signs of habitation dating back to the Iron Age, as well as early Roman and Merovingian times, have been found in Puurs.

Arguably, the Benedictine abbeys of Saint-Cornelimunster of Aachen were the lords of Puurs in the 10th century A.D. In 1278 the municipality was acquired by the Abbey of Sint-Bernard&#x27;s upon Scheldt, whose property it would remain until the end of the 18th century.

==Points of interest==

=== Saint-Peter Church ===
Puurs&#x27; Saint-Peter Church is quite large and is hence sometimes referred to as the region&#x27;s &quot;cathedral&quot;. It was built in the 15th century, on the remains of a roman-style church. The baroque-style bell tower was added in the late 17th century. The classical center piece was completed in 1744.

===Asparagus===
The lands of Kalfort are widely renowned for producing the most delicious asparagus, and at the beginning of summer a festival is held in honour of this &quot;white gold&quot;.

===Beer===
The internationally sold Duvel beer is brewed in Breendonk, by the Duvel-Moortgat brewery. Each year in August, a long foot march called the Dodentocht (Death March) passes by the brewery, and participants and spectators can enjoy Duvel beer for free.

===Nazi Prison Camp===
Fort Breendonk was used by the Nazis as a political prison camp. It is kept in its World War II state and is open for visiting. Fort Breendonk and its twin sister Fort Liezele (which now serves as a municipal recreational area) were initially built by the Belgian military just before World War I, as part of a string of fortresses (the National Redoubt) designed to protect the approaches to Antwerp. Since 1976, the site of the fort has been part of the municipality of Willebroek.

===Heritage railway===
The Dendermonde-Puurs Steam Railway is a heritage railroad that links up Puurs and Dendermonde. The maintenance road that runs alongside serves as a bicycle track. Bikers can leave the track in Sint-Amands and follow the scenic route up North on the banks of the river Scheldt.

=== COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing ===
Puurs is the location of Pfizer&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing hub in Europe. Starting in December 2020, vaccine doses were transported by armed cargo trucks and military-escorted planes, to facilities across the planet.

==International relations==
===Twin towns - sister cities===
Puurs was twinned with:
* Dębica in Poland

On 13 November 2020, the municipality of Puurs-Sint-Amands suspended its 20-year-long partnership with the Polish town of Dębica because of the town&#x27;s adoption of the Charter of The Rights of The Family, which, according to the Belgians, discriminates against LGBT people.

<doc id="156173" wikidata="Q912030" url="?curid=156173" title="Sint-Amands">
<text>Sint-Amands () is a town and a former municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp, Belgium. The municipality comprises the towns of Lippelo, Oppuurs and Sint-Amands proper. In 2021, Sint-Amands had a total population of 8,524. The total area is 15.58 km2. Sint-Amands is located at the right bank of the Scheldt river.

Effective 1 January 2019, Puurs and Sint-Amands were merged into the new municipality of Puurs-Sint-Amands.

== History ==
The inhabited area of Sint-Amands has been present since Roman times, with Roman artifacts discovered in the modern day municipality. 

The first written reference to Sint-Amands dates to 822, in a document authored by Louis the Pious, king of Carolingian Empire at that time and son of Charlemagne. Sint-Amands was the central location of the Baasrode region (today Dendermonde) and the region was given as a gift to the Saint-Amand Abbey.

In the 11th century, the region split into three parts: Baasrode, Sint-Amands, and Mariekerke. During this time period, a large area of the right bank of the Scheldt river was incorporated into the Flanders region and Sint-Amands became a separate seigneury.

The establishment of a parish in Sint-Amands was first noted in 1281 in the records of the diocese of Kamerijk. In 1559, the parish merged with the diocese of Mechelen until 1600 when it merged with the diocese of Ghent. In 1801, the parish once again presided under the diocese of Mechelen.

== Industry ==
Until the 19th century, Sint-Amands was an agricultural town. There were several large farms, but most land was divided into smaller farms.

Prior to the construction of the Brussels-Willebroek canal, Sint-Amands saw heavy shipping traffic with barges heading to Brussels, Mechelen, Antwerp, Dendermonde, and Temse.

<doc id="156198" wikidata="Q55430" url="?curid=156198" title="Zhang Yimou">
<text>Zhang Yimou (; born 14 November 1950) is a Chinese filmmaker. A leading figure of China&#x27;s Fifth Generation directors, he made his directorial debut in 1988 with &quot;Red Sorghum,&quot; which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.

Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with three Academy Awards nominations for Best Foreign Language Film for &quot;Ju Dou&quot; in 1990, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; in 1991, and &quot;Hero&quot; in 2003; a Silver Lion, two Golden Lion prizes and the Glory to the Filmmaker Award at the Venice Film Festival; Grand Jury Prize, Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and Technical Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival; the Golden Bear, the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1993, he was a member of the jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. Zhang directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games as well as the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games, which received considerable international acclaim.

One of Zhang&#x27;s recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as &quot;To Live&quot; (1994) and &quot;Not One Less&quot; (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;, and in his wuxia films like &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;. His highest-budgeted film to date is the 2016 monster film &quot;The Great Wall&quot;, set in Imperial China and starring Matt Damon. In 2010, Zhang received an honorary doctorate from Yale, and in 2018, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Boston University. In 2022, he joined the Beijing Film Academy as a distinguished professor.

==Early life==
Zhang was born on 14 November 1950 in Xi&#x27;an, the capital of Shaanxi province. Zhang&#x27;s father, Zhang Bingjun (), a dermatologist, had been an officer in the National Revolutionary Army under Chiang Kai-shek during the Chinese Civil War; an uncle and an elder brother had followed the Nationalist forces to Taiwan after their 1949 defeat. Zhang&#x27;s mother, Zhang Xiaoyou (), was a doctor at the 2nd Hospital affiliated Xi&#x27;an Jiao Tong University who graduated from Xi&#x27;an Medical University. He has two younger brothers, Zhang Weimou () and Zhang Qimou (). As a result of his family&#x27;s ties to the Nationalist movement, Zhang faced difficulties in his early life.

During the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, Zhang left his school studies and went to work, first as a farm labourer for 3 years, and later at a cotton textile mill for 7 years in the city of Xianyang. During this time he took up painting and amateur still photography, selling his own blood to buy his first camera. In 1978, he went to Beijing Film Academy and majored in cinematography. He has an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Boston University and also one from Yale University.

==Career==

=== Film ===

==== Beginnings ====
When Gaokao was reinstated and the Beijing Film Academy reopened its doors to new students in 1978, Zhang, at 28, was over the Cinematography Department’s admission age limit of 22 and lacked the required academic qualifications. With the help of relatives in Beijing, Zhang appealed to the faculty members as well as prominent artists, such as Bai Xueshi, Huang Yongyu, and Hua Junwu, then the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s general secretary. Hua presented Zhang’s photography portfolio to Huang Zhen, Minister of Culture, who, impressed by Zhang’s talent, instructed the academy to admit him as a two-year auditing student. After two years, Zhang managed to become an official student and completed the full four-year program. He graduated with the BFA class of 1982, which also included Chen Kaige, Tian Zhuangzhuang, and Zhang Junzhao. The class went on to form the core of the Fifth Generation, who were a part of an artistic reemergence in China after the end of the Cultural Revolution.

Zhang and his co-graduates were assigned to various state-run studios, and Zhang was sent to work for the Guangxi Film Studio as a cinematographer. Though originally intended to work as director&#x27;s assistants, the graduates soon discovered there was a dearth of directors so soon after the Cultural Revolution, and gained permission to start making their own films. This led to the production of Zhang Junzhao&#x27;s &quot;One and Eight&quot;, on which Zhang Yimou worked as director of photography, and Chen Kaige&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Earth&quot;, in 1984. These two films were successes at the Hong Kong Film Festival and helped to bring the new Chinese cinema to the attention of worldwide audiences, signaling a departure from the earlier propagandist films of the Cultural Revolution. &quot;Yellow Earth&quot; is today widely considered the inaugural film of the Fifth Generation directors.

In 1985, after moving back to his home town of Xi&#x27;an, Zhang was engaged as cinematographer and lead actor for director Wu Tianming&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Old Well&quot;, which was subsequently released in 1987. The lead role won Zhang a Best Actor award at the Tokyo International Film Festival.

==== 1980s ====
1988 saw the release of Zhang&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, starring Chinese actress Gong Li in her first leading role. &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; was met with critical acclaim, bringing Zhang to the forefront of the world&#x27;s art directors, and winning him a Golden Bear for Best Picture at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival in 1988.

&quot;Codename Cougar&quot; (or &quot;The Puma Action&quot;), a minor experiment in the political thriller genre, was released in 1989, featuring Gong Li and eminent Chinese actor Ge You. However, it garnered less-than-positive reviews at home and Zhang himself later dismissed the film as his worst. In the same year, Zhang began work on his next project, the period drama &quot;Ju Dou&quot;. Starring Gong Li in the eponymous lead role, along with Li Baotian as the male lead, &quot;Ju Dou&quot; garnered as much critical acclaim as had &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; and became China&#x27;s first film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. &quot;Ju Dou&quot; highlighted the way in which the &quot;gaze&quot; can have different meanings, from voyeurism to ethical appeal. In 1989, Zhang became a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.

==== 1990s ====
After the success of &quot;Ju Dou&quot;, Zhang began work on &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;. Based on Su Tong&#x27;s novel &quot;Wives and Concubines&quot;, the film depicted the realities of life in a wealthy family compound during the 1920s. Gong Li was again featured in the lead role, her fourth collaboration with Zhang as director. &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; received almost unanimous international acclaim. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted its &quot;voluptuous physical beauty&quot; and sumptuous use of colours. Gong Li&#x27;s acting was also praised as starkly contrasting with the roles she played in Zhang&#x27;s earlier films. &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; was nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 1992 Academy Awards, becoming the second Chinese film to earn this distinction (after Zhang&#x27;s &quot;Ju Dou&quot;). It eventually lost out to Gabriele Salvatores&#x27;s &quot;Mediterraneo&quot;.

Zhang&#x27;s next directorial work, &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot;, in 1992, once again starring Gong Li in the lead role. The film, which tells the tale of a peasant woman seeking justice for her husband after he was beaten by a village official, was a hit at film festivals and won the Golden Lion award at the 1992 Venice Film Festival.

Next, Zhang directed &quot;To Live&quot;, an epic film based on the novel by Yu Hua of the same name. &quot;To Live&quot; highlighted the resilience of the ordinary Chinese people, personified by its two main characters, amidst three generations of upheavals throughout Chinese politics of the 20th century. It was banned in China, but released at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Jury Prize, as well as earning a Best Actor prize for Ge You. &quot;To Live&quot; was officially banned but still shown in theaters in China.

&quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; followed in 1995, featuring Gong Li in her seventh film under Zhang&#x27;s direction. The two had developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship, but this would end during production of &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot;. Zhang and Gong would not work together again until 2006&#x27;s &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot;.

1997 saw the release of &quot;Keep Cool&quot;, a black comedy film about life in modern China. &quot;Keep Cool&quot; marked only the second time Zhang had set a film in the modern era, after &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot;. As in &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot;, Zhang returned to the neorealist habit of employing non-professional actors and location shooting for &quot;Not One Less&quot; in 1999 which won him his second Golden Lion prize in Venice. Shot immediately after &quot;Not One Less&quot;, Zhang&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;The Road Home&quot; featured a new leading lady in the form of the young actress Zhang Ziyi, in her film debut. The film is based on a simple throw-back narrative centering on a love story between the narrator&#x27;s parents.

==== 2000–present ====

&quot;Happy Times&quot;, a relatively unknown film by Zhang, was based loosely on the short story &quot;&quot;, by Mo Yan. Starring popular Chinese actor Zhao Benshan and actress Dong Jie, it was an official selection for the Berlin International Film Festival in 2002.

Zhang&#x27;s next major project was the ambitious wuxia drama &quot;Hero&quot;, released in China in 2002. With an impressive lineup of Asian stars, including Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Zhang Ziyi, and Donnie Yen, &quot;Hero&quot; told a fictional tale about Ying Zheng, the King of the State of Qin (later to become the first Emperor of China), and his would-be assassins. The film was released in North America in 2004, two years after its Chinese release, by American distributor Miramax Films, and became a huge international hit. &quot;Hero&quot; was one of the few foreign-language films to debut at number 1 at the U.S. box office, and was one of the nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2003 Academy Awards.

Zhang followed up the huge success of &quot;Hero&quot; with another martial arts epic, &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;, in 2004. Set in the Tang dynasty, it starred Zhang Ziyi, Andy Lau, and Takeshi Kaneshiro as characters caught in a dangerous love triangle. &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; received acclaim from critics, who noted the use of colour that harked back to some of Zhang&#x27;s earlier works.

Released in China in 2005, &quot;Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles&quot; was a return to the more low-key drama that characterized much of Zhang&#x27;s middle period pieces. The film stars Japanese actor Ken Takakura, as a father who wishes to repair relations with his alienated son, and is eventually led by circumstance to set out on a journey to China. Zhang had been an admirer of Takakura for over thirty years.

2006&#x27;s &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; saw him reunited with leading actress Gong Li. Taiwanese singer Jay Chou and Hong Kong star Chow Yun-fat also starred in the period epic based on a play by Cao Yu.

Zhang&#x27;s recent films, and his involvement with the 2008 Olympic ceremonies, have not been without controversy. Some critics claim that his recent works, contrary to his earlier films, have received approval from the Chinese government. However, in interviews, Zhang has said that he is not interested in politics, and that it was an honour for him to direct the Olympic ceremonies because it was &quot;a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity&quot;. In 2008, he won a Peabody Award &quot;for creating a spell-binding, unforgettable celebration of the Olympic promise, featuring a cast of thousands&quot; at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. On 24 May 2010, Zhang was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree by Yale University, and was described as &quot;a genius with camera and choreography&quot;.

Zhang&#x27;s 2011 &quot;The Flowers of War&quot; was his most expensive film to date, budgeting for $90.2 million, until his 2016 &quot;The Great Wall&quot; surpassed it with a budget of $150 million. After the mixed reception and financial disappointment of &quot;The Great Wall&quot;, Zhang returned in 2018 with the critically acclaimed &quot;Shadow&quot;, which received 12 nominations at the 55th Golden Horse Awards and won four, including Best Director.

Starting in the 1990s, Zhang Yimou has been directing stage productions in parallel with his film career. In 1998, he directed an acclaimed version of Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Turandot&quot;, firstly in Florence and then later Turandot at the Forbidden City, Beijing, with Zubin Mehta conducting, the latter documented in the film &quot;The Turandot Project (2000)&quot;. He reprised his version of &quot;Turandot&quot; in October 2009, at the Bird&#x27;s Nest Stadium in Beijing, and plans to tour with the production in Europe, Asia and Australia in 2010. In 2001, Zhang adapted his 1991 film &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; for the stage, directing a ballet version.

Zhang has co-directed a number of outdoor folk musicals under the title &quot;Impression&quot;. These include &quot;Impression, Liu Sanjie&quot;, which opened in August 2003 at the Li River, Guangxi province; &quot;Impression Lijiang&quot;, in June 2006 at the foot of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Lijiang, Yunnan province; &quot;Impression West Lake&quot;, in late 2007 at the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province; &quot;Impression Hainan&quot; in late 2009, set in Hainan Island; and &quot;Impression Dahongpao&quot; set on Mount Wuyi, in Fujian province. All five performances were co-directed by Wang Chaoge and Fan Yue.

Zhang also led the production of Tan Dun&#x27;s opera, &quot;The First Emperor&quot;, which had its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on 21 December 2006.
In 2017 he directed an innovative ballet titled &quot;2047 Apologue&quot;, where the 12 minute solo finale &quot;The Weaving Machine&quot; was choreographed by Rose Alice Larkings and including hundreds of LED lamps. Onstage as Rose Alice danced the 12 minute solo was an elderly Chinese weaver at her loom, highlighting the old crafts and industries which remain so important in a world of new technology.

=== 2008 and 2022 Beijing Olympics opening and closing ceremonies ===
Zhang was chosen to direct the Beijing portion of the closing ceremonies of two Olympics: the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. He directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, alongside co-director and choreographer Zhang Jigang. He also directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2022 Winter Paralympics.

Zhang was a runner-up for the Time Magazine Person of the Year award in 2008. Steven Spielberg, who withdrew as an adviser to the Olympic ceremonies to pressure China into helping with the conflict in Darfur, described Zhang&#x27;s works in the Olympic ceremonies in &quot;Time magazine&quot;, saying &quot;At the heart of Zhang&#x27;s Olympic ceremonies was the idea that the conflict of man foretells the desire for inner peace. This theme is one he&#x27;s explored and perfected in his films, whether they are about the lives of humble peasants or exalted royalty. This year he captured this prevalent theme of harmony and peace, which is the spirit of the Olympic Games. In one evening of visual and emotional splendor, he educated, enlightened, and entertained us all.&quot;

== Style ==
In terms of style and personality, he leans towards a director&#x27;s thinking of sensation and intuition. This kind of director&#x27;s thinking focuses on visual perception, emphasizing elements such as composition, color, and lighting, and using a vivid and intuitive visual style to reflect or express the subject&#x27;s emotions.

Zhang Yimou is good at mastering simple colors, clear but not trivial or complicated. Using appropriate color combinations to express the ultimate beauty that one wants to give to the audience in their subjective thoughts. Taking red as an example, in &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, red represents fresh blood, savage plateau, and initial desire.

The films created by Zhang Yimou can meet the needs of the times and social development in terms of artistic expression, incorporating some of his own thinking and exploration, with a focus on macro social themes and contemporary thinking.

Reception of Zhang Yimou&#x27;s films has been mixed. While some critics praise his striking aesthetics and ability to break into the Western art market, some Chinese-based critics have attacked Zhang for pandering to Western audiences and portraying China as weak, exotic, and vulnerable.

==Personal life==

=== Relationship ===

==== Xiao Hua ====
Zhang Yimou&#x27;s first wife is Xiao Hua. Xiao was born in Xi’an in 1951 to an intellectual family whose ancestral home was in Beijing. At the age of four, Xiao was sent to live with her grandmother in Beijing, where she grew up. In 1965, she returned to Xi’an to attend the middle school and became a classmate of Zhang. After graduation, Zhang invited Xiao to join him in the Down to the Countryside Movement to settle in rural Shaanxi. Xiao agreed and they were sent to Qian County for 3 years, when they began a relationship. In 1971, Zhang and Xiao returned to Xi&#x27;an. Zhang became a worker at a cotton mill in Xianyang, while Xiao was assigned to a factory in Xingping County. Starting in 1972, China allowed workers, farmers, and soldiers to apply for university. Xiao tried but failed the entrance exams for two consecutive years. In 1975, she was recommended for admission to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Zhang, having been deprived of the opportunity for college education due to his “anti-revolutionary” family background, discouraged her from attending, saying, &quot;You’ll grow close to your university classmates, find common ground with them, and eventually look down on me.&quot; As a result, Xiao declined the opportunity.

In 1978, the national college entrance exam was reinstated in China and Zhang applied to the Beijing Film Academy. The age limit for the Cinematography Department was 22, and 28-year-old Zhang was initially rejected. Through Xiao&#x27;s brother-in-law, eventually, Zhang managed to get his photography portfolio to Huang Zhen, then China&#x27;s Minister of Culture. Huang appreciated Zhang’s work and approved his admission. Before heading to Beijing for his studies, he and Xiao had a modest wedding. After graduating in 1982, Zhang was assigned to Guangxi Film Studio as a cinematographer, rarely returning home. On March 31, 1983, their daughter Zhang Mo was born while Zhang was filming &quot;One and Eight&quot; in Guangxi. In October 1987, while doing Zhang’s laundry, Xiao found a love letter from Gong Li in his pocket. A few days later, Xiao received a call from Gong&#x27;s then boyfriend, surnamed Yang, who told her: “I’ve met with Zhang Yimou. He said that my relationship with my wife was a misunderstanding that arose from our time in the countryside.” In 1988, Zhang and Xiao divorced.

==== Gong Li ====
Zhang&#x27;s personal and professional relationship with his muse Gong Li has been highly publicized. Their relationship started in 1986 on the set of &quot;Red Sorghum,&quot; when Zhang was married to Xiao while Gong was in a relationship with Yang. Yang violently assaulted Gong after finding out her relationship with Zhang. In 1988, Zhang divorced Xiao for Gong. In 1995, soon after shooting &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot;, their 7th collaboration during their relationship, Zhang announced their break-up amidst rumors of Gong&#x27;s affair with then managing director of British American Tobacco in China, Ooi Hoe Seong (whom she married a year later). According to Gong&#x27;s mother, however, they split due to Zhang&#x27;s reluctance to marry Gong after their 9-year relationship. According to Zhou Xiaofeng, Zhang Yimou’s script consultant, producer Zhang Weiping deliberately sabotaged the relationship between the director and actress by spreading lies and rumors, including claims of her affair with Ooi. This alleged strategy aimed to exploit Zhang Yimou while sidelining his more tactful and decisive partner, ultimately leading to a feud between Gong and the producer. After their break-up, Zhang invited Gong to star in his films &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;House of Flying Daggers,&quot; but she declined both. They reunited in 2006 for the film &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower,&quot; during which Gong stipulated in her contract that she would not meet the producer Zhang Weiping.

==== Chen Ting ====
In 1999, 19-year-old Chen Ting met Zhang when she auditioned for his film &quot;Happy Times&quot;. The two began a secret relationship, and their first son, Zhang Yinan, was born in 2001, followed by their second son, Zhang Yiding, in 2004, and their daughter, Zhang Yijiao, in 2006. The couple did not marry until December 2011 in Wuxi, Jiangsu, where Chen lives, in order to secure hukou for their children.

On March 11, 2012, actress He Jun revealed Zhang’s remarriage and his three children on Weibo. He Jun had been a backup candidate for &quot;The Flowers of War&quot; cast, but was dismissed after revealing her participation in the production on Weibo in December 2010. It was suggested that He is a niece of the assistant to Zhang Weiping, Zhang Yimou’s former business partner until their split in 2012, and that Weiping allegedly orchestrated He’s revelation—a claim He denied. Further online allegations claimed that Zhang had fathered seven children with four different women. Zhang was subsequently investigated by the authorities for violating China&#x27;s one-child policy. On 29 November 2013, under the public pressure, Zhang admitted in a statement that he and his wife, Chen Ting, have two sons and a daughter, and that they would cooperate with Wuxi&#x27;s family planning authorities for an investigation and accept any legal consequences. The statement also suggested that certain individuals had used illegal means to expose Zhang&#x27;s privacy. On January 9, 2014, the Wuxi Family Planning Bureau fined the couple 7,487,854 RMB (roughly US$1.2 million) for violating China&#x27;s one-child policy. On May 31, 2021, as China promulgated a three-child policy, Chen posted a poster titled “The Three-Child Policy Is Here” on Weibo, with the caption “Mission accomplished ahead of time.” Zhang Yimou’s studio reposted her Weibo.

=== Feud ===

==== Zhang Weiping ====
Zhang Weiping (no relation) first met Zhang Yimou in 1989 while working in pharmaceutical procurement at a hospital in Beijing. At the time, Zhang Weiping’s elder brother worked in customs, and Zhang Weiping himself later worked for the German company Siemens as a customs broker. This position facilitated the development of a close friendship with Zhang Yimou, as the latter’s film reels frequently required customs clearance for overseas processing. In the 1990s, Zhang Weiping transitioned into business. In 1996, when Zhang Yimou’s film &quot;Keep Cool&quot; faced a funding crisis following Gong Li’s withdrawal due to her breakup with the director, which led other investors to pull out, Zhang Weiping stepped in with an investment of 26 million yuan. &quot;Keep Cool&quot; went on to gross 46 million yuan, becoming China’s highest-grossing domestic film of the year. Despite incurring a personal loss of nearly 10 million yuan due to weak overseas copyright sales, Zhang Weiping’s confidence in the potential of the Chinese film industry was bolstered by the film’s domestic box office success. From that point onward, Zhang Weiping became Zhang Yimou’s investor, producer, and business partner for 16 years. In 1997, they co-founded New Pictures and collaborated on 11 films. However, Zhang Yimou left the company in 2012 after an acrimonious split, stemming from years of business and creative disputes and precipitated by the critical and commercial underperformance of &quot;The Flowers of War.&quot;

After the split, according to &quot;Fate: Zhang Yimou the Lonely&quot;, a 2015 biography written by Zhou Xiaofeng, Zhang Yimou’s script consultant since 2006, Zhang Weiping orchestrated the revelation of Zhang Yimou’s secret remarriage and children, which violated China’s one-child policy. Since 2015, Zhang Yimou filed three lawsuits against Zhang Weiping and his New Pictures company to recover unpaid earnings. In 2015, Zhang Yimou sought 15 million yuan in box office revenue share from &quot;A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop&quot;. Meanwhile, his wife, Chen Ting, disclosed on Weibo that during the two men’s 16-year collaboration, Zhang Yimou had only been paid 12 million yuan in total. She also accused Zhang Weiping of falsely claiming to the family planning authorities that Zhang Yimou earned an annual salary of millions of yuan, allegedly to increase fines imposed for violating the one-child policy. In 2019, the court awarded Zhang Yimou only 2.46 million yuan from his original claim of 15 million yuan. Zhang Weiping refused to comply, resulting in his placement on the list of judgment defaulters. The same year, New Pictures was shut down. In 2020, Zhang Yimou filed the second lawsuit against Zhang Weiping, seeking 2.59 million yuan in unpaid labor fees. Zhang Yimou won the case and the court dismissed Zhang Weiping&#x27;s appeal. In 2021, Zhang Yimou filed the third lawsuit against Zhang Weiping, citing “shareholder liability for harming the interests of company creditors.”

<text>Sonic Youth Recordings (sometimes referred to as SYR) is a record label established by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth in 1996. SYR was set up to allow the band to release records by themselves and their friends without the commercial pressures of a major label. As a result, the work on this label tends towards free improvisation and experimental music.

The records that Sonic Youth themselves released on this label follow a tradition where each album is released in a different language. &quot;SYR1&quot; has song titles and album sleeve artwork in French; &quot;SYR2&quot; is in Dutch, &quot;SYR3&quot; is in Esperanto, &quot;SYR4&quot; is in English, &quot;SYR5&quot; is in Japanese, &quot;SYR6&quot; is in Lithuanian, &quot;SYR7&quot; is in Arpitan, &quot;SYR8&quot; is in Danish, &quot;SYR9&quot; is in French, and &quot;AUG5&quot; is in English.

<doc id="156205" wikidata="Q1197575" url="?curid=156205" title="Whose Body?">
<text>Whose Body? is a 1923 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers first published in the UK by T. Fisher Unwin and in the US by Boni &amp; Liveright. It was her debut novel, and the book in which she introduced the character of Lord Peter Wimsey. &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; (1926) would be the next novel in which the character reappears.

Initial reviews of the novel were largely positive, and later critics have continued to express admiration. 

==Plot==
Thipps, an architect, finds a dead body wearing nothing but a pair of pince-nez in the bath of his London flat. Lord Peter Wimsey—a nobleman who has recently developed an interest in criminal investigation as a hobby—resolves to investigate the matter privately. Leading the official investigation is Inspector Sugg, who suggests that the body may be that of the famous financier Sir Reuben Levy, who disappeared from his bedroom in mysterious circumstances the night before. Sir Reuben&#x27;s disappearance is in the hands of Inspector Charles Parker, a friend of Wimsey&#x27;s. Although the body in the bath superficially resembles that of Sir Reuben, it quickly becomes clear that it is not him, and it appears that the cases may be unconnected. Wimsey joins Parker in his investigation.

Thipps&#x27;s flat is near a teaching hospital, and Wimsey considers the possibility that the unexpected appearance of a body may have been the result of a practical joke perpetrated by one of the medical students. However, that is excluded by evidence given at the inquest by the respected surgeon and neurologist Sir Julian Freke, who states that there was no subject missing from his dissecting room.

A prostitute&#x27;s chance encounter with Levy on the night of his disappearance, on the road leading to the hospital and to Sir Julian Freke&#x27;s house next door, provides Wimsey with the clue that allows him to link the two cases. Freke maintains that he was being discreetly consulted by Levy about a medical problem, and that Levy left at about 10 pm. Freke&#x27;s manservant reports that Freke was inexplicably taking a bath at about 3 o&#x27;clock the following morning, judging from the noise of the cistern.

Wimsey ultimately discovers that Freke had lured Sir Reuben to his house with the promise of some inside financial information, and had murdered him there. Freke smuggled the body out onto the roof under cover of the cistern noise, took it into the hospital, and substituted it for that of a pauper which had been donated for dissection by the local workhouse. He then visited Sir Reuben&#x27;s home to stage his disappearance, returned, carried the pauper&#x27;s body over the flat roofs of the nearby houses and placed it in Thipps&#x27; bath, entering via a bathroom window that had been left open. As a joke, he added a pair of pince-nez that had by chance come into his possession. Returning to the hospital, he prepared Sir Reuben&#x27;s body for dissection, giving it to his medical students for that purpose the next day.

Freke unsuccessfully attempts to murder both Parker and Wimsey. When it becomes clear that his actions have been discovered, he prepares a written confession of his long-held desire for revenge: many years earlier, he had hoped to marry the woman who later became Lady Levy, but she had chosen Sir Reuben in preference to him. He had also wanted to substantiate his personal theory of mind – in which conscience, sense of responsibility and so on are merely &quot;surface symptoms&quot; which arise from physical irritation or damage to the tissues of the brain. As he completes the confession the police arrive to arrest him, just in time to prevent his suicide.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Initial reviews of the novel in 1923 were largely positive. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that “there seems to be no reason why the discerning, but by no means infallible, Lord Peter should not become one of the best-known and best-liked among the many amateur detectives of fiction”, while the &quot;New York Herald&quot; called the book &quot;The best detective story we have read since we stopped regarding books purely as amusements”.

In their 1989 review of crime novels, the US writers Barzun and Taylor called the book &quot;a stunning first novel that disclosed the advent of a new star in the firmament, and one of the first magnitude. The episode of the bum in the bathtub, the character (and the name) of Sir Julian Freke, the detection, and the possibilities in Peter Wimsey are so many signs of genius about to erupt. Peter alone suffers from fatuousness overdone, a period fault that Sayers soon blotted out&quot;.

A. N. Wilson, writing in 1993, noted that &quot;The publisher made [Sayers] tone the story down, but the plot depends on Lord Peter being clever enough to spot that the body, uncircumcised, is not that of a Jew&quot;. In the 1923 text, Parker says that the body in the bath could not be Sir Reuben Levy because &quot;Sir Reuben is a pious Jew of pious parents, and the chap in the bath obviously isn&#x27;t ...&quot; Later versions replaced this with &quot;But as a matter of fact, the man in the bath is no more Sir Reuben Levy than Adolf Beck, poor devil, was John Smith&quot;.

In her introduction to Hodder &amp; Stoughton&#x27;s 2016 reprint, Laura Wilson argued that Wimsey, conceived as a caricature of the gifted amateur sleuth, owes something to P. G. Wodehouse, whose Bertie Wooster had made his first appearance some years earlier. Sayers said of Wimsey that &quot;at the time I was particularly hard up and it gave me pleasure to spend his fortune for him. When I was dissatisfied with my single unfurnished room I took a luxurious flat for him in Piccadilly. ... I can heartily recommend this inexpensive way of furnishing to all who are discontented with their incomes&quot;.

In his 2017 overview of the classic crime genre, Martin Edwards said that Lord Peter Wimsey began his life as a fantasy figure, created &quot;as a conscious act of escapism by young writer who was short of money and experiencing one unsatisfactory love affair after another&quot;.

In an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; commemorating the novel&#x27;s centenary in 2024, Sarah Weinman wrote that “What elevated Sayers’s debut to the upper ranks of the genre was the quality of her prose and the sense that her sleuth had more emotional heft than he displayed.” She considered that even after 100 years the story remains a pure pleasure to read.

==Adaptations==
BBC Radio 4 produced a radio dramatisation starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey and Patricia Routledge as his mother the Dowager Duchess of Denver.

<text>Clouds of Witness is a 1926 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, the second in her series featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. In the United States the novel was first published in 1927 under the title Clouds of Witnesses.

It was adapted for television in 1972, as part of a series starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter.

==Plot==
Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Denver, has taken a shooting lodge at Riddlesdale in Yorkshire. At 3 o&#x27;clock one morning, Captain Denis Cathcart, the fiancé of Wimsey&#x27;s sister Lady Mary, is found shot dead just outside the conservatory. Mary, trying to leave the house at 3 am for a reason she declines to explain, finds Denver kneeling over Cathcart&#x27;s body. Suspicion falls on Denver, as the lethal bullet had come from his revolver and he admits having quarrelled with Cathcart earlier, after receiving a letter, which is lost, informing him that Cathcart had been caught cheating at cards. He maintains that he stumbled across the body after returning from a walk on the moors, but will say no more.

Wimsey arrives to investigate, along with his friend Inspector Charles Parker, who will find himself becoming increasingly attracted to Lady Mary throughout the novel. They find a series of unidentified footprints and a discarded jewel in the form of a cat. It is clear that both Denver and Mary are hiding something: Denver refuses to budge from his story that he was simply out for a walk, while Mary is feigning illness to avoid talking to anyone.

Wimsey investigates several false leads. The footprints turn out to be those of Mary&#x27;s secret fiancé, Goyles, a socialist agitator considered &quot;an unsuitable match&quot; by her family. He had crept into the grounds for a pre-arranged rendezvous at 3 am, when the couple had intended to elope. Mary assumed that he was the killer and has been covering for him, but when she learns that he had fled in terror after discovering the body, she breaks off their engagement in disgust at his cowardice.

Wimsey&#x27;s investigations lead him to a violent local farmer, Grimethorpe, with a stunningly beautiful wife. Wimsey finds the lost letter that was sent to Denver wedged in the window of the Grimethorpes&#x27; bedroom, proving that Denver had been visiting Mrs Grimethorpe on the night of Cathcart&#x27;s death. This is what he has refused to admit, being determined to shield his mistress even at the price of being wrongfully convicted of murder.

Eventually, the jewelled cat leads Wimsey to Cathcart&#x27;s mistress of many years, who had left him for an American millionaire. Wimsey travels to New York to find her, makes a daring and dangerous transatlantic flight back to London, and arrives just in time to present his evidence at Denver&#x27;s trial in the House of Lords. Wimsey brings a letter that Cathcart had written to his mistress on the night of his death. After hearing that she was leaving him, Cathcart had written back stating his intention to commit suicide. He had then taken Denver&#x27;s revolver from the study and gone out into the garden to shoot himself. The confounding factor in the investigation had been the coincidence of Denver returning from Mrs Grimethorpe&#x27;s, just in time to find the body, at the same time that Mary had emerged from the house for her rendezvous with Goyles.

Denver is acquitted. As he is leaving the House of Lords, Grimethorpe appears, shoots at him, flees, and is knocked down and killed by a passing taxi. Mrs Grimethorpe, finally free of her husband, declares that she has no interest in continuing her affair with Denver. In the final scene of the book, Inspector Sugg finds Wimsey, Parker, and a friend on the street after midnight, hopelessly drunk, celebrating the end of the case. Sugg assists them into cabs, and reflects, &quot;Thank Gawd there weren&#x27;t no witnesses.&quot;

==Title==

The book&#x27;s title derives from the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 12, verse 1: &quot;Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==

In his 2017 overview of the classic crime genre, Martin Edwards suggests that &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; is the work of a novelist learning her craft, but that it displays the storytelling qualities that soon made Sayers famous. While this early portrayal of Wimsey verges on a caricature, Sayers sought to characterise him in greater depth in later novels. Edwards notes that in this novel Wimsey is portrayed not only as a great detective but also as a man of action, and he quotes part of the defence counsel&#x27;s speech to the House of Lords, explaining Wimsey&#x27;s transatlantic dash to attend the trial:

Written in 1926, this imagined flight of a solo aviator, albeit with a passenger in this instance, preceded the actual accomplishment of Charles Lindbergh who achieved the solo feat a year later. Alcock and Brown, however, flying in tandem, had crossed the Atlantic non-stop in 1919.

A copy of &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; was one of the volumes modified by Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell in their adulterations of library books from the Islington and Hampstead libraries in the early 1960s.

==Adaptations==
In 1972 the novel was the subject of a BBC TV mini-series starring Ian Carmichael as Wimsey and Glyn Houston as Bunter.

<text>Unnatural Death is a 1927 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, her third featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. It was published under the title &quot;The Dawson Pedigree&quot; in the United States in 1928.

==Plot==
Lord Peter Wimsey and his friend Chief Inspector Parker hear about the death, in late 1925, of an elderly cancer sufferer named Agatha Dawson who was being cared for by her great-niece Mary Whittaker. Miss Dawson had an aversion to making a will and believed that, if she died without one, Miss Whittaker, her only known relative, would automatically inherit everything. 

Wimsey is intrigued despite there being no evidence of any crime having been committed. He sends his private investigator, Miss Katharine Climpson, to investigate. She discovers that shortly before Miss Dawson&#x27;s death her maids, the sisters Bertha and Evelyn Gotobed, had been dismissed. Wimsey asks his solicitor friend John Murbles to place advertisements in the press asking them to get in touch. A few days later, Bertha is found dead in Epping Forest. On the body is a £5 banknote, originally issued to a Mrs Muriel Forrest who lives in an elegant flat in London&#x27;s South Audley Street.

Wimsey and Parker visit her. She claims not to remember the banknote, but thinks she may have used it to bet on a horse. Wimsey tricks her into providing her fingerprints on a wineglass. In a drawer he finds a hypodermic syringe with a doctor&#x27;s prescription: &quot;to be injected when the pain is very severe&quot;.

Evelyn Gotobed tells Wimsey of an episode shortly before the sisters were dismissed in which Miss Whittaker had tried, unsuccessfully, to get them to witness Miss Dawson signing her will.

Wimsey visits a West Indian clergyman named Hallelujah Dawson, now in London. It seems that he may be a cousin of Miss Dawson, and a closer relative than Miss Whittaker. He has a large family and is in need of funds.

Wimsey learns of a motive for Miss Dawson to be killed before the end of 1925: a new &#x27;Property Act&#x27;, due to come into force on 1 January 1926, that changed the law of intestacy. Until 1925, the estate of a person dying without a will always passed to the closest relative, no matter how remote. From 1926, in the absence of near relatives the estate is forfeit to the Crown, leaving distant relations such as a great-niece with nothing.

Wimsey visits Mrs Forrest at her flat, where she unsuccessfully tries to drug him. She makes rather clumsy advances, and Wimsey suspects blackmail. He kisses her, realises that she is physically revolted, and slips away. 

Miss Climpson reports that Mary Whittaker &quot;is not of the marrying sort&quot;. Whittaker disappears along with her besotted young female admirer, Vera Findlater. Several days later, Miss Findlater&#x27;s body is found on the downs, brutally disfigured by a blow to the head. There is no sign of Mary Whittaker. A distinctive cap and male footprints nearby suggest a link with Hallelujah Dawson. However, the post mortem finds that Vera Findlater was already dead when she was struck. Close inspection reveals that the footprints have been faked, and that the scene has been set up in order to frame the innocent clergyman. Tyre tracks from Mrs Forrest&#x27;s car cause Wimsey to suspect her and Mary Whittaker of acting in collusion.

Wimsey&#x27;s manservant, Bunter, realises that the fingerprints on Mrs Forrest&#x27;s wineglass are identical to those on a cheque written by Miss Whittaker. Wimsey at last understands that Muriel Forrest and Mary Whittaker are one and the same person. She carried out the murders by injecting air into her victims&#x27; bloodstream with her hypodermic syringe, causing blockage and immediate death through heart failure. 

Miss Climpson heads to South Audley Street where she finds Mary Whittaker in her disguise as Mrs Forrest. She attacks Miss Climpson, who is saved from becoming another fatality by the timely arrival of Wimsey and Parker. 

Whittaker is committed to prison to await trial. There, she commits suicide. Wimsey is sickened by the killer&#x27;s evil and greed. Coming out of the prison on a sunny day with Parker, he finds a darkened world: they have emerged just at the time of the total solar eclipse.

==Literary significance and criticism==

According to James Brabazon in his biography of Sayers, she drew her ingenious and medically doubtful murder method from her familiarity with motor engines, gained from her affair with a car mechanic and motor-bike enthusiast.

In their review of crime novels, the US writers Barzun and Taylor stated that &quot;The tale is perhaps a little forced in conception and remote in tone. That is the trouble with all the great masters – they accustom us to such dazzling performances that when they give us what would seem wonderful coming from other hands, we sniff and act choosy. The mode of compassing death has been carped at, but no one could do anything but rejoice at Miss Climpson and her subterfuges.&quot;

HRF Keating, writing in 1989, noted that Sayers had &quot;invented a murder method that is appropriately dramatic and cunningly ingenious, the injection of an air-bubble with a hypodermic&quot;. However, &quot;not only would it require the use of an instrument so large as to be farcical, but Miss Sayers has her bubble put into an artery not a vein. No wonder afterwards she pledged herself &#x27;strictly in future to seeing I never write a book which I know to be careless&#x27;.&quot;

==Themes and treatment==
In &quot;Murder in the Closet: Essays on Queer Clues in Crime Fiction before Stonewall&quot; (2017), Noah Stewart described Mary Whittaker as being &quot;to my knowledge the most clearly delineated homosexual character in Golden Age detective fiction, despite the word &#x27;lesbian&#x27; never being used, and she&#x27;s depicted as enticing a young girl into a life of homosexuality&quot;. The episode in which Mary Whittaker is kissed by Wimsey is &quot;the closest that a writer in 1927 would be able to come to saying that a character was a lesbian and that kissing a man made her want to vomit.&quot; Laura Vorachek argued that, in the novel, &quot;Sayers attempts to challenge the prevalent cultural associations of blackness and criminality.&quot;

==Legal background==
On 1 January 1926, the date specified by Sayers, two important property statutes came into force in England: the Law of Property Act 1925 and the Administration of Estates Act 1925. The latter, corresponding most closely with the ‘Property Act’ of the novel, swept away the old rules on intestacy and specified by way of a six-point list the persons who would inherit if the intestate left neither issue nor parents. If the deceased had no surviving relatives of the classes mentioned (which did not include great-niece), the estate would go to the Crown.

==Adaptations==
In May 1975, an adaptation was made for BBC Radio 4, produced by Simon Brett and starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey.

<text>The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club is a 1928 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, her fourth featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Much of the novel is set in the Bellona Club, a fictional London club for war veterans (Bellona being a Roman goddess of war).

==Plot==
On the afternoon of 10 November, ninety-year-old General Fentiman is called to the deathbed of his estranged sister, Lady Dormer. He learns that, under the terms of her will, he stands to inherit most of her substantial fortune (money sorely needed by his grandsons, Robert and George Fentiman). However, should the General die first, nearly everything will go to Lady Dormer&#x27;s companion Ann Dorland.

Lady Dormer dies the next morning, Armistice Day, and that afternoon the General is found dead in his armchair at the Bellona Club. Dr Penberthy, a club member and the General&#x27;s personal physician, certifies death by natural causes but is unable to state the exact time the General died. As the estate would amply provide for all three claimants, the Fentiman brothers suggest a negotiated settlement, but Ann Dorland absolutely refuses. Wimsey is asked to investigate the General&#x27;s time of death.

Oddly enough, nobody saw the General arrive at the club at his usual time of 10 am. His manservant reports that the General did not return home after visiting Lady Dormer the day before. An unknown man by the name of Mr Oliver had telephoned to say that the General would be spending the night with him. Robert Fentiman says that he knows of Oliver, and much time is spent chasing the elusive individual through several countries before Robert admits that he does not actually exist.

Wimsey discovers that General Fentiman began to feel unwell while visiting his sister, and left her house to visit Dr Penberthy. The General then travelled to the club, meeting George Fentiman &quot;en route&quot;. At the club, the General informed Robert of the terms of the will; later, Robert discovered his grandfather had died of heart failure in the club library. Annoyed at losing his inheritance, Robert concealed the body overnight and invented Oliver to cover up the death. The next day, while the club members had stepped outside to observe the usual two minutes&#x27; silence at 11 am, Robert moved the body to the armchair.

Wimsey believes the General&#x27;s death is too convenient to be natural and has the body exhumed. An autopsy proves the General was poisoned by an overdose of the heart medication digitalis. When it becomes known that the body will be exhumed, Ann Dorland, who has an obvious motive, suddenly and suspiciously agrees to the proposed compromise with the Fentimans.

Wimsey finds Ann Dorland distressed by the callous and humiliating behaviour of Dr Penberthy, to whom she had been secretly engaged. It was he, with an eye on her expected inheritance, who had insisted she should refuse the compromise and fight for the whole estate. When it became known that the General would be exhumed, Penberthy broke the engagement off, giving highly insulting reasons. He had hoped that Ann would be embarrassed into silence, but Wimsey manages to get the truth from her.

Wimsey works out what had happened. When the General had consulted Dr Penberthy after seeing his sister, he had mentioned that under the terms of the will Ann Dorland would not inherit if Lady Dormer were to die before he did. To ensure that that did not happen, Penberthy prescribed the General a massive dose of digitalis, to be taken later that evening when Penberthy would not be in attendance. Contriving to be present later when the body was discovered, Penberthy was able to certify a natural death without arousing suspicion, in spite of Robert&#x27;s intervention which initially confused the time.

Penberthy writes a confession publicly exonerating Ann Dorland, and shoots himself in the club library. The three original claimants to the estate meet to divide it equitably, and Robert begins courting Ann.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Writing in 1990 Katherine Kenny described the book as the most successful of Sayers&#x27; early fiction, coupling a slick detective plot with vivid details of post-war English life. &quot;The book is a tightly constructed little drama based upon the old joke about an Englishman&#x27;s club so stuffy that its dead members cannot be differentiated from the living – a pertinent comment upon the society so described.”

==Adaptations==
In 1973 the novel was the subject of a BBC TV mini-series starring Ian Carmichael as Wimsey.
In 1975 it was broadcast on BBC radio as a serial in six 30-minute parts, also starring Ian Carmichael.

<text>Strong Poison is a 1930 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, her fifth featuring Lord Peter Wimsey and the first in which Harriet Vane appears.

==Plot==
The novel opens with mystery author Harriet Vane on trial for the murder of her former lover, Phillip Boyes: a writer with strong views on atheism, anarchy, and free love. Publicly professing to disapprove of marriage, he had persuaded a reluctant Harriet to live with him, only to renounce his principles a year later and to propose. Harriet, outraged at being deceived, had broken off the relationship.

Following the separation, the former couple had met occasionally, and the evidence at trial pointed to Boyes suffering from repeated bouts of gastric illness at around the time that Harriet was buying poisons under assumed names, to demonstrate – so she said – a plot point of her novel then in progress.

Returning from a holiday in North Wales in better health, Boyes had dined with his cousin, the solicitor Norman Urquhart, before going to Harriet&#x27;s flat to discuss reconciliation, where he had accepted a cup of coffee. That night he was taken fatally ill, apparently with gastritis. Foul play was eventually suspected, and a post-mortem revealed that Boyes had died from acute arsenic poisoning. Apart from Harriet&#x27;s coffee and the evening meal with his cousin in which every item had been shared by two or more people, the victim appeared to have taken nothing else that evening.

The trial results in a hung jury. As a unanimous verdict is required, the judge orders a re-trial. Lord Peter Wimsey visits Harriet in prison, declares his conviction of her innocence and promises to catch the real murderer. Wimsey also announces that he wishes to marry her, a suggestion that Harriet politely but firmly declines.

Working against time before the new trial, Wimsey first explores the possibility that Boyes killed himself. Wimsey&#x27;s friend, Detective Inspector Charles Parker, disproves that theory. 

The rich great-aunt of the cousins Urquhart and Boyes, Rosanna Wrayburn, is now quite old and close to death. Urquhart is acting as her family solicitor. He tells Wimsey that when she dies most of her fortune will pass to him, with nothing at all going to Boyes. Wimsey suspects that to be a lie, and sends his enquiry agent Miss Climpson to get hold of Rosanna&#x27;s original will, which she does in a comic scene exposing the practices of fraudulent mediums. The will in fact names Boyes as principal beneficiary.

Wimsey plants a spy, Miss Joan Murchison, in Urquhart&#x27;s office where she finds a hidden packet of arsenic. She also discovers that Urquhart had abused his position as Rosanna&#x27;s solicitor, embezzled her investments, then lost the money on the stock market. Urquhart recognised that he would face inevitable exposure should Rosanna die and Boyes claim his inheritance. However, Boyes was unaware of the will&#x27;s contents and Urquhart reasoned that if Boyes were to die first, nobody could challenge him as sole remaining beneficiary, and his fraud would not be revealed.

After perusing A.E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, in which the poet likens the reading of serious poetry to King Mithridates&#x27; self-immunization against poisons, Wimsey suddenly understands what had happened. Urquhart had administered the arsenic in an omelette which Boyes himself had cooked. Although Boyes and Urquhart had shared the dish, the latter had been unaffected as he had carefully built up his own immunity beforehand by taking small doses of the poison over a long period. Wimsey tricks Urquhart into a confession before witnesses.

At Harriet&#x27;s retrial, the prosecution presents no case and she is freed. Exhausted by her ordeal, she again rejects Wimsey&#x27;s proposal of marriage. Wimsey persuades Parker to propose to his sister, Lady Mary, whom he has long admired. Freddy Arbuthnot, Wimsey&#x27;s friend and stock market contact, marries Rachel Levy, the daughter of the murder victim in &quot;Whose Body?&quot;

==Principal characters==
*Lord Peter Wimsey – protagonist, aristocrat and amateur detective
*Harriet Vane – protagonist, author of detective fiction
*Philip Boyes – Harriet&#x27;s former lover, now deceased
*Norman Urquhart – Solicitor and Boyes&#x27; cousin
*Rosanna Wrayburn, or &quot;Cremorna Garden&quot; – great-aunt of Boyes and Urquhart, sometime stage performer, now senile and bedridden
*Caroline Booth, nurse to Mrs Wrayburn, believer in spiritualism
*Charles Parker – police detective, friend of Wimsey
*Miss Katharine Climpson – enquiry agent employed by Wimsey
*Miss Joan Murchison – enquiry agent, employee of Miss Climpson
*Lady Mary Wimsey – Wimsey&#x27;s younger sister, engaged to Parker
*The Hon. Freddy Arbuthnot – Wimsey&#x27;s friend and stock market contact
*Marjorie Phelps – artist friend of Wimsey

==Title==
The novel&#x27;s title appears in some variants of the Anglo-Scottish border ballad &quot;Lord Rendal&quot; whose title character was poisoned by his lover:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;What did you have for your breakfast, my own pretty boy?
What did you have for your breakfast, my comfort and joy?&quot;
&quot;A cup of strong poison; mother, make my bed soon,
There&#x27;s a pain in my heart, and I mean to lie down.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Literary significance and criticism ==
In their review of crime novels (1989 edition), the US writers Barzun and Taylor called the novel &quot;highest among the masterpieces. It has the strongest possible element of suspense – curiosity &quot;and&quot; the feeling one shares with Wimsey for Harriet Vane. The clues, the enigma, the free-love question, and the order of telling could not be improved upon. As for the somber opening, with the judge&#x27;s comments on how to make an omelet, it is sheer genius.&quot;

The effect of arsenic as described in the novel was accepted by the science of the time, but it is now believed that long-term consumption would in fact have caused many health problems.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for a BBC television series in 1987 starring Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter and Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane.

It has been adapted for radio three times:

==Background==
While Sayers was working on her first novel, &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, she began a relationship with John Cournos, a writer of Russian-Jewish background. Cournos was an advocate of free love: he did not believe in marriage and did not want children. Cournos pressed Sayers to have sex with contraception, but she, a High Anglican, resisted to avoid what she called &quot;the taint of the rubber shop&quot;. Their relationship foundered on the mismatch of expectations, and within two years Cournos – apparently not believing in the ideas he had professed – had married somebody else. Both Sayers and Cournos later wrote fictionalised versions of their relationship: Sayers in &quot;Strong Poison&quot; (1930) and Cournos in &quot;The Devil Is an English Gentleman&quot; (1932).

<doc id="156210" wikidata="Q853547" url="?curid=156210" title="MSX">
<text>MSX is a standardized home computer architecture, announced by ASCII Corporation on June 16, 1983. It was initially conceived by Microsoft as a product for the Eastern sector, and jointly marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, the director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft and Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period, in the same fashion as the VHS standard for home video tape machines. The first MSX computer sold to the public was a Mitsubishi ML-8000, released on October 21, 1983, thus marking its official release date.

MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries. There are differing accounts of MSX sales. One source claims 9 million MSX units were sold worldwide, including in Japan alone, whereas ASCII corporation founder Kazuhiko Nishi claims that 3 million were sold in Japan, and 1 million overseas. Despite Microsoft&#x27;s involvement, few MSX-based machines were released in the United States.

The meaning of the acronym MSX remains a matter of debate. In 2001, Kazuhiko Nishi recalled that many assumed that it was derived from &quot;Microsoft Extended&quot;, referring to the built-in Microsoft Extended BASIC (MSX BASIC). Others believed that it stood for &quot;Matsushita-Sony&quot;. Nishi said that the team&#x27;s original definition was &quot;Machines with Software eXchangeability&quot;, although in 1985 he said it was named after the MX missile. According to his book in 2020, he considered the name of the new standard should consist of three letters, like &quot;VHS&quot;. He felt &quot;MSX&quot; was fit because it means &quot;the next of Microsoft&quot;, and it also contains the first letters of Matsushita (Panasonic) and Sony.

Before the success of Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer, the MSX was the platform that major Japanese game studios such as Konami and Hudson Soft developed for. The first two games in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series were originally released for MSX hardware.

==History==

In the early 1980s, most home computers manufactured in Japan such as the NEC PC-6001 and PC-8000 series, Fujitsu&#x27;s FM-7 and FM-8, and Hitachi&#x27;s Basic Master featured a variant of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter integrated into their on-board ROMs. The hardware design of these computers and the various dialects of their BASICs were incompatible. Other Japanese consumer electronics firms such as Panasonic, Canon, Casio, Yamaha, Pioneer, and Sanyo were searching for ways to enter the new home computer market.

Major Japanese electronics companies entered the computer market in the 1960s, and Panasonic (Matsushita Electric Industrial) was also developing mainframe computers. The Japanese economy was facing a recession after the 1964 Summer Olympics and Panasonic decided to exit the computer business and focus on home appliances. The decision was a huge success, and Panasonic grew to become one of the largest electronics companies. In the late 1970s, the company investigated other business areas outside of home appliances. Panasonic also saw potential in the recent microcomputer revolution. One of Panasonic&#x27;s distributors, Yamagata National, told Panasonic&#x27;s president, Toshihiko Yamashita: Yamashita ordered the vice president, Shunkichi Kisaka, to develop a personal computer, and Kisaka called on Kazuyasu Maeda of Matsushita R&amp;D Center.

Maeda requested Nishi to assist with the development. They were already close to each other. When they met at a seminar held by NEC, they noticed both were from Kobe and had graduated from the same university. They often talked to each other about home computers. At the same time, Spectravideo contacted Microsoft in order to obtain software for their new home computer. Nishi went to Hong Kong to meet with Spectravideo, and suggested some improvements to its prototype. Spectravideo&#x27;s president, Harry Fox, was willing to accept Nishi&#x27;s proposals. Nishi conceived to create a unified standard based on its machine, and Maeda agreed with his idea. Nishi wanted to involve Panasonic and Sony in the development of home computers. While they were competing for videotape formats, Nobuyuki Idei of Sony accepted his proposal. Idei thought Sony should cooperate with Panasonic on its development because the SMC-70, Sony&#x27;s first personal computer, faced difficulty in the market when Sony started their computer business. Maeda also wanted to invite NEC, but NEC chose to go its own way.

Nishi proposed MSX as an attempt to create a single industry-standard for home computers. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders, many Japanese electronics manufacturers (Including GoldStar, Philips and Spectravideo) built and promoted MSX computers. Any piece of hardware or software with the MSX logo on it was compatible with MSX products from other manufacturers. In particular, the expansion cartridge format was part of the standard; any MSX expansion or game cartridge would work in any MSX computer.

Nishi&#x27;s standard was built around the Spectravideo SV-328 computer. The standard consisted primarily of several off-the-shelf parts; the main CPU was a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80, the Texas Instruments TMS9918 graphics chip with 16 KB of dedicated VRAM, sound and partial I/O support was provided by the AY-3-8910 chip manufactured by General Instrument (GI), and an Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) chip was used for parallel I/O such as the keyboard. The choice of these components was shared by many other home computers and games consoles of the period, such as the ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000 video game systems. To reduce overall system cost, many MSX models used a custom IC known as &quot;MSX-Engine&quot;, which integrated glue logic, 8255 PPI, YM2149 compatible sound chip and more, sometimes even the Z80 CPU. However, almost all MSX systems used a professional keyboard instead of a chiclet keyboard, driving up the price compared to the original SV-328. Consequently, these components alongside Microsoft&#x27;s MSX BASIC made the MSX a competitive, though somewhat expensive, home computer package.

===Debut===

On June 27, 1983, the MSX was formally announced during a press conference, and a slew of big Japanese firms declared their plans to introduce the machines. The Japanese companies avoided the intensely competitive U.S. home computer market, which was in the throes of a Commodore-led price war. Only Spectravideo and Yamaha briefly marketed MSX machines in the U.S. Spectravideo&#x27;s MSX enjoyed very little success, and Yamaha&#x27;s CX5M model, built to interface with various types of MIDI equipment, was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer.

===Evolution===
MSX spawned four generations. The first three, MSX (1983), MSX2 (1985), and MSX2+ (1988), were all 8-bit computers based on the Z80 microprocessor. The MSX2+ was exclusively released in Japan.

A new MSX3 was originally scheduled to be released in 1990, but delays in the development of its Yamaha-designed VDP caused it to miss its time to market deadline. In its place, the MSX TurboR was released, which used the new custom 16-bit R800 microprocessor developed by ASCII Corporation intended for the MSX3, but features such as DMA and 24-bit addressing were disabled. Like the MSX2+, the MSX TurboR was exclusively released in Japan. By the time the MSX TurboR standard was announced in 1990, only Panasonic was manufacturing MSX computers. Its initial model FS-A1ST met with moderate success, but the upgraded model FS-A1GT introduced in 1991 sold poorly due to its high retail cost of 99800 yen (about 740 USD at the time). Production of the TurboR ended in 1993 when Panasonic decided to focus on the release of 3DO. The VDP was eventually delivered in 1992, two years after its planned deadline, by which time the market had moved on. In an attempt to reduce its financial loss, Yamaha stripped nearly all V9958 compatibility and marketed the resulting V9990 E-VDP III as a video-chipset for PC VGA graphic cards, with moderate success.

===Impact===

In Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil, the MSX was the preeminent home computer system of the 1980s. It was also fairly popular in continental Europe, especially in the Netherlands and Spain. Classrooms full of networked Yamaha MSX computers were used for teaching informatics in schools in some Arab countries, the Soviet Union, and Cuba, where they were widely used in schools. In total, 9 million MSX computers were sold in Japan, making it relatively popular. However, the MSX did not become the worldwide standard envisioned because of limited adoption in other markets. Before the MSX&#x27;s lack of success in these markets became apparent, US manufacturer Commodore Business Machines overhauled its product line in the early 1980s and introduced models such as the Plus/4 and Commodore 16, that were intended to better compete with the features of MSX computers.

In comparison with rival 8-bit computers, the Commodore 64 is estimated to have sold 12.5–17 million units worldwide, the Apple II sold 6 million units, the ZX Spectrum over 5 million units, the Atari 8-bit computers sold at least 4 million units, the Amstrad CPC sold 3 million units, and the Tandy TRS-80 Model 1 sold 250,000 units.

A Sony MSX2 machine was launched into space to the Russian Mir space station.

==Similar systems==
The system MSX most closely resembled was the Spectravideo SV-328 home computer (Spectravideo even claimed to be &quot;MSX compatible&quot; in advertisements before the actual launch of MSX systems, but it was not completely compatible with it). This led to a new and short-lived kind of software cracking: &quot;converting&quot;. Since the MSX games were unplayable on the SV-328 computer, SV-328 crackers developed a method of modifying the (MSX) games to make them work on the SV-328. In most cases, this included downloading the MSX BIOS to the SV-328 from tape or floppy disk. Spectravideo later launched the SVI-728 which completely adhered to the MSX standard.

The Sega SG-1000, the Memotech MTX, the Tatung Einstein, and the ColecoVision all have many similarities with the MSX1 standard, but none are fully compatible with it. Porting games between those systems is somewhat easy. It was also very common to port games from the ZX Spectrum to the MSX, since both have the same CPU, the Spectrum 128 had the same soundchip, and the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s graphic mode could be easily emulated on the MSX&#x27;s screen-2 mode.

Many Roland S-series audio/music digital sampler/synthesizer keyboards and rack module units are based on the MSX operating system. This includes the earlier 12-bit sample resolution models S-50, S-330, S-550, W-30, and later 16-bit sample resolution models S-770, S-750, SP-700, and S-760. Most of these models included (or could be expanded with) color video outputs to display monitors, as well as MSX-compatible mouse ports.

==Localization==
By default, MSX machines have a hardcoded character set and keyboard scan code handling algorithm. While MSX has full application software compatibility at the firmware (BIOS) level, due to minor hardware differences, replacement of the BIOS with another from a different computer may return incorrect scan code translations and result in incorrect behaviour of the keyboard subsystem for the application software.

In 2011, AGE Labs introduced Language Pack firmware, aiming to make each model support several localizations. In AGE Labs&#x27; GR8BIT kit, the Language Pack is installed by default in place of the Kanji-ROM. It allows changing the character set and keyboard layout of the machine at startup between Japanese, Russian, International and Portuguese locales. It also gives the ability to change locales during machine operation using the newly introduced codice_1 command in BASIC. The selected locale setting is stored into the unused RTC NVRAM memory space.

==Games==
Several popular video game franchises were established on the MSX:
* &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Penguin Adventure&quot;
* &quot;Aleste&quot; and &quot;Zanac&quot; (the latter developed and released alongside the original FDS version)
* &quot;Bomberman&quot;
* &quot;Eggerland&quot;
* &quot;Metal Gear&quot;
* &quot;Parodius&quot;
* &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; (released alongside the FDS version)

Others received various installments on the MSX, including several titles unique to the system or largely reworked versions of games on other formats:
* &quot;Castlevania&quot; (as &quot;Vampire Killer&quot;)
* &quot;Contra&quot;
* &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;
* &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;
* &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;
* &quot;Gradius&quot; (&quot;Nemesis&quot;)
* &quot;R-Type&quot;
* &quot;Wizardry&quot;

==Legacy==

===2001===

In 2001, Kazuhiko Nishi initiated a MSX revival around an official MSX emulator called MSXPLAYer. This is the only official MSX emulator as all MSX copyrights are maintained by the MSX Association. In 2004, a Dutch company Bazix announced they had become the representatives of MSX Association in Europe, being the English contact for any questions regarding the MSX trademarks, copyrights, and licensing. On October 17, 2006, Bazix launched WOOMB.Net, a website selling MSX games in English and other languages, with a selection of 14 games. In Japan, game sales began earlier, through Project EGG. &quot;WOOMB.Net&quot; was the English counterpart of this and other Japanese services offered by D4 Enterprise, which also announced in August 2006 the launch of a new MSX2 compatible system called the &quot;one chip-MSX&quot;, a system based on an Altera Cyclone EP1C12Q240C8 FPGA. The one chip-MSX&quot; is similar in concept to the C-One, a Commodore 64 clone also built on the basis of a single FPGA chip. The new MSX system is housed in a box made out of transparent blue plastic, and can be used with a standard monitor (or TV) and a PC keyboard. It has two MSX cartridge slots and supports the audio extensions MSX-MUSIC and SCC+. A SD/MMC-flashcard can be used as an external storage medium, emulating a disk drive and can be used to boot MSX-DOS. Due to its VHDL programmable hardware, it is possible to give the device new hardware extensions simply by running a reconfiguration program under MSX-DOS. The &quot;one chip-MSX&quot; also has two USB connectors that can be used after adding some supporting VHDL code.

===2011===

In 2011, AGE Labs announced GR8BIT, a do-it-yourself kit for building an MSX computer. The kit, licensed by the MSX Licensing Corporation, is targeted to those wanting to learn about computer hardware. It includes all the necessary components to assemble a working MSX2-compatible computer except for an ATX chassis, power supply, floppy drive, hard disk, PS/2 keyboard, and monitor.

===2014===
Some of the Korean forum members who made Zemmix Neo created a new MSX-compatible called Mini IQ3000 Cutie, which has similar features to Daewoo Electronics&#x27; Korean-made MSX2 model, the IQ-2000. It is based on 1ChipMSX but has some special features like &#x27;Scan Line Generator&#x27;, which improves the quality of the video display, and &#x27;Multi Language Support&#x27; that allows it to support two languages. By default, the machine operates using the Korean version of MSX displaying the Korean font, but if the &#x27;del&#x27; key is pressed during booting it will operate in Japanese mode. Even though the default mode is Korean, the default font allocation table is Japanese, and will show Japanese characters when executing Japanese version software programs.

===2019===

In 2019, a group of fans developed the MSX Mini Replica. It is a 1:2 scale reproduction of the Philips VG-8020 computer compatible with the software of the MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and TurboR generations. It incorporates 2 USB ports, an HDMI video output and internally uses the same hardware as the C64 Mini. Connecting an additional peripheral called MSX Player allows it to run original games on ROM cartridges.

===2020===
The MSXVR is a computer released in 2020 and compatible with the MSX family of computers. Like the latest Zemmix game consoles, it is also based on a Raspberry Pi card with additional circuitry to connect the original MSX peripherals.

===2023===
In 2022, Nishi announced an official revival of the MSX computer standard dubbed the MSX3, to be implemented in multiple configurations, including an upgrade cartridge to existing MSX computers. Later, in 2023 following a successful crowdfunding campaign, an IoT device resembling a Game Boy with a keyboard, the MSX0, was revealed, intended for IoT uses, alongside the base MSX3 unit. Plans also call for a supercomputer, the MSX Turbo X 128, based around the concept of clusters.

==System specifications==
==Peripherals==

===Keyboard===
The keyboard is a functionally separate unit which could be connected by non-multiplexed and multiplexed interfaces. Multiplexed keyboard units feature additional data direction line, allowing sending scan line number to the keyboard using same data lines used for return scan code, decreasing overall number of wires between keyboard and machine. Non-multiplexed interface is usually used for internal keyboards (and some external keyboards, like Panasonic CF-3300); multiplexed interface is used for external keyboards (e.g. in Yamaha YIS805 model).

The keyboard is organized as a matrix with maximum 11 input lines and 8 output lines, accounting for maximum 88 keys (including all control, numerical and alphanumerical keys). Each scan line is regularly queried to identify the state of the keys on the line; query speed is identified by the system interrupt frequency. Such organization allows system to sense state of each key, not exhibiting notorious problem with 8042 microcontroller-based keyboards when pressing several keys simultaneously (usually more than 3) generates wrong input characters, or renders inability to sense the press of more keys.

Due to the keyboard scan being controlled by the system interrupts, one of the troubleshooting hints when an MSX machine does not display any image (assuming power is present) is to press the CAPS key to see if the respective LED toggles. If it does not toggle, the system is likely suffering a more serious problem than just lack of image on the screen (i.e. the problem with video cable or video display interface in overall).

In 2009, Kamil Karimov designed the adapter board to connect a PS/2 keyboard to the multiplexed MSX keyboard interface. The firmware embedded into its ATTiny chip was tailored for Daewoo CPC machines.

In 2011, AGE Labs embedded a PS/2 keyboard controller unit, based on Microchip microcontroller, into its GR8BIT do-it-yourself machine. Its firmware is developed to directly convert PS/2 scan codes to the MSX keyboard scan codes. Thus it is fully transparent to the applications, allowing use of the controller unit with different MSX-compatible machines and for different localization setups.

===Cartridges===
MSX standard requires at least 1 cartridge slot, most MSX models have 2. These slots are interchangeable, so in most cases it makes no difference in which slot a cartridge is inserted. The physical connector is a 50 pin (2 × 25 contacts), standard 2.54 mm (0.1 inch) pitch edge connector. Using these cartridge slots, a wide variety of peripherals could be connected.

Regular game cartridges are about the size of an audio cassette (so-called &quot;Konami size&quot;). Despite their higher cost, this was a popular format due to its reliability and ease of use.

Around 1985, Hudson Soft released the credit card-sized Bee Card, which was meant as a cheaper and more convenient alternative to ROM cartridges. But it was a commercial failure, and very few titles were released on the format.

Source files for development of the MSX cartridges are available from AGE Labs for EAGLE.

===Floppy disk drives===
Early MSX models did not have a built-in disk drive, so software were initially published on cartridge and cassette tape.

Mitsumi QuickDisks were originally launched as a proprietary extension for the MSX in early 1984, but they never really caught on, as they were quickly surpassed by the standard floppy disk interface released a few months later. Only a handful of titles were released in this format.

Sony also created a battery backed RAM cartridge the HBI-55 &quot;data cartridge&quot; in 1984 for some computers in their &quot;Hit-Bit&quot; line of MSX systems, that could be used to store programs or data as an alternative to cassette tapes. Many Yamaha Music software are also compatible with this cartridge.

Traditional floppy disk drives were made available for MSX in 1984, either built-in or in the form of a cartridge containing the disk interface electronics and a BIOS extension ROM (the floppy disk drive interface), connected to an external case with the drive. In South America, many of these systems used a floppy disk drive, but in Europe, drives were more popular. In Japan, some MSX1 systems included a built-in 3.5-inch disk drive, like the Panasonic (previously named National) CF-3300. In Europe, a range of Philips MSX2 systems NMS 8230, 8235, 8245, 8250 and above featured either 360 or 720 KB 3.5-inch floppy drives.

In 1985, the MSX2 was released, and these systems often (but not always) also included a built-in 3.5-inch disk drive. Consequently, the popular media for games and other software shifted to floppy disks.

The MSX-DOS disk operating system had binary compatibility with CP/M, but used the same FAT file system as MS-DOS. Its user commands were also similar to early MS-DOS versions. In this way, Microsoft could promote MSX for home use while promoting MS-DOS based personal computers in office environments.

The MSX 3.5-inch floppy disks are directly compatible with MS-DOS (although some details like file undeletion and boot sector code were different). Like MS-DOS 1, MSX disks (formatted) under MSX-DOS 1 have no support for subdirectories.

In September 2012, AGE Labs extended the standard by including support for 1.44Mb 3.5-inch format. The 1.44Mb diskette size goes in two configurations: Standard (1 sector per cluster, 9 FAT sectors), and Compatible (4 sectors per cluster, 3 FAT sectors).

==Emulation==
MSX computers are emulated on many platforms today. Early MSX emulators were often based on the code of the pioneer fMSX, a portable MSX emulator by Marat Fayzullin. Many emulators removed Fayzullin&#x27;s Z80 emulation code entirely in later versions to avoid legal problems, as at the time fMSX was not free software. Somewhat later fMSX source code became free for non-profit use; however a license was still required for commercial use. On December 31, 2013, the Windows version of fMSX 3.7 was released, free for anyone to use.

The official MSX emulator MSXPLAYer is produced by the MSX Association, of which the inventor of the MSX standard, Kazuhiko Nishi, is the president.

As of version 0.146.u, MESS currently supports 90% of all MSX versions.

===Virtual Console===
In February 2007, Nintendo of Japan announced that MSX games will be available for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console emulator. It was confirmed that the games would cost 700 Wii Points and will become available from the middle of 2007. It also became available for the Wii U on December 25, 2013. Ultimately 13 games, mainly Konami titles, for the Wii, plus one for the Wii U, were released for the service in Japan only.

<text>The Five Red Herrings (also The 5 Red Herrings) is a 1931 novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, her sixth featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. In the United States it was published in the same year under the title &quot;Suspicious Characters&quot;.

==Plot==

The novel is set in Galloway, a part of Scotland popular with artists and recreational fishermen. Sandy Campbell is a talented painter, but also a notoriously quarrelsome drunkard. When he is found dead in a stream, with a still-wet half-finished painting on the bank above, it is assumed that he fell in accidentally, fracturing his skull. Lord Peter Wimsey, who is in the region on a fishing holiday, suspects murder when he realises that something is missing from the scene which makes it likely that another artist painted the picture. Sayers includes a parenthetical note at this point: &quot;Here Lord Peter Wimsey told the Sergeant what he was looking for and why, but as the intelligent reader will readily supply these details for himself, they are omitted from this page.&quot; A local doctor believes that the degree of rigor mortis suggests that Campbell died during the previous night.

Whoever killed Campbell also executed the painting in Campbell&#x27;s distinctive style, to contrive the appearance of an accident. Six talented artists in the area have had recent public brawls with Campbell: Farren, Strachan, Gowan, Graham, Waters, and Ferguson. One of the six is the criminal, and five are red herrings.

All the suspects behave suspiciously: some leave the district without explanation, others give obviously inaccurate statements or conceal facts. Wimsey investigates, with some assistance from his friend in London, Charles Parker. The task of identifying the culprit is made more difficult because of the complexities of the local train timetables, the easy availability of bicycles, and the resultant opportunities for the murderer to evade notice.

All six suspects are eventually traced and give statements in which they deny killing Campbell, but none are entirely satisfactory. The Procurator Fiscal, the Chief Constable and the investigating police officers meet with Wimsey to review the evidence. The police put forward several theories, implicating all of the suspects either as killer or as accessory. Asked for his opinion, Wimsey finally reveals that the true killer was in fact Ferguson, the only one of the artists who while painting often kept spare tubes of paint in his pocket. Ferguson had absentmindedly pocketed a tube of white while creating the faked painting; it was the absence of that tube that Wimsey had noted at the start. The police are sceptical, but Wimsey offers a reconstruction, and over the course of twenty-four hours demonstrates how the killer contrived the scene above the stream and also established a false alibi.

Ferguson confesses, but states that Campbell&#x27;s death happened accidentally during a fight, and was not murder. When the case is tried, the jury brings in a verdict of manslaughter, with a strong recommendation to mercy on the ground that &quot;Campbell was undoubtedly looking for trouble&quot;.

==Principal characters==
* Lord Peter Wimsey
* Mervyn Bunter: Wimsey&#x27;s manservant
* Sandy Campbell (deceased): artist
* Hugh Farren: artist and suspect; Gilda Farren: his wife
* Henry Strachan: golf club secretary, artist and suspect
* Matthew Gowan: wealthy artist and suspect
* Jock Graham: artist and suspect
* Michael Waters: English artist and suspect
* John Ferguson: Campbell&#x27;s next-door neighbour, artist and suspect
* Sir Maxwell Jamieson: Chief Constable
* Inspector Macpherson: Kirkcudbright Police
* Sergeant Dalziel: Newton Stewart Police

==Foreword==
The novel includes a foreword in the form of a personal letter from the author &quot;To my friend Joe Dignam, kindliest of landlords&quot;. The letter starts: &quot;Here at last is your book about Gatehouse and Kirkcudbright. All the places are real places and all the trains are real trains, and all the landscapes are correct, except that I have run up a few new houses here and there.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
The first edition was reviewed in &quot;The Spectator&quot; of 1931 by M. I. Cole, who found the rather indistinguishable artist suspects, and the elaborate examination of timetables, ticket punches and so on, to be really taxing to the intelligence. He noted that Lord Peter Wimsey and the author&#x27;s usual pleasant fantasies have retired into the background leaving a &quot;pure-puzzle&quot; book which is disappointing, dry, and dull. He acknowledged, however, that it has been appreciated immensely by puzzle fanatics who possess &quot;the type of mind that goes on solving crossword puzzles for ever and ever&quot;.

In &quot;A Catalogue of Crime&quot; (revised edn 1989), Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor called &quot;The Five Red Herrings&quot; &quot;A work that grows on rereading and remains in the mind as one of the richest, most colorful of her group studies. The Scottish setting, the artists in the colony, the train-ticket puzzle, and the final chase place this triumph among the four or five &quot;chefs d&#x27;oeuvre&quot; from her hand.&quot;

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Five Red Herrings&quot; was adapted for television in 1975 as part of a series starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter and Glyn Houston as Bunter. It has also been dramatised for BBC Radio with Carmichael as Lord Peter and Peter Jones as Bunter.

<text>Have His Carcase is a 1932 locked-room mystery by Dorothy L. Sayers, her seventh novel featuring Lord Peter Wimsey and the second in which Harriet Vane appears. It is also included in the 1987 BBC TV series. The book marks a stage in the long drawn out courting of Harriet Vane by Wimsey. Though working closely with him on solving the book&#x27;s mystery, she still refuses to marry him.

==Plot==
During a hiking holiday on the South West coast of England, the detective novelist Harriet Vane discovers the body of a man lying on an isolated rock on the shore, not far from the resort of Wilvercombe; his throat has been cut. Harriet takes photographs and collects the razor used in the death, and other personal items. The man&#x27;s blood is still liquid, from which it is concluded that he had died shortly before she arrived. There are no footprints in the sand other than hers and those of the victim. Unfortunately, the corpse is washed away by the rising tide before she can summon help.

Alerted to the discovery by a friend, Lord Peter Wimsey arrives, and he and Harriet start their investigations. The victim is identified as Paul Alexis, a young man of Russian extraction, employed by a Wilvercombe hotel as a professional dancing partner. The police tend to the view that Alexis&#x27; death was suicide and that he had cut his own throat.

Alexis had been engaged to a rich widow in her fifties, Mrs Weldon. Her son, Henry Weldon, ten years older than his mother&#x27;s lover and by all appearances a simple and brutish man, is appalled at the prospect of his mother&#x27;s remarriage to a gigolo, and at his potential loss of inheritance. He travels to Wilvercombe to monitor the investigation while ostensibly comforting his mother after her loss. Weldon appears to be a likely murder suspect, but he has an unshakeable alibi for the time of Alexis&#x27; death – as do a large number of other possible suspects.

Staged to look like suicide, Alexis&#x27; death is gradually revealed to be the result of an ingenious murder plot that played upon Alexis&#x27; fantasies. Wimsey and Harriet discover that in the period leading up to his death Alexis, an avid reader of Ruritanian romances, had believed himself to be a descendant of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. A series of cipher letters received from an unknown source convinced him that he was being called to return to Russia to take his place as the new rightful Tsar.

He had been lured to the rock by his anonymous correspondent who urged him to be ready to meet a &quot;Rider from the Sea&quot;, a rider who it was said would be carrying instructions for his onward journey to Warsaw. Once at the rock, Alexis met his death at the hand of the murderer who had ridden his horse along the beach through the incoming tide to avoid leaving tracks.

Wimsey and Harriet ultimately realise that Weldon is not the simple character he has been presenting, but a criminal who has been living under two different identities. Weldon was himself the rider, and had been provided with his alibi by two co-conspirators, a friend and his wife. Although his alibi was secure for the believed time of death, the investigators discover that Alexis had died far earlier than had been thought; he had suffered from the blood-clotting disorder haemophilia (a disorder known to have affected the Russian royal family), resulting in his blood remaining liquid for much longer than would normally be expected.

Weldon and his co-conspirators are undone by their unsuccessful attempts to reshuffle their alibis to match the new information about the time of death — and by proof of their actual friendship. 

Even as Wimsey and Harriet solve the case, Mrs Weldon has already moved on to another gigolo at the hotel, a sympathetic French dancer named Antoine.

==Title==
The novel&#x27;s title appears in William Cowper&#x27;s translation of Book II of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;: &quot;The vulture&#x27;s maw / Shall have his carcase, and the dogs his bones&quot;. The phrase also appears a number of times in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; by Charles Dickens, as Sam Weller&#x27;s distortion of the legal term &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

==Characters==
*Lord Peter Wimsey: protagonist, aristocratic amateur detective
*Miss Harriet Vane: protagonist, detective novelist with whom Wimsey is in love

==Chapter heads==
All the chapter heads feature quotations from the works of the dramatist and poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes.

==Criticism==
In their overview &quot;A Catalogue of Crime&quot; (1971/89) Barzun &amp; Taylor noted that the book was &quot;A great achievement, despite some critics&#x27; carping. The people, the motive, the cipher, and the detection are all topnotch. Here, too, is the first (and definitive) use of hemophilia as a misleading fact. And surely the son, the mother, and her self-deluded gigolo are definitive types&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for radio in 1981 for BBC Radio 4 by Alistair Beaton, starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter and Maria Aitken as Harriet Vane.

It was adapted for television in 1987, as part of a series starring Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter and Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane. Mervyn Bunter is played by Richard Morant, the brother of Angela Morant who portrays the character Mrs Morecambe. The police officer in charge, Inspector Trethowan in this adaptation, is played by Ray Armstrong.

<doc id="156213" wikidata="Q1815880" url="?curid=156213" title="The Nine Tailors">
<text>The Nine Tailors is a 1934 mystery novel by the British writer Dorothy L. Sayers, her ninth featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. The story is set in the Lincolnshire Fens, and revolves around a group of bell-ringers at the local parish church. The book has been described as Sayers&#x27; finest literary achievement, although not all critics were convinced by the mode of death, nor by the amount of technical campanology detail included.

== Plot ==
Twenty years before the events of the novel, the family of Sir Henry Thorpe, squire of the Fenland village of Fenchurch St Paul, had suffered the theft of a guest&#x27;s valuable emerald necklace, still unrecovered. The family&#x27;s then-butler, Geoffrey Deacon, and his accomplice, Nobby Cranton, had been convicted and imprisoned. In 1918, Deacon escaped from prison and disappeared, leaving his wife, Mary, none the wiser. After a man&#x27;s body in prison clothes was found two years later in a nearby dene-hole, Mary was declared a widow, and became free to marry one of the village bell-ringers, William Thoday.

The novel opens with Lord Peter Wimsey running his car into a ditch near Fenchurch on a snowy New Year&#x27;s Eve. Stranded for a few days while repairs are carried out, Wimsey helps ring an all-night peal on the church bells after William Thoday is struck down with influenza. Lady Thorpe, Sir Henry&#x27;s wife, dies the next day.

When Sir Henry dies the following Easter, a man&#x27;s mutilated body is found in his wife&#x27;s grave, believed to be that of a labourer calling himself &#x27;Stephen Driver&#x27;. Oddly, the dead man was wearing French-made underclothes. The rector writes to Wimsey asking him to return to investigate.

At the Post Office, Bunter, Wimsey&#x27;s manservant, finds an uncollected letter posted from France. The writer is the French wife of a British soldier, Arthur Cobbleigh, who had deserted in 1918. Cobbleigh evidently knew where the emeralds were hidden and plotted to recover them with &#x27;Driver&#x27; – who is revealed to be not the mutilated man, but Cranton.
A document found in the bell chamber is a cipher, written on the same paper as the letter from France. Wimsey&#x27;s knowledge of change ringing enables him to decipher it, leading him to the emeralds, still in their hiding place in the church. He shows the document to Mary Thoday, and she and William promptly abscond to London. Wimsey deduces that Mary recognised the handwriting as that of Deacon, her first husband, who apparently was still alive at the time of the cipher&#x27;s composition. Realising their marriage was unintentionally bigamous, the Thodays have gone to get remarried.

Wimsey further deduces that the mutilated man was Deacon. After his escape, Deacon had killed Cobbleigh and swapped clothes and identities with him, leaving him in the dene-hole. After marrying bigamously in France, Deacon had waited several years to return for the emeralds that he had hidden before his arrest. He had asked Cranton for help, sending him the cipher as a token of good faith. Cranton had broken into the church, discovered Deacon&#x27;s body in the bell chamber, and fled in horror.

William Thoday and his brother Jim, a merchant seaman, are interviewed. William confesses that on 30 December he had encountered Deacon, whom he had long believed to be dead, prowling around the church. Desperate to protect his wife and children from the scandal of an illegitimate marriage, he had tied Deacon up and locked him in the bell chamber, planning to bribe him to leave the country the next day. Unfortunately, his bout of influenza prevented him from returning, and Jim discovered Deacon&#x27;s dead body still tied up two days later. Still loyal to his brother, Jim had made the body unrecognisable, hidden it in Lady Thorpe&#x27;s grave, and returned to his ship. When the body was rediscovered at Easter, each of the brothers thought that the other had killed Deacon.

When Wimsey returns to Fenchurch the following Christmas, floods are threatening the countryside, and Wimsey climbs the tower as the bells are sounding the alarm. The appalling noise in the bell chamber convinces him that Deacon, tied there for hours during the all-night New Year peal, could not have survived: Deacon had been killed by the bells themselves. Wimsey explains, &quot;We needn&#x27;t look for a murderer now. Because the murderers of Geoffrey Deacon are hanging already, and a good deal higher than Haman&quot;. William Thoday is drowned in the flood trying to save another man. Wimsey speculates that &quot;I think perhaps he guessed at last how Geoffrey Deacon died and felt himself responsible&quot;.

==Title==
The &quot;Nine Tailors&quot; of the book&#x27;s title are taken from the old saying &quot;Nine Tailors Make a Man&quot;, which Sayers quotes at the end of the novel. As explained by John Shand in his 1936 &quot;Spectator&quot; article &quot;The Bellringers&#x27; Art&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Nine Tailors&#x27; means the nine strokes which at the beginning of the toll for the dead announce to the villagers that a man is dead. A woman&#x27;s death is announced with &#x27;Six Tailors&#x27;. Hence the old saying ... which might otherwise be construed as a slander on a worthy profession&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==
In 1996 the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association awarded the story a &quot;Rusty Dagger award for the best crime novel of the 1930s&quot;, an award devised and organised for the Association by the noir writer, Russell James.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the book&#x27;s first publication, Isaac Anderson said, &quot;It may be that you, like this reviewer, do not know the difference between a kent treble bob major and a grandsire triple, but even so, you will probably enjoy what Dorothy Sayers has to say about them and about other things concerned with the ancient art of change-ringing, since her dissertation is all woven into a most fascinating mystery tale... This is, most emphatically, Dorothy Sayers at her very best.&quot;

John Shand, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, said &quot;Those who would appreciate an artist&#x27;s picture of a group of village bellringers – of the kind who can pull a rope with any Londoner – may find one in [this novel], [which] contains the best description known to me of the bells, the ringers and the art. It is probably, indeed, the only novel based on a study of campanology. Its very title and chapter-headings pay tribute to the peculiar vocabulary of the art.&quot; Shand considered the means of death to be &quot;Novelist&#x27;s licence, I am afraid. But a trifle like that cannot spoil a good story.&quot;

In his 1941 book &quot;Murder for Pleasure: The Life and Times of the Detective Story&quot;, Howard Haycraft noted that Sayers has been called by some critics the greatest of living mystery writers. He went on, &quot;Whether or not the reader agrees with this verdict, he can not, unless he is both obtuse and ungrateful, dispute her preëminence as one of the most brilliant and prescient artists the genre has yet produced... [This book is] in the writer&#x27;s estimation her finest achievement and one of the truly great detective stories of all time.&quot;

Taking the opposite view, the American critic Edmund Wilson, in his excoriating 1945 essay attacking the entire genre of detective fiction, &quot;Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;, criticised &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; in particular for being dull, overlong and far too detailed. He considered the bell-ringing prose to be &quot;a lot of information of the kind that you might expect to find in an encyclopaedia article on campanology&quot;. In his view, Sayers does not, really, write very well: &quot;it is simply that she is more consciously literary than most of the other detective story-writers and that she thus attracts attention in a field which is mostly on a sub-literary level.&quot;

Sayers&#x27; obituarist, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1957, noted that many critics regarded &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; as her finest literary achievement.

In their review of crime novels (revised edn 1989), the American writers Barzun and Taylor called this novel &quot;For many reasons, no great favourite... despite Dorothy&#x27;s swotting up of bell-ringing and the two good maps. The cause of death, however, is original, and the rescue scene in the church amid the flood shows the hand of the master. It should be added that this work is a favourite with many readers. Sinclair Lewis judged it the best of his four &#x27;indispensables&#x27;. &quot;

Also writing in 1989, H. R. F. Keating said that the author &quot;incautiously entered the closed world of bell-ringing in &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; on the strength of a sixpenny pamphlet picked up by chance – and invented a method of killing which would not produce death, as well as breaking a fundamental rule of that esoteric art by allowing a relief ringer to take part in her famous nine-hour champion peal.&quot;

== Background ==
As a child and young teenager, Sayers lived on the southern edge of the Fens at Bluntisham-cum-Earith, where her father was rector. She also was inspired by her father&#x27;s restoration of the Bluntisham church bells in 1910.

Much of the technical detail of the novel was taken from Charles Troyte&#x27;s &quot;Change Ringing&quot;, quotations from which are placed at the start of many of the chapters. In a letter discussing the book, Sayers said &quot;I wrote [the novel] without ever having seen bells rung, by brooding over &quot;Troyte on Change-Ringing&quot; and trying to translate its technical descriptions into visual effects. That ... &#x27;came out&#x27; beyond expectation&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; has been adapted several times for BBC Radio: as a four-part serialisation by Giles Cooper for the BBC Light Programme in 1954, with Alan Wheatley as Lord Peter Wimsey; as an eight-part adaptation by Alistair Beaton for Radio 4 in 1980, with Ian Carmichael as Wimsey; and as a single two-hour &quot;Murder for Christmas&quot; programme by Michelene Wandor in 1987, with Gary Bond as Wimsey.

In 1974 the novel was adapted for BBC television by Anthony Steven as a series of four hour-long episodes, starring Ian Carmichael as Wimsey.

<text>Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon is a 1937 novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, her eleventh and last featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, and her fourth and last to feature Harriet Vane.

== Plot introduction ==
Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane marry and go to spend their honeymoon at Talboys, an old farmhouse in Hertfordshire which he has bought her as a present. The honeymoon is intended as a break from his usual routine of solving crimes, and hers of writing about them, but it turns into a murder investigation when the seller of the house is found dead at the bottom of the cellar steps with severe head injuries.

== Plot ==
After an engagement of some months following the events at the end of &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;, Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane marry. They plan to spend their honeymoon at Talboys, an old farmhouse in Harriet&#x27;s native Hertfordshire which Wimsey has bought for her, and they abscond from the wedding reception, evading the assembled reporters.

Arriving late at night, they are surprised to find the house locked up and not prepared for them. They gain access and spend their wedding night there, but next morning the former owner, Noakes, is found dead in the cellar with head injuries. The quiet honeymoon is ruined as a murder investigation begins and the house fills with policemen, reporters, and brokers&#x27; men distraining Noakes&#x27; hideous furniture.

Noakes was an unpopular man, a miser and (it turns out) a blackmailer. He was assumed to be well off, but it transpires that he was bankrupt, owed large amounts of money, and was planning to flee his creditors with the cash he had received for Talboys. The house had been locked and bolted when the newly-weds arrived, and medical evidence seems to rule out an accident, so it seems he was attacked in the house and died later, having somehow locked up after his attacker. The suspects include Noakes&#x27; niece Aggie; Mrs Ruddle, his neighbour and cleaning lady; Frank Crutchley, a local garage mechanic who also tended Noakes&#x27; garden; and the local police constable, who was his blackmail victim.

Peter&#x27;s and Harriet&#x27;s relationship is resolved during the process of catching the murderer and bringing him to justice. In a final scene, in which almost the entire cast of characters is gathered in the front room of Talboys, the killer turns out to be Crutchley. He had planned to marry Noakes&#x27; somewhat elderly niece and get his hands on the money he had left her in his will. He had set a booby trap with a weighted plant pot on a chain, which was triggered by the victim opening the radio cabinet after locking up for the night. Wimsey&#x27;s reaction to the case – his arrangement for the defendant to be represented by top defence counsel; his guilt at condemning a man to be hanged; the return of his shell-shock – dominates the final chapters of the book. It is mentioned that Wimsey had previously also suffered similar pangs of conscience when other murderers had been sent to the gallows. His deep remorse and guilt at having caused Crutchley to be executed leave doubt as to whether he would undertake further murder investigations.

== Later writings ==
Sayers completed no further Wimsey novels after &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;, though she did begin work on a story titled &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, which would be completed years after her death by Jill Paton Walsh.

The 1942 short story &quot;Talboys&quot;, the very last Wimsey fiction published by Sayers, is both a sequel to the present book, in having the same location and some of the same village characters, and an antithesis in being lighthearted and having no crime worse than the theft of some peaches from a neighbour&#x27;s garden.

==Title==
A &quot;&quot; is a holiday spent by a bus driver travelling on a bus: it is no break from the usual routine. By analogy, anyone who spends a holiday doing their normal job is taking a &quot;busman&#x27;s holiday&quot;.

==Literary significance and criticism==
In their review of Crime novels (revised edn 1989), the US writers Barzun and Taylor comment that the novel is &quot;Not near the top of her form, but remarkable as a treatment of the newly wedded and bedded pair of eccentrics ... with Bunter in the offing and three local characters, chiefly comic. Peter&#x27;s mother – Dowager Duchess of Denver – Peter&#x27;s sister, John Donne, a case of vintage port, and the handling of &quot;corroded sut&quot; provide plenty of garnishing for an indifferent murder, even if we weren&#x27;t also given an idea of Lord Peter&#x27;s sexual tastes and powers under trying circumstances.&quot;

Raymond Chandler, in his essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder,&quot; satirized a number of classic detective stories, and he chose this one among Sayers&#x27;s novels to mock for the complicated murder method: &quot;a murderer who needs that much help from Providence must be in the wrong business&quot; 

==Adaptations==
&quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; first saw the light of day as a stage play by Sayers and Muriel St. Clare Byrne. Subtitled &quot;A Detective Comedy in Three Acts&quot;, it opened at London&#x27;s Comedy Theatre, in December 1936, with Dennis Arundell as Peter and Veronica Turleigh as Harriet Vane. The play was a success, and ran for 413 performances.

A 1940 film version, based as much on the play as on the novel, stars Robert Montgomery as Peter and Constance Cummings as Harriet. The movie was released in the United States as &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;.

It was twice adapted for BBC television broadcast. The 1947 adaptation, 90 minutes in length, was directed by John Glyn-Jones and starred Harold Warrender as Lord Peter, Ruth Lodge as Harriet, and Ronald Adam as Bunter; Joan Hickson, later to be better known for playing Agatha Christie&#x27;s amateur sleuth Miss Marple, played Miss Twitterton. The 1957 adaptation, again 90 minutes in length, was directed by Brandon Acton-Bond, and starred Peter Gray as Lord Peter, Sarah Lawson as Harriet, and Charles Lloyd-Pack as Bunter.

There have been three BBC radio adaptations. The first, in 1949, was adapted for radio by Peggy Wells, and starred Hugh Latimer as Lord Peter, Rita Vale as Harriet, and Stanley Groome as Bunter. The second, again adapted for radio by Wells, was broadcast in 1965, and featured Angus MacKay as Lord Peter, Dorothy Reynolds as Harriet, and David Monico as Bunter. The third adaptation, broadcast in 1983 on BBC Radio 4, was in six parts. This starred Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey, Sarah Badel as Harriet, Peter Jones as Bunter, Rosemary Leach as Miss Twitterton, Pearl Hackney as Mrs Ruddle, Peter Vaughan as Superintendent Kirk and John Westbrook as the Narrator.

A stage production of &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; took place at the Lyric theatre, Hammersmith from 12 July - 27 August 1988 and starred Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter Wimsey and Emily Richard as Harriet (Lady Peter) Wimsey. The two actors are married to each other in real life. (Petherbridge starred as Lord Peter in A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery, a 1987 televised adaptation of all the Harriet Vane novels except &quot;Busman&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Honeymoon&quot; for which the BBC could not obtain the rights).

Lifeline Theatre (Chicago, Illinois) presented an original adaptation of &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; in the spring and summer of 2009. Frances Limoncelli adapted the script from Dorothy Sayers&#x27; novel. The show was directed by Paul Holmquist. &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; was preceded by adaptations of &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, &quot;Strong Poison&quot;, and &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; (all adapted by Frances Limoncelli and produced at Lifeline Theatre).

<doc id="156216" wikidata="Q7798366" url="?curid=156216" title="Thrones, Dominations">
<text>Thrones, Dominations is a Lord Peter Wimsey–Harriet Vane murder mystery novel that Dorothy L. Sayers began writing but abandoned, and which remained at her death as fragments and notes. It was completed by Jill Paton Walsh and published in 1998. The title is a quotation from John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and refers to two categories of angel in the Christian angelic hierarchy.

==Background==
Sayers had charted the developing relationship between Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane over four published novels, culminating in &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;, the action of which takes place immediately following the couple&#x27;s wedding. The characters appeared thereafter only in a few short stories and other published pieces, revealing only glimpses of their married life. According to Sayers&#x27; friend and biographer Barbara Reynolds, Sayers had begun work in 1936 on &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, a murder mystery novel in which the Wimsey marriage was to be contrasted with those of two other couples.

She apparently worked on it for some months during 1936, but does not appear to have done so thereafter; it has been suggested that this is due at least in part to the constitutional crisis of that year surrounding Edward VIII and his relationship with Wallis Simpson.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGregor/Lewis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of December 1936 onwards overtook the story, with the abdication altering how Sayers&#x27; potential audience would interpret a tale of contrasting marriages. In 1938, she declared in a letter that she had come to dislike the book, and had &quot;great difficulty doing anything about it&quot;.

Sayers&#x27; notes for the work were found among her papers after her death in 1957, and were acquired in 1976 by the Wade Center at Wheaton College, Illinois. They consisted of a number of complete scenes from the beginning of the story and a few diagrams, including a multi-coloured representation of the interactions of the characters. By 1985 there were plans to publish the manuscript as it stood, together with some of the other short Wimsey pieces, both published and unpublished, but these failed due to the death of Sayers&#x27; son and heir Anthony Fleming in that year. In 1996 the literary trustees of the estate approached novelist Jill Paton Walsh and asked her to look at the material with a view to completing the novel. She was also able to refer to a typescript which had been found in a safe at Sayers&#x27; former literary agents and which differed in some respects from the manuscript version.

The scenes were not ordered or numbered, and had to be arranged in logical order by Paton Walsh to constitute the first six chapters of the book. The remainder of the story had to be constructed from almost no data, based on what had already been written, but Paton Walsh has said that Sayers&#x27; notes make it clear who the murderer would be. The book was published in February 1998. Jill Paton Walsh followed it in 2002 with another Wimsey/Vane novel, &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot;, set during World War II and based on some short wartime writings of Sayers known as &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In 1936, Lord and Lady Peter Wimsey, returning from a European honeymoon, are settling into their new home in London, where daily life is affected by the illness and then death of the king. The couple are personally happy, having resolved many of the problems in their relationship caused by character and circumstance, but must now tackle the practical details of bringing their lives together, including domestic and working arrangements, and social and family obligations.

The couple become slightly acquainted with Laurence Harwell, a wealthy theatrical &quot;angel&quot;, and his beautiful wife, whom he has rescued from poverty following her rich father&#x27;s disgrace and imprisonment. After two years&#x27; marriage the Harwells are famously still devoted to one another, and when she is found dead at their weekend cottage in the country Wimsey is asked to help interview the distraught husband, and becomes involved with the investigation. (He is also asked to undertake sensitive diplomatic duties connected with the problematic behaviour of the new king, and as the 1936 abdication crisis looms, he gloomily predicts the coming war with Hitler&#x27;s Germany.)

Suspicion falls on a writer known to have been in love with Mrs Harwell, and a talented but bohemian painter who had been working on portraits of both Harriet and the murdered woman. Two men who knew Mrs Harwell&#x27;s father in prison, and who have been blackmailing him with threats to harm her, are also suspected.

Meanwhile, Harriet straightens out her domestic situation, learning how to fulfill her new role whilst keeping her own identity, and finds a practical solution to allow Wimsey&#x27;s devoted manservant Bunter to marry without having to leave the household. Harriet&#x27;s unorthodox approach infuriates her sister-in-law (who believes Harriet has an obligation to abandon her career, do her duty to the family and produce an heir) but it allows her to solve most of the practical difficulties that might have stood in the way of a successful and happy marriage. She also discovers she is expecting a baby.

After some plot twists, a second murder and a scene involving the hidden rivers and Victorian sewers that run under London, it is revealed that Harwell unintentionally killed his wife in a jealous rage, in the belief she was preparing to entertain a lover, although ironically her preparations had really been for him. Harwell might have gotten off with a manslaughter conviction, except that he later committed the premeditated murder of an actress who was in a position to disprove his alibi and tried to blackmail him. Harriet visits Harwell in prison to comfort him with the knowledge that his wife had not, after all, been unfaithful. In doing so, she finally banishes the lingering ghosts of her own imprisonment and murder trial, and the effect they have had on her relationship with her own husband.

==Characters==
*Lord Peter Wimsey – Aristocratic amateur detective in his mid-forties. The younger son of a duke, his wealth comes largely from property which he manages with intelligence and responsibility.
*Lady Peter Wimsey (née Harriet Vane) – Successful detective novelist in her early thirties, newly married to Lord Peter after a stormy courtship. Was saved from the gallows by her husband when accused of the murder of a former lover.
*Laurence Harwell – Independently wealthy investor in plays. Married for approximately two years, indulgent of his wife and deeply in love.
*Rosamund Harwell – Daughter of a wealthy man, reduced to humiliating poverty and employment as a mannequin after her father&#x27;s imprisonment for fraud. Rescued by her marriage to Harwell two years previously – deeply in love, but given to friendly relations with other men and bored because she has little to occupy her days. Strikingly beautiful.
*Mr Warren – Rosamund Harwell&#x27;s father, once wealthy but now dependent on his daughter and son-in-law after becoming involved in fraudulent transactions and ending up penniless and in prison. Damaged by his experiences, proud of his daughter and grateful to Harwell.
*Claude Amery – Talented writer and promising playwright. Passionately in love with Rosamund Harwell, and very jealous of her husband, who offered to stage his first play.
*Gaston Chaparelle – Society portrait painter. Talented artist but an amoral man in the habit of seducing his female sitters.
*Mervyn Bunter – Wimsey&#x27;s manservant for over 16 years. Devoted and loyal, but in love and wishing to marry.
*Hope Fanshaw – Portrait photographer with her own business. Object of Bunter&#x27;s affections.
*Gloria Tallant (née Phoebe Sugden) – Young actress of small talent but great ambition. Acquainted with Harwell, and her family home is close to the Harwells&#x27; country cottage.
*Duke and Duchess of Denver – Wimsey&#x27;s older brother Gerald and sister-in-law Helen. She has traditional views on class and rank and disapproves of the Wimsey marriage, particularly Harriet&#x27;s attitude to work and children. He is dutiful but unimaginative and in awe of his clever brother, but inclined to like Harriet. Both increasingly worried by their only son and heir Jerry (styled as Lord St. George), who is charming but spoiled and unreliable, and hope the Wimseys will produce children to ensure the succession of the family lands and estates beyond doubt.
*Honoria, Dowager Duchess of Denver – Wimsey&#x27;s witty mother who is very pleased with his choice of wife and becomes a friend of Harriet&#x27;s; some parts of the novel are presented in the form of humorous letters and diary entries of hers
*Chief Inspector Charles Parker – Police officer in charge of the Harwell murder case. Wimsey&#x27;s brother-in-law and close friend.

==Reception==
The book attracted considerable media interest, and met with mixed reviews from a variety of high-profile critics. Novelist Ruth Rendell, writing in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, declared it &quot;...impossible to tell where Dorothy L. Sayers ends and Jill Paton Walsh begins&quot;.

A. N. Wilson agreed that the joins in the material appeared &quot;seamless&quot; to the amateur reader, but found the plot in the main &quot;rather feeble&quot;; he noted Paton Walsh&#x27;s attempt to parody Sayers&#x27; style, &quot;...the really corking snobbery, the sub-Wodehousian banter, and the conceited swapping of obvious quotations&quot;, but judged it a failure.

Joyce Carol Oates in the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the book &quot;engrossing, intelligent and provocative&quot;, praised the power of its descriptive passages, and found its darker tone more in keeping with the later Wimsey novels than with the &quot;zest and flashy originality&quot; of the earlier ones.

Reviewer Barbara Fowler noted that &quot;The original Wimsey books were contemporary novels, reflecting social and political situations and outlooks at the time of writing. The present book, except for its beginning, is a historical novel – specifically, a historical detective book – carefully reconstructing a historical past time with a lot of hindsight. ... King Edward VIII is seen here from a clearly post-WWII perspective, with a reference made to his meeting Nazi agents and with Wimsey flatly stating that he is not fit to be King. It is extremely unlikely that Sayers, had she completed the book at the time itself, would have written anything of the kind, or that her publishers would have risked scandal by unleashing such a book upon the British public; at the time, it often happened that British papers delicately avoided altogether any mention of the mess in which their King was becoming involved&quot;.

<text>Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV (born April 6, 1965) is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. He is the frontman of the alternative rock band Pixies, with whom he performs under the stage name Black Francis. Following the band&#x27;s breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under the name Frank Black. After releasing two albums with record label 4AD and one with American Recordings, he left the label and formed a new band, Frank Black and the Catholics. He re-adopted the name Black Francis in 2007.

His vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of Pixies to a more measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, UFOs, and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud–quiet dynamics, and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording during his time with the Catholics, give him a distinct style within alternative rock.

Thompson regrouped Pixies in early 2004, but continued to release solo records and tour as a solo artist until 2013, when he declared his solo career to be over.

==Biography==

===Youth and college===
Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father was a bar owner. Thompson lived in Los Angeles, California, because his father wanted to &quot;learn more about the restaurant and bar business&quot;. Thompson was introduced to music at a young age, as his parents listened to 1960s folk rock. His first guitar was his mother&#x27;s, a Yamaha classical guitar bought with money from his father&#x27;s bar tips, which he started to play at age &quot;11 or 12&quot;.

Thompson&#x27;s family moved around, first with his father, and then his stepfather, a religious man who &quot;pursued real estate on both coasts&quot;; his parents had separated twice by the time he was in first grade. When Thompson was 12, his mother and stepfather joined an evangelical church that was tied to the Pentecostal denomination Assemblies of God, a move that influenced many of his songs written with the Pixies, which often refer to the Bible.

He discovered the music of Christian rock singer-songwriter Larry Norman at 13 when Norman played at a religious summer camp that Thompson attended. Norman&#x27;s music influenced Thompson to the extent that he titled the Pixies&#x27; first EP and a lyric in the band&#x27;s song &quot;Levitate Me&quot; after one of Norman&#x27;s catchphrases, &quot;Come on, pilgrim!&quot; Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:

Thompson lived in an apartment in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Just before his senior year, his family moved to Westport, Massachusetts, where he received a &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot; award—the title of a later solo album. During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; from &quot;Doolittle&quot;, and &quot;Velvety Instrumental Version&quot;.

After graduating from Westport High School in 1983, Thompson studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in anthropology. Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a semester before moving in with future Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago. The two shared an interest in rock music, and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie; they began to jam together. It was at this time that Thompson discovered The Cars, a band he described as &quot;very influential on me and the Pixies&quot;.

In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico, as part of an exchange program. He spent six months in an apartment with a &quot;weird, psycho roommate&quot; who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song &quot;Crackity Jones&quot;; many of the band&#x27;s early songs refer to Thompson&#x27;s experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view Halley&#x27;s Comet (he later said it &quot;seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time&quot;), or start a rock band. He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words &quot;we gotta do it, now is the time, Joe&quot;, to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.

===Pixies===

Soon after returning to Massachusetts, Thompson dropped out of college, and moved to Boston with Santiago. He spent 1985 working in a warehouse, &quot;managing buttons on teddy bears&quot;, composing songs on his acoustic guitar, and writing lyrics on the subway. In January 1986, Thompson formed Pixies with Santiago. Bassist Kim Deal was recruited a week later via a classified advertisement placed in a Boston paper, which requested a bassist &quot;into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary&quot;. Drummer David Lovering was later hired on recommendation from Deal&#x27;s husband.

In 1987 Pixies released an 18-track demo tape, commonly referred to as &quot;The Purple Tape&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s father assisted the band financially, lending $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father &quot;wasn&#x27;t around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his best to make up for lost time&quot;. &quot;The Purple Tape&quot; led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD. For the release of the mini album &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;, Thompson adopted the alias &quot;Black Francis&quot;, a name inspired by his father: &quot;he had been saving that name in case he had another son&quot;.

In 1988 Pixies recorded their debut album &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. Thompson wrote and sang on all the tracks, with the exception of the single &quot;Gigantic&quot;, which was co-written and sung by Deal. To support the album, the band undertook a European tour, during which Thompson met Eric Drew Feldman, a later collaborator on Pixies and solo albums. &quot;Doolittle&quot;, with Thompson-penned songs such as &quot;Debaser&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven&quot;, was released the following year to widespread critical acclaim. However, by this time, tensions between Thompson and Deal, combined with exhaustion, led the band to announce a hiatus. Thompson has an aversion to flying, and spent this time driving across America with his girlfriend, Jean Walsh (whom he had met in the band&#x27;s early days), performing solo shows in order to raise funds to buy furniture for his new Los Angeles apartment.
The band reconvened in 1990, and recorded two further albums: 1990&#x27;s &quot;Bossanova&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;; the latter was Thompson&#x27;s first collaboration with Feldman. The later Pixies albums were characterized by Feldman&#x27;s increasing influence on the band&#x27;s output, as well as a focus on science fiction themes, including aliens and UFOs. These themes would continue to be explored throughout his early solo work. &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; includes the song &quot;U-Mass&quot;, which was written about the university he attended as a youth, and due to the keyboard part played by Feldman, signified a move away from the band&#x27;s alternative rock sound. Although Deal had contributed on the songs &quot;Gigantic&quot; (from &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;) and &quot;Silver&quot; (from &quot;Doolittle&quot;), from &quot;Bossanova&quot; on, Thompson wrote all the band&#x27;s original material. This contributed to the increasing tension between him and Deal, and the Pixies broke up in 1992; this was not publicly announced until early 1993.

===Early solo career===
While Pixies&#x27; 1991 album &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album&#x27;s producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had &quot;plenty of tunes and musical scraps&quot;.

He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Hang On to Your Ego&quot;. Feldman became the album&#x27;s producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name &quot;Frank Black&quot; (inverting his old persona &quot;Black Francis&quot;) and released the results as &quot;Frank Black&quot; in March 1993. &quot;Frank Black&quot; was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in &quot;I Heard Ramona Sing&quot;, a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies&#x27; albums &quot;Bossanova&quot; and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;, &quot;but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did&quot;.

The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot;. &quot;Teenager&quot; included the song &quot;Headache&quot; (), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as &quot;irresistible pop&quot;. The production of &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot; was markedly different from &quot;Frank Black&quot;; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in &quot;Teenager&quot;, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson&#x27;s songwriting became &quot;a lot more spontaneous&quot; while recording the album. Thompson had begun to stray from his style with Pixies, writing songs that covered a variety of genres and topics, and his new-found method of recording was closer to later albums than that of &quot;Frank Black&quot; and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;.

Both &quot;Frank Black&quot; and &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot; were critically well received, although they enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released &quot;The Cult of Ray&quot; on Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings; the album marked a turn away from the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole &quot;Teenager&quot; holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson&#x27;s working methods for the next several years.

===Frank Black and the Catholics===

Thompson dubbed his new band &quot;Frank Black and the Catholics&quot; and recorded their eponymous first album in 1997. Recorded live-to-two-track initially as merely a demo, he was so pleased with the results that he decided to release the sessions with no further production. The album was delayed for over a year by conflicts at American, both internal and over its production, and was ultimately released in late 1998 by SpinArt Records in the US. Since leaving American Recordings, Black has avoided long-term contracts with labels, and has maintained ownership of his album masters, licensing each album individually for release.

&quot;Frank Black and the Catholics&quot; became the first album to be posted to the eMusic service; they claim it is &quot;the first album ever made legally available for commercial download&quot;. Critical reception to the album was mixed, with some writers noting Thompson&#x27;s seemingly deliberate turn away from the &quot;quirkiness&quot; of the Pixies and his early solo work for a self-consciously straightforward approach, and the &quot;disappointingly straightforward punk-pop&quot; musical style present on the album.

He would continue to eschew multi-track recording for the live-to-two-track technique for all subsequent releases under the group name. Live-to-two-track recording precludes the use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture; all takes are recorded continuously, and mixing is done &quot;on the fly&quot;. On later albums, he incorporated more musicians into the sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures. Explaining his rationale behind the method, he commented:

Workman left the Catholics in 1998 to pursue session and sideman work; Rich Gilbert was added to the band to replace him. Frank Black and the Catholics released &quot;Pistolero&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Dog in the Sand&quot; in 2001. &quot;Dog in the Sand&quot; added Dave Philips on pedal steel guitar and lead guitar, and Santiago and Feldman began making occasional appearances with the group live and on record.

By this time, while dismissing the possibility of a Pixies reunion, Thompson had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band&#x27;s songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again. Black and the Catholics continued to release records; two separate albums, &quot;Black Letter Days&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Workshop&quot;, were released simultaneously in 2002. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Workshop&quot; included the song &quot;Velvety&quot; (), a version of the Pixies song &quot;Velvety Instrumental Version&quot; that Black wrote as a teenager, with lyrics. The song was one of the first signs that he had acknowledged his past work with the Pixies in his solo output. A sixth album with the Catholics, &quot;Show Me Your Tears&quot;, was released in 2003. &quot;Show Me Your Tears&#x27;&quot; title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Thompson&#x27;s recent divorce and entry into therapy.

===Pixies reunion, Nashville and the return of Black Francis===
In late 2003, following long-standing rumors, an official announcement was made that the Pixies were rehearsing for a reunion tour. The band played publicly for the first time in 12 years in April 2004, and went on to tour extensively throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe in the same year. They also recorded one of Deal&#x27;s compositions, &quot;Bam Thwok&quot;, which was released on the iTunes Music Store. &quot;Frank Black Francis&quot;, a double album bridging the gap between his two personas, was released to coincide with the Pixies reunion tour. The first disc consisted of solo demos of Pixies songs recorded the day before &quot;The Purple Tape&quot; was recorded, and the second contained studio collaborations, again of Pixies songs, with Two Pale Boys.

Also in 2004, Thompson began to collaborate with a group of Nashville session musicians, including Steve Cropper, Spooner Oldham, Reggie Young, and Anton Fig, as well as producer Jon Tiven. In July 2005, the collective released &quot;Honeycomb&quot; under the Frank Black name, to generally favorable reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;spare, graceful, [and] in the pocket&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot; noted it as &quot;One of [Thompson&#x27;s] finest hours&quot;. A second volume of Nashville sessions, a double album entitled &quot;Fast Man Raider Man&quot;, was released in June 2006. Thompson appeared at a concert by Christian rock pioneer Larry Norman in June 2005 in Salem, Oregon. Norman and Thompson performed a duet on &quot;Watch What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, which later appeared on Norman&#x27;s album, &quot;Live at The Elsinore&quot;.

Thompson continued to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, they released two separate albums of B-sides and rarities, &quot;Snake Oil&quot; and &quot;One More Road for the Hit&quot;, on iTunes, with an eye towards a future CD release. Thompson was also working on more new solo material with Feldman in the first part of 2006, some of which they performed live. In the fall of 2006, Thompson began his first solo tour since 2003, taking Feldman, Billy Block, and Duane Jarvis along as his backing band. In October 2006, Thompson announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, but it is believed that no recording took place because of the reluctance of another member of the Pixies to commit to the project. In December 2006, he released the compilation &quot;Christmass&quot; album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from a solo tour the previous summer.

A Frank Black &quot;best of&quot; compilation, &quot;Frank Black 93-03&quot;, was released in June 2007. Concurrently with that release, Thompson undertook a European tour with a new band, featuring Salem&#x27;s Guards of Metropolis members Jason Carter and Charles Normal, as well as bassist Simon &quot;Ding&quot; Archer. For this tour, Thompson eschewed his usual rhythm guitar role and performed solely as a frontman and singer. In September 2007, a new album entitled &quot;Bluefinger&quot; was released under his former stage name of Black Francis. For this album, he was inspired by the life and works of Herman Brood, a Dutch musician and artist. He also released a new &quot;mini-album&quot; entitled &quot;Svn Fngrs&quot; as Black Francis in March 2008.

In February 2008, Thompson was taken away by the Irish police in Dublin, Ireland, after staging an impromptu &quot;precore&quot; acoustic solo gig at St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. He was later released and performed that night in Vicar Street as planned. However, a similar event planned for London was prevented by police and had to be re-arranged for a small indoor venue.

Thompson currently lives in Massachusetts with his wife, Rachel Phillips.

Thompson has three children with his ex-wife, Violet Clark, along with her two children from previous relationships. The couple formerly lived in Eugene, Oregon, where they met. Thompson and Clark formerly composed the band Grand Duchy, which was active from 2008-2012. Their debut album, &quot;Petit Fours&quot;, was released in February 2009.
In 2008, Black produced Art Brut&#x27;s third album, &quot;Art Brut vs. Satan&quot;, which was released the following year. Black gave several joint interviews with frontman Eddie Argos about the album, and Art Brut supported the Pixies at their 2009 Brixton Academy show. In 2010, Black worked with the group a second time on their album &quot;Brilliant! Tragic!&quot;.

Black Francis released &quot;NonStopErotik&quot; in March 2010 and contributed the song &quot;I Heard Ramona Sing&quot; to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; released in August 2010.

In the fall of 2010 in Nashville, Thompson recorded an album of new songs written and performed with collaborator Reid Paley, as Paley &amp; Francis (Reid Paley &amp; Black Francis). The debut Paley &amp; Francis album (also titled &quot;Paley &amp; Francis&quot;) was produced by Jon Tiven, and features Reid Paley and Black Francis on guitars and vocals, accompanied by Muscle Shoals legends Spooner Oldham on piano and David Hood on bass. The album was released in October 2011 on Sonic Unyon in North America, and on Cooking Vinyl in the UK &amp; Europe.

Paley &amp; Francis debuted live in early September 2011 with club performances in Albany NY, Buffalo NY, and Hamilton, Ontario, and as one of the headliners of the Supercrawl Festival. The band for these performances consisted of Reid Paley and Black Francis on guitars and vocals, Eric Eble on bass, and Dave Varriale on drums. The pair toured again from February 8 to 22, 2013, with the shows including solo performances by each artist.

Black Francis contributed, in 2011, to the Ray Davies album of collaborations, &quot;See My Friends&quot;, with his cover of the Kinks tune &quot;This Is Where I Belong&quot;.

Black Francis performed at The Coach House Concert Hall in San Juan Capistrano, California, on March 22, 2013. The Pixies, minus original bassist Kim Deal, reunited for a United States and world tour in 2014 and have subsequently released five additional studio albums: &quot;Indie Cindy&quot; (2014), &quot;Head Carrier&quot; (2016), &quot;Beneath the Eyrie&quot; (2019), &quot;Doggerel&quot; (2022) and &quot;The Night the Zombies Came&quot; (2024).

==Musical style==

Over the course of his career, Thompson&#x27;s musical style has grown to encompass a large number of genres; however, he is considered to produce rock or alternative rock compositions. Whereas songs such as &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; (&quot;Doolittle&quot;), &quot;Velvety&quot; (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Workshop&quot;) and &quot;Headache&quot; (&quot;Teenager of the Year&quot;) expose a more light rock side, others such as &quot;Something Against You&quot; (&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;) and &quot;Thalassocracy&quot; (&quot;Teenager of the Year&quot;) hint to a more heavy rock influence in his material. A strong country music influence is also increasingly evident in his style, most notably in his Nashville albums, &quot;Honeycomb&quot; and &quot;Fast Man Raider Man&quot;.

Thompson has said that he acquired his vocal style as a teenager, when a Thai neighbor asked him to sing &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; by The Beatles (from their album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;) and to &quot;Scream it like you hate that bitch!&quot; Thompson&#x27;s powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band&#x27;s typical song structure of quietly paced verses followed by thundering chorus lines and repetitive guitar staccato.

The Fender Telecaster is Thompson&#x27;s preferred electric guitar, but he occasionally uses a Gibson SG. He uses Martin acoustic guitars.

===Influences===
Thompson has drawn influence from a number of musical genres. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter Larry Norman. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given Leon Russell&#x27;s 1970 debut album, which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered punk music (Black Flag), along with bands from other genres, such as the new wave band The Cars and the obscure Angst. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, Hüsker Dü&#x27;s &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot; by Captain Beefheart, and &quot;I&#x27;m Sick of You&quot;, an Iggy Pop bootleg. Thompson was also greatly influenced by the Beatles self-titled 1968 release with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions.

Thompson&#x27;s lyrics have also featured references to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies; most notably in the incestuous tale of Nimrod in &quot;Nimrod&#x27;s Son&quot;, the stories of Uriah and Bathsheba in &quot;Dead&quot;, Samson in &quot;Gouge Away&quot; and references to the Tower of Babel in songs such as &quot;Build High&quot; and &quot;Old Black Dawning&quot;. He cited surrealist films &quot;Eraserhead&quot; and &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (as mentioned in &quot;In Heaven&quot; and &quot;Debaser&quot; respectively) as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career. He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies&#x27; &quot;Doolittle&quot;), saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels&quot;, but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.

===Songwriting and lyrics===
During his stay in Puerto Rico, Thompson acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of Spanish, which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including &quot;Isla de Encanta&quot; and &quot;Vamos&quot;, reference his experiences in San Juan, and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island&#x27;s slang. The island&#x27;s influence in his work is most notable in the song &quot;Isla De Encanta&quot;, named after the island&#x27;s motto, &quot;Isla Del Encanto&quot;. Other Pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include &quot;Vamos&quot; (&quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;), &quot;Oh My Golly!&quot;, &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; (&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;), &quot;Crackity Jones&quot; (&quot;Doolittle&quot;) and the B-side &quot;Bailey&#x27;s Walk&quot;. Several of his songs contain Spanish lyrics, most notably in the Pixies&#x27; first album, &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;, and a Spanish translation of &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot; by The Yardbirds. From his later works with the Pixies onwards, his use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of California and its culture.

Thompson&#x27;s lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off-beat topics such as outer space, UFOs, and The Three Stooges—the last of these being the subject of &quot;Two Reelers&quot;, a song from &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot;. Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on the later Pixies records, as well as his early solo albums. With the Catholics, his lyrics have tended towards historical topics; for example, the song &quot;St. Francis Dam Disaster&quot; (from &quot;Dog in the Sand&quot;) details the catastrophic collapse of the St. Francis Dam near Los Angeles in March 1928, and the &quot;All My Ghosts&quot; EP featured an account of the Humboldt County Massacre of Wiyot Indians in 1860 near Eureka, California.

==Television appearances and videos==

Thompson has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of the Pixies, ranging from &quot;120 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The Late Show&quot; in the United States, to &quot;The Word&quot; in the UK.

As part of the Pixies, he was reluctant to film music videos for singles. Elektra Records&#x27; Peter Lubin said &quot;to get videos out of them was a major ... undertaking and it only got worse over time, because Thompson refused to lip-sync;. The video for &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; mocks the practice by showing Thompson and Deal opening their mouths as the vocals are being heard.

In his early solo career as Frank Black, his videos were more professional; he became more willing to take part in them. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; is an example; the video shows Thompson riding across a desert on a hovercraft. They Might Be Giants&#x27; John Flansburgh, who directed the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; video, later commented on the change in Black&#x27;s attitude to music videos:

Thompson has released few music videos since leaving 4AD, one being a low-budget video in Germany for &quot;Dog in the Sand&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Robert Onion&quot;. The last widely released video produced for his solo material was for &quot;Men in Black&quot;, from &quot;Cult of Ray&quot;.

In 2013, Thompson appeared in a video promoting McSweeney&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Lost Sloth&quot;.

<text>Kimberley Ann Deal (born June 10, 1961) is an American musician. She was the original bassist and co-vocalist in the alternative rock band the Pixies from 1986 to 1993 and 2004 to 2013. She is the frontwoman of the Breeders, which she formed in 1989.

Deal joined the Pixies in January 1986, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums &quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. Following &quot;Doolittle&quot; and the Pixies&#x27; hiatus, she formed the Breeders with Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses, Josephine Wiggs of the Perfect Disaster, and Britt Walford of Slint; following the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Pod&quot;, her twin sister Kelley Deal replaced Donelly.

The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to the Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album &quot;Last Splash&quot; in 1993, featuring the popular single &quot;Cannonball&quot;. In 1994, the Breeders went on hiatus after Kelley entered drug rehabilitation. During the band&#x27;s hiatus, Deal adopted the stage name Tammy Ampersand and formed the short-lived rock band the Amps, recording a single album, &quot;Pacer&quot;, in 1995. After her own stint in drug rehabilitation, Deal eventually reformed the Breeders with a new line-up for two more albums, &quot;Title TK&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Mountain Battles&quot; in 2008. She returned to the Pixies when the band reunited in 2004. 

In 2013, Deal left the Pixies to concentrate on the Breeders, after that band&#x27;s most famous line-up reunited for a new series of tours celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Last Splash&quot;. In 2018, the Breeders released their fifth album &quot;All Nerve&quot;, the first album to reunite the Deals, Wiggs, and Macpherson since &quot;Last Splash&quot;. In 2024, Deal released her debut solo album, &quot;Nobody Loves You More&quot;.

== Early life ==
Deal was born in Dayton, Ohio, United States. Her father was a laser physicist who worked at the nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Kim and her identical twin sister Kelley were introduced to music at a young age; the two sang to a &quot;two-track, quarter-inch, tape&quot; when they were &quot;four or five&quot; years old, and grew up listening to hard rock bands such as AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. When Deal was 11, she learned Roger Miller&#x27;s &quot;King of the Road&quot; on the acoustic guitar. Attending Wayne High School in suburban Huber Heights, she was a cheerleader and often got into conflicts with authority. &quot;We were popular girls,&quot; according to Kelley. &quot;We got good grades and played sports.&quot; Still, growing up in Dayton was &quot;like living in Russia&quot;, according to Kim. A friend of Kelley&#x27;s living in California sent the Deals cassettes of artists such as James Blood Ulmer, the Undertones, Elvis Costello, Sex Pistols and Siouxsie and the Banshees. &quot;These tapes were our most treasured possession, the only link with civilization,&quot; Kim later recalled.

As a teenager, she formed a folk rock band with her sister. She then became a prolific songwriter, as she found it easier to write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: &quot;I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just trying to figure out how blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn&#x27;t have anything to do with who I was.&quot; The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, the two &quot;had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17.&quot; They later bought a drum machine &quot;so it would feel like we were more in a band.&quot;

Deal attended seven different colleges following high school, including Ohio State University, but did not graduate from any of them. She eventually earned an associate degree in medical technology from Kettering College and took several jobs in cellular biology, including working in a hospital laboratory and a biochemical lab.

== Musical career ==
=== The Pixies ===

Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for the Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; that read, &quot;Band seeks bassist into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please – no chops.&quot; Deal&#x27;s was the only response, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley&#x27;s bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering, a friend of her husband whom she&#x27;d met at their wedding reception, as drummer. For the release of the band&#x27;s first recording &quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot; (1987), Deal used the &quot;nom de disque&quot; &quot;Mrs. John Murphy&quot; in the liner notes, chosen as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a woman who wished to be called only by her husband&#x27;s name.
For &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Gigantic&quot;, which she co-wrote with frontman Black Francis. &quot;Doolittle&quot; followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song &quot;Silver&quot;. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album&#x27;s recording sessions. Deal commented that the sessions &quot;went from just all fun to work&quot;. Exhaustion from releasing three records in two years and constant touring contributed to intra-band friction, particularly between Francis and Deal.

The tension and exhaustion culminated at the end of the US &quot;Fuck or Fight&quot; tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. The band soon announced a hiatus.

=== The Breeders ===

During a 1988 post-&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; tour of Europe with Throwing Muses as part of the Pixies, Deal began to write new material. As neither band had plans for the short term, Deal discussed possible side-projects with Throwing Muses guitarist Tanya Donelly. After rejecting the idea of creating a dance album together, the pair decided to form a new band. Deal named the band the Breeders, after the folk band she formed with Kelley as a teenager, and they recruited Carrie Bradley, violinist and vocalist in Ed&#x27;s Redeeming Qualities, to record a short demo tape.

The Breeders&#x27; demo was sent to 4AD head Ivo Watts-Russell, who immediately signed them to the label. The Breeders allowed Deal to become more active in songwriting, and their debut album, &quot;Pod&quot; (1990), written primarily by Deal, was recorded in Edinburgh by Steve Albini. &quot;Pod&quot; was praised by contemporaries; Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain later named the album one of his favorites and remarked, &quot;I wish Kim was allowed to write more songs for the Pixies.&quot;

=== &quot;Bossanova&quot; and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; ===
Deal returned to the U.S. after finishing recording &quot;Pod&quot; in Edinburgh, but was then fired from the Pixies. Regardless, she flew out to Los Angeles, where the other members of the band had moved, to meet them, and was accepted back into the band to record &quot;Bossanova&quot; (1990).

The band&#x27;s final studio album was &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; (1991). The recording sessions were fractious, and the whole band was hardly ever together during the process.

Deal rarely sang on the band&#x27;s songs during this time; one of the few tracks she sang on was a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Waiting for You&quot;. () Deal did sing on &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;, on songs such as &quot;Alec Eiffel&quot;, but did not write any material for the album.

=== &quot;Last Splash&quot; ===
A year after the Pixies&#x27; breakup, Kelley Deal joined the Breeders on lead guitar, replacing Donelly, and the band released &quot;Last Splash&quot; to critical acclaim and considerable commercial success. The record went platinum within a year of its release.

At the height of the Breeders&#x27; popularity in the early-mid 1990s, the band scored a number of hit music videos featured heavily on MTV, including &quot;Cannonball&quot;, &quot;Safari&quot;, &quot;Divine Hammer&quot;, and &quot;Saints.&quot; The band also released the vinyl-only &quot;Head to Toe&quot; 10&quot; EP during the summer of 1994, when they appeared on the main stage of Lollapalooza. Although the band went into stasis in 1994 when Kelley Deal entered rehab for a heroin addiction, they never officially split up, and in 2002 released &quot;Title TK&quot; (TK is a copyediting mark meaning &quot;to come&quot; and is often used when editing drafts to indicate missing information).

=== 1995–2004: The Amps and other projects ===
Deal formed the Amps in 1995 under the sobriquet &quot;Tammy Ampersand&quot;. Their lone album, &quot;Pacer&quot; (1995), was generally well-received but sold poorly.

She also produced music for other groups, most notably fellow Dayton band Guided by Voices (one of the songs on &quot;Pacer&quot;, &quot;I Am Decided&quot;, was co-written by the band&#x27;s lead singer, Robert Pollard).

Deal has contributed her voice to numerous projects, including This Mortal Coil&#x27;s 1991 version of Chris Bell&#x27;s &quot;You and Your Sister&quot; (a duet with Tanya Donnelly); the 1995 Sonic Youth single &quot;Little Trouble Girl&quot;; and the For Carnation&#x27;s &quot;Tales (Live from the Crypt)&quot; in 2000.
=== Pixies reunion and beyond ===
In 2004, Deal returned to the newly reunited Pixies, releasing the single &quot;Bam Thwok&quot; and touring North America. One notable performance included a live taping for the public television program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; in October 2004. The Pixies also played the Coachella Festival in 2004 and headlined Lollapalooza in 2005 at Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park. The Pixies also toured the UK to critical acclaim including a headline appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals.

In 2003, Deal moved back to Dayton to care for her mother, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In early April 2008, the Breeders released their fourth full-length studio album, &quot;Mountain Battles&quot;. followed by the EP &quot;Fate to Fatal&quot; a year later. On June 14, 2013, it was announced that Deal had left the Pixies. She has since posted new solo music on her website. , she has no contact with her former Pixies bandmates, according to Joey Santiago.

=== Solo releases, &quot;LSXX&quot;, and &quot;All Nerve&quot; ===
In December 2012, Deal played a solo set at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; festival in the UK, debuting several new songs. At the same time, she released her first solo single, &quot;Walking with a Killer&quot;, and continued to issue further solo releases throughout 2013 and 2014.

In April 2013, 4AD released &quot;LSXX&quot;, a 20th anniversary edition of the Breeders album &quot;Last Splash&quot;. Deal reunited with Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs, and Jim Macpherson for a &quot;Last Splash&quot; anniversary tour of North America, Europe, and Australia. In August 2014, it was reported that the same line up were working on new material.

A new single, &quot;Wait in the Car&quot;, was released on October 3, 2017. On March 2, 2018, the reunited lineup released &quot;All Nerve&quot;, their first studio album in ten years, to widespread critical acclaim. In the following months, the Breeders also collaborated on multiple tracks of Courtney Barnett&#x27;s May 2018 album &quot;Tell Me How You Really Feel&quot;, with Kim and Kelley singing backing vocals on the singles &quot;Nameless, Faceless&quot; and &quot;Crippling Self-Doubt and a General Lack of Confidence&quot;.

In August 2024, Deal announced the pending release date November 22 of her debut solo album &quot;Nobody Loves You More&quot; noting it contains several collaborations. &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; listed the album in their year-end ranking of the best albums of 2024, respectively placing it at #6 and #42.

== Equipment ==

=== Bass guitars ===
Kim Deal generally plays four-string solid-body bass guitars and always uses a pick, particularly the &quot;green Dunlops with the little turtle on them&quot;, although since the Pixies&#x27; reunion she has also been using custom green Dunlops with &quot;KIM&quot; written on them. She prefers having old strings on a bass.
* Aria Pro II Cardinal Series – the Pixies&#x27; first bass belonged to Kelley and was loaned to Kim upon her joining the band. It was used on &quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and seen in the &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; live video.
* 1962 Fender Precision Reissue – Acquired for use on &quot;Doolittle&quot; on producer Gil Norton&#x27;s insistence. It appears in the video for &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;. On &quot;Bossanova&quot;, the Precision was used on &quot;Dig for Fire&quot; for its &quot;lazier, growlier sound&quot; that was &quot;not as boingy-boingy-sproingy&quot;.
* Music Man StingRay – Acquired during the &quot;Bossanova&quot; sessions &quot;because it was active and had a different sound,&quot; and became her main live bass &quot;because it was a little less country-sounding than the Fender&quot;. The instrument was afterwards played by Josephine Wiggs in the Breeders, and by Luis Lerma in the Amps.
* Steinberger headless bass – Bought during the recording of &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot; due to intonation issues on her other instruments. Deal described it as having a &quot;weird, organ-y sound&quot;.
* Gibson Thunderbird – more recently, her favorite bass that she did not use on the Pixies&#x27; reunion, feeling she had to &quot;sound like the records&quot;. It is seen played upside-down (left-handed) by Mando Lopez in the Breeders, and by Kim Deal herself in the video for &quot;Biker Gone&quot; (2014).

=== Guitars ===
Deal has noted that she prefers to amplify acoustic guitars through Marshall electric guitar amplifiers.
* Seagull acoustic
* 1958 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Reissue – Also played by Joey Santiago up through &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; (before he acquired his own) and then by Kelley Deal in the Breeders.
* 1991 Fender Stratocaster Ultra – Kelley Deal also has the same model, which she received as a Christmas present from Kim in 1991.
* Fender Telecaster has occasionally been played by Kim in the Breeders&#x27; live performances since at least the &quot;Last Splash&quot; era. She was also shown using the guitar on the tour bus in the Pixies documentary film &quot;loudQUIETloud&quot; (2006).
* Gibson hollowbody – Borrowed for use on &quot;Last Splash&quot;.

=== Amplification ===
* Peavey 300 Combo, 1×15&quot; speaker
* Trace Elliot bass head – &quot;It&#x27;s the new series and I don&#x27;t know what the number is or if there even is a number on there.&quot;
* Trace Elliot 1048H bass cabinet, 4×10&quot; speakers
* SWR heads
* Marshall JCM 900 head
* Marshall cabinets
* Gallien-Krueger cabinet, 4×10&quot; speakers
* &quot;Joe&#x27;s Light&quot; cabinet, 1×18&quot; speaker – Of this and the Gallien-Krueger she commented: &quot;I hate my cabinets.&quot;
* Sears Tremolo amp with the word &#x27;Marshall&#x27; pasted on it.

=== Effects ===
* dbx 160X Compressor – &quot;I use a compressor live, but only because sound guys seem to like it when I have one onstage, even if it&#x27;s on bypass.&quot;
* Boss DS-1 Distortion pedals – Used by both Kim and Kelley.

== Recording ==
Kim Deal eschews digital equipment entirely for recording and mixing. Deal commissioned the &quot;All Wave&quot; logo in an effort to identify recordings that follow this method of recording, and possibly start a movement.

== Personal life ==
Deal married John Murphy on Memorial Day, 1985. In January 1986, they moved to Boston, Murphy’s hometown. Murphy co-wrote the Breeders song &quot;Hoverin&#x27;&quot; with Deal. The couple divorced in 1988.

When asked if she had a &quot;gay bone&quot; in her body, Deal responded with &quot;You know what? I&#x27;m just so…asexual, I wish I had a gay bone.&quot;

<text>Paul Tortelier (21 March 1914 – 18 December 1990) was a French cellist and composer. After an outstanding student career at the Conservatoire de Paris he played in orchestras in France and the US before the Second World War. After the war he became a well-known soloist, playing in countries round the globe. He taught at music schools in France, Germany and China, and gave televised masterclasses in England. He was particularly associated with the solo part in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, cello concertos by Elgar and others, and Bach&#x27;s Cello Suites.

==Life and work==
===Early years===
Tortelier was born in Paris, the son of Joseph Tortelier and his wife Marguerite, &quot;née&quot; Boura. Joseph, who came from a family with Breton roots, was a &quot;menuisier-ébéniste&quot; – a carpenter-cabinet-maker – in Montmartre. Tortelier&#x27;s mother had a particular love of the cello and he began to play the instrument when he was six. His general education was at the École Lucien Lafflessele, and from the age of nine he studied the cello with Louis Feuillard.

At the age of 12 Tortelier entered the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied the cello with Gérard Hekking. While a student he earned an income in a trio playing accompaniments to silent films. He won the conservatoire&#x27;s first prize when he was 16, playing the Elgar Cello Concerto, and then he studied harmony and composition under Jean Gallon. He made his professional début in 1931 at the age of 17, as soloist in Lalo&#x27;s Cello Concerto with the Orchestre Lamoureux.

In 1935 Tortelier joined the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra as first cellist and played with them until 1937. He gave performances under Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini, and played the solo part in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; conducted by the composer.

In 1937 Tortelier accepted an invitation from Serge Koussevitzky to join the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He remained until the 1939–40 season. He was in Paris during the Second World War, teaching at the Conservatoire. He had a short-lived marriage to Madeleine Gaston, which ended in divorce in 1944. After the war he was principal cellist of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1946–47. In 1946 he married a cello pupil, Maud Monique Martin, with whom he had three children, all of whom became musicians: Yan Pascal, a violinist and subsequently a conductor; Maria de la Pau, a pianist; and Pomona, a cellist.

===International solo career===
In 1947 Tortelier&#x27;s international career as a soloist began in Berlin and Amsterdam. After a concert in the latter city, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, at which Tortelier again played the solo part in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Beecham invited him to reprise his performance with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) at a festival of Strauss&#x27;s music in London, in the presence of the composer. Within days Tortelier gave a recital with Gerald Moore at the Wigmore Hall and recorded the Strauss piece with Beecham and the RPO. After the recital, the music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Tortelier showed himself to be &quot;an artist of great distinction, whose playing combined technical mastery with fine musicianship throughout a programme including works by Bach, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and virtuoso show-pieces&quot;. He added:

During his subsequent career Tortelier played throughout Europe, the Americas, Australia, North Africa, Israel, the USSR and Japan, but Britain remained central to his career, and most of his recordings over the next four decades were made there. He found the English baffling in their undemonstrative feelings, but he was fond of them: &quot;I cannot speak of the English without emotion. I owe them everything in terms of my career&quot;. He was less at home with Americans, whom he found friendly but lacking in real love.

In 1950 Tortelier was asked by Pablo Casals to play as the principal cellist in the Prades Festival Orchestra; out of respect for Casals, Tortelier agreed. He later said, &quot;I have played for Toscanini and Karajan, but I never felt with any conductor what I felt with Casals&quot;. More than any other cellist it was Casals who influenced him the most. Tortelier said that there was a spiritual quality in the older man&#x27;s playing: &quot;one never thought that Casals was playing the cello; he was playing music&quot;. Nonetheless, Tortelier gained technical insights from Casals, particularly the latter&#x27;s flexible use of the left hand on the fingerboard and his assertive phrasing and articulation. He also absorbed Casals&#x27;s approach to intonation, subtly sharpening or flattening the pitch of notes for the best harmonic effect. Casals said of Tortelier&#x27;s mastery of the cello, &quot;When you play you make it talk&quot;.

Although he was not Jewish (he was an agnostic Roman Catholic) Tortelier was inspired by the ideals of the founders of the newly formed state of Israel in 1948, and in 1955–56 he lived with his wife and children in the kibbutz Ma&#x27;abarot, near Haifa. During this period he made his début as a conductor, with the Israel Philharmonic.

Tortelier&#x27;s international career continued into his seventies. At a concert to mark his 75th birthday he was joined by colleagues including his friend Mstislav Rostropovich, who conducted the Saint-Saëns A-minor concerto with Tortelier as soloist and later in the concert joined him as fellow soloist in a composition of Tortelier&#x27;s own, the &quot;Valse, alla Maud&quot;.

Tortelier died of a heart attack on 18 December 1990 at the age of 76 in the domaine of Villarceaux, Yvelines, near Paris. At a concert the following June to celebrate his life and work, Yehudi Menuhin, Sir Charles Groves and Yan-Pascal Tortelier conducted, and the cellists included Maud Martin Tortelier, János Starker and two of Tortelier&#x27;s former students, Arto Noras and Raphael Sommer.

==Composer, teacher and innovator==
Tortelier thought it important for executant musicians to write music, because he felt it enabled him to approach even repertory works as, to some extent, an act of re-creation:

His compositions include a concerto for two cellos and orchestra (1950), a solo cello suite in D, and two sonatas for cello and piano. He wrote a set of variations for cello and orchestra (&quot;May Music Save Peace&quot;). He also wrote a symphony, the &quot;Israel Symphony&quot;. Several of his compositions were included at a special concert to mark his 75th birthday at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989, in which his wife and son joined in his celebrations. He twice edited the Bach Cello Suites; his first version was published by Augener in 1961, and the second by Galliard in 1966.

Tortelier&#x27;s students included Noras, Sommer, Jacqueline du Pré, Anne Gastinel and Nathan Waks. He was a professor at the Conservatoire de Paris (1956–69), the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen, Germany (1969–1975), and the Conservatoire Pierre Cochereau, Nice (1978–80). He was also an honorary professor at the Central Conservatoire in Beijing. In the 1960s and 1970s he gave a series of master classes which were recorded and broadcast on TV by the BBC. &quot;The Times&quot; said of them, &quot;he was the first musician to popularise the master class on BBC television. With his deep-set, expressive eyes, his unruly mop of white hair and broken but articulate English he captivated his audience as much as his pupils&quot;. His physical resemblance to the traditional drawings of Cervantes&#x27;s Don Quixote was remarked on.

Pursuing his encouragement of rising talent, Tortelier was artistic director and panel chairman for Britain&#x27;s first major cello competition, held in Bristol in 1975. 20 competitors from 12 countries took part, and the gala concert featured the premiere of Tortelier&#x27;s own Concerto for Two Cellos, performed by the composer and his wife, with their son conducting.

If Tortelier had to play or tune a violin he would do so holding it vertically, like a miniature cello. After he tuned his son&#x27;s violin thus on one occasion, the young Yan Pascal commented that it did not sound as good when tuned upright as when tuned in its normal horizontal position. Tortelier concurred, and further consideration of the point led him to develop a new kind of endpin, hinged to bring the cello down from nearly vertical to a slope, so that the instrument vibrates more freely, giving greater projection of its sound. This suited some cellists more than others, and according to &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; is &quot;not widely used&quot;.

==Honours==

Tortelier was an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London, held honorary degrees from three English universities, and was a Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland. A street in the Batignolles-Monceau, the 17th arrondissement of Paris, is named in his honour.

==Recordings==
Tortelier&#x27;s extensive discography includes two sets of the Bach Cello Suites, the first made in Paris in 1960 and the second in London in 1982. He recorded &quot;Don Quixote&quot; twice: first with Beecham and the RPO in 1947 and then in 1973 with Rudolf Kempe and the Staatskapelle Dresden. &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine said of the latter that despite the merits of rival recordings, &quot;for sheer charm and elegance&quot; this version won the palm. Tortelier made three studio recordings of the Elgar concerto – with Sir Malcolm Sargent and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1953, Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1972, and Groves and the RPO in 1988. The BBC issued a recording of a 1972 concert performance of the concerto with Boult and the BBC Symphony, on a CD that also includes a performance of the Brahms Double Concerto with the Torteliers &quot;père et fils&quot; as soloists. His other recordings include concertos by Haydn, Saint-Saëns, Dvořák and Walton, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Variations on a Rococo Theme, Beethoven&#x27;s complete works for cello and piano with Éric Heidsieck and the cello sonatas of Debussy and Fauré with Jean Hubeau. With Menuhin he recorded the double concertos of Brahms and Delius.

<text>Sir Frederick Henry Royce, 1st Baronet, (27 March 1863 – 22 April 1933) was an English engineer famous for his designs of car and aeroplane engines with a reputation for reliability and longevity. With Charles Rolls (1877–1910) and Claude Johnson (1864–1926), he founded Rolls-Royce.

Rolls-Royce initially focused on large 40–50 horsepower motor cars, the Silver Ghost and its successors. Royce produced his first aero engine shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, and aircraft engines became Rolls-Royce&#x27;s principal product.

Royce&#x27;s health broke down in 1911, and he was persuaded to leave his factory in the Midlands at Derby and, taking a team of designers, move to the south of England spending winters in the south of France. He died at his home in Sussex in the spring of 1933.

==Early life==
Royce was born in Alwalton, Huntingdonshire, near Peterborough in 1863 to James and Mary Royce (née King). He was the youngest of their five children. His father ran a flour mill which he leased from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners but the business failed and the family moved to London. His father died in 1872 and Royce had to go out to work selling newspapers and delivering telegrams after only one year of formal schooling.

In 1878 he started an apprenticeship with the Great Northern Railway company at its works in Peterborough thanks to the financial help of an aunt. After three years the money ran out. After a short time with a tool-making company in Leeds he returned to London and joined the Electric Light and Power Company. He moved to their Liverpool office in 1882 working on street and theatre lighting.

In 1884, with £20 of savings, he entered a partnership with Ernest Claremont, a friend who contributed £50, and they started a business making domestic electric fittings in a workshop in Cooke Street, Hulme, Manchester, called F. H. Royce and Company. In 1894 they started making dynamos and electric cranes and F. H. Royce &amp; Company was registered as a limited liability company. The company was re-registered in 1899 as Royce Ltd with a public share flotation and a further factory opened in Trafford Park, Manchester.

==Partnership with Rolls==

Following a decline in trade after the Second Boer War, and the arrival of increasing competition by cranes and dynamos from Germany and the United States, Royce began considering the motor car as a potential new product for the company. With his fascination for all things mechanical he became increasingly focused on motor cars and bought first, in 1901, a small De Dion and in 1902 or 1903 a 1901 model two cylinder Decauville. This did not meet his high standards and so he first improved it and then decided to manufacture a car of his own which he did in a corner of the workshop in 1904.

Two more cars were made. Of the three, which were called Royce and had two cylinder engines, one was given to Ernest Claremont and the other sold to one of the other directors, Henry Edmunds. Edmunds was a friend of Charles Rolls who had a car showroom in London selling imported models and showed him his car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the newly opened Midland Hotel, Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royce.

The first Rolls-Royce car, the Rolls-Royce 10 hp, was unveiled at the Paris Salon in December 1904. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Royce appointed chief engineer and works director on a salary of £1,250 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of £10,000. Royce thus provided the technical expertise to complement Rolls&#x27; financial backing and business acumen. By 1907 the company was winning awards for the engineering reliability of its cars.

The Rolls-Royce Eagle was the first aircraft engine to be developed by Rolls-Royce Limited. It was introduced in 1915 to meet British military requirements during the First World War and proved to be one of only two aero engines made by the Allies that was neither a production nor a technical failure.

Royce &amp; Company remained in business as a separate company making cranes until 1932 when it was bought by Herbert Morris of Loughborough. The last Royce-designed crane was built in 1964.

The partnership ended when Rolls died in 1910 in a crash of his Wright Flyer aircraft.

==Development of Rolls-Royce==
Royce had always worked hard and was renowned for never eating proper meals which resulted in him being taken ill, first in 1902 and again in 1911. Ill health had forced his move away from Derby in 1912. In the same year, he had a major operation in London and was given only a few months to live by the doctors. In spite of this he returned to work but was prevented from visiting the factory, which had moved to larger premises, fitted out to detailed plans by Royce, in Derby in 1908. He insisted on checking all new designs and engineers and draughtsmen had to take the drawings to be personally checked by him, a daunting prospect with his well-known perfectionism. He had a villa built at Le Canadel in the south of France and a further home at Crowborough, East Sussex. In 1917, Royce moved to the village of West Wittering, West Sussex.

In October 1928, he began design of the &quot;R&quot; engine while walking with some of his leading engineers on the beach at West Wittering, sketching ideas in the sand. Less than a year later, the &quot;R” engine, designed in his studio in the village, set a new world air speed record of 357.7 miles per hour and won the Schneider Trophy of 1929. When the Ramsay MacDonald government decided not to finance the next attempt in 1931, Lucy, Lady Houston, felt that Britain must not be left out of this contest and sent a telegram to the Prime Minister stating that she would guarantee £100,000, if necessary, towards the cost leading the Government to reverse their previous decision. The result was that Royce found that the &quot;R&quot; could be made to produce more power and the Supermarine S.6B seaplane won the Trophy at on 13 September 1931. Later that month on 29 September, the same aircraft with an improved engine flew at , becoming the first craft to fly at over and breaking the world&#x27;s speed record.

== Bentley, shock absorber and Merlin ==

In 1931, Rolls-Royce Ltd. bought out their rival firm of W. O. Bentley. A &quot;20/25&quot; engine was put into a chassis and a Bentley radiator fitted. An open four-seater body completed the picture. The engine was &quot;hotted-up&quot; and the car was taken down to West Wittering to get Royce&#x27;s approval. They were somewhat apprehensive of what he would say, but he gave it his blessing. He told them that such a fast car should have a means by which the driver could adjust the stiffness of the suspension whilst they were driving, to suit the road conditions 

The night before he died he sat up in bed and drew a sketch on the back of an envelope which he gave to Miss Aubin (his nurse and housekeeper) telling her to see that the &quot;boys&quot; in the factory got it safely. He died before it reached Derby. This was the adjustable shock-absorber. Thus, in 1933 the first Bentley made by Rolls-Royce Ltd made its appearance and another famous name carried on.

A few years later the Royce conceived driver adjustable dampers evolved into a ground breaking &quot;ride control&quot; system which automatically adjusted the stiffness of the dampers to match the speed of the car - softer at low speed for better comfort and increasingly stiffer as the car went faster to provide better stability and response.In addition to this automatic control, the driver was still provided with a steering wheel mounted adjustment to tune the range of damping stiffness to suit their preference. 

Following the success of the &quot;R” engine, it was clear that they had an engine that would be of use to the Royal Air Force. As no Government assistance was forthcoming at first, in the national interest they went ahead with development of what was called the &quot;PV-12&quot; engine (standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder). The idea was to produce an engine of about the same performance as the &quot;R”, albeit with a much longer life. Rolls-Royce launched the PV-12 in October 1933 and the engine completed its first test in 1934, the year after Royce died. The PV-12 became the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.

== Personal life ==

Henry Royce married Minnie Punt in 1893 and they set up home together in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, and were joined by his mother, who lived nearby until her death in 1904, and Minnie&#x27;s niece, Violet. The Royces moved to a newly built house in Knutsford, Cheshire in 1898. The couple separated in 1912.

Royce, who lived by the motto &quot;Whatever is rightly done, however humble, is noble&quot;, was appointed OBE in 1918, and was created a baronet, of Seaton in the County of Rutland, in 1930 for his services to British Aviation. He had no children and the baronetcy became extinct on his death.

After he fell ill, Royce was looked after by a nurse, Miss Ethel Aubin for twenty years (after his death she married G.H.R. Tildesley, Royce&#x27;s solicitor). He died at his house Elmstead in West Wittering on 22 April 1933. His cremated remains were initially buried under his statue at the Rolls-Royce works in Derby, but in 1937 his urn was removed to the parish church of Alwalton, his birthplace.

In 1962, a memorial window dedicated to his memory was unveiled in Westminster Abbey. The window is one of a series designed by Ninian Comper dedicated to the memory of eminent engineers. He is also commemorated in Royce Hall, student accommodation at Loughborough University, and until 2011 at one of Peterborough&#x27;s Queensgate shopping centre car parks. The Sir Henry Royce Suite, a business suite, is named after him at the Peterborough Marriott Hotel in the Alwalton business park.

<text>Ian Gillett Carmichael, (18 June 1920 – 5 February 2010) was an English actor who worked prolifically on stage, screen and radio in a career that spanned seventy years. Born in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but his studies—and the early stages of his career—were curtailed by the Second World War. After his demobilisation he returned to acting and found success, initially in revue and sketch productions.

In 1955 Carmichael was noticed by the film producers John and Roy Boulting, who cast him in five of their films as one of the major players. The first was the 1956 film &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a satire on the British Army; he received critical and popular praise for the role, including from the American market. In many of his roles he played a likeable, often accident-prone, innocent. In the mid-1960s he played Bertie Wooster in adaptations of the works of P. G. Wodehouse in &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; for BBC Television, for which he received mostly positive reviews, including from Wodehouse. In the early 1970s he played another upper-class literary character, Lord Peter Wimsey, the amateur but talented investigator created by Dorothy L. Sayers.

Much of Carmichael&#x27;s success came through a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing for a role. He learned much about the craft and technique of humour while appearing with the comic actor Leo Franklyn. Although Carmichael tired of being typecast as the affable but bumbling upper-class Englishman, his craft ensured that while audiences laughed at his antics, he retained their affection; Dennis Barker, in Carmichael&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that he &quot;could play fool parts in a way that did not cut the characters completely off from human sympathy: a certain dignity was always maintained&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Ian Gillett Carmichael was born on 18 June 1920 in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was the eldest child of Kate ( Gillett) and her husband Arthur Denholm Carmichael, an optician on the premises of his family&#x27;s firm of jewellers. Carmichael had two younger sisters, the twins Mary and Margaret, who were born in December 1923. Robert Fairclough, his biographer, describes Carmichael&#x27;s upbringing as a &quot;privileged, pampered existence&quot;; his parents employed maids and a cook. His infant education included one term at the local Froebel House School when he was four, but this was curtailed after his parents were shocked at the &quot;alarmingly foul language he began bringing home&quot;, according to Alex Jennings, Carmichael&#x27;s biographer in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

In 1928 Carmichael was sent to Scarborough College, a prep school in North Yorkshire, which he attended between the ages of seven and thirteen. He did not like the and authoritarian regime at the school. He described the discipline as &quot;&quot;, with corporal punishment used for even minor infringements of the rules; ablutions in the morning and evening were conducted with cold water—which often had a film of ice on the top during winter.

In 1933 Carmichael left Scarborough College and entered Bromsgrove School, a public school in Worcestershire. He soon concluded that &quot;the new curriculum was not arduous&quot;, which gave him the opportunity for focus on matters that were of more interest for him: acting, popular music and cricket. In the late 1930s Carmichael decided to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His parents would have preferred he went into the family jewellery business, but accepted their son&#x27;s decision and supported him financially when he left Yorkshire for London in January 1939.

===Early career and war service, 1939–1946===

Carmichael enjoyed his time at RADA, including the fact that women outnumbered men on his course, which he described as &quot;heady stuff&quot; after his boys-only boarding school. He remembered the time at RADA in the late 1930s fondly in his autobiography, describing it as:

A period of unconfined joy, occasioned by my finally shaking off the shackles of school discipline and being able to mix daily with young men and young women who shared my interests and enthusiasms. This joy was, nevertheless, being tempered by the worsening European situation. The fear that now, just as I was standing on the threshold of a future that I had dreamed about for years, the whole thing might be snuffed out like a candle was too unbearable to contemplate.

During his second term Carmichael had his first professional acting role: as a robot in Karel Čapek&#x27;s &quot;R.U.R.&quot; at the People&#x27;s Palace theatre, in Mile End, East London. He recalled the experience as &quot;a dull play performed in a cold and uninspiring theatre and my particular contribution required absolutely no acting talent whatsoever&quot;. He then appeared as Flute in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at RADA&#x27;s Vanbrugh Theatre. The opening night was 1 September 1939, the day Hitler invaded Poland. After the play&#x27;s second performance its run was ended, as RADA shut down in anticipation that war was about to be declared; the following day the UK joined the war. Carmichael returned to his familial home and completed the forms to join the Officer Cadet Reserve, hoping to be commissioned as an officer. He helped gather the harvest in a nearby farm until 2 October, when he was attested into the army; he was told he would have to wait until he was twenty—on 18 June 1940—before he started training.

As the early months of the war were marked by limited military action, RADA reassessed its closure, and decided to reopen. Carmichael returned to London and shared lodgings with two fellow RADA students, Geoffrey Hibbert and Patrick Macnee; Carmichael and Macnee became lifelong friends. Between June and August 1940 Carmichael was on a ten-week tour of &quot;Nine Sharp&quot;, a revue developed by Herbert Farjeon. After the tour Carmichael reported for training on 12 September at Catterick Garrison. After ten weeks&#x27; basic training, he was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to become an officer cadet. He completed his training and passed out in March 1941 as a second lieutenant in the 22nd Dragoons, part of the Royal Armoured Corps.

At the end of training manoeuvres in November 1941, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, Carmichael was struggling to close the hatch of his Valentine tank when it slammed down, cutting off the top of a finger on his left hand. The surgery was botched and caused him pain for several months; he had a second operation several months later. He described it as &quot;dashed unfortunate&quot; and &quot;my one and only war-wound, albeit a self-inflicted one&quot;.

In between training for the liberation of France Carmichael began producing revues and productions as part of his brigade&#x27;s entertainment. On 16 June 1944, ten days after D-Day, Carmichael and his armoured reconnaissance troop landed in France. He fought through to Germany with the regiment and by the time of Victory in Europe Day in May 1945, he had been promoted to captain and mentioned in despatches.
Carmichael&#x27;s regiment was part of 30 Corps and an initial post-war challenge in Germany was the welfare of the occupying forces. The corps&#x27; commanding officer was Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, who ordered a repertory company to be formed for entertainment. When Carmichael auditioned he recognised the major in charge of the unit as Richard Stone, an actor who had been a contemporary at RADA; Carmichael was taken into the company and assisted Stone with auditioning other members. One of the comedians who auditioned was Frankie Howerd, whom Carmichael thought &quot;very gauche ... too undisciplined and not very funny either. Very much the amateur&quot;. Stone disagreed and signed the comic up to perform in a Royal Army Service Corps concert party. The corps&#x27; company was also joined by actors from Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA); Carmichael did not often appear on stage with them, but worked as the producer of twenty shows. In April 1946 Stone was promoted and was transferred to the UK; Carmichael was promoted to major and took control of the theatrical company. His leadership of the company was short-lived, as he was demobilised that July.

===Early post-war career, 1946–1955===
In July 1946 Carmichael signed with Stone, who had also been demobilised and had set up as a theatrical agent. Carmichael obtained his first post-war role in the revue &quot;Between Ourselves&quot; in mid-1946 before he appeared in two small roles in the comedy &quot;She Wanted a Cream Front Door&quot;— a hotel receptionist and a BBC reporter. The production went on a twelve-week tour round Britain from October 1946, and then ran at the Apollo Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, London, for four months.

Between 1947 and 1951 Carmichael appeared on stage in both plays and revues —the latter often at the Players&#x27; Theatre in Villiers Street, Charing Cross. He made his debut appearance on BBC television in 1947 in &quot;New Faces&quot;, a revue that also included Zoe Gail, Bill Fraser and Charles Hawtrey. From 1948 he also began appearing in films, including &quot;Bond Street&quot; (1948), &quot;Trottie True&quot; and &quot;Dear Mr. Prohack&quot; (both 1949); these early roles were minor parts and he was uncredited. He spent much of 1949 in a thirty-week tour of Britain with the operetta &quot;The Lilac Domino&quot;. According to Jennings, Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;first conspicuous success&quot; was &quot;The Lyric Revue&quot; in 1951; the production transferred to The Globe (now the Gielgud Theatre) as &quot;The Globe Revue&quot; in 1952. He received a positive review in the industry publication &quot;The Stage&quot;, which reported that he &quot;&quot; for his comic performance in one sketch, &quot;Bank Holiday&quot;, which involved him undressing on the beach under a mackintosh.

Carmichael spent the next three years appearing in stage revues and small roles in films. Although he enjoyed working in revues, he was concerned about being stuck in a career rut. In a 1954 interview in &quot;The Stage&quot;, he said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that managers and directors may think of me only as a revue artist, and much as I enjoy acting in sketches I feel there must be a limit to the number of characters one is able to create. What I would like now is to be offered a part in light comedy or a farce&quot;. Between November 1954 and May 1955 he appeared as David Prentice in the stage production of &quot;Simon and Laura&quot; alongside Roland Culver and Coral Browne at the Strand Theatre, London. The following year a film version was directed by Muriel Box; she asked Carmichael to repeat his role, while Browne and Culver&#x27;s roles were taken by Kay Kendall and Peter Finch. The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; thought Carmichael &quot;comes near to stealing the film from both of them&quot;. In 1955 Carmichael also appeared in &quot;The Colditz Story&quot;. He played Robin Cartwright, an officer in the Guards, and spent much of his screen time appearing with Richard Wattis; the two men provided an element of comic relief in the film, with what Fairclough describes as a &quot;Flanagan and Allen tribute act&quot;. &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; was Carmichael&#x27;s ninth film role and he had, Fairclough notes, risen to sixth in the credits behind John Mills and Eric Portman.

===Screen success, 1955–1962===

In 1955 Carmichael was contacted by the filmmaker twins the Boulting brothers. They wanted him to appear in two film versions of novels—&quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; by Alan Hackney and &quot;Brothers in Law&quot; by Henry Cecil—with an option for five films in all; the final contract was for a total of six films. The Boultings&#x27; first work with Carmichael was the 1956 film &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a satire on the British Army. The film opened in February 1956 and starred Carmichael, Richard Attenborough, Dennis Price and Terry-Thomas. The film historian Alan Boulton observed &quot;Reviews were decidedly mixed and the critical response did not match the popular enthusiasm for the film&quot;; it was either the second or third most popular film at the British box office that year. Carmichael received praise for his role, however, including from &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, which thought he &quot;fulfils his promise as a comedian&quot;; the reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; thought Carmichael acted &quot;with an unfailing tact and sympathy—he even manages to make a drunken scene seem rich in comedy&quot;. The film introduced American audiences to Carmichael, and his screen presence in the US was warmly received by reviewers. The reviewer Margaret Hinxman, writing in &quot;Picturegoer&quot;, considered that after &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; Carmichael had become &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s choicest screen exports&quot;.

From June to September 1956 Carmichael was involved in the filming of &quot;Brothers in Law&quot;, which was directed by Roy Boulting; others in the cast included Attenborough and Terry-Thomas. When the film was released in March 1957 Carmichael received positive reviews, including from Philip Oakes, the reviewer from &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, who concluded that Carmichael &quot;confirms his placing in my form book as our best light comedian&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; thought Carmichael was &quot;irrepressibly funny in his well-bred, well-intentioned, bewildered ineptitude&quot;.
In September 1957 Carmichael appeared in a third Boulting brothers film, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; in which he appeared alongside Terry-Thomas and Hugh Griffith in an adaptation of a 1954 novel by Kingsley Amis. Fairclough notes that while the film was not well received by the critics, Carmichael&#x27;s performance received great praise. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; considered that Carmichael, &quot;although in many ways excellent, has fewer chances than in &quot;Brothers-in-Law&quot; to delight us with those studies in agonised embarrassment in which he excels&quot;, while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reviewer considered &quot;[Carmichael&#x27;s] Jim, complete with North-Country accent and the ability to pull comic faces, might so easily have been the author&#x27;s creation brought to life off the page.&quot;

Carmichael then appeared in a fourth film with the Boultings, &quot;Happy Is the Bride&quot;, a lightweight comedy of manners released in March 1958 which also included Janette Scott, Cecil Parker, Terry-Thomas and Joyce Grenfell. Carmichael spent much of the end of 1957 and most of 1958 on stage with &quot;The Tunnel of Love&quot;. The journalist R. B. Marriott described it as a &quot;slightly crazy, wonderfully ridiculous comedy&quot;, and it had a five-week tour around the UK which preceded a run at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London, between December 1957 and August 1958. During the run, in April 1958, Carmichael was interviewed for &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; by Roy Plomley on the BBC Home Service.

Carmichael once again appeared as Stanley Windrush, the character he portrayed in &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot;, in his fifth film with the Boultings, &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, which was released in August 1959. Several other actors from &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; also reprised their roles: Price (as Bertram Tracepurcel); Attenborough (as Sidney De Vere Cox) and Terry-Thomas (as Major Hitchcock). A new character was introduced in the film, Peter Sellers as the trade union shop steward Fred Kite. The film was the highest-grossing at the British box office in 1960 and earned Sellers the award for Best British Actor at the 13th British Academy Film Awards. Although Sellers received most of the plaudits for the film, Carmichael was given good reviews for his role, with &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; saying he was &quot;in excellent fooling&quot; and &quot;delicious both at work and at play&quot;. In 1960 Carmichael appeared in &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;, based on Stephen Potter&#x27;s &quot;gamesmanship&quot; series of books. Appearing alongside him were Terry-Thomas, Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. The reviews for the film were not positive, but the actors were praised for their work in it.

The release of &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; was Carmichael&#x27;s tenth film in five years. Fairclough observes that during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Carmichael began to get a reputation among his colleagues as being difficult to work with. Eric Maschwitz, the BBC&#x27;s Head of Light Entertainment for Television, recorded in an internal memo that Carmichael had given &quot;great difficulty&quot; during negotiations, and concluded that &quot;his head seems to have been a little turned by his success&quot;. Some actors had to point out to him that he was &quot;doing a Carmichael&quot; whenever he tried to improve his billing, or upstage his fellow actors, including Derek Nimmo in 1962, during the filming of &quot;The Amorous Prawn&quot;. Despite the criticism, Carmichael described the period as &quot;I think the happiest five or six years of my whole career&quot;.

In December 1961 Carmichael was appearing in the comedy mystery play &quot;The Gazebo&quot; every evening and filming &quot;Double Bunk&quot; during the day. The mental and physical toll on him was too much, and he collapsed in the middle of a performance. The show&#x27;s producer, Harold Fielding, instructed Carmichael to take at least two week&#x27;s holiday to rest, and he paid for Carmichael and his wife to have a holiday in Switzerland. He returned to the show on 23 December, but he lost his voice during the Boxing Day show and could only complete Act 1. He returned to the show after a few days, but left permanently on 28 January 1962 on his doctor&#x27;s orders.

===Wooster and Wimsey, 1962–1979===

Tastes in film changed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the new wave of British films moving away from plots centred on the upper classes and the establishment, to works such as &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (both 1959), &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962), where working class drama came to the fore. One of the effects of the new movement was a downturn in the number of films that wanted a character like those normally played by Carmichael. He was still being offered some film roles, but all, he said, &quot;were variations on the same old bumbling, accident-prone clot&quot; with which he was becoming increasingly bored.

In August 1964 the BBC approached Carmichael to discuss the possibility of his taking the role of Bertie Wooster—described by Fairclough as &quot;the misadventuring, 1920s upper-class loafer&quot;—for adaptations of the works of P. G. Wodehouse. He turned it down, as he had agreed to appear on Broadway, taking the lead in a production of the farce &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot;. He appeared at the Cort Theatre in February 1965, but the run ended after 23 performances, as the farce was not to the taste of New York audiences. Carmichael was delighted by the early close, as he hated his time in the US and said &quot;I found New York a disturbing, violent city and I disliked it instantly&quot;. As soon as he heard the production was to close, he sent a telegram to the BBC to note his availability to play Wooster. Carmichael negotiated a fee of 500 guineas (£525) per half-hour episode, and assisted in finding the right person for Jeeves, eventually selecting Dennis Price.

The first series of &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; received the Guild of Television Producers and Directors award for best comedy series production of 1965, and the programme ran for three series, broadcast between May 1965 and November 1967, comprising twenty episodes in total. Reviews for Carmichael were positive, with a reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; declaring &quot;&quot;The World of Wooster&quot; is also a triumph of casting, for Ian Carmichael and Dennis Price are perfect impersonators of two characters who are by no means lay-figures ... They are a priceless pair.&quot; A different reviewer pointed out one drawback of the 44-year-old Carmichael&#x27;s performance: &quot;If we have thought of Bertie Wooster as eternally 22, not far in time from enjoyably wasted university days, Mr. Ian Carmichael opposes our view with a Bertie who is older but hopefully fixed in an inescapable mental youth.&quot; The best review, as far as Carmichael and the producer Michael Mills were concerned, was from Wodehouse, who sent a telegram to the BBC:

To the producer and cast of the Jeeves sketches.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you all for the perfectly wonderful performances. I am simply delighted with it. Bertie and Jeeves are just as I have always imagined them, and every part is played just right.&lt;br&gt;
Bless you!&lt;br&gt;
P. G. Wodehouse

Wodehouse later reconsidered his opinion and thought Carmichael overacted in the role. Only one of the episodes remains: the others were wiped to reuse the expensive videotape.

In September 1970 Carmichael was the lead role in &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, a sitcom loosely based on the true story of a single man who fostered twelve children. There were two series—one in 1970, one the following year—and a total of 22 episodes; he negotiated a salary of £1,500 per episode, making him the best-paid actor at the BBC. The media historian Mark Lewisohn thought that the programme, &quot;although ostensibly a middle-of-the-road family sitcom of no great ambition, came over as a polished and professional piece of work that pleased audiences over two extended series&quot;.

Carmichael was one of the driving forces behind the BBC&#x27;s decision to adapt Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s Lord Peter Wimsey stories for television. He first had the idea of appearing as Wimsey in 1966, but various factors—including financing, Carmichael&#x27;s association with Bertie Wooster in the public&#x27;s eye and difficulty obtaining the rights—delayed the project. By January 1971, however, they were able to start filming the first programme, &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot;, which was broadcast in 1972 in five parts. This was followed by &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot;, &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot;, &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; and &quot;The Five Red Herrings&quot; between February 1973 and August 1975. Richard Last, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; thought Carmichael was &quot;an inspired piece of casting. ... he has exactly the right outward touch of aristocratic frivolity but more than the ability to suggest the steel underneath&quot;. Clive James, reviewing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, described Carmichael as &quot;an extremely clever actor&quot;, and thought he was &quot;turning in one of those thespian efforts which seem easy at the time but which in retrospect are found to have been the ideal embodiment of the written character&quot;. Carmichael went on to play Wimsey on BBC Radio 4, recording nine adaptations with Peter Jones as Mervyn Bunter, Wimsey&#x27;s valet.

In 1979 Carmichael appeared in &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, which starred Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd; the film was a remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1938 film of the same name. Carmichael appeared as Caldicott alongside Arthur Lowe&#x27;s character Charters, two cricket-obsessed English gentlemen; the roles were played in the original by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford. The journalist Patrick Humphries, while describing the film as &quot;lamentable&quot;, thought that only Carmichael and Lowe &quot;emerge with any credibility&quot;. Carmichael was interviewed on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; for a second time in June 1979.

===Semi-retirement, 1979–2009===
In 1979 Carmichael published his autobiography &quot;Will the Real Ian Carmichael ...&quot;, which marked what Fairclough calls his &quot;semi-retirement&quot; in Yorkshire. He continued to work periodically, including providing the voice for Rat in the 1983 film &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and as the narrator for the television series of the same name between 1984 and 1990. He revisited the works of Wodehouse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, providing the voice of Galahad Threepwood for two radio productions, &quot;Pigs Have Wings&quot; and &quot;Galahad at Blandings&quot;.

In 1992 and 1993 he played Sir James Menzies in two series of &quot;Strathblair&quot;, a BBC family drama set in 1950 broadcast on Sunday evenings. He undertook his last stage role in June 1995, playing Sir Peter Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre. From 2003 he took his final role: that of T. J. Middleditch in the ITV hospital drama series &quot;The Royal&quot;. He continued filming with &quot;The Royal&quot; until 2009.

===Personal life===
In late March 1941, when Carmichael&#x27;s regiment was posted to Whitby he met &quot;Pym&quot;—Jean Pyman Maclean—who he described as &quot;blonde, just eighteen, five feet six, sensationally pretty and a beautiful dancer&quot;; he thought her personality was &quot;warm ... genuine. There was an innocence about her, an unsophistication that disarmed even the most worldly&quot;. The couple became engaged in May 1942 and married on 6 October 1943; they had two daughters, Lee (born in 1946) and Sally (born in 1949). Pym died of cancer in 1983.

In 1984 Carmichael recorded a series of short stories for the BBC; the programmes were produced by Kate Fenton. They began a relationship and she left the BBC in 1985 and moved in with him in the Esk Valley, near Whitby. They were married in July 1992. Carmichael enjoyed playing and watching cricket, and listed it as one of this interests in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;. He was a member of the Lord&#x27;s Taverners cricket charity from 1956 until October 1976, and would relax on film sets playing a casual game with other members of the cast and crew, a practice he was introduced to by the Boulting brothers. He was also a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

In 2003 Carmichael was appointed OBE for services to drama. He died on 5 February 2010 of a pulmonary embolism.

==Screen persona and technique==
Carmichael learned much of his technique from the thirty-week tour of &quot;The Lilac Domino&quot; he undertook in the late 1940s, where he appeared opposite the comic actor Leo Franklyn. Carmichael acknowledged the credit for his development as a light comic actor went &quot;in its entirety to the training, coaxing and encouragement of ... Franklyn&quot;, who &quot;showed me how to time my laughs and how to play an audience&quot;. Carmichael&#x27;s experience in revue helped when he worked in a dramatic play; his experience in getting a character across to an audience quickly in a short sketch showed him that &quot;it is very important to establish a comedy character as soon as possible. Your whole performance may depend on this being done&quot;.

Carmichael polished his performances through extensive rehearsals and training. The screenwriter Paul Dehn acknowledges the effort and discipline needed by Carmichael to achieve a polished feel to his act, describing how Carmichael would &quot;slave for hours to perfect one stumble on a stairway and, having got it, ... [would] make it seem effortless thereafter&quot;. Jennings considers much of Carmichael&#x27;s seemingly effortless light touch &quot;was built on a hugely disciplined and virtuosic technique&quot;. Carmichael&#x27;s choice of comedy was character-, rather than situation-based and when the film or play generated its atmosphere from normal, recognisable aspects of life. He selected his work projects carefully and became involved in the development and production side as closely as possible, or initiated the project himself.

The image he portrayed in many of his works was summarised by one obituarist as &quot;the affable, archetypal silly ass Englishman&quot; with a &quot;wide-eyed boyish grin, bemused courtesy and hapless, trusting manner&quot;. He became somewhat typecast with the character, but audiences liked him in the role, and &quot;he polished this persona with great care&quot;, according to his obituarist in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, even though he tired of playing the role so often. One of the attractions for the public was that he played his parts to get the audience&#x27;s sympathy for the character, but with a measure of dignity that viewers could relate to. During Carmichael&#x27;s semi-retirement, the Boulting brothers told him that they had not shown the range of his talents, and that &quot;perhaps they should not virtually have confined him to the playing of &quot;. When he took the role of Wimsey—the intelligent, cultured and effective investigator—the critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote that &quot;it was high time that Ian Carmichael was given the opportunity to look intelligent&quot;.

<text>Renan is an unincorporated community in the northeastern part of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, United States. It is included in the Danville, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area.
It is contained within the Staunton River Magisterial District, and is located on a crossroads between Straightstone, Mount Airy, and Hurt.

The community of Renan was named in the second half of the 19th century after Ernest Renan, French philosopher and theologian. The name of the community is pronounced with stress on the first syllable of the word, however. In the 1880s, the four-room Harmony Grove School served the area, which was then replaced by the brick Renan School. This was then closed and converted into a Virginia furniture factory.

A store served the community from 1901 until the 1980s.

<text>Roy Joseph Plunkett (June 26, 1910 – May 12, 1994) was an American chemist. He discovered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), better known as Teflon, in 1938.

==Personal life and education==
Plunkett was born in New Carlisle, Ohio and attended Newton High School in Pleasant Hill, Ohio.

In 1932, he graduated from Manchester University with a B.A. in chemistry. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1936 from Ohio State University for his work on &quot;The Mechanism of Carbohydrate Oxidation.&quot;

He married Dorothy Enola Detrick (1907 – 1984) on August 16, 1935 in Franklin, Ohio. Next, he married Lois Mary Koch (1925 – 1996) on May 14, 1965 in Arlington, Virginia.

Plunkett died of cancer on May 12, 1994, at his Texas home at the age of 83. 

==Career==
In 1936, he was hired as a research chemist by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company at its Jackson Laboratory in Deepwater, New Jersey.

In 1938, while attempting to make a new chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, Plunkett&#x27;s laboratory team discovered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), better known as Teflon. In New York City in April 1986, Plunkett shared the story of his accidental discovery at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society national meeting in the History of Chemistry section. Hi story was published in the Symposium Proceedings:

On the morning of April 6, 1938, Jack Rebok, my assistant, selected one of the TFE cylinders that we had been using the previous day and set up the apparatus ready to go. When he opened the valve — to let the TFE gas flow under its own pressure from the cylinder — nothing happened...We were in a quandary. I couldn&#x27;t think of anything else to do under the circumstances, so we unscrewed the valve from the cylinder. By this time it was pretty clear that there wasn&#x27;t any gas left. I carefully tipped the cylinder upside down, and out came a whitish powder down onto the lab bench. We scraped around some with the wire inside the cylinder...to get some more of the powder. What I got out that way certainly didn&#x27;t add up, so I knew there must be more, inside. Finally...we decided to cut open the cylinder. When we did, we found more of the powder packed onto the bottom and lower sides of the cylinder.

The tetrafluoroethylene in the container had polymerized into polytetrafluoroethylene, a waxy solid with that was found to have had properties such as resistance to corrosion, low surface friction, and high heat resistance. 

Later in his career, Plunkett was the chief chemist involved in the production of tetraethyllead, an antiknock agent that made gasoline &quot;leaded,&quot; later discontinued over concerns about the toxic effects of lead. After that, he directed the production of Freon, DuPont&#x27;s brand name for chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant. He retired in 1975.

==Awards==
In 1951, Plunkett received the John Scott Medal from the city of Philadelphia for an invention promoting the &quot;comfort, welfare, and happiness of humankind&quot;. Attendees were given a Teflon-coated muffin tin to take home. Other awards and honors followed. Plunkett was inducted into the Plastics Hall of Fame in 1973 and the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1985.

<text>Friedrich Emil Welti known as Emil Welti (23 April 1825 – 24 February 1899) was a Swiss politician, lawyer and judge. From 1856 to 1866, he was a member of the government of the canton of Aargau and, beginning in 1857, the Council of States. In 1867, Welti was elected to the Bundesrat as a representative of the liberal-radical faction (today&#x27;s FDP).

Welti was elected Federal President six times, a total exceeded only by Karl Schenk. He is remembered for unifying the army, overhauling the Federal Constitution of 1874, and opening political doors for the Gotthard Railway.

== Early life ==
Welti was the eldest of nine children. He was born to a distinguished political family. His father, Jakob Welti, was a parish councilor and chief justice of Zurzach. His grandfather Abraham Welti belonged to both the National Assembly of the Helvetic Republic and the Consulta. After attending community and secondary school in Zurzach, Welti attended the Kantonsschule Aarau from 1840 to 1844, where he achieved top of his class and belonged to KTV fraternity. From 1844 to 1847, he studied law along with his school friend Samuel Wildi at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena as well as the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. He was taught by Adolf Rudorff, Georg Friedrich Puchta, and Friedrich Schelling.

At his father&#x27;s request, Welti renounced an academic career and instead pursued law. In 1847, he took part in the Sonderbundskrieg as actuary of the commission of inquiry against the war council of the Sonderbundes. From 1852 to 1856, he was president of Zurzach district court. 

== Career ==
=== Cantonal and federal politics ===
In 1856, Welti was elected to the Grand Council of the Canton of Aargau and to the government council. During his first term, he was head of the Justice Department. He introduced a new Criminal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and the construction of Lenzburg prison. From 1862 to 1866, he stood ran Education Department and created a new school law. His demands for civil marriage and full legal equality for Jews were not initially accepted. In the years 1858, 1862 and 1866, he was Landammann.

In 1857, the Great Council elected Welti to the Council of States and confirmed it annually until 1866. He immediately took a leading role and commented on issues such as the trade agreement with France and a railway line through the Alps. In the years 1860 and 1866, he was a Council President. In 1860, the Federal Council sent him to Geneva as Federal Commissioner to mediate during the Savoy trade talks. Geneva gave him honorary citizenship. In 1864 he again intervened in Geneva when trouble followed the State Council elections riots. In 1866, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Zurich, and in 1867, honorary citizenship of the city of Aarau.

=== Federal Council ===
In the Federal Council elections in 1863, Welti lost to the incumbent Friedrich Frey-Herosé. After the latter retired at the end of 1866, Welti became a promising candidate. He received support from the left wing as a supporter of a centralized state. Representatives of the industry around &quot;railway king&quot; Alfred Escher backed him as a staunch supporter of the Gotthard railway. In the election of the fifth member of the government on 8 December 1866 Welti received in the first ballot 103 of 159 valid votes, taking office on 1 January 1867.

From the beginning, Welti was one of the most influential figures in the state executive. During his 24-year tenure he represented four different departments: Military Department (1867–68, 1870–71, 1873–75), Political Department (1869, 1872, 1876, 1880, 1884), Post and Railway Department (1877–79, 1882–83, 1885–91) and Justice and Police Department (1881). In the years 1869, 1872, 1876, 1880, 1884 and 1891 he was Federal President. Because of his appearance and his German-friendly attitude, he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Swiss Bismarck &quot;.

As Secretary of Defense, Welti pushed for the merger of the individual cantonal armies into a national army. The necessity became especially evident after the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, when the army&#x27;s weakness was revealed and conflicts of competence with General Hans Herzog. In the debate on the revision of the Federal Constitution, Welti represented a centralist position. However, the constitutional draft of 1872, which was decisively influenced by him, narrowly failed referendum earning 50.5% no votes. He had to accept federalist compromises, but he was able to enforce his most important concern, the unification of law, in the final constitution of 1874. He kept himself largely out of the Kulturkampf and took a mediating role.

Railroad policy was another focus. When asked whether the planned Alpine railway should lead through the Gotthard or the Splügen, he could not intervene directly as a representative of the federal government, as the railway was a matter for the cantons and private companies. In negotiations, however, he was able to convince Italy and the German Reich to support the Gotthard project and to subsidize it. He guaranteed the federal government a right of supervision and codetermination, since he did not want to leave this project of national importance to the private sector alone. In 1878, when the company threatened to fail due to increasing costs, it was able to supply additional subsidies in parliament despite fierce opposition.

For the first time in 1862, the repurchase of private railways by the federal government became the subject of debate, but succumbed to the resistance of the circles around Alfred Escher. The situation changed with the railway crisis in the late 1870s. In 1883, the Confederation could finally have asserted its right of repurchase, but because of the overvaluation of its assets, the price would have been too high. Welti put the financial management of the railway companies under federal supervision. After negotiations with the Nordostbahn had failed, the federal government was able to take over in 1890 a large share of the Jura-Simplon-Bahn.

=== Resignation ===
In 1891, Welti was able to conclude a repurchase agreement with the Centralbahn, which was approved by Parliament. A referendum came about, and on 6 December 1891 the repurchase agreement was rejected by a two-thirds majority. The same day, Welti announced his retirement for the end of the year. Parliament tried to dissuade him but accepted his resignation on 17 December. In 1898 his successor Josef Zemp nationalized the most important private railways. Another reason for Welti&#x27;s resignation may have been the family tragedy involving daughter-in-law Lydia Welti-Escher, who took her own life on December 12 after she was locked up in a Roman madhouse the year before.

In politics, Welti accepted no more tasks. On behalf of the Federal Council, however, he worked in trade and railway matters. He devoted himself to scientific studies and occasionally taught at the Municipal Gymnasium in Bern. At the age of 73, he died of concussion and pneumonia.

During his time in office he held the following departments:
*Military Department (1867–1868)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1869)
*Military Department (1870–1871)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1872)
*Military Department (1873–1875)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1876)
*Department of Posts and Telegraph (1877–1878)
*Department of Posts and Railways (1879)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1880)
*Department of Justice and Police (1881)
*Department of Posts and Railways (1882–1883)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1884)
*Department of Posts and Railways (1885–1891)

He was President of the Confederation six times, in 1869, 1872, 1876, 1880, 1884 and 1891.

== Personal life ==
In 1853, he married Carolina Gross. The couple had two children, Louise Mathilde and Friedrich Emil Welti, the latter of whom married Alfred Escher&#x27;s daughter Lydia Escher.

The 2013.Swiss &quot;Alfred Escher and Stefano Franscini - Battle for the Gotthard&quot; four-part documentary mentioned him
