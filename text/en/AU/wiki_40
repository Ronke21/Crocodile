<text>San Marcos () is a city and the county seat of Hays County, Texas, United States. The city is a part of the Greater Austin Metropolitan Area. San Marcos&#x27;s limits extend into Caldwell and Guadalupe counties, as well. San Marcos is on the Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio. Its population was 44,894 at the 2010 census and 67,553 at the 2020 census.
Founded on the banks of the San Marcos River, the area is thought to be among the oldest continuously inhabited sites in the Americas. San Marcos is home to Texas State University and the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment.

In 2010, San Marcos was listed in &quot;Business Week&quot;s fourth annual survey of the &quot;Best Places to Raise your Kids&quot;. In 2013 and 2014, the United States Census Bureau named it the fastest-growing city in the United States. In December 2013, it was named number nine on &quot;Business Insider&quot;s list of the &quot;10 Most Exciting Small Cities In America&quot;.

==History==
Archeologists have found evidence at the San Marcos River associated with the Clovis culture, which suggests that the river has been the site of human habitation for more than 10,000 years. The San Marcos Springs are the third-largest collection of springs in Texas. Never in recorded history has the river run dry.

In 1689, Spaniard Alonso de León led an expedition from Mexico to explore Texas and establish missions and presidios in the region. De León&#x27;s party helped blaze the &quot;Camino Real&quot; (later known as the Old San Antonio Road), which followed present-day Hunter Road, Hopkins Street, and Aquarena Springs Drive (the route later shifted four miles to the south; it is now followed by County Road 266, known locally as Old Bastrop Highway). De León&#x27;s party reached the river on April 25, the feast day of St. Mark the Evangelist; the river was thus named the San Marcos.

In 1803, after the Louisiana purchase, the Spanish government in Mexico became concerned about American citizens moving into Texas. Officials decided to establish more Spanish settlements between San Antonio de Béxar and Nacogdoches in an effort to secure Spanish presence in the area. The governor of the province of Texas, Manuel Antonio Cordero y Bustamante, approached his friend Felipe Roque de la Portilla to organize and oversee the venture. In 1807, after extracting promises from Cordero that he would receive a substantial land grant and that the government would assist the settlers financially, Portilla headed for Texas with a small group of settlers. The exact number has been disputed; some suggest that only ten persons were in the original group, while other sources say the number was as high as fifty-two. There is also some conflict in records as to whether Portilla&#x27;s family was in the original group or whether they arrived in the fall of 1808. Most sources agree the group arrived at the San Marcos River on January 6, 1808. In April Governor Cordero issued the official order that established San Marcos de Neve, and his military representative, Juan Ygnacio de Arrambide, issued thirteen titles to town lots. Disaster struck the settlers in June, when a flood washed them out of their homes. Throughout the summer and fall the settlers rebuilt their town. In letters to government officials, Portilla reported that he left the colony in September 1808 to get more settlers and returned with six new families in late October. While there are no other records to confirm the increase, Portilla&#x27;s census of 1809 did show a total of seventy-three persons and 1,771 animals. Over the next three years, the settlers made a valiant effort to maintain their new homes, but frequent Indian raids and the failure of the government to send soldiers for protection forced them to abandon the settlement in 1812.. The settlers were plagued by floods and Indian raids, and the settlement was abandoned in 1812.

In November 1846, the first Anglo-American settlers moved into the vicinity of the San Marcos Springs. The Texas Legislature organized Hays County on March 1, 1848, and designated San Marcos as the county seat. In 1851, a town center was laid out about a mile southwest of the headwaters of the river. The town became a center for ginning and milling local agricultural products. The town&#x27;s most notable founder and early settler was Gen. Edward Burleson, a hero of the Texas Revolution and former vice president of the Republic of Texas. Burleson built a dam on the upper reaches of the river in 1849. The dam powered several mills, including one within present-day Sewell Park.
In the decade following the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad on September 30, 1880, cattle and cotton provided the basis for the growth of San Marcos as a center for commerce and transportation.

In 1866, the Coronal Institute was established as an early private high school. In 1899, Southwest Texas State Normal School (now known as Texas State University) was established as a teacher&#x27;s college to meet demand for public school teachers in Texas. In 1907, the San Marcos Baptist Academy was established, furthering education as an important industry for the town. The demands of World War II forced the town&#x27;s industry to diversify, and with the emergence of a manufacturing and light industrial sector, the town began to experience growth.

In the late 1940s, former Hollywood director Shadrack Graham produced a documentary about daily life in San Marcos as part of his &quot;Our Hometown&quot; series of films that encouraged commerce and civic activity in small communities. The film highlights several local businesses from the era, including Smith&#x27;s Flowers, Waldrin&#x27;s Cleaners, Lack&#x27;s Furniture, and the Palace Movie Theater.

Gary Air Force Base, just east of town, was opened in 1942 as San Marcos Army Airfield, renamed San Marcos Air Force Base in 1947, and renamed finally in 1953 in honor of Lieutenant Arthur Edward Gary, killed at Clark Field in the Philippines on December 7, 1941, the first San Martian to die in World War II. During the war, the base trained over 10,000 navigators, and in the following years was the largest center of Air Force and Army helicopter training for pilots and mechanics in the United States, with 21 squadrons and 4800 personnel stationed there. The base was handed over to the Army in 1956, renamed Camp Gary, and was closed in 1963. Subsequently, part of the base was taken over by the city for use as San Marcos Airport, while another part was reopened in 1966 as the Gary Job Corps Center.

In the 1960s, with the establishment of Aquarena Springs and Wonder World as attractions, the tourist industry became a growing part of the city&#x27;s economy. By the 1960s, what was then named Southwest Texas State University had grown into an important regional institution, and when coupled with the creation of Gary Job Corps Training Center in 1965, education became the largest industry in San Marcos. The remarkable growth explosion of Austin further allowed San Marcos to prosper.

By 1973, San Marcos and Hays County were included by the U. S. Census Bureau in the Austin metropolitan statistical area. By that year, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 25,000 citizens, along with an additional Southwest Texas State University student body of 20,000.

By 1990, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 28,743, by 2000, it reached 34,733, and by 2010, it was 44,894. A report, released by the U.S. Census Bureau in May 2013, stated that San Marcos had the highest rate of growth among all U.S. cities and towns with at least 50,000 people. Its population rose 6.9% between 2011 and 2012. The university, now known as Texas State University, boasts a student body of 34,225.

In 1991, protestors advocating for legalization of marijuana conducted a civil disobedience action and were arrested; they became known as the San Marcos Seven.

<text>Baytown is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, within Harris and Chambers counties. Located in the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan statistical area, it lies on the northern side of the Galveston Bay complex near the outlets of the San Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou. It is the sixth-largest city within this metropolitan area and seventh largest community (including The Woodlands CDP). Major highways serving the city include State Highway 99, State Highway 146 and Interstate 10. At the 2020 U.S. census, Baytown had a population of 83,701, and it had an estimated population of 84,324 in 2022.

== History ==
White American settlers first arrived in the now-Baytown area in 1822. One of its earliest settlers was Nathaniel Lynch, who set up a ferry crossing at the junction of the San Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou. The still-operating ferry service is known as the Lynchburg Ferry. Other early settlers of Baytown included William Scott, one of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s Old Three Hundred, and Ashbel Smith, who owned a plantation in the area.

The city now known as Baytown was originally three separate towns. The first of these was Goose Creek, named for the bayou of the same name where Canada geese wintered and whose name is still reflected in the area&#x27;s Goose Creek school district, whose establishment dates back to before 1850. With the discovery of the Goose Creek Oil Field, the rival communities of Pelly in the late 1910s, and East Baytown in the early 1920s, developed as early boomtowns. The &quot;East&quot; in East Baytown was later dropped because it was west of Goose Creek.

Serious talk of merging the three cities began shortly after World War I, but the community of Baytown was opposed to this idea. However, in 1947, the three cities finally agreed to consolidate. The citizens settled on the name Baytown for the new combined city. Baytown as it is known today was officially founded January 24, 1948.

In 1916, the Humble Oil and Refining Company, founded by one-time Texas governor Ross S. Sterling and his associates, in developing the Goose Creek Oil Field, built the first offshore drilling operation in Texas and the second in the United States. The company later built the Baytown Refinery, which would become one of the largest Exxon refineries in the world. Since then, many other refineries have been built in the area. Exxon-Mobil is still one of the major employers in the city and now runs over 10 plants in the area including a newly announced 2 billion dollar expansion to its chemical facilities in 2019.

Following the discovery of oil nearby, the population of Baytown and the tri-cities boomed. Many immigrants arrived in Baytown, among them a number of Jewish families who founded a synagogue, K’nesseth Israel, in 1930.

Steel manufacturing in Baytown began in 1970 when United States Steel opened the Texas Works near the city. The plant was officially closed in July 1986, due to a poor economic climate and the decline of American steel in the 1980s. The mill was later purchased by Jindal Steel and now operates as JSW Steel USA, Inc.

== Geography ==
The city of Baytown is located at the mouth of the San Jacinto River on Galveston Bay, by road east of Houston. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , 2.92%, is covered by water.

Baytown is located on the Gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and marshes. The municipalities have been built on reclaimed marshes, swamps, and prairies, which are all still visible in undeveloped parts of the Galveston Bay area. Baytown is bordered by water on three sides. Along the south and west is Galveston Bay. On the east is Cedar Bayou. The city is roughly bordered along the north by Interstate 10. Portions of the city to the east of Cedar Bayou lie in Chambers County.

Flatness of the local terrain and proximity to the bay have made flooding a recurring problem for the area. Baytown and surrounding communities once relied on groundwater for its needs, but severe land subsidence has forced much the city to turn to ground-level water sources.

=== Geology ===
The land beneath Baytown consists of layers of sand and clay to great depths. These layers were created by millennia of river-borne sediments which gradually incorporated plant and animal matter, creating the petroleum deposits for which the Gulf Coast is now known.

The region around the city has numerous faults, many considered active, but none have produced significant earthquakes in recorded history. These faults tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed &quot;fault creep&quot;, which reduces the risk of an earthquake. The one significant earthquake that has been reported in the area was the result of an underground water and petroleum extraction.

=== Climate ===
Baytown&#x27;s climate is classified as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot; in Köppen climate classification system). Spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes create tornadoes (but not to the extent found in tornado alley). Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring heat from the deserts of Mexico and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.

Summer temperatures typically have highs near though higher temperatures are not uncommon. The city&#x27;s proximity to the bay and the winds that it generates moderate the area&#x27;s temperatures and ease the effects of the humidity, creating a more pleasant climate than inland communities like Houston. Winters in the area are temperate with typical January high of and lows are near . Snowfall is rare. Baytown’s annual rainfall averages are around or exceed , making it one of the wetter cities of the lower 48.

Excessive ozone levels can occur due to industrial activities; nearby Houston is ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. The industries located along the ship channel and the bay are a major cause of the pollution.

Hurricanes are a substantial concern during the fall season. Though Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula provide some shielding, Baytown still faces more danger than Houston and other inland communities, particularly because of storm surge, as well as severe land subsidence in some low-lying areas of town due to excess pumping of groundwater in the 1960s (see Brownwood subdivision) by area refineries and municipalities. Hurricanes Carla (1961), Alicia (1983), Ike (2008), and Harvey (2017) were the four most damaging hurricanes to affect Baytown.

<doc id="151128" wikidata="Q981185" url="?curid=151128" title="Mont Belvieu, Texas">
<text>Mont Belvieu is a city in Chambers County in the U.S. state of Texas. It is just north of Interstate 10 along State Highway 146. The population is currently 11,922 and was 7,654 at the 2020 census, an increase of nearly 100% from 3,835 in 2010. It is the site of the largest underground storage facility for liquefied petroleum gas in the US. The US LPG market pricing indicator is driven primarily by the Mont Belvieu market, and reported daily by the US Energy Administration.

==Geography==

Mont Belvieu is located in northwestern Chambers County at (29.860242, –94.874535). A small part of the city limits extend north into Liberty County. The city is northeast of Baytown via Highway 146 and east of Houston via Interstate 10.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Mont Belvieu has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.14%, is water.

The city is along Interstate 10 and is east of Downtown Houston.

==Historical development==
The first permanent settlers to the area were Henry Griffith and his wife, Amelia Barrow, both from the Louisiana area. Henry was a cattle rancher, and at one time all of Mont Belvieu was used as pasture land for their cattle. Amos Barber became the second settler, and other settlers followed. After years of owning all of the land Griffith sold the deed to the land known today as Mont Belvieu. Henry Griffith died and was buried with no grave marker; Amelia soon followed. A memorial has been erected at the site of an old oak tree, and there is a rumor that Amelia was buried just down the hill from where their house once stood,(which now borders the Enterprise Products gas storage facility).

Growth of local industries soon proved a mixed blessing. Serious pipeline and petrochemical plant accidents happened in 1960, 1964, and 1965. A 1985 explosion at one of the plants threatened the entire salt dome on which the city was built, which had in recent years been used to store liquid petroleum gas, and led to a series of efforts by townspeople to force the petrochemical industries to buy out the homes in the immediate vicinity of their plants. By 1990 some 200 families had been bought out by a dozen petrochemical corporations. With the aid of these local industries the community was rebuilt two miles east of its 1985 location. Among the buildings at the new site were a city hall, several new churches, and the relocated Barbers Hill ISD schools. This area (Eagle Drive) is now the central core of Mont Belvieu&#x27;s residential area hosting multiple subdivisions and many &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; stores. Another core was developed south of the original city along Texas State Highway 146 north of Interstate 10; this core is based mostly on commercial services for Interstate 10 travelers hosting multiple hotels, fast food restaurants, and gas stations. The two cores are connected by the city&#x27;s old location (now dubbed &quot;the hill&quot;) which consists mostly of petrochemical company offices and cement slabs of the old city.

==Economy==
In 2019 Dwight Silverman of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; described Mont Belvieu as &quot;a fairly affluent city&quot; due to its taxes on the various area industrial plants. In addition it is at the junction of various oil and natural gas pipelines numbering in the hundreds.

==Government and infrastructure==
By 2019, Mont Belvieu began offering a municipal broadband internet service, MB Link, as home rule cities in Texas are permitted to establish municipal internet. Mont Belvieu won a court agreement in 2017 that internet is a utility, like electricity and water. Mont Belvieu chose this path because it was unable to persuade private telecommunications companies to expand or add new infrastructure for internet purposes, even after the city government offered to have the cables laid.

The United States Postal Service operates the Mont Belvieu Post Office at 16043 Eagle Drive, 77580-9700.

==Education==
The portion of Mont Belvieu in Chambers County is served by the Barbers Hill Independent School District. The portion in Liberty County is zoned to Dayton Independent School District.

The Sam and Carmena Goss Memorial Branch Library in Mont Belvieu is a branch of the Chambers County Library System. They are located at 1 John Hall Drive, Mont Belvieu, Texas 77523.

Residents of Barbers Hill ISD and Dayton ISD are zoned to Lee College.

<text>Seabrook is a city in Harris County, Texas, United States, with some water surface area located within Chambers County. The population was 13,618 at the 2020 U.S. census. Several fish markets line the city&#x27;s waterfront, while antique shops and bed and breakfast establishments are found in the city&#x27;s downtown area.

==History==

Seabrook is known for its fish markets on Waterfront Drive where resident shrimpers and fishermen bring in their catches daily. Besides bordering the bay, the city encompasses marshes through which runoff from inland fields drain to the bay. The piece of land was purchased by Seabrook W. Sydnor, who was the son of Galveston mayor and slave trader John Seabrook Sydnor, in 1895. In March 1903, the Seabrook Company of Houston created a layout of the proposed Seabrook Town site. The new town attracted fishermen, merchants and even a few residents.

The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 demolished the local school, but by 1905 it was restored and was run by three teachers who taught 100 students. The local schools became part of the Clear Creek Independent School District in 1947. The population of Seabrook rose from 200 to 560 before the Great Depression, but fell to 200 in 1936, and remained at 400 from 1940 until 1947, when the Albert and Ernest Fay shipyard opened. It could handle 150 boats, and opened up jobs and is the main cause of the population increase. Despite damage from Hurricane Carla, a bridge linking Seabrook and Kemah was completed in 1961. With the opening of the bridge and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Seabrook&#x27;s population rose to approximately 6,000.

In 1986, the decision was made to start the construction of a fixed-span bridge that was tall enough for sailboats to pass under. After this bridge was finished, Highway 146 was linked all the way from Galveston to Texas State Highway 225. This spurred a further increase in the population of Seabrook to its present level of nearly 12,000 people.

All Seabrook residents are zoned to Seabrook Intermediate School (Seabrook). Seabrook Intermediate also houses the Science Magnet Program, which offers an enriched Science curriculum with many outside science activities. This program is an application-process program and the students accepted are gifted in the field of science. Seabrook Intermediate also houses the Living Materials Center, which is the home for over 60 species of animals. The Living Materials Center is available to all students in the school and throughout the district.

All Seabrook residents are zoned to Clear Falls High School in League City. Residents were previously zoned to Clear Lake High School in Clear Lake City, Houston.

===Colleges and universities===

==Infrastructure and services==
The Harris County Public Library Evelyn Meador Branch serves the community. The library opened on June 26, 1988. The original planning of the library started in 1985 when five Seabrook residents met Harris County Commissioner Jim Fonteno.

===Damage from Hurricane Ike===

The city of Seabrook was under mandatory evacuation for Hurricane Ike on the morning of September 13, 2008. Hurricane Ike was the 3rd most destructive hurricane to hit the United States. In Seabrook, the storm surge not only knocked out the streets as a means of transportation, but also knocked the power out for the entire city, along with many others. Because Seabrook is surrounded by water, the aftermath of debris and boats on the roads was phenomenal from all of the boat docks close to shore. Seabrook residents were left without power and running water for up to a month after Hurricane Ike made landfall.

A month after the hurricane, Seabrook was still dealing with people not being able to live in the conditions, even after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) came. The students zoned to schools in the Clear Creek Independent School District (which are all the residents in Seabrook) missed almost three weeks of school due to the evacuation and the damage to buildings and roads in the Seabrook and surrounding areas.

==Sister cities==

On June 19, 2002 the cities of Seabrook and Isla Santa Cruz, Ecuador finalized a sister city status during a ceremony at Seabrook City Hall. As part of the agreements the City of Seabrook planned to build a $500,000 ($733,024 adjusted for inflation ), Ecuador visitors&#x27; center, which was to include a museum, a multimedia cultural center, and retail shops. Ecuador stated that it had secured $450,000 of the funds as of January 1, 2004. In May 2004 the city asked for an additional $150,000 in private funding and stated that the center may not be built if it does not get this funding.

<text>Texas City is a city in Galveston County, Texas, United States, on the southwest shoreline of Galveston Bay. Texas City is a deepwater port on Texas&#x27;s Gulf Coast, as well as a petroleum-refining and petrochemical-manufacturing center. The population was 51,898 at the 2020 census, making it the third-largest city in Galveston County, behind League City and Galveston. It is a part of the Houston metropolitan area. It is notable as the site of a major explosion in 1947 that demolished the port and much of the city.

==History==


Three duck hunters in 1891 noted that a location along Galveston Bay, known locally as Shoal Point, had the potential to become a major port. Shoal Point had existed since the 1830s, when veterans of the Texas Revolution (1835–1836) were awarded land for their services. The name was applied to the community when a post office opened in 1878. The duck hunters were three brothers from Duluth, Minnesota, named Benjamin, Henry, and Jacob Myers. After they returned to Duluth, they formed the Myers Brothers syndicate, convinced other investors to put up money to buy of Galveston Bay frontage, including Shoal Point. They renamed the area Texas City.

===Founding===
By 1893, the investors had formed the Texas City Improvement Company (TCIC), which plotted and filed the townsite plan. A post office opened in 1893 with Frank B. Davison appointed as the town&#x27;s first postmaster, to serve about 250 people who had moved there from Minnesota and Michigan. TCIC also received permission from the federal government to dredge an eight-foot channel in the bay from Bolivar Roads (at the east end of Galveston Island) to serve Texas City. In 1894, the channel was first used commercially. TCIC eventually dredged the channel to a 40-foot depth and extended the length of the port to 1.5 mi. TCIC also built a 4-mi railroad to the Texas City Junction south of town, where it connected to two other rail lines: Galveston, Houston and San Antonio and Galveston-Houston and Henderson.

Despite these successes, the TCIC went bankrupt in 1897. Its assets were reorganized into two new companies: Texas City Company (TCC), and Texas City Railway Terminal Company (TCRTC). TCC acquired 3,000 city lots and provided water, gas, and electricity to the town. TCRTC operated the railroad. These companies were chartered on February 4, 1899.

A grid of streets and avenues was laid out during the 1890s, and houses and other structures began to appear. The Davison Home, where the first childbirth in the town took place, was constructed between 1895 and 1897. As the TCIC, the TCC, and TCRTC expanded, urbanization expanded.

Permission was granted in the summer of 1900 to dredge the Texas City channel to a depth of 25 ft. The disastrous Galveston Hurricane of 1900 interrupted the project, washing the dredge ashore. However, the Texas City port remained open after the storm passed. Even before the channel dredging was complete, the first ocean-going ship, SS &quot;Piqua&quot;, arrived at the port from Mexico on September 28, 1904. Dredging was completed March 19, 1905, when the US government opened a customs house in Texas City. Port growth progressed rapidly after this, from 12 ships in 1904, to 239 in 1910.

Texas City Refining Company was chartered in 1908 to build a refinery adjacent to the port facility. For several years, it was the only Texas refinery capable of producing the byproducts wax and lubricating oil. This facility was later acquired and expanded by Texas oilman Sid Richardson. Three more refineries soon followed, making Texas City a major port for deepwater shipping of Texas petroleum products to the Atlantic Coast.

Texas City incorporated in 1911 with a mayor and commission form of government. It held its first mayoral election on September 16, choosing William P. Tarpey as mayor.

The 2nd Division of the United States Army deployed to Texas City in 1913 to guard the Gulf Coast from incursions during the Mexican Revolution, essentially encamping nearly half of the nation&#x27;s land military personnel there, due to the perceived double threat that the Mexican Revolution might spill over across the border or that the neighboring country might become a German ally in the incipient World War.

The military deployment also included the 1st Aero Division, and the Wright brothers trained over a dozen soldiers as military pilots, essentially turning Texas City into the birthplace of what became the United States Air Force, as the city claims at its monument of the birthplace of the Air Force at Bay Street City Park. Speed and distance records were set by pilots trained and planes flying out of Texas City&#x27;s impromptu military air base.

An August 1915 hurricane completely demolished the encampment. Nine soldiers were killed. Military leaders promptly moved the camp to San Antonio.

In 1921, the Texas City Railway Terminal Company took over operations of the port facilities. Hugh B. Moore was named president of the company and began an ambitious program of expansions. He was credited with attracting a sugar refinery, a fig processing plant, a gasoline cracking plant, and a grain elevator. Also, more warehouses and tank farms were built to support this growth. By 1925, Texas City had an estimated population of 3,500 and was a thriving community with two refineries producing gasoline, the Texas City Sugar Refinery, two cotton compressing facilities, and even passenger bus service.

The Great Depression and competition caused the sugar refinery to fail in 1930. Economic hard times afflicted the city for a few years until the oil business returned to expansion. Republic Oil Refinery opened a gasoline refinery in 1931. In 1934, Pan American Refinery (a subsidiary of Standard Oil Company of Indiana) began operating. Moore was able to win this refinery from the Houston Ship Channel because of Texas City&#x27;s location nearer the Gulf of Mexico. By the end of the 1930s, Texas City&#x27;s population had grown to 5,200.

Seatrain Lines constructed a terminal at the Texas City port during 1939–1940. This was a specialized company that owned ships designed to carry railroad cars from Texas City to New York City on a weekly schedule. By 1940, Texas City was the fourth-ranked Texas port, exceeded only by Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur.

===Texas City Dike===
Texas City is home to the Texas City Dike, a man-made breakwater built of tumbled granite blocks in the 1930s, that was originally designed to protect the lower Houston Ship Channel from silting. The dike, famous among locals as being &quot;the world&#x27;s longest man-made fishing pier&quot;, extends roughly to the southeast into the mouth of Galveston Bay.

===World War II impact===
Prosperity and industrial expansion returned as the United States became more involved in World War II. Enemy submarines had almost completely stopped the shipment of petroleum products to friendly countries from the Middle East, South America, and Southeast Asia. Texas City refineries and chemical plants worked around the clock at full capacity to supply the war effort. Realizing that all of the world&#x27;s tin smelters could no longer supply the US demand, Jesse H. Jones, head of the Defense Plant Corporation, decided to build the Texas City tin smelter. The government also funded construction of a petrochemical plant to make styrene monomer, a vital raw material for synthetic rubber. Monsanto Chemical Company contracted to operate the facility, which became the nucleus of an even larger petrochemical complex after the war. By 1950, the local population had reached 16,620.

===1947 Texas City disaster===
The postwar prosperity was interrupted on the morning of April 16, 1947, when the French ship &quot;Grandcamp&quot;, containing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, exploded, initiating what is generally regarded as the worst industrial accident in United States history, the Texas City disaster. The fertilizer manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa was already overheating when stored at the Texas City docks. The blast devastated the Monsanto plant and offices, which were immediately across the slip from the &quot;Grandcamp&quot;, blew away the warehouses, showered shrapnel from the ship in all directions, and ignited a second ship, the S.S.&quot;High Flyer&quot;, docked at an adjacent slip. Released from its mooring by the blast, the &quot;High Flyer&quot; rammed a third ship, SS &quot;Wilson B. Keene&quot;, docked across the slip. Both ships also carried ammonium nitrate fertilizer and were ablaze. They, too, exploded. In all, the explosions killed 581 and injured over 5,000 people. The explosions were so powerful and intense that many of the bodies of the emergency workers who responded to the initial explosion were never accounted for. The entire Texas City and Port Terminal Fire departments were wiped out.

The steel-reinforced concrete grain elevator was pockmarked with shrapnel and the drive shaft of the &quot;Grandcamp&quot; was embedded in the headhouse. The ship&#x27;s anchor was hurled several miles away, where it was discovered embedded in the ground at the PanAmerican refinery. School children and townspeople who were attracted to the smoke also died, and entire blocks of homes near the port were destroyed. People in Galveston away were knocked to their knees. Surrounding chemical and oil tanks and refineries were ignited by the blast. At least 63 who died and were not able to be identified are memorialized in a cemetery in the north part of town. The Texas City disaster is widely regarded as the foundation of disaster planning for the United States. Monsanto and other plants committed to rebuilding, and the city ultimately recovered quite well from the accident. Numerous petrochemical refineries are still located in the same port area of Texas City. The city has often referred to itself as &quot;the town that would not die,&quot; a moniker whose accuracy would be tested once again in the days surrounding Hurricane Ike&#x27;s assault on the region early on September 13, 2008.

===1987 Marathon Oil refinery hydrogen fluoride gas release===
On October 30, 1987, a crane at the Marathon Oil refinery accidentally dropped its load on a tank of liquid hydrogen fluoride, causing a release of of hydrogen fluoride gas and requiring 3,000 residents to be evacuated.

===2005 BP explosion===
On March 23, 2005, the city suffered another explosion in a local BP (formerly Amoco) oil refinery which killed 15 and injured 180. In the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB)&#x27;s final report on the accident, published in March 2007, they described the event as &quot;one of the worst industrial disasters in recent U.S. history.&quot; The BP facility in Texas City is the United States&#x27; third-largest oil refinery, employing over 2,000 people, processing 460,000 barrels (73,000 m³) of crude oil each day, and producing roughly 4% of the country&#x27;s gasoline.

===2008 Hurricane Ike===
Even in the widespread destruction throughout Galveston County caused by the wind and surge associated with Ike, Texas City was largely spared the devastation that other low-lying areas suffered. Texas City is mostly surrounded by a levee system that was built in the early 1960s following the devastating floods from Hurricane Carla in 1961. Together with pump stations containing several Archimedes&#x27; screws located at various places throughout the northeast periphery of the city adjoining Galveston, Dollar Bay, and Moses Lake, the levee and pump station system may well have saved the city from wholesale devastation at the hands of Ike&#x27;s powerful tidal surge. Damage in the city was largely limited to that caused by Ike&#x27;s powerful winds and heavy rains.

Beginning Sunday, September 14, 2008, the day after landfall, Texas City&#x27;s high school football complex, Stingaree Stadium, was used as a staging and relocation area for persons evacuated by National Guard Black Hawk helicopters from nearby bayfront communities such as the Bolivar Peninsula and Galveston Island. Also, by the morning of Monday, September 15, the American Red Cross had opened a relief and material distribution center in the city.

The Texas City Dike was overtopped by a greater than storm surge when Hurricane Ike barreled through the region in the early-morning hours of Saturday, September 13, 2008. Although all buildings, piers, and the Dike Road were destroyed, the dike itself weathered the storm. The dike was closed for three years while the road and supporting facilities were rebuilt. It was reopened to traffic in September 2011.

==Geography==
Texas City is northwest of Galveston and southeast of Houston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 67.61%, is covered by water.

Officially, the elevation of Texas City is 10 feet above sea level, though some areas are even lower. It was naturally vulnerable to flooding by hurricane storm surges and heavy rainstorms.

The land south and west of the city is flat coastal plain. A large part of this area to the south is marshland. Texas City is bounded on the north by Moses Lake, which is fed by Moses Bayou, a freshwater stream. The lake drains into Galveston Bay, which bounds the city on the east.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 51,898 people, 19,526 households, and 13,005 families residing in the city. There were 21,493 housing units.

The Hispanic and Latino population&#x27;s percentage of the overall population of Texas City had increased to 29.9% in 2017 from 27% in 2010, and by then the city had a Hispanic supermarket and other businesses catering to Hispanics. The African-American percentage had declined to 28% in 2017 from 30.8% in 2010.

==Economy==

The Texas City economy has long been based on heavy industry, particularly shipping at the Port of Texas City, as well as petroleum and petrochemical refining. The Texas City Industrial Complex is a leading center of the petrochemical industry. Within this complex, the Galveston Bay Refinery operated by Marathon is the second-largest petroleum refinery in Texas and third-largest in the United States. The Port of Texas City became the third-leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. In recent decades, the city&#x27;s planners have made efforts to diversify the economy into tourism, health care, and many other sectors. As early as 1974, Texas City was placed on the top-ten list for the EPA superfund. Outdated practices for the disposal of toxic waste have continued there for years.

The Port of Texas City, operated by the Port of Texas City / Texas City Terminal Railway, is the eighth-largest port in the United States and the third-largest in Texas, with waterborne tonnage exceeding 78 million net tons. The Texas City Terminal Railway Company provides an important land link to the port, handling over 25,000 carloads per year. The Port of Texas City&#x27;s success as a privately owned port has been aided by its shareholders, the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads, whose connections allow for expeditious interchange of their traffic.

The Galveston County Juvenile Justice Department Jerry J. Esmond Juvenile Justice Center is in Texas City. Prisoners there attend the Dickinson Independent School District.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice maintains the Young Medical Facility Complex for females in Texas City. Young opened in 1996 as the Texas City Regional Medical Unit.

==Arts and culture==
In 1928, the city dedicated a room in city hall to form a municipal library, operated by the Texas City Civic Club. In 1947, city hall received damage from the Texas City explosion; it was later demolished. In 1948, the library moved to a former house. In 1964, the library moved into its current building. In 1984, the Moore Memorial Public Library was expanded to .

The Texas City Museum includes the Galveston County Model Railroad Club exhibit.

==Parks and recreation==

The city operates 42 parks, some of which are part of the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail.

The Texas City Prairie Preserve is a nature preserve located on the shores of Moses Lake opposite the city. The terrain of the preserve includes prairie and wetland habitats. The preserve includes of public-access areas, including campsites. The remainder of the preserve is available for tours, including boardwalk access through the marshes.

The Bay Street Park is a property near the bay and the levee. Part of the park commemorates the Aero Squadron, one of the first U.S. Army air squadrons and a precursor to the modern Air Force. The rest of the park features wilderness trails and family entertainment areas.

Nessler Park is a property used for community events such as the annual &quot;Music Fest by the Bay&quot;. Other large city parks include Carver Park, Godard Park, and Holland Park.

The centerpiece of Texas City&#x27;s Heritage Square historical district is the former residence of one of the city&#x27;s fathers, Frank B. Davison. The Victorian-styled Davison Home was completed in 1897.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public schools====
Most of Texas City is served by the Texas City Independent School District, which has four elementary schools for grades K–4: Kohfeldt Elementary, Roosevelt-Wilson Elementary, Heights Elementary, and Guajardo Elementary. The TCISD intermediate school, Levi Fry Intermediate, provides for fifth and sixth graders, and one TCISD middle school, Blocker Middle School, provides for seventh and eighth graders. Texas City High School serves the TCISD portion of Texas City.

Other portions are a part of the Dickinson Independent School District.

Some were previously in the La Marque Independent School District. On December 2, 2015, Texas Education Agency (TEA) Commissioner Michael Williams announced that the Texas City Independent School District would absorb the La Marque district effective July 1, 2016.

====Private schools====
Our Lady of Fatima School, a Roman Catholic elementary school operated by the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, is in Texas City.

===Colleges and universities===
Texas City is served by the College of the Mainland, which is located in Texas City.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The major freeway serving the area is the Gulf Freeway, part of Interstate 45, which connects Texas City with Galveston and Houston. Texas State Highway 146 locally connects Texas City with other Galveston Bay Area communities on the shoreline. Texas Loop 197 combines with Highway 146 to form a ring around the city, providing access to the city&#x27;s major areas.

===Police===
In 2008, civilian code-enforcement officers were replaced with police officers because residents tended to ignore civilian officials.

<text>Bullard is a small town in Smith and Cherokee counties in the east-central part of the U.S. state of Texas. U.S. Route 69 and Farm-to-Market Roads 2137, 2493, and 344 intersect here, about south of the larger city of Tyler. Its population was 3,318 at the 2020 census, up from 2,463 at the 2010 census.

The Smith County portion of the town is part of the Tyler metropolitan statistical area, while the Cherokee County portion is part of the Jacksonville micropolitan statistical area.

Bullard was earlier known as &quot;Etna&quot; and &quot;Hewsville&quot;. The town is named for John H. Bullard, a Confederate soldier, and Emma Eugenia (Erwin) Bullard. In 1881, John Bullard opened the Hewsville post office in his store. In 1883, the Etna post office, near Hewsville, was closed. Then, the Hewsville office was renamed &quot;Bullard&quot;. Many rural residents in northern Cherokee County are served by the Bullard post office. The bypassing of the railroad brought about the demise of Etna and the rise of Bullard.

==History==
The Etna post office, just west of Bullard, was granted in 1867, although settlers had been in the vicinity since the early 1850s. John and Emma Bullard arrived about 1870. A new post office named Hewsville was opened in the Bullards&#x27; store in 1881. The Etna post office was closed in 1883 and the Hewsville post office was renamed as Bullard.

When the Kansas and Gulf Short Line Railroad extended its route from Tyler to Lufkin, it passed through Bullard and built a depot there. This attracted new residents and businesses. In 1890, the town had 200 residents and most essential businesses, plus a doctor and a telegraph office. The railroad was renamed several times - becoming the St. Louis, Arkansas, and Texas Railway and then (1892) the Tyler and Southwestern Railway.

In 1903, the two public schools (segregated) had five teachers and 186 students between them. By 1914, the population had doubled to 400 and the railroad changed names once again - becoming the St. Louis Southwestern Railroad.

The population was 450 after World War II. The community did not organize to elect a city council until 1948.

By the mid-1960s, the population had declined to 300, but it rebounded by 1973 when it reached 573. The community is now concentrated around the crossroads. Most residents commute for work to nearby Tyler.

==Geography==
Bullard is located in southern Smith County, with a small portion extending south into Cherokee County. Four-lane U.S. Route 69 passes through the east side of town, leading north to Tyler and south to Jacksonville.

<text>Carrollton is a city in Dallas, Denton, and Collin counties in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 133,434, making it the 27th-most populous city in Texas.

==History==

The area was first settled by Jared Ford in 1842 by William and Mary Larner on a site within the Peters Colony grant. In 1844, the A. W. Perry family claimed land in the area around Trinity Mills where, in partnership with Wade H. Witt, a mill was established.

The English colony, a group of families in the northeastern area of settlement which crossed into Denton County, was home to large landowners including the Furneaux, Jackson, Morgan, and Rowe families. Carrollton was most likely named after Carrollton, Illinois, the original home of many of these settlers.

Early on, Carrollton&#x27;s livelihood was exclusively agricultural, but following the construction of the Dallas-Wichita Railroad through Trinity Mills in 1878, the community began to grow in its industrial significance. Carrollton&#x27;s significance was further strengthened when the railroad was extended to Denton in 1880 by Jay Gould, who sold the line to the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (the Katy) in 1881. By 1885, Carrollton had flour mills, cotton gins, two churches, a school, and a population of 150. The St. Louis Southwestern Railway (the &quot;Cotton Belt&quot;) crossed the Katy in 1888, and the town became a shipping center for livestock, cotton, cotton seed, and grain, helping the town surpass Trinity Mills to the north.

In 1913, Carrollton was officially incorporated, and W.F. Vinson was elected mayor. A gravel industry that began in Carrollton in 1912 transformed the city, by the late 1940s, to a &quot;grain and gravel&quot; town. The city also supported a brick plant and a dairy industry, and National Metal Products established itself in the city in 1946.

After World War II, the city grew rapidly. In 1950, its population stood at 1,610, and it grew to 4,242 in 1960 and 13,855 in 1970. At this point, significant suburban growth began spilling out of north Dallas, and the city grew tremendously between 1970 and 1980, with a documented growth of 193% to 40,595 inhabitants. By 1983, the population was 52,000, by 1990, it had reached 82,169, and by 2010 the population had grown to 119,097.

As a suburb of Dallas, in 2006, Carrollton was included in Relocate America&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Places to Live&quot; list. Also in 2006, it was selected as the 19th best place to live in the United States by &quot;Money&quot; magazine. In 2008, it was named by &quot;Money&quot; magazine the 15th best place to live among small cities.

<text>Frisco is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Collin and Denton counties. It is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex (DFW) and about from both Dallas Love Field and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Its population was 200,509 in the 2020 U.S. census.

Frisco was the fastest-growing city in the United States in 2017, and also from 2000 to 2009. In the late 1990s, the northern DFW suburban development tide hit the northern border of Plano and spilled into Frisco, sparking rapid growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in Dallas&#x27;s northern exurbs, Frisco serves as a bedroom community for professionals who work in DFW. Since 2003, Frisco has received the designation Tree City USA from the National Arbor Day Foundation.

The United States Census Bureau defines an urban area of northern Dallas-area suburbs that are separated from the Dallas–Fort Worth urban area, with McKinney and Frisco as the principal cities: the McKinney–Frisco, Texas, urban area had a population of 504,803 as of the 2020 census, ranked 83rd in the United States.

==History==
When the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers, many of the settlers traveled by wagon trains along the Shawnee Trail. This trail became the Preston Trail, and later Preston Road. With all this activity, the community of Lebanon was founded along this trail and was granted a U.S. post office in 1860.

In 1902, a line of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (&quot;the Frisco&quot;) was being built through the area, and periodic watering stops were needed along the route for the steam locomotives. The current settlement of Lebanon was on Preston Ridge and was too high in elevation, so the watering stop was placed about 4 miles (6 km) to the west on lower ground. A community grew around this train stop, and some Lebanon residents moved their houses to the new community on logs. The new town was originally named Emerson, but the U.S. Postal Service rejected the name as too similar to another community, Emberson, in Lamar County.

In 1904, the town&#x27;s residents chose &quot;Frisco City&quot; in honor of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. This name was later shortened to Frisco.

Lewisville ISD operates one elementary campus in the city while Prosper ISD operates an elementary school, a middle school, and Rock Hill High School, a high school within the Frisco city limits.

Frisco ISD has 12 high schools 18 middle schools and 43 elementary schools, and 3 special programs centers. Most Frisco ISD schools are within the Frisco city limits, but some are in adjacent suburbs, such as Plano.

The Frisco ISD Early Childhood School is available for children ages three and four who meet eligibility requirements for Headstart, Prekindergarten, or Preschool Program for Children with Disabilities.

At the Frisco ISD Career and Technical Education Center, high school students can experience and try different careers, from veterinary work to advertising and graphic design.

<text>Garland is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located within Dallas County with portions extending into Collin and Rockwall counties. It is located northeast of Dallas and is a part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. In 2020, it had a population of 246,018, making it the 93rd-most populous city in the United States and the 13th-most populous city in Texas. Garland is the third largest city in Dallas County by population and has access to downtown Dallas via public transportation including two DART Blue Line stations and buses. It as known worldwide as the birthplace of Wingstop, which first opened in 1994 and still operates to this day. 

==History==

Immigrants began arriving in the Peters colony area around 1850, but a community was not created until 1874. Two communities sprang up in the area: Embree, named for physician K. H. Embree, and Duck Creek, named for the local creek of the same name. A rivalry between the two towns ensued as the area began to grow around the Santa Fe Railroad depot.

Eventually, to settle a dispute regarding which town should have the local post office, Dallas County Judge Thomas F. Nash asked visiting Congressman Joe Abbott to move the post office between the two towns. The move was completed in 1887. The new location was named Garland after U.S. Attorney General Augustus Hill Garland.

Soon after, the towns of Embree and Duck Creek were combined, and the three areas combined to form the city of Garland, which was incorporated in 1891. By 1904, the town had a population of 819 people.

In 1920, local businessmen financed a new electrical generator plant (sold by Fairbanks-Morse) for the town. This later led to the formation of Garland Power and Light, the municipal electric provider that still powers the city today.

On May 9, 1927, a devastating F4 tornado struck the town and killed 15 people, including the former mayor, S. E. Nicholson.

Businesses began to move back into the area in the late 1930s. The Craddock food company and later the Byer-Rolnick hat factory (now owned by Resistol) moved into the area. In 1937, KRLD, a major Dallas radio station, built its radio antenna tower in Garland, and it is operational to this day.

During World War II, several aircraft plants were operated in the area, and the Kraft Foods company purchased a vacant one after the war for its own use. By 1950, the population of Garland exceeded 10,000 people. From 1950 to 1954, though, the Dallas/Garland area suffered from a serious and extended drought, so to supplement the water provided by wells, Garland began using the water from the nearby Lake Lavon.

The suburban population boom that the whole country experienced after World War II also reached Garland by 1960, when the population nearly quadrupled from the 1950 figure to about 38,500. By 1970, the population had doubled to about 81,500. By 1980, the population reached 138,850. Charles R. Matthews served as mayor in the 1980s; he was later a member of the elected Texas Railroad Commission.

In the 2000s, Garland added several notable developments, mostly in the northern portion of the city. Hawaiian Falls waterpark opened in 2003. (Garland formerly had a Wet &#x27;n Wild waterpark, which closed in 1993). The Garland Independent School District&#x27;s Curtis Culwell Center (formerly called the Special Events Center), an arena and conference facility, opened in 2005.

Later that year, Firewheel Town Center, a Main Street-style outdoor mall, owned by Simon Property Group, opened in October 2005. It has over 100 business and includes an AMC theater. In 2009, the city, in conjunction with developer Trammell Crow Company, finished a public/private partnership to develop the old parking lot (the land between 5th Street, 6th Street, and on the north side of Austin Street) into a new mixed-use, transit-oriented development named 5th Street Crossing. Cater-corner to both City Hall and the downtown DART Rail station, the project consists of 189 residential apartment units, of flex retail, and six live-work units.

On May 3, 2015, the Curtis Culwell Center attack took place in Garland. The attack ended in a shootout with police guarding the event and the deaths of the two perpetrators.

The southeast side of Garland suffered a major blow on the night of December 26, 2015, after a large EF4 tornado struck the area, moving north from Sunnyvale. Nine fatalities were confirmed in the city from this event. Exactly 6 years later, a mass shooting took place at a convenience store in Garland, resulting in the deaths of 3 people.

<text>Plano ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, where it is the largest city in Collin County. A small portion of Plano is located in Denton County. Plano is also one of the principal cities of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. With a population of 285,494 at the 2020 census, it is the ninth most-populous city in Texas, and, respectively, the 73rd most populous city in the United States.

Plano&#x27;s economy is a large part of Dallas&#x27; economy, home to many large companies such as Frito Lay, JCPenney, Pizza Hut, and other major distributors. It is also home to the headquarters of Toyota Motor North America. Plano has also been named as both one of the fastest growing cities and one of the best places to live in the country.

==History==

Several Native Americans have passed through what is now Plano, including the Comanche, Caddo, and Wichita. Settlers came to the area near present-day Plano in the early 1840s. Facilities such as a sawmill, a gristmill, and a store soon brought more people to the area. A mail service was established, and after rejecting several names for the nascent town (including naming it in honor of then-President Millard Fillmore), residents suggested the name &quot;Plano&quot; (from the Spanish word for &quot;flat&quot;) in reference to the local terrain. The post office accepted the name.

In 1872, the completion of the Houston and Central Texas Railway helped Plano grow, and it was incorporated in 1873. By 1874, the population was over 500. In 1881, a fire raged through the business district, destroying most of the buildings. Plano was rebuilt and business again flourished through the 1880s. Also in 1881, the city assumed responsibility for what would eventually become Plano Independent School District (PISD), ending the days of it being served only by private schools.

At first, Plano&#x27;s population grew slowly, reaching 1,304 in 1900 and 3,695 in 1960. By 1970, Plano began to feel some of the boom its neighbors had experienced after World War II. A series of public works projects and a change in taxes that removed the farming community from the town helped increase the population. In 1970, the population reached 17,872, and by 1980, it had exploded to 72,000. Sewers, schools, and street development kept pace with this massive increase, largely because of Plano&#x27;s flat topography, grid layout, and planning initiatives.

During the 1980s, many large corporations, including J. C. Penney and Frito-Lay, moved their headquarters to Plano, spurring further growth. By 1990, the population reached 128,713, dwarfing the county seat, McKinney. In 1994, Plano was recognized as an All-America City. By 2000, the population grew to 222,030, making it one of Dallas&#x27;s largest suburbs. Plano is surrounded by other municipalities and so cannot expand in area, and there is little undeveloped land within the city limits. But as of July 2012, one large tract of land was being developed: Turnpike Commons at the intersection of Renner Road and the George Bush Turnpike (also bordered by Shiloh Road to the east). The development is expected to feature apartments, medical facilities, restaurants, a Race Trac gas station, and a hotel.

On June 15, 2015, after five years of disuse, a 178-foot water tower built in 1985 was demolished to make room for Legacy West.

==Government==
===Local government===
Plano has a council-manager form of government, with a part-time city council that sets city policy and a city manager responsible for city operations. The Plano City Council has eight members elected on a nonpartisan basis in staggered odd-year elections every other May. Council members and the mayor are elected by and serve the city at large. Council members serving in places one, two, three, and four must reside in that district, and the mayor always serves in place six. The mayor receives a yearly stipend of $8,400, and each council member receives $6,000.

All council members, including the mayor, serve a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms. The mayor and city council members could serve for a maximum of three consecutive three-year terms until voters approved changes to the city charter in 2011.

Mark Israelson has served as city manager of the city of Plano since May 2019.

The 38th mayor of Plano was businessman Harry LaRosiliere, who was elected the first African-American mayor of Plano in 2013. Plano elected its first African-American city council member, David Perry, in 1990.

On December 8, 2014, the city council passed an amendment to its civil rights act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected. The ordinance drew the ire of conservative groups such as the Liberty Institute, which argued that it infringed on business owners&#x27; religious rights. Many civil rights organizations were not supportive either, such as the Human Rights Campaign, which argued that the policy&#x27;s exclusion of transgender individuals from being able to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity rendered the ordinance not worth defending.

In the 2008 fiscal year Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Plano reported $194 million in revenue, $212 million in expenditures, $278 million in total assets, $31.4 million in total liabilities, and $337 million in cash and investments.

Plano is a voluntary member of the North Central Texas Council of Governments association, the purpose of which is to coordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.

In 2020, Police Chief Ed Drain announced the Plano Police Department would no longer make arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana.

===Politics===
Dallas&#x27;s wealthy northern suburbs were solidly Republican, and in 2005, the Bay Area Center for Voting Research ranked Plano, the largest of them, the United States&#x27; fifth-most conservative city. It has recently become more competitive in national elections as its population has diversified, shifting toward the Democratic Party since 2016, when Donald Trump won the city by a narrow margin. In 2018, Beto O&#x27;Rourke became the first Democrat to win the city in a statewide election in the 21st century, and in 2020, Joe Biden won the city by an even larger margin. But in local and state elections, Plano still leans Republican, voting to reelect Governor Greg Abbott in 2018 and narrowly reelecting Republicans to the Texas House of Representatives and Texas Senate in 2018 and 2020.


===State representation===
Plano is split between the 33rd, 65th, 66th, 67th, 70th, and 89th Districts in the Texas House of Representatives. The part of Plano in Collin County is wholly contained in Texas Senate, District 8, while the Denton County portion is in Texas Senate, District 30.

Republican Justin Holland represents Texas House District 33, Republican Kronda Thimesch represents Texas House District 65, Republican Matt Shaheen represents Texas House District 66, Republican Jeff Leach has represented Texas House District 67 since 2013, Democrat Mihaela Plesa represents Texas House District 70, and Republican Candy Noble represents Texas House District 89. Republican Angela Paxton represents Texas Senate District 8 and Republican Drew Springer represents Texas Senate District 30.

===Federal representation===
Plano is split between Texas&#x27;s 3rd, 4th, 26th, and 32nd congressional districts, represented by Republicans Keith Self, Pat Fallon, and Brandon Gill, and Democrat Julie Johnson respectively. Plano is represented in the United States Senate by Republicans Ted Cruz and John Cornyn.

==Education==
Plano has 70 public schools, 16 private schools, and two campuses of Collin College.

===Primary and secondary schools===
The Plano Independent School District serves most of the city. Student enrollment has increased dramatically till 2012. However, the district has seen a decline since then, which resulted in two middle schools and two elementary schools to be closed for the 2025-2026 school year. Plano has a unique high school system, in which grades 9–10 attend a high school and grades 11–12 attend a senior high. There are three senior high schools (grades 11–12) in PISD: Plano East, Plano, and Plano West. Small portions of Plano are served by the Lewisville Independent School District, Frisco Independent School District, and Allen Independent School District.

Plano schools graduate more of their students than comparable districts. In 2010, 93% of Plano Independent School District students graduated from high school, 18 percentage points higher than Dallas ISD&#x27;s rate. In 2012, Plano Independent School District announced that 128 seniors were selected as National Merit Semifinalists.

Plano has given $1.2 billion in property tax revenue to other school districts through Texas&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; law, which requires school districts designated as affluent to give a percentage of their property tax revenue to other districts outside the county. In 2008, PISD gave $86 million. Controversy erupted when the salaries of teachers in less affluent districts—such as Garland ISD—exceeded the salaries of teachers in districts that had to pay into &quot;Robin Hood&quot;.

In the 2013–14 school year, Plano ISD opened two four-year high school academies, one focusing on STEAM (STEM education plus Media Arts) called Plano ISD Academy High School, and the other on health science. Additionally, the district modified its International Baccalaureate program to allow freshmen and sophomores in the program to be housed at Plano East Senior High School.

In addition to Catholic primary and middle schools, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas operates John Paul II High School in Plano. Non-Catholic private schools in Plano include Great Lakes Academy, Spring Creek Academy, Yorktown Education, and Prestonwood Christian Academy. In addition, the Collin County campus of Coram Deo Academy is in the One Church (previously Four Corners Church) facility in Plano.

===Colleges and universities===

Plano is the home to two campuses of Collin College, one at the Courtyard Center on Preston Park Boulevard and the larger Spring Creek Campus on Spring Creek Parkway at Jupiter. DBU North, a satellite campus of Dallas Baptist University, is in west Plano, and offers undergraduate and graduate courses and houses the admissions and academic counseling offices.

As defined by the Texas Legislature, all of Collin County is in the Collin College district. The portion of Plano within Denton County is zoned to North Central Texas College.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Plano is one of 12 suburbs of Dallas that opt into the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) public transportation system. During its early membership in DART, Plano was lightly served by bus lines, but in 2002, the Red Line of the DART light rail project opened stations in Downtown Plano and at Parker Road, which provide access to commuters traveling to work elsewhere in the Dallas area. The Orange Line traverses the same route for selected weekday/peak hour trips. Bus routes serve areas of downtown, south central, and west Plano, but no bus routes serve the far north, north central, and far east areas. Instead, DART&#x27;s GoLink on-demand service serves these areas. The Silver Line is also planned to run through Southern Plano. Approximately 1% of the city&#x27;s population uses DART. The Parker Road station charged for parking for non-member city residents from April 2, 2012, to April 3, 2014, as a part of the Fair Share Parking initiative. Two DART park-and-ride bus facilities, separate from the rail lines, are in Plano: Jack Hatchell Transit Center and Northwest Plano Park &amp; Ride.

Plano was the first city in Collin County to adopt a master plan for its road system. The use of multi-lane, divided highways for all major roads allows for higher speed limits, generally , but sometimes up to on the northern section of Preston Road. Plano is served directly by several major roadways and freeways. Central Plano is bordered to the east by U.S. Highway 75, the west by Dallas North Tollway, the south by President George Bush Turnpike (Texas State Highway 190 (east of Coit Road)), and the north by Sam Rayburn Tollway (Texas State Highway 121). Preston Road (Texas State Highway 289) is a major thoroughfare that runs through the city. Plano is Texas&#x27;s largest city without an interstate highway.

Plano opened a new interchange at Parker Rd. and U.S. 75 in December 2010. The single-point interchange is the first of its kind in Texas. The design is intended to reduce severe congestion at this interchange. According to reports, traffic congestion has been reduced by 50-75%.

Plano is roughly 30 miles northeast of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the primary airport serving Plano residents and visitors.

===Fire department===
Plano Fire-Rescue has 386 full-time firefighters who operate out of 13 stations. The department is responsible for a population of 271,000 residents spread across . It is also the 10 largest department (by number of firefighters) in the state of Texas.

===Police===
The Plano Police Department is an accredited agency and Plano&#x27;s principal law enforcement agency. The department is led by Chief Ed Drain. The department has authorized staff of 414 sworn officers, 178 full-time civilian employees, and 79 civilian part-time employees. It is a member of the North Texas Crime Commission and uses the Crime Stoppers program.

===Water===
Plano is part of the North Texas Municipal Water District, headquartered in Wylie, Texas. Lake Lavon is the district&#x27;s principal source of raw water. Plano&#x27;s water distribution system includes:
* 10 elevated towers
* 12 ground storage tanks
* 54.5 million-gallon water storage capacity

==History==
Emigrants from Kentucky and Tennessee settled near present-day Richardson in the 1840s. Before the Civil War, a small settlement called Breckenridge, located near present-day Richland College, was established. In 1873, the Houston and Texas Central Railway built a depot northwest of Breckenridge. After the H.&amp;T.C. purchased acreage for a townsite from two local land-owners, the site was surveyed and laid out in blocks and lots, which the railroad began selling in 1874. The town was named after the secretary of the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad, Alfred S. Richardson.

In 1908, the Texas Electric Railway, an electric railway known as the Interurban, connected Richardson to Denison, Waco, Corsicana and Dallas. In 1910 the population was approximately 600. A red brick schoolhouse was built in 1914 and is now the administrative office for the Richardson Independent School District. In 1924 the Red Brick Road, the present-day Greenville Avenue, was completed. The completion of the road brought increased traffic, population and property values. The town incorporated and elected a mayor in 1925. In 1940 the population was approximately 740.

After World War II the city experienced major increases in population, which stood at approximately 1,300 by 1950. Throughout the 1950s the city continued to see growth including the opening of the Collins Radio Richardson office, Central Expressway, a police department, shopping centers, and many homes. Texas Instruments opened its offices in Dallas on the southern border of Richardson in 1956. This was followed by significant gains in land values, population, and economic status. In the 1960s Richardson experienced additional growth including several new parks, facilities, and the creation of the University of Texas at Dallas within the city limits. By 1972 the population was approximately 56,000. Residential growth continued through the 1970s and slowed in the 1980s. Commercial development increased throughout the 1980s. Richardson had a population of 74,840 according to the 1990 census. Population increases throughout the 1990s were primarily from development of the northeast part of the city. The city of Buckingham, after being completely surrounded by Richardson, was annexed into the city in 1996.

Richardson had a population of 91,802 as of the 2000 census. By 2002 Richardson had four Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) light rail stations and had built the Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and Corporate Presentations and the adjacent Galatyn Park urban center, which has a 2-acre public pedestrian plaza, a luxury hotel, and mixed-use development. Richardson was a &quot;dry city&quot; with no alcohol sales until November 2006, when the local option election passed to allow the sale of beer and wine in grocery and convenience stores. In the fall of 2008 Peter Perfect, a Style Network television show, came to Richardson. The business-makeover show remodeled SpiritWear, an apparel and embroidery store in the city&#x27;s historic downtown area. The episode first aired on January 22, 2009. It was the first episode of the series to be filmed outside of California.

Dallas County has an estimated 275,000 Arab Americans, many of whom have settled in Richardson. Many of them have come from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Yemen, Morocco, etc. The DFW Chinatown is located in Richardson, in part because of the large Asian population. Esther Wu, a former editor of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, stated that Chinese immigration began in Richardson in 1975. Since then the Chinese community has expanded to the north. In the mid-1980s the majority of ethnic Chinese K–12 students in the DFW area resided in Richardson.

By 2012 North Texas had over 60 Chinese cultural organizations and most of them were headquartered in Richardson and Plano. The Dallas Chinese Community Center (DCCC; ) is in the D-FW Chinatown. It includes English as a second language (ESL) classes and 20,000 books written in Simplified Chinese; the center imported some books from People&#x27;s Republic of Mainland China. As of 2011 the Chinese restaurants catering to ethnic Chinese in DFW are mainly in Richardson and Plano. The University of Texas at Dallas in Richardson, as of 2012, has almost 1,000 Chinese students. The university has a program to recruit students of Chinese origin.

Richardson&#x27;s Indian immigrant community has been primarily driven by the international telecommunications industry that is so prevalent in the community. The Indian Association of North Texas headquarters are in Richardson. Indo-Pak grocery store is located in an Indian-oriented strip shopping center east of Central Expressway. Of the suburbs in the DFW area, Richardson had one of the earliest Indian settlements.

Richardson is home to a large community of Vietnamese Americans and even has a significant amount of Vietnamese-catering retail stores, malls, markets, and plazas, especially near U.S. 75, such as the Hong Kong Market, the Cali Saigon Shopping Mall, etc.

==Economy==
Despite declining economies in other parts of the United States, from 2005 to 2009 Richardson had substantial increases in its economy. The city&#x27;s total assessed property value went up from $8.3 billion in 2005 to $14 billion in 2017. Sales tax collection went up from $21 million in 2005 to an estimated $32.9 million in 2017.

Since 2008, both Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and Moody&#x27;s have upgraded Richardson&#x27;s credit rating to &quot;AAA&quot; from the previous rating of &quot;AA+&quot;. At the time, Richardson was one of only four cities in the state of Texas and one of 88 cities in the nation with an &quot;AAA&quot; rating from Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s. In 2015, the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) determined Richardson&#x27;s daytime population to be 156,065 based on American Community Survey information. The economy remains rooted in the telecommunication industry. However, Richardson&#x27;s property tax base is deep and extends beyond its telecommunication roots to include other sectors including insurance, health care, technology and finance. The tax base is diverse with the 10 leading taxpayers accounting for 16.17% of total assessed value.

On March 1, 2014, the Richardson Fire Department officially received its Class 1 ISO rating. The Insurance Services Office (ISO) is &quot;a leading supplier of statistical, underwriting and actuarial information for the property/casualty insurance industry&quot;, and its rating is used to measure the quality and effectiveness of fire protection in a community. At the time, Richardson was one of only 56 municipalities in the country to achieve this highest rating, which tends to reduce property/casualty insurance premiums.

==Arts and culture==

The Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts is located in Richardson. It serves as the primary venue for the Richardson Symphony Orchestra and the Plano Symphony Orchestra.

==Government==
Richardson was originally incorporated in 1925, with the first Charter being adopted in 1956 and the latest revision made in November 2015. The community is a home rule city and has operated under the council–manager form of government since 1956. Richardson voters simultaneously elect six Council members and a mayor to represent them every two years. The Council members representing the four districts (1 to 4) must live in each district respectively; however, the mayor and the remaining two districts (5 and 6) can live in any part of the city. All Council members and the mayor are elected at large, with four Council members representing each of the city&#x27;s four districts. The City Council is elected for two-year terms on a nonpartisan basis.

The Charter requires that the City Council appoint a city manager to act as the chief administrative and executive officer. The city manager is not appointed for a fixed time and may be removed at the will and pleasure of the majority of the City Council. One of the responsibilities of the city manager is to appoint and remove department heads and conduct the general affairs of the municipal government in accordance with the policies of the City Council.

The City provides to its citizens a full range of services including police and fire protection, emergency ambulance service, water and sewer service, solid waste disposal, park and recreational activities, cultural events, and a library. In addition, the City provides planning for future land use, traffic control, building inspection, and community services and operates two 18-hole golf courses. The City also operates the Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and Corporate Presentations, which is a multi-venue performing arts and presentation center.

The City of Richardson is a voluntary member of the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) association, the purpose of which is to coordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
The University of Texas at Dallas, also referred to as UT Dallas or UTD, is a public research university in the University of Texas System. Despite its name the UT Dallas main campus, consisting of approximately , is within the Richardson city limits at 800 West Campbell Road.

During 2016, construction was completed on the Student Services Building addition. New projects include an Alumni Center, a Brain Performance Institute and an engineering building as well as additional housing options. These enhancements are part of a campus renovation that has included hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in new and upgraded buildings since 2009.

===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====

The city is served by the Richardson Independent School District (RISD) within the Dallas County portion of the city, and the Plano Independent School District (PISD) within the Collin County portion of the city. Despite that name, however, most of the Richardson Independent School District lies outside of the municipal boundaries of Richardson: 60 percent of RISD is in Dallas, with 35 percent in Richardson and 5 percent in Garland.

The RISD and PISD have many Blue Ribbon Schools. The Blue Ribbon Schools Program is a United States government program created to honor schools. The Blue Ribbon award is considered to be the highest honor that an American school can achieve.

Zoned RISD high schools in Richardson include Richardson High School, Lloyd V. Berkner High School, and J.J. Pearce High School. The Christa McAuliffe Learning Center is also in Richardson. Lake Highlands High School is part of the Richardson Independent School District but is located in Lake Highlands, an area in Dallas just south of Richardson.

Sections of Richardson in the Plano Independent School District are served by several schools. Aldridge, Haggar, Miller, Schell, and Stinson elementary schools are within Richardson and serve Collin County portions of Richardson. A section of Collin County Richardson is zoned to Mendenhall Elementary School in Plano. Otto, Frankford and Wilson middle schools in Plano and Murphy Middle School in Murphy serve separate sections of Collin County Richardson. Vines High School and T.H. Williams High School, 9–10 schools in Plano, serve separate sections of Collin County Richardson, along with McMillen High School in Murphy.

===Public libraries===
The Richardson Public Library is located at 900 Civic Center Drive at the southwest corner of U.S. Route 75 (North Central Expressway) and Arapaho Road.

The roots of the Richardson Public Library date back to 1947 when a branch of the Dallas County Library was established in a section of the Cash Dry Goods store on East Main Street in downtown Richardson. The fledgling library collection numbered about 400 volumes and was managed by Jessie Durham the store&#x27;s proprietor. The City Council established the library as a city department in 1958 and in 1959 the library moved into a newly constructed building at 310 Tyler Street. This new library was just under in size and was built at a cost of $100,000.

Richardson was experiencing rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s, and the library facility soon became inadequate for community needs. The current facility was constructed at a cost of $2 million and opened December 1, 1970. The new , four-story building opened with the use of two floors and a small portion of a third. The basement was finished in 1980 for the reference collection and services. In 1995 the library underwent another expansion which finished the upper floor and renovated the three previously opened floors. Another renovation occurred in 2006 when the Youth Services department was expanded.

In 2008 the library set a new record for the number of items circulated in a fiscal year when the 1 millionth item was checked out in the fall of 2008. The building has undergone building renovations and technological improvements in recent years that have enhanced the library experience for patrons. Since 2014, the digital library has expanded to include movies, music and magazines as well as books and audiobooks. In 2015, the Richardson Library established a &quot;makerspace&quot; that initially included a 3-D printer, designated computers with creative applications and software, and kits for the early exploration of electronics.

The Texas Municipal League recognized the library with its &quot;Achievement of Excellence in Libraries&quot; award every year from 2004 to 2017.

==Transportation==

Richardson and the region benefit from the location of two major highways in the city. The President George Bush Turnpike, running east–west along the northern border of the city, provides a convenient connection to the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, as well as links to IH 35E, IH 30, IH20, SH 114, and SH 183 west of the city as well as a second link to IH30 east of the city.

Richardson also benefits from the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Light Rail line which parallels U.S. 75 and has four stations in the city. In October 2016, DART approved the future construction of the Silver Line commuter rail with the adoption of its 20-Year Financial Plan. Service on the Cotton Belt is projected to commence in 2025. The Cotton Belt line will run from DFW Airport to the eastern side of Plano, with Richardson stations located at The University of Texas at Dallas and CityLine. The Cotton Belt rail line will also connect to Trinity Metro&#x27;s TEXRail line, which connects downtown Fort Worth to the DFW Airport. In order to take full advantage of these transportation assets for development and redevelopment purposes, the City has implemented three Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Districts. TIF District #1 was established in November 2006, encompassing both sides of the U.S. 75 corridor from Campbell Road south to Spring Valley Road, and then extending west from U.S. 75 along Spring Valley Road to Coit Road. TIF District #2, established in November 2011, is bounded by President George Bush Turnpike on the north, Wyndham Lane on the east, Renner Road on the south, and the DART light rail line on the west. TIF District #3, established in November 2011, is bounded by President George Bush Turnpike on the north, the DART light rail line on the east, Renner Road on the South and has its western boundary between Alma Road and U.S. 75. Dallas County participates financially in TIF District #1 and Collin County participates financially in TIF District #2 and TIF District #3.

===Central Trail===

The southern Central Trail extension opened in June 2014 and the northern extension opened in 2015. The new hike and bike trail segments mean that the central spine to Richardson&#x27;s trail network will run from city limit to city limit, eventually connecting to trails throughout the region.

===Bike lanes===
In July 2015, Richardson was named a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists. Richardson has a long-range plan to provide bicycle facilities and to designate preferred bicycle routes on lower-volume, lower-speed roadways. There are now more than 15 miles of bike lanes in Richardson.

<text>Royse City is a city in Rockwall County in the U.S. state of Texas. It also extends into Collin and Hunt counties. The population was 2,957 at the 2000 census, rising to 9,349 in 2010. The estimated population in 2018 was 12,998. In 2020, its population grew to 13,508.

==History==
Garrett Burgess Griffin Royse, better known as Byrd Royse, was born in Adair County, Kentucky, on January 31, 1838, to William and Mary Stone Royse. He was the seventh of 14 children. &quot;Circa&quot; 1850, Royse&#x27;s future grandmother-in-law, Mrs. Nancy McCasland, and her sons bought several tracts of land that were later to become known as Royse City.

Royse was instrumental in getting the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway line brought from Greenville to Dallas through Rockwall County. Royse City was settled in 1885, when the railway came through the area. The town was named after G. B. Royse, who plotted the town and sold the first lots.

After its founding, Royse City preserved its stable, small, country-town status due to its proximity to Garland (21 miles away) and Dallas (33 miles).

Interstate 30 was constructed just south of the city in the mid-1960s. The city grew south to meet the interstate.

In 2000, Royse City had a population of 2,957. Still a small town, Royse City was feeling the impacts of the rapid growth of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, along with Rockwall County. The city&#x27;s location along Interstate 30 between Rockwall and Greenville helped to fuel this growth.

Royse City has grown rapidly to the north and south as newer subdivisions have been built. By 2010, Royse City had a population of 9,349, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This represents a growth rate of 216.2%.

==Geography==
Royse City is located in the northeastern corner of Rockwall County, and extends north into Collin County and east into Hunt County. According to the United States Census Bureau, Royse City has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.75%, is covered by water.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 13,508 people, 4,608 households, and 3,711 families residing in the city. In 2000, 2,957 people, 1,027 households, and 781 families were residing in the city.

At the 2000 census, the racial makeup of the city was 79.44% White, 7.51% African American, 0.47% Native American, 0.54% Asian, 9.54% from other races, and 2.50% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 20.97% of the population. Following nationwide trends of greater diversification, the racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 61.67% non-Hispanic white, 8.31% Black or African American, 1.64% Asian, 0.09% Pacific Islander, 0.26% some other race, 4.46% multiracial, and 23.11% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

In 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $42,266, and for a family was $48,804. Males had a median income of $30,966 versus $23,804 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,153. About 8.4% of families and 10.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.0% of those under age 18 and 10.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Royse City serves as a bedroom community for nearby Dallas and Greenville. Most of the development in the city is residential. The local economy consists of service businesses, restaurants, stores, schools, and medical offices. In June 2019, the popular travel center chain Buc-ee&#x27;s added a store in Royse City.

In 2007, Royse City was designated as an official Texas Main Street City. The Royse City Main Street program was set up to promote the city&#x27;s downtown area, where the goals are to foster a thriving business district, while preserving historic buildings. In 2015, construction was completed on an overpass at Interstate 30 and Erby Campbell Blvd.

==Education==
The entirety of Royse City is served by the Royse City Independent School District. Royse City High School (RCHS) is only high school serving the entirety of Royse City. In the 2024 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; high school rankings, RCHS ranked #569 in Texas and #183 in the Dallas Metro Area.

<doc id="151143" wikidata="Q312698" url="?curid=151143" title="Frederick Delius">
<text>Frederick Theodore Albert Delius (born Fritz Theodor Albert Delius; ; 29 January 1862 – 10 June 1934) was an English composer. Born in Bradford in the north of England to a prosperous mercantile family, he resisted attempts to recruit him to commerce. He was sent to Florida in the United States in 1884 to manage an orange plantation. He soon neglected his managerial duties, and in 1886 returned to Europe.

Having been influenced by African-American music during his short stay in Florida, he began composing. After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany beginning in 1886, he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in Paris and then in nearby Grez-sur-Loing, where he and his wife Jelka lived for the rest of their lives, except during the First World War.

Delius&#x27;s first successes came in Germany, where Hans Haym and other conductors promoted his music from the late 1890s. In Delius&#x27;s native Britain, his music did not make regular appearances in concert programmes until 1907, after Thomas Beecham took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere of &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; in London in 1909 (he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908); he staged the opera &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; at Covent Garden in 1910; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of the composer&#x27;s works. After 1918, Delius began to suffer the effects of syphilis, contracted during his earlier years in Paris. He became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 with the aid of an amanuensis, Eric Fenby.

The lyricism in Delius&#x27;s early compositions reflected the music he had heard in America and the influences of European composers such as Grieg and Wagner. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of chromatic harmony. Delius&#x27;s music has been only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer&#x27;s life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians.

==Life==

===Early years===

Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as Fritz Theodor Albert Delius, and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons – there were also ten daughters – born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, &quot;née&quot; Krönig (1838–1929). Delius&#x27;s parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, and Julius&#x27;s family had already lived for several generations in German lands near the Rhine but was originally Dutch. Julius&#x27;s father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.

The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under George Haddock of Leeds.

Although Delius achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878 he was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary; Delius then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.

Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius&#x27;s first job was as the firm&#x27;s representative in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen&#x27;s denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect that his son would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.

===Florida===
Whether the move to America was Julius&#x27;s idea or his son&#x27;s is unknown. A leading Florida property firm had branches in several English cities including Bradford; in an article on Delius&#x27;s time in Florida, William Randel conjectures that either Julius Delius visited the Bradford office and conceived the notion of sending his wayward son to grow oranges in Florida, or that Fritz himself saw it as a way to escape the hated family wool business and suggested the idea to his father. Delius was in Florida from the spring of 1884 to the autumn of 1885, living on a plantation at Solano Grove on the Saint Johns River, about 35 miles (55 kilometres) south of Jacksonville. He continued to be engrossed in music, and in Jacksonville he met Thomas Ward, who became his teacher in counterpoint and composition. Delius later said that Ward&#x27;s teaching was the only useful music instruction he ever had.
Delius later liked to represent his house at Solano Grove as &quot;a shanty&quot;, but it was a substantial cottage of four rooms, with plenty of space for Delius to entertain guests. Ward sometimes stayed there, as did an old Bradford friend, Charles Douglas, and Delius&#x27;s brother Ernest. Protected from excessive summer heat by river breezes and a canopy of oak trees, the house was an agreeable place to live in. Delius paid little attention to the business of growing oranges, and continued to pursue his musical interests. Jacksonville had a rich, though to a European, unorthodox musical life. Randel notes that in local hotels, the African-American waiters doubled as singers, with daily vocal concerts for patrons and passers-by, giving Delius his introduction to spirituals. Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. &quot;Delius never forgot the singing as he heard it, day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; it is hard to imagine conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges – or more conducive to composing.&quot;

While in Florida, Delius had his first composition published, a polka for piano called &quot;Zum Carnival&quot;. In late 1885 he left a caretaker in charge of Solano Grove and moved to Danville, Virginia. Thereafter he pursued a wholly musical career. An advertisement in the local paper announced, &quot;Fritz Delius will begin at once giving instruction in Piano, Violin, Theory and Composition. He will give lessons at the residences of his pupils. Terms reasonable.&quot; Delius also offered lessons in French and German. Danville had a thriving musical life, and early works of his were publicly performed there.

===Illegitimate son===
During his time in Florida, Delius is alleged to have fathered a son with a local African-American woman named Chloe. Upon Delius&#x27;s return to Florida some years later to sell the plantation, it was suggested that Chloe, fearing that he had come to take her son away from her, fled with the child and disappeared. In the 1990s the violinist Tasmin Little embarked on a search for descendants of Delius&#x27;s alleged love-child. Little believes that his failure to track down his son had been a significant influence in the tone of his works thereafter.

===Leipzig and Paris===

In 1886, Julius Delius finally agreed to allow his son to pursue a musical career, and paid for him to study music formally. Delius left Danville and returned to Europe via New York, where he paused briefly to give a few lessons. Back in Europe he enrolled at the conservatoire in Leipzig, Germany. Leipzig was a major musical centre, where Arthur Nikisch and Gustav Mahler were conductors at the Opera House, and Brahms and Tchaikovsky conducted their works at the Gewandhaus. At the conservatoire, Delius made little progress in his piano studies under Carl Reinecke, but Salomon Jadassohn praised his hard work and grasp of counterpoint; Delius also resumed studies under Hans Sitt. Delius&#x27;s early biographer, the composer Patrick Hadley, observed that no trace of his academic tuition can be found in Delius&#x27;s mature music &quot;except in certain of the weaker passages&quot;. Much more important to Delius&#x27;s development was meeting the composer Edvard Grieg in Leipzig. Grieg, like Ward before him, recognised Delius&#x27;s potential. In the spring of 1888, Sitt conducted Delius&#x27;s &quot;Florida Suite&quot; for an audience of three: Grieg, Christian Sinding and the composer. Grieg and Sinding were enthusiastic and became warm supporters of Delius. At a dinner party in London in April 1888, Grieg finally convinced Julius Delius that his son&#x27;s future lay in music.

After leaving Leipzig in 1888, Delius moved to Paris where his uncle, Theodore, took him under his wing and looked after him socially and financially. Over the next eight years, Delius befriended many writers and artists, including August Strindberg, Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin. He mixed very little with French musicians, although Florent Schmitt arranged the piano scores of Delius&#x27;s first two operas, &quot;Irmelin&quot; and &quot;The Magic Fountain&quot; (Ravel later did the same for his &quot;verismo&quot; opera &quot;Margot la rouge&quot;). As a result, his music never became widely known in France. Delius&#x27;s biographer Diana McVeagh says of these years that Delius &quot;was found to be attractive, warm-hearted, spontaneous, and amorous&quot;. It is generally believed that during this period he contracted the syphilis that caused the collapse of his health in later years.

Delius&#x27;s Paris years were musically productive. His symphonic poem &quot;Paa Vidderne&quot; was performed in Christiania in 1891 and in Monte Carlo in 1894; Gunnar Heiberg commissioned Delius to provide incidental music for his play &quot;Folkeraadet&quot; in 1897; and Delius&#x27;s second opera, &quot;The Magic Fountain&quot;, was accepted for staging at Prague, but the project fell through for unknown reasons. Other works of the period were the fantasy overture &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (1895–1897) and orchestral variations, &quot;Appalachia: Variations on an Old Slave Song&quot; (1896, rewritten in 1904 for voices and orchestra).

===First successes===

In 1897, Delius met the German artist Jelka Rosen, who later became his wife. She was a professional painter, a friend of Auguste Rodin, and a regular exhibitor at the Salon des Indépendants. Jelka quickly declared her admiration for the young composer&#x27;s music, and the couple were drawn closer together by a shared passion for the works of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and the music of Grieg. Jelka bought a house in Grez-sur-Loing, a village outside Paris on the edge of Fontainebleau. Delius visited her there, and after a brief return visit to Florida, he moved in with her.

In 1903 they married, and, apart from a short period when the area was threatened by the advancing German army during the First World War, Delius lived in Grez for the rest of his life. The marriage was not conventional: Jelka was, at first, the principal earner; there were no children; and Delius was not a faithful husband. Jelka was often distressed by his affairs, but her devotion did not waver.

In the same year, Delius began a fruitful association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, which he gave under its German title &quot;Über die Berge in die Ferne&quot; on 13 November 1897, believed to be the first time Delius&#x27;s music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James&#x27;s Hall in London, which included &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, a choral piece, &quot;Mitternachtslied&quot;, and excerpts from the opera &quot;Koanga&quot;. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius&#x27;s orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.

The orchestral work &quot;&quot; was composed in 1899 and dedicated to Haym. He gave the premiere at Elberfeld on 14 December 1901. It provoked some critical comment from the local newspaper, which complained that the composer put his listeners on a bus and shuttled them from one Parisian night-spot to another, &quot;but he does not let us hear the tuneful gypsy melodies in the boulevard cafés, always just cymbals and tambourine and mostly from two cabarets at the same time at that&quot;. The work was given under Busoni in Berlin less than a year later.

Most of Delius&#x27;s premieres of this period were given by Haym and his fellow German conductors. In 1904 Cassirer premiered &quot;Koanga&quot;, and in the same year the Piano Concerto was given in Elberfeld, and &quot;Lebenstanz&quot; in Düsseldorf. &quot;Appalachia&quot; (choral orchestral variations on an old slave song, also inspired by Florida) followed there in 1905. &quot;Sea Drift&quot; (a cantata with words taken from a poem by Walt Whitman) was premiered at Essen in 1906, and the opera &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; in Berlin in 1907. Delius&#x27;s reputation in Germany remained high until the First World War; in 1910 his rhapsody &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; was performed by 36 different German orchestras.

===Growing reputation===

By 1907, thanks to performances of his works in many German cities, Delius was, as Thomas Beecham said, &quot;floating safely on a wave of prosperity which increased as the year went on&quot;. Henry Wood premiered the revised version of Delius&#x27;s Piano Concerto that year. Also in 1907, Cassirer conducted some concerts in London, at one of which, with Beecham&#x27;s New Symphony Orchestra, he presented &quot;Appalachia&quot;. Beecham, who had until then heard not a note of Delius&#x27;s music, expressed his &quot;wonderment&quot; and became a lifelong devotee of the composer&#x27;s works. In January 1908, he conducted the British premiere of &quot;Paris: The Song of a Great City&quot;. Later that year, Beecham introduced &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; to London audiences, and Enrique Fernández Arbós presented &quot;Lebenstanz&quot;.

In 1909, Beecham conducted the first complete performance of &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;, the largest and most ambitious of Delius&#x27;s concert works, written for four soloists, a double choir, and a large orchestra. Although the work was based on the same Nietzsche work as Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure. Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of Elgar; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct &quot;Paris&quot; – &quot;the symphonic development seems to me to be too scant, and it seems moreover to be an imitation of Charpentier&quot;.

In the early years of the 20th century, Delius composed some of his most popular works, including &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; (1907), &quot;In a Summer Garden&quot; (1908, revised 1911), &quot;Summer Night on the River&quot; (1911), and &quot;On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring&quot; (1912), of which McVeagh comments, &quot;These exquisite idylls, for all their composer&#x27;s German descent and French domicile, spell &#x27;England&#x27; for most listeners.&quot; In 1910, Beecham put on an opera season at the Royal Opera House in London. Having access to the Beecham family&#x27;s considerable fortune, he ignored commercial considerations and programmed several works of limited box-office appeal, including &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The reviews were polite, but &quot;The Times&quot;, having praised the orchestral aspects of the score, commented, &quot;Mr. Delius seems to have remarkably little sense of dramatic writing for the voice&quot;. Other reviewers agreed that the score contained passages of great beauty, but was ineffective as drama.

===War and post-war===
During the First World War, Delius and Jelka moved from Grez to avoid the hostilities. They took up temporary residence in the south of England, where Delius continued to compose. In 1915, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; published a profile of him by his admirer, the composer Philip Heseltine (known as &quot;Peter Warlock&quot;), who commented:

[H]e holds no official position in the musical life of the country [i.e. Britain]; he does not teach in any of the academies, he is not even an honorary professor or doctor of music. He never gives concerts or makes propaganda for his music; he never conducts an orchestra, or plays an instrument in public (even Berlioz played the tambourine!)
Heseltine depicted Delius as a composer uncompromisingly focused on his own music. &quot;There can be no superficial view of Delius&#x27;s music: either one feels it in the very depths of one&#x27;s being, or not at all. This may be a part of the reason why one so seldom hears a really first-rate performance of Delius&#x27;s work, save under Mr. Beecham&quot;.

One of Delius&#x27;s major wartime works was his &quot;Requiem&quot;, dedicated &quot;to the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war&quot;. The work owes nothing to the traditional Christian liturgy, eschewing notions of an afterlife and celebrating instead a pantheistic renewal of Nature. When Albert Coates presented the work in London in 1922, its atheism offended some believers. This attitude persisted long after Delius&#x27;s death, as the &quot;Requiem&quot; did not receive another performance in the UK until 1965, and by 1980 had still had only seven performances world-wide. In Germany, the regular presentation of Delius&#x27;s works ceased at the outbreak of the war, and never resumed. Nevertheless, his standing with some continental musicians was unaffected; Beecham records that Bartók and Kodály were admirers of Delius, and the former grew into the habit of sending his compositions to Delius for comment and tried to interest him in both Hungarian and Romanian popular music.

By the end of the war, Delius and Jelka had returned to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he had probably contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius&#x27;s medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor H. Balfour Gardiner bought the house at Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka to live there rent-free. 

Beecham was temporarily absent from the concert hall and opera house between 1920 and 1923, but Coates gave the first performance of &quot;A Song of the High Hills&quot; in 1920, and Henry Wood and Hamilton Harty programmed Delius&#x27;s music with the Queen&#x27;s Hall and Hallé Orchestras. Wood gave the British première of the Double Concerto for violin and cello in 1920, and of &quot;A Song Before Sunrise&quot; and the &quot;Dance Rhapsody No. 2&quot; in 1923. Delius had a financial and artistic success with his incidental music for James Elroy Flecker&#x27;s play &quot;Hassan&quot; (1923), with 281 performances at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. With Beecham&#x27;s return the composer became, in Hadley&#x27;s words, &quot;what his most fervent admirers had never envisaged – a genuine popular success&quot;. Hadley cites, in particular, the six-day Delius festival at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1929 under Beecham&#x27;s general direction, in the presence of the composer in his bath-chair. &quot;[T]he cream of his orchestral output with and without soli and chorus was included&quot;, and the hall was filled. Beecham was assisted in the organisation of the festival by Philip Heseltine, who wrote the detailed programme notes for three of the six concerts. The festival included chamber music and songs, an excerpt from &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the Piano and Violin Concertos, and premières of &quot;Cynara&quot; and &quot;A Late Lark&quot;, concluding with &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;.
The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; music critic, Neville Cardus, met Delius during the festival. He describes the wreck of the composer&#x27;s physique, yet &quot;there was nothing pitiable about him ... his face was strong and disdainful, every line graven on it by intrepid living&quot;. Delius, Cardus says, spoke with a noticeable Yorkshire accent as he dismissed most English music as paper music that should never be heard, written by people &quot;afraid of their feelin&#x27;s&quot;.

===Last years===
A young English admirer, Eric Fenby, learning that Delius was trying to compose by dictating to Jelka, volunteered his services as an unpaid amanuensis. For five years, from 1928, he worked with Delius, taking down his new compositions from dictation, and helping him revise earlier works. Together they produced &quot;Cynara&quot; (a setting of words by Ernest Dowson), &quot;A Late Lark&quot; (a setting of W. E. Henley), &quot;A Song of Summer&quot;, a third violin sonata, the &quot;Irmelin&quot; prelude, and &quot;Idyll&quot; (1932), which reused music from Delius&#x27;s short opera &quot;Margot la rouge&quot;, composed thirty years earlier. McVeagh rates their greatest joint production as &quot;The Songs of Farewell&quot;, settings of Whitman poems for chorus and orchestra, which were dedicated to Jelka. Other works produced in this period include a &quot;Caprice and Elegy&quot; for cello and orchestra written for the distinguished British cellist Beatrice Harrison, and a short orchestral piece, &quot;Fantastic Dance&quot;, which Delius dedicated to Fenby. The violin sonata incorporates the first, incomprehensible, melody that Delius had attempted to dictate to Fenby before their &quot;modus operandi&quot; had been worked out. Fenby&#x27;s initial failure to pick up the tune led Delius to the view that &quot;[the] boy is no good ... he cannot even take down a simple melody&quot;. Fenby later wrote a book about his experiences of working with Delius. Among other details, Fenby reveals Delius&#x27;s love of cricket. The pair followed the 1930 Test series between England and Australia with great interest, and regaled a bemused Jelka with accounts of their boyhood exploits in the game. In 1932, Delius was awarded the Freedom of the City of Bradford.
In 1933, the year before both composers died, Elgar, who had flown to Paris to conduct a performance of his Violin Concerto, visited Delius at Grez. Delius was not on the whole an admirer of Elgar&#x27;s music, but the two men took to each other, and there followed a warm correspondence until Elgar&#x27;s death in February 1934. Elgar described Delius as &quot;a poet and a visionary&quot;.

Delius died at Grez on 10 June 1934, aged 72. He had wished to be buried in his own garden, but the French authorities forbade it. His alternative wish, despite his atheism, was to be buried &quot;in some country churchyard in the south of England, where people could place wild flowers&quot;. At this time Jelka was too ill to make the journey across the Channel, and Delius was temporarily buried in the local cemetery at Grez.

By May 1935, Jelka felt she had enough strength to undertake the crossing to attend a reburial in England. She chose St Peter&#x27;s church, Limpsfield, Surrey as the site for the grave. She sailed to England for the service, but became ill &quot;en route&quot;, and on arrival was taken to hospital in Dover and then Kensington in London, missing the reburial on 26 May. The ceremony took place at midnight; the headline in the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; was &quot;Sixty People Under Flickering Lamps In A Surrey Churchyard&quot;. The vicar offered a prayer: &quot;May the souls of the departed through the mercy of God rest in peace.&quot; Jelka died two days later, on 28 May. She was buried in the same grave as Delius.

==Music==
===Influences===

After the 1929 London festival &quot;The Times&quot; music critic wrote that Delius &quot;belongs to no school, follows no tradition and is like no other composer in the form, content or style of his music&quot;. This &quot;extremely individual and personal idiom&quot; was, however, the product of a long musical apprenticeship, during which the composer absorbed many influences. The earliest significant experiences in his artistic development came, Delius later asserted, from the sounds of the plantation songs carried down the river to him at Solano Grove. It was this singing, he told Fenby, that first gave him the urge to express himself in music; thus, writes Fenby, many of Delius&#x27;s early works are &quot;redolent of Negro hymnology and folk-song&quot;, a sound &quot;not heard before in the orchestra, and seldom since&quot;. Delius&#x27;s familiarity with &quot;black&quot; music possibly predates his American adventures; during the 1870s a popular singing group, the Fisk Jubilee Singers from Nashville, Tennessee, toured Britain and Europe, giving several well-received concerts in Bradford. When Delius wrote to Elgar in 1933 of the &quot;beautiful four-part harmonies&quot; of the black plantation workers, he may have been unconsciously alluding to the spirituals sung by the Fisk group.

At Leipzig, Delius became a fervent disciple of Wagner, whose technique of continuous music he sought to master. An ability to construct long musical paragraphs is, according to the Delius scholar Christopher Palmer, Delius&#x27;s lasting debt to Wagner, from whom he also acquired a knowledge of chromatic harmonic technique, &quot;an endlessly proliferating sensuousness of sound&quot;. Grieg, however, was perhaps the composer who influenced him more than any other. The Norwegian composer, like Delius, found his primary inspiration in nature and in folk-melodies, and was the stimulus for the Norwegian flavour that characterises much of Delius&#x27;s early music. The music writer Anthony Payne observes that Grieg&#x27;s &quot;airy texture and non-developing use of chromaticism showed [Delius] how to lighten the Wagnerian load&quot;. Early in his career Delius drew inspiration from Chopin, later from his own contemporaries Ravel and Richard Strauss, and from the much younger Percy Grainger, who first brought the tune of &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; to Delius&#x27;s notice.

According to Palmer, it is arguable that Delius gained his sense of direction as a composer from his French contemporary Claude Debussy. Palmer identifies aesthetic similarities between the two, and points to several parallel characteristics and enthusiasms. Both were inspired early in their careers by Grieg, both admired Chopin; they are also linked in their musical depictions of the sea, and in their uses of the wordless voice. The opening of &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; is described by Palmer as &quot;perhaps the most Debussian moment in Delius&quot;. Debussy, in a review of Delius&#x27;s &quot;Two Danish Songs&quot; for soprano and orchestra given in a concert on 16 March 1901, wrote: &quot;They are very sweet, very pale – music to soothe convalescents in well-to-do neighbourhoods&quot;. Delius admired the French composer&#x27;s orchestration, but thought his works lacking in melody – the latter a comment frequently directed against Delius&#x27;s own music. Fenby, however, draws attention to Delius&#x27;s &quot;flights of melodic poetic-prose&quot;, while conceding that the composer was contemptuous of public taste, of &quot;giving the public what they wanted&quot; in the form of pretty tunes.

===Stylistic development===
From the conventional forms of his early music, over the course of his creative career Delius developed a style easily recognisable and &quot;unlike the work of any other&quot;, according to Payne. As he gradually found his voice, Delius replaced the methods developed during his creative infancy with a more mature style in which Payne discerns &quot;an increasing richness of chord structure, bearing with it its own subtle means of contrast and development&quot;. Hubert Foss, the Oxford University Press&#x27;s musical editor during the 1920s and 1930s, writes that rather than creating his music from the known possibilities of instruments, Delius &quot;thought the sounds first&quot; and then sought the means for producing these particular sounds. Delius&#x27;s full stylistic maturity dates from around 1907, when he began to write the series of works on which his main reputation rests. In the more mature works Foss observes Delius&#x27;s increasing rejection of conventional forms such as sonata or concerto; Delius&#x27;s music, he comments, is &quot;certainly not architectural; nearer to painting, especially to the &quot;pointilliste&quot; style of design&quot;. The painting analogy is echoed by Cardus.

====Towards recognition====
Delius&#x27;s first orchestral compositions were, in Christopher Palmer&#x27;s words, the work of &quot;an insipid if charming water-colourist&quot;. The &quot;Florida Suite&quot; (1887, revised 1889) is &quot;an expertly crafted synthesis of Grieg and Negroid Americana&quot;, while Delius&#x27;s first opera &quot;Irmelin&quot; (1890–1892) lacks any identifiably Delian passages. Its harmony and modulation are conventional, and the work bears the clear fingerprints of Wagner and Grieg. Payne asserts that none of the works prior to 1895 are of lasting interest. The first noticeable stylistic advance is evident in &quot;Koanga&quot; (1895–1897), with richer chords and faster harmonic rhythms; here we find Delius &quot;feeling his way towards the vein that he was soon to tap so surely&quot;. In &quot;Paris&quot; (1899), the orchestration owes a debt to Richard Strauss; its passages of quiet beauty, says Payne, nevertheless lack the deep personal involvement of the later works. &quot;Paris&quot;, the final work of Delius&#x27;s apprentice years, is described by Foss as &quot;one of the most complete, if not the greatest, of Delius&#x27;s musical paintings&quot;.

In each of the major works written in the years after &quot;Paris&quot;, Delius combined orchestral and vocal forces. The first of these works was &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot;, a music drama which departs from the normal operatic structure of acts and scenes and tells its story of tragic love in a series of tableaux. Musically it shows a considerable advance in style from the early operas of the apprentice years. The entr&#x27;acte known as &quot;The Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot; is described by Heseltine as showing &quot;all the tragic beauty of mortality ... concentrated and poured forth in music of overwhelming, almost intolerable poignancy&quot;. In this work Delius begins to achieve the texture of sound that characterised all his later compositions. Delius&#x27;s music is often assumed to lack melody and form. Cardus argues that melody, while not a primary factor, is there abundantly, &quot;floating and weaving itself into the texture of shifting harmony&quot; – a characteristic which Cardus believes is shared only by Debussy.

Delius&#x27;s next work, &quot;Appalachia&quot;, introduces a further feature that recurred in later pieces – the use of the voice instrumentally in wordless singing, in this case depicting the distant plantation songs that had inspired Delius at Solano Grove. Although Payne argues that &quot;Appalachia&quot; shows only a limited advance in technique, Fenby identifies one orchestral passage as the first expression of Delius&#x27;s idea of &quot;the transitoriness of all mortal things mirrored in nature&quot;. Hereafter, whole works rather than brief passages would be informed by this idea. The transitional phase of the composer&#x27;s career concludes with three further vocal pieces: &quot;Sea Drift&quot; (1903), &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; (1904–05), and &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot; (1906–07). Payne salutes each of these as masterpieces, in which the Delian style struggles to emerge in its full ripeness. Fenby describes &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; as standing outside the general progression of Delius&#x27;s work, &quot;a vast parenthesis&quot;, unlike anything else he wrote, but nevertheless an essential ingredient in his development.

====Full flowering====
&quot;Brigg Fair&quot; (1907) announced the composer&#x27;s full stylistic maturity, the first of the pieces for orchestra that confirm Delius&#x27;s status as a musical poet, with the influences of Wagner and Grieg almost entirely absent. The work was followed in the next few years by &quot;In a Summer Garden&quot; (1908), &quot;Life&#x27;s Dance&quot;, &quot;Summer Night on the River&quot; (both 1911) and &quot;On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring&quot; (1912). The critic R. W. S. Mendl described this sequence as &quot;exquisite nature studies&quot;, with a unity and shape lacking in the earlier formal tone poems. These works became part of the standard English concert repertory, and helped to establish the character of Delius&#x27;s music in the English concert-goer&#x27;s mind, although according to Ernest Newman, the concentration on these works to the neglect of his wider output may have done Delius as much harm as good. The typical mature Delian orchestral sound is apparent in these works, through the division of the strings into ten or more sections, punctuated by woodwind comments and decorations. In the &quot;North Country Sketches&quot; of 1913–14, Delius divides the strings into 12 parts, and harps, horns, clarinets and bassoons evoke a lifeless winter scene. In Payne&#x27;s view, the &quot;Sketches&quot; are the high-water mark of Delius&#x27;s compositional skill, although Fenby awards the accolade to the later &quot;Eventyr (Once Upon a Time)&quot; (1917).

During this period Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he produced his final opera, &quot;Fennimore and Gerda&quot; (1908–1910), like &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; written in tableau form, but in his mature style. His choral works of the period, notably &quot;An Arabesque&quot; and &quot;A Song of the High Hills&quot; (both 1911) are among the most radical of Delius&#x27;s writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus&#x27;s verdict, however, is that Delius&#x27;s chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in the quantity and quality of Delius&#x27;s output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to &quot;Hassan&quot; (1920–1923) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius&#x27;s best work.

====Final phase====
The four-year association with Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius&#x27;s early career. The first of the major works was the orchestral &quot;A Song of Summer&quot;, based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of &quot;A Poem of Life and Love&quot;. In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to &quot;imagine that we are sitting on the cliffs in the heather, looking out over the sea&quot;. This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking. The other major work, a setting of Walt Whitman poems with the title &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot;, was an even more alarming prospect to Fenby: &quot;the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings ...&quot; combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work – yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932. Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its &quot;hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;&quot;. Payne describes the work as &quot;bracing and exultant, with in places an almost Holstian clarity&quot;.

===Reception===
Recognition came late to Delius; before 1899, when he was already 37, his works were largely unpublished and unknown to the public. When the symphonic poem &quot;Paa Vidderne&quot; was performed at Monte Carlo on 25 February 1894 in a programme of works from British composers, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; listed the composers as &quot;... Balfe, Mackenzie, Oakeley, Sullivan ... and one Delius, whoever he may be&quot;. The work was well received in Monte Carlo, and brought the composer a congratulatory letter from Princess Alice of Monaco, but this did not lead to demands for further performances of this or other Delius works. Some of his individual songs (he wrote more than 60) were occasionally included in vocal recitals; referring to &quot;the strange songs of Fritz Delius&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; critic expressed regret &quot;that the powers the composer undoubtedly possesses should not be turned to better account or undergo proper development at the hands of some musician competent to train them&quot;.

Of the May 1899 concert at St. James&#x27;s Hall, London, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; reviewer remarked on the rawness of some of the music, but praised the &quot;boldness of conception and virile strength that command and hold attention&quot;. Beecham, however, records that despite this &quot;fair show of acclaim&quot;, for all the impetus it gave to future performances of Delius&#x27;s work the event might never have happened; none of the music was heard again in England for many years. Delius was much better received in Germany, where a series of successful performances of his works led to what Beecham describes as a Delius vogue there, &quot;second only to that of Richard Strauss&quot;.

In England, a performance of the Piano Concerto on 22 October 1907 at the Queen&#x27;s Hall was praised for the brilliance of the soloist, Theodor Szántó, and for the power of the music itself. From that point onwards the music of Delius became increasingly familiar to both British and European audiences, as performances of his works proliferated. Beecham&#x27;s presentation of &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in June 1909 did not inspire Hans Haym, who had come from Elberfeld for the concert, though Beecham says that many professional and amateur musicians thought it &quot;the most impressive and original achievement of its genre written in the last fifty years&quot; Some reviewers continued to doubt the popular appeal of Delius&#x27;s music, while others were more specifically hostile.

From 1910, Delius&#x27;s works began to be heard in America: &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; and &quot;In a Summer Garden&quot; were performed in 1910–11 by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Walter Damrosch. In November 1915 Grainger gave the first American performance of the Piano Concerto, again with the New York Philharmonic. The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic described the work as uneven; richly harmonious, but combining colour and beauty with effects &quot;of an almost crass unskillfulness and ugliness&quot;.

For the rest of his lifetime Delius&#x27;s more popular pieces were performed in England and abroad, often under the sponsorship of Beecham, who was primarily responsible for the Delius festival in October–November 1929. In a retrospective comment on the festival &quot;The Times&quot; critic wrote of full houses and an apparent enthusiasm for &quot;music which hitherto has enjoyed no exceptional vogue&quot;, but wondered whether this new acceptance was based on a solid foundation. After Delius&#x27;s death Beecham continued to promote his works; a second festival was held in 1946, and a third (after Beecham&#x27;s death) at Bradford in 1962, to celebrate the centenary of Delius&#x27;s birth. These occasions were in the face of a general indifference to the music; writing in the centenary year, the musicologist Deryck Cooke opined that at that time, &quot;to declare oneself a confirmed Delian is hardly less self-defamatory than to admit to being an addict of cocaine and marihuana&quot;.

Beecham had died in 1961, and Fenby writes that it &quot;seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius&#x27;s music from extinction&quot;, such was the conductor&#x27;s unique mastery over the music. However, other conductors have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of &quot;develop[ing] a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius&quot;. The music has never become fashionable, a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius&#x27;s music is an &quot;acquired taste&quot;, Fenby answers: &quot;The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or the sound of it is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few.&quot; Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius&#x27;s death, the &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as &quot;a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music&quot;. His music&#x27;s abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it &quot;recollects emotion in tranquillity ... Delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event&quot;.

==Memorials and legacy==

Just before his death, Delius prepared a codicil to his will whereby the royalties on future performances of his music would be used to support an annual concert of works by young composers. Delius died before this provision could be legally effected; Fenby says that Beecham then persuaded Jelka in her own will to abandon the concerts idea and apply the royalties towards the editing and recording of Delius&#x27;s main works. After Jelka&#x27;s death in 1935 the Delius Trust was established, to supervise this task. As stipulated in Jelka&#x27;s will, the Trust operated largely under Beecham&#x27;s direction. After Beecham&#x27;s death in 1961 advisers were appointed to assist the trustees, and in 1979 the administration of the Trust was taken over by the Musicians&#x27; Benevolent Fund. Over the years the Trust&#x27;s objectives have been extended so that it can promote the music of other composers who were Delius&#x27;s contemporaries. The Trust is a co-sponsor of the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s Composition Prize for young composers.

Herbert Stothart made arrangements of Delius&#x27;s music, particularly &quot;Appalachia&quot;, for the 1946 film &quot;The Yearling&quot;.

In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius&#x27;s music who had gone to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is independent from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius&#x27;s life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius&#x27;s music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius&#x27;s death.

Public interest in Delius&#x27;s life was stimulated in the UK in 1968, with the showing of the Ken Russell film &quot;Song of Summer&quot; on BBC Television. The film depicted the years of the Delius–Fenby collaboration; Fenby co-scripted with Russell. Max Adrian played Delius, with Christopher Gable as Fenby and Maureen Pryor as Jelka.

In America, a small memorial to Delius stands in Solano Grove. The Delius Association of Florida has for many years organised an annual festival at Jacksonville, to mark the composer&#x27;s birthday. At Jacksonville University, the Music Faculty awards an annual Delius Composition Prize. In February 2012 Delius was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; stamps set.

Beecham stresses Delius&#x27;s role as an innovator: &quot;The best of Delius is undoubtedly to be found in those works where he disregarded classical traditions and created his own forms&quot;. Fenby echoes this: &quot;the people who really count are those who discover new ways of making our lives more beautiful. Frederick Delius was such a man&quot;. Palmer writes that Delius&#x27;s true legacy is the ability of his music to inspire the creative urge in its listeners and to enhance their awareness of the wonders of life. Palmer concludes by invoking George Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Choir Invisible&quot;: &quot;Frederick Delius ... belongs to the company of those true artists for whose life and work the world is a better place to live in, and of whom surely is composed, in a literal sense, &#x27;the choir invisible/Whose music is the gladness of the world&#x27;&quot;.

==Recordings==
The first recordings of Delius&#x27;s works, in 1927, were conducted by Beecham for the Columbia label: the &quot;Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot; interlude from &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring&quot;, performed by the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. These began a long series of Delius recordings under Beecham that continued for the rest of the conductor&#x27;s life. He was not alone, however; Geoffrey Toye in 1929–30 recorded &quot;Brigg Fair&quot;, &quot;In a Summer Garden&quot;, &quot;Summer Night on the River&quot; and the &quot;Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot;. Fenby recounts that on his first day in Grez, Jelka played Beecham&#x27;s &quot;First Cuckoo&quot; recording. In May 1934, when Delius was close to death, Fenby played him Toye&#x27;s &quot;In a Summer Garden&quot;, the last music, Fenby says, that Delius ever heard. By the end of the 1930s Beecham had issued versions for Columbia of most of the main orchestral and choral works, together with several songs in which he accompanied the soprano Dora Labbette on the piano. By 1936 Columbia and HMV had issued recordings of Violin Sonatas 1 and 2, the &quot;Elegy and Caprice&quot;, and of some of the shorter works.

Full recordings of the operas were not available until after the Second World War. Once again Beecham, now with the HMV label, led the way, with &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1948, performed by the new Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. Later versions of this work include those of Meredith Davies for EMI in 1971, Charles Mackerras for Argo in 1989, and a German-language version conducted by Klauspeter Seibel in 1995. Beecham&#x27;s former protégé Norman Del Mar recorded a complete &quot;Irmelin&quot; for BBC Digital in 1985. In 1997 EMI reissued Meredith Davies&#x27;s 1976 recording of &quot;Fennimore and Gerda&quot;, which Richard Hickox conducted in German the same year for Chandos. Recordings of all the major works, and of many of the individual songs, have been issued at regular intervals since the Second World War. Many of these recordings have been issued in conjunction with the Delius Society, which has prepared various discographies of Delius&#x27;s recorded music.

Purchasing from Collin County, Sachse erected the first cotton mills and gins in the county. After Sachse gave 100 feet of frontage through all of his holdings to the railroad in 1886, the railroad built a depot on the frontage and named the town Sachse. Since the depot was labeled &#x27;Saxie&#x27;, many old legal documents referred to the city as &#x27;Saxie&#x27;. The flaw was corrected in 1892. The word Sachse comes from the German word for Saxon.

<text>Wylie is a city and northeastern suburb of Dallas, that was once solely located in Collin County, but now extends into neighboring Dallas and Rockwall counties in the U.S. state of Texas. It is located on State Route 78 about northeast of central Dallas and centrally located between nearby Lavon Lake and Lake Ray Hubbard.

==History==

Originally called Nickelville, reportedly after the name of the first store, it was organized in the early 1870s. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway laid tracks a half mile north of the original townsite in 1886. The businesses of Nickelville moved to take advantage of the railroad within the following year, and the City of Wylie was incorporated in 1887 along the right-of-way. It was named for Lt. Colonel William D. Wylie, a right-of-way agent for the railroad and Civil War veteran.

That same year, Wylie had given itself its name, established a post office branch, and incorporated, choosing an alderman form of government. Two years later, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway reached the town. The two railroads and the rich agricultural region of the Blackland Prairies contributed to the town&#x27;s growth. In 1890, Wylie had a population of 400 and the first one-room school house was built. By 1900, it had grown to 773. In the next decade, the population tripled. Before 1920, the community had over 35 businesses, including two banks, a school, and a weekly newspaper.

Unlike many rural Texas communities, Wylie grew during the Great Depression years, reaching 914 residents by 1940. In part, this was a result of increased dairy farming to meet the demands of nearby Dallas. Following World War II, the population increase continued.

Onions were the town&#x27;s cash crop in the 1930s and 1940s. &quot;Wide Awake Wylie&quot; became the city&#x27;s nickname in the late 1940s and 1950s, a result of late night get-togethers of its citizens and businesses that stayed open until midnight on some evenings.

Designed to provide water for towns in four counties, the construction of the Lavon Dam and Reservoir north of town, and the selection of Wylie to house the offices of the North Texas Municipal Water District, pushed the population to 1,804 in 1960.

In the 1990s, Wylie had two disasters. On May 9, 1993 (Mother&#x27;s Day), a tornado ravaged downtown Wylie. In December 1998, two fires destroyed and damaged several businesses. After that, the downtown area was renovated, while preserving the many century-old buildings that remained standing. On April 11, 2016, a hail storm struck Wylie that produced softball-sized hailstones and damaged an estimated 80% of homes in the city, causing over $240 million in damage.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 35.317 square miles, of which 21.037 square miles are land and 14.280 square miles, or 40.43%, are covered by water. Wylie is part of the subtropical region, with hot, dry summers and cold, mild, rainy winters.

<text>New Braunfels ( ) is a city in Comal and Guadalupe counties in the U.S. state of Texas. It is the seat of Comal County. The city covers and had a population of 90,403 as of the 2020 Census. A suburb just north of San Antonio, and part of the Greater San Antonio metropolitan area, it was the third-fastest-growing city in the United States from 2010 to 2020. As of 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates its population at 104,707.

New Braunfels is known for its German Texan heritage.

==History==
New Braunfels was established in 1845 by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, Commissioner General of the Mainzer Adelsverein, also known as the Noblemen&#x27;s Society. Prince Carl named the settlement in honor of his home of Solms-Braunfels, Germany.

The Adelsverein organized hundreds of people in Germany to settle in Texas. Immigrants from Germany began arriving at Galveston in July 1844. Most then traveled by ship to Indianola in December 1844, and began the overland journey to the Fisher-Miller land grant purchased by Prince Carl. At the urging of John Coffee Hays, who realized the settlers would not have time to build homes and plant crops further inland before winter, and as the German settlers were traveling inland along the Guadalupe River, they stopped near the Comal Springs. Prince Carl bought two leagues of land from Rafael Garza and Maria Antonio Veramendi Garza for $1,111.00.

The land was located northeast of San Antonio on El Camino Real de los Tejas and had the strong freshwater Comal Springs, known as &quot;Las Fontanas&quot;, when the Germans arrived. It was about halfway between Indianola and the lower portions of the Fisher-Miller land grant. The first settlers forded the Guadalupe River on Good Friday, March 21, 1845, near the present-day Faust Street bridge.

As the spring of 1845 progressed, the settlers built the &quot;Zinkenburg&quot;, a fort named for Adelsverein civil engineer Nicolaus Zink, divided the land, and began building homes and planting crops. Prince Carl would also lay the cornerstone for the Sophienburg, a permanent fort and center for the immigrant association.

In 1844, Prince Carl was so disillusioned with the logistics of the colonization that he asked the Verein to remove him as commissioner-general and appoint a successor. When John O. Meusebach arrived, the finances were in disarray, due in part to Prince Carl&#x27;s lack of business experience and his refusal to keep financial records. To a larger degree, the financial situation happened because the Adelsverein was an organization of noblemen with no practical backgrounds at running businesses. They were on the other side of the world and did not witness the situation with which both Prince Carl and Meusebach were dealing. Henry Francis Fisher had not supplied transport and supplies for which the Verein advanced money to him. Meusebach found Prince Carl in Galveston trying to return to Germany, detained by authorities for unpaid bills. Meusebach made good on the debts, so Prince Carl could depart.

Meusebach discovered that Prince Carl&#x27;s choice of the inadequate Carlshafen (Indianola) as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was deliberately chosen to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans. According to Nicolaus Zink, Prince Carl had planned to establish a German feudal state by secretly bringing in immigrants and placing them in military fortresses. Meusebach, who had renounced his own title of nobility, took a different approach and invited Americans to settle in the Vereins territory.
Prince Carl, being an officer of the Imperial Army of Austria, had kept a uniformed military unit at the ready in Indianola. Meusebach converted the military unit to a more needed work detail. A finance and business structure for the colony was put in place by Meusebach. He also provided for adequate food and shelter for the colonists. On August 11, 1845, Hermann Friedrich Seele became the first teacher for the German-English school in New Braunfels. Meusebach established friendly relations with a local tribe of Waco Indians. Upon seeing his reddish-blonde hair, they called him &quot;Ma-be-quo-si-to-mu&quot;, &quot;Chief with the burning hair of the head&quot;.

In May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 emigrants were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants was stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach&#x27;s requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings of pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established a $60,000 letter of credit. The amount was not adequate for sustaining the total number of German emigrants in Texas, but Castell also sent Philip Cappes as special commissioner to observe the situation. Cappes had also been instructed by Castell to observe Meusebach and to secretly report back every detail. By the time Cappes departed in March 1847, he recommended another $200,000 be advanced.

Cappes invited Henry Francis Fisher to New Braunfels, in spite of Fisher not being entirely trustworthy to the Verein. As of February 11, 1845, Fisher had been involved in coercing newly arrived immigrants to sign documents stating their intent to depart from the Verein and align with Fisher&#x27;s friend Friedrich Schubbert, also known as Friedrich Strubberg.

Cappes was not in town when Meusebach was breakfast host to Fisher on December 31, 1846. Posters had mysteriously appeared about town maligning Meusebach, saying &quot;Curses upon Meusebach the slave driver&quot;, and inciting colonists to free themselves from his &quot;tyranny&quot;. A group led by Rudolph Iwonski pushed their way into Meusebach&#x27;s home, and colonist C. Herber brandished a whip. Herber was an alleged counterfeiter to whom Count Castell had awarded asylum. Meusebach and Herber shared a dislike of one another.

The colonists&#x27; list of demands included Meusebach resigning as commissioner-general and turning the colonization over to Fisher. Meusebach kept his composure, but the group became so heated, they yelled, &quot;Hang him!&quot; When the estimated 120 men dispersed, Fisher was nowhere to be found. The same evening, a different group of individuals assembled and pledged to stand by Meusebach, the next day passing resolutions condemning the actions of the mob. Meusebach himself had considered leaving Texas as early as November 1845, when he wrote to Count Castell and announced his intention to resign and return to Germany. Meusebach did not feel the Adelsverein was organized enough to achieve its goals. After the mob visit in New Braunfels, he again submitted his resignation to accompany a financial report to Castell on January 23, 1847.

Meusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the United States hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the Mexican–American War.

Meusebach stabilized the community&#x27;s finances, and encouraged the settlers to establish additional neighboring communities. The largest of these secondary settlements was Fredericksburg, to the northwest of New Braunfels.

New Braunfels thrived, and by 1850, it was the fourth-largest city in Texas, with 1,723 people, following only Galveston, San Antonio, and Houston in population. In 1852, the &quot;Zeitung&quot; newspaper was established, edited by German Texan botanist Ferdinand Lindheimer. The newspaper continues to publish under its current name, the &quot;Herald-Zeitung&quot;.

==Geography==

New Braunfels is located in southeastern Comal County. The city is northeast of Downtown San Antonio, southwest of San Marcos, and southwest of Austin.

According to the United States Census Bureau, New Braunfels has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.91%, is covered by water. The city is situated along the Balcones Fault, where the Texas Hill Country meets rolling prairie land. Along the fault in the city, a string of artesian springs known as Comal Springs gives rise to the Comal River, which is known as one of the shortest rivers in the world, as it winds through the city before meeting the Guadalupe River.

=== Gruene ===

Gruene Historical District is located within the city limits of New Braunfels. Founded by the sons of settlers Ernst and Antoinette Gruene, the community had a bank, post office, school, general store, lumberyard, gristmill, dance hall, and cotton gin. It also had access to two railways for shipping cotton bales. Its most famous attribute was the dance hall, a family activity in those days. Due to the failure of the cotton crop from boll weevils, and the failure of the banks after 1929, commercial activity slowed to a crawl. This village is now a Nationally Registered Historic District where one can dine in the ruins of the original gristmill or enjoy live music at Gruene Hall.

<text>Dalhart is a city in Dallam and Hartley counties in the U.S. state of Texas, and the county seat of Dallam County. The population was 8,447 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Founded in 1901, Dalhart is named for its location on the border of Dallam and Hartley Counties; its name is a portmanteau of the names of the two counties. The city was founded at the site of a railroad junction, which heavily contributed to its early growth.

Dalhart was in the center of the Dust Bowl, an area adversely affected by a long period of drought and dust storms during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Here, Tex Thornton, operating on the now debunked concussion theory, coaxed today&#x27;s inflation-adjusted equivalent of $1 million from the locals on claims he could fire rocket-powered explosives into the clouds and cause rain.

Other West Texas communities in the most conservative lineup are Hereford (number one), Monahans (number five), and Childress (number nine). In contrast, Vashon Island, Washington, was named the &quot;most liberal&quot; city in the nation regarding political donations.

== Economy ==


Dalhart&#x27;s economy is centered around agribusiness, including farming, ranching, feedlot operations, large-scale pig farms, and more recently, a cheese processing plant. Dalhart is also home to a state prison.

During the peak operating period of the XIT Ranch, the land was in native grass. Some land was diverted into dry farmland, but the rain was insufficient to make it productive. A few irrigation wells were drilled in areas where the soil was not sandy and was level enough for row irrigation. Later, center pivot irrigation, credited to Colorado farmer Frank Zybach in 1949, was introduced and was found to be ideal for the area&#x27;s rolling sandy soils. About the same time, large feedlots were built due to the low-humidity climate. This created a good market for corn, which is the major crop grown by farmers in the area.

In the mid-2000s, a combination of tax incentives, Texas&#x27; relatively unrestricted environmental regulations, and Dalhart&#x27;s existing agricultural infrastructure attracted industrial dairy farms to the area. In 2007, Hilmar Cheese Company of California capitalized on the resulting milk availability, opening a major production plant in Dalhart. Texas Governor Rick Perry visited Dalhart to speak at the company&#x27;s official welcoming ceremony, reiterating the company&#x27;s projection that 2000 new jobs would be created in the region by the emerging dairy product production industry. This factory and the surrounding dairies are a significant emerging subsector of Dalhart&#x27;s established agribusiness culture.

The international agribusiness company Cargill owns a 21,500-acre hog-production site near Dalhart.

== Arts and culture ==

Dalhart is known as the &quot;XIT City&quot; because of its relationship with the historic XIT Ranch. The ranch was a plot of land traded in exchange for the construction of the Texas State Capitol in Austin.

Held annually on the first full Thursday through Sunday weekend of August, the event includes the world&#x27;s largest free barbecue, junior rodeo, Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association events, and three nights of live music.

The Muscle Car Party Weekend is held each year in May, and includes a classic car show, bicycle drag races, and dinner and dance. The events are sponsored by the Dalhart Cruzers Car Club, and each year, the club raffles a classic car.

<text>Coppell ( ) is a city in the northwest corner of Dallas County in the U.S. state of Texas. It is a suburb of Dallas and a bedroom community in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Its population was 42,983 at the 2020 census. A small area in the far northern portion of the city extends into neighboring Denton County.

==History==

The Coppell area was settled by German and French immigrants in the 1840s. Members of the Peters Colony also settled here in the 1840s. Originally named Gibbs Station, after Barnett Gibbs (one of Texas&#x27;s first lieutenant governors), the town was renamed in 1892 for George Coppell, a New York banker, who was born in Liverpool, England and probably moved to the United States circa 1859. He was reportedly heavily involved with the final construction of the local railroad line. Popular belief is that he was an engineer, but little or no evidence supports that claim.

In 1955, the community was incorporated through a ballot measure that passed by a vote of 41 to 1. Spurred by the opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW Airport) in 1974, the city was radically transformed from a tiny farming village to a large, upper-middle class suburban community in the 1980s and 1990s. By 2000, almost all of the residentially zoned land in the city was developed, and the population grew to over 35,000. In addition to suburban homes, the city has a growing commercial base of warehouses and transportation centers on the south and west sides of the city, closest in proximity to the airport.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.00%, is covered by water.

Coppell occupies the northwest corner of Dallas County and lies in proximity to DFW Airport. A portion of the airport property is within the city limits of Coppell. It is bordered on the west by Grapevine, on the north by Lewisville, on the east by Carrollton, and on the south by Irving and Dallas.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 42,983 people, 15,231 households, and 12,178 families residing in the city. As of the census data estimates for 2019, 41,645 people, 15,538 households, and 12,155 families were residing in the city. The population density was . There are 16,002 housing units averaged . The racial makeup of the city was 67.1% White, 4.2% African American, 0.2% Native American, 24.4% Asian, 0.8% from other races, and 3.2% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 13.1% of the population.

Of the 15,538 households, 44.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.0% were married couples living together, 3.0% were widowed, 9.0% were divorced, 0.9% were separated, and 22.0% were single. About 20.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.68, and the average family size was 3.09.

In the city, the age distribution was 27.0% under the age of 18, 4.9% from 18 to 24, 35.9% from 25 to 44, 34.7% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.6 males.

According to a 2019 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $122,340, and for a family was $141,867. Males had a median income of $87,484 versus $46,038 for females. The per capita income for the city was $41,645. About 2.1% of families and 2.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.7% of those under age 18 and 2.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==

Coppell&#x27;s economy relies largely on its proximity to DFW Airport, which is directly to its southwest and accessible by several highways and surface routes. As such, many corporations have shipping and distribution facilities in a large commercial zone comprising the southwestern section of the city, among them Amazon, Avaya, Nokia, IBM, The Container Store, Uline and Mohawk Industries. Fortune 1000 financial services and mortgage firm Mr. Cooper is headquartered in Coppell in the Cypress Waters development. In March 2010, Samsung opened a new cell-phone manufacturing and distribution facility in the city. Anime distributor Funimation (now known as Crunchyroll) moved to the new Cypress Waters development on Olympus Boulevard in late 2021.

==Sports==
Coppell is home to the gymnastics club Texas Dreams Gymnastics. The club has coached Peyton Ernst and Bailie Key and has a strong team of upcoming level 10 gymnasts. The head coach is former Olympian, and the first American &quot;All Around&quot; World Champion Gold Medalist 1991, Kim Zmeskal Burdette.
Coppell also is known for their soccer association, the Coppell Youth Soccer Association. The organization has been developing youth in the sport at the recreational and competitive level.
==Education==
Coppell residents are served by one of four school districts.

Coppell Independent School District (CISD) is responsible for the kindergarten–grade 12 education of the majority of the City of Coppell&#x27;s children. A portion of the CISD also covers parts of north Irving in the Valley Ranch area and those portions of Lewisville that fall south of the current Dallas/Denton County boundary. Its high schools are Coppell High School and the more recently opened New Tech High.

Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD serves easternmost Coppell, south of Sandy Lake Rd. and to the east of Macarthur Blvd., including the Riverchase area, and students matriculate to Barbara Bush Middle School and Ranchview High School in Irving. A portion of Coppell in Dallas County is within Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District.

Lewisville ISD serves the northernmost section of Coppell falling in Denton County, including the Coppell Greens subdivision. This area is north of State Highway 121.

All of the elementary schools in the Coppell Independent School District are rated &quot;exemplary&quot; by the Texas Education Agency (in 2008), as are Coppell Middle School North and Coppell Middle School East. Coppell Middle School West, Coppell High School, and the district as a whole are rated &quot;recognized&quot;. New Tech High received an &quot;exemplary&quot; ranking in its first year, the 2008–2009 school year. Riverchase Elementary (in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District, but located in Coppell) is rated &quot;recognized&quot;. Students from that school go on to attend the Barbara Bush Middle School and Ranchview High School in neighboring Valley Ranch. They are rated &quot;academically acceptable&quot; and &quot;recognized&quot;, respectively.

The Coppell ISD was ranked as the top music program in the United States by the Music Educators Association in 2000. In August 2001, Coppell voters approved a sales tax increase to provide funding for arts in the school district. The Coppell High School Marching Band won the Texas 4A UIL championship in 1999 and finished third in 5A in 2009. The Coppell Middle School North Band won the Texas state championship in 2006, 2011, and 2016. The Coppell Middle School East band finished fourth in state in 2011.

Coppell High School&#x27;s news program, KCBY-TV, has won several national awards for their work with video production. The KCBY broadcast department features local stories reaching out to the community in the school, as well as the community outside of school. The KCBY sports department offers a live broadcast of all of the athletic home games. The Head of KCBY is Irma Kennedy, who had worked with NBC prior to taking the job. In the summer of 2010, KCBY got an estimated $500,000 worth of new equipment, as it prepared to take on the challenges of a live broadcast in spring 2011. The news program also features a movie-related segment every week featuring new upcoming movies and more. 

New Tech High at Coppell’s film program, NT Fuze, has had several of its productions accepted to major film festivals, including South by Southwest and the Dallas International Film Festival. NT Fuze provides students a chance to learn the art of filmmaking and use the latest production tools. NT Fuze produces quality content not only for New Tech and Coppell ISD, but also for local businesses and organizations.

==Transportation==
Coppell is next to the northeast corner of DFW Airport. No freeways go directly through the city, but the entire perimeter is served by SH121 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway (west and north), Interstate 635 (south), and the President George Bush Turnpike and Interstate 35E (east).

Coppell offers ADA-compliant paratransit through an agreement with SPAN Transit, based in neighboring Denton County.

Coppell has no general-use public transportation. It was a charter member of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), but voters elected to withdraw from DART in 1989. This election remains controversial today, as the city had a much smaller population in the 1980s. Since Coppell borders DART member cities Carrollton, Dallas, and Irving, it can rejoin at a later date if it wishes, but implementing the mandatory 1% sales tax would require cutting other city services.

DART&#x27;s planned Silver Line commuter rail system will pass through Coppell. While Coppell&#x27;s lack of membership means that a station cannot be built in it, the Cypress Waters station will be located in an enclave of Dallas that borders Coppell. It is unclear whether Coppell will connect to the station via transit, which would require making a special agreement with DART or a third-party transit provider.

<text>Mister Fantastic (Dr. Reed Nathaniel Richards) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The character is a founding member and the leader of the Fantastic Four. Richards has a mastery of mechanical, aerospace and electrical engineering, chemistry, all levels of physics, and human and alien biology. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; listed Mister Fantastic as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics. He is the inventor of the spacecraft that was bombarded by cosmic radiation on its maiden voyage, granting the Fantastic Four their powers. Richards gained the ability to stretch his body into any shape he desires.

Mister Fantastic acts as the leader and father figure of the Fantastic Four, and although his cosmic ray powers are primarily stretching abilities, his presence on the team is defined by his scientific acumen, as he is officially acknowledged as the smartest man in the Marvel Universe. This is particularly a point of tragedy in regards to his best friend, Ben Grimm, who he has constantly tried to turn back into his human form but who typically remains in a large, rocky form and is called the Thing. Richards is the husband of Susan Storm, father of Franklin Richards and Valeria Richards, and mentor to his brother-in-law, Johnny Storm.

The character was portrayed by actors Alex Hyde-White in the 1994 &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; film, Ioan Gruffudd in the 2005 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and its 2007 sequel &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, and Miles Teller in the 2015 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, John Krasinski portrayed Richards in the 2022 film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, and Pedro Pascal will portray him in the 2025 film &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot;, the 2026 film &quot;&quot;, and the 2027 film &quot;&quot;.

==Creation==
During an interview, Lee stated the inspiration behind the character&#x27;s powers:
==Publication history==
==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Fantastic Four===
Born in Central City, California, Reed Richards is the son of Evelyn and Nathaniel Richards. Nathaniel was a scientific genius, and Reed inherited a similar level of intellect and interests. A child prodigy with special aptitude in mathematics, physics, and mechanics, Reed Richards was taking college-level courses when he was 14. He attended such prestigious universities as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Columbia University, and the fictional Empire State University. By the age of 20, he had several degrees in the sciences under his belt.

It was at Empire State University that he met Benjamin J. Grimm. Reed had already begun designing a starship capable of traveling in hyperspace. Sharing his plans with his new roommate, Grimm jokingly volunteered to pilot the craft.

Also while at State U he met a brilliant fellow student, Victor Von Doom. In Richards, Doom met the first person who could match him intellectually; regarding Richards as his ultimate rival, Doom became increasingly jealous of Richards. Determined to prove he was better, Doom conducted reckless experiments which eventually scarred his face and would lead him to become Doctor Doom.

During the summer months, Reed rented a room in a boarding house owned by the aunt of a young woman named Susan Storm, who was an undergraduate student at the time. Reed fell in love with Sue instantly and began courting her. Ultimately, Reed was too distracted from his work on his dissertation due to his romance with Sue and decided that the best thing for the both of them was to move out of Marygay&#x27;s home.

Moving on to Harvard, Reed earned PhDs in Physics and Electrical Engineering while working as a military scientist, all this by the age of 22. He also worked in communications for the Army and was involved in the Sin-Cong Conflict. Three years later, in his mid-20s, Reed used his inheritance, along with government funding, to finance his research. Determined to go to Mars and beyond, Richards based the fateful project in Central City. Susan Storm moved into the area, and within a short time, found herself engaged to Reed. Reed&#x27;s old college roommate, Ben Grimm, now a successful test pilot and astronaut, was indeed slated to pilot the craft.

All seemed well; however, when the government threatened to cut funding and cancel the project, Reed, Ben, Sue, and Sue&#x27;s younger brother Johnny, agreed to sneak aboard the starship and take it up immediately. They knew they had not completed all the testing that had been planned, but Reed was confident they would be safe. Ben was initially skeptical about the unknown effects of radiation, while Reed theorized that their ship&#x27;s shielding would be adequate to protect them.

It was on Reed&#x27;s initiative that the fateful mission which had Susan Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm accompanying him into space took place. When their ship passed through the Van Allen belt they found their cockpit bombarded with nearly lethal doses of cosmic radiation. Reed had neglected to account for the abnormal radiation levels in the belt&#x27;s atmosphere. The cosmic rays wreaked havoc on the starship&#x27;s insufficient shielding and they were forced to return to Earth immediately. When they crash-landed they found that their bodies were changed dramatically. Reed&#x27;s body was elastic and he could reshape any portion of his body at will. At his suggestion, they decided to use their new abilities to serve mankind as the Fantastic Four. Reed was chosen to lead the group, under the name &quot;Mr. Fantastic&quot;. He later told his daughter, by way of a bedtime story, that the reason he suggested they become adventurers and gave them such outlandish costumes and names as &quot;Mister Fantastic&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; was that he knew they would likely be hated and feared for their powers without such an over-the-top public image.

This history has been changed over the years to keep it current. In the original comics, Richards was a veteran of World War II who had served behind enemy lines in occupied France, and the goal of his space mission was a crewed space flight to the Moon before the Communists were able to. This was later changed to getting there before the Chinese Communists and to explore the interstellar areas of the red planet and beyond. Also, Reed originally states that he and Sue &quot;were kids together&quot; and that Sue was the &quot;girl next door&quot; who Reed left behind to go fight in the war. This origin story was, many years later, altered so that Sue was thirteen years old when she first met Reed, who was in his early twenties, at her Aunt Marygay&#x27;s boardinghouse. Current official Marvel canon has since altered this origin story by combining elements of both—it eliminated the large age gap but maintained that Reed and Sue did not meet until their late teens at Aunt Marygay&#x27;s boardinghouse. The change in age was an editorial decision made in 2013 as Reed developing, several years later, a romantic interest in a girl he first met when she was thirteen years old was deemed inappropriate.

===Leadership of the Fantastic Four===
The early career of the Fantastic Four led Mister Fantastic to a number of discoveries, and had their first encounters with many unusual characters. In the team&#x27;s first appearance, they battled the Mole Man. They then battled the Skrulls. Soon after that, the team encountered the Sub-Mariner. They then had the first of many battles with Doctor Doom. They later journeyed to a subatomic world. Soon after that, they encountered Rama-Tut. They then battled the Molecule Man.

As the team leader, Mr. Fantastic created numerous exotic devices and vehicles for the team to use such as clothing made of &#x27;unstable molecules&#x27; so that it can be used with their powers safely. Furthermore, he often leads the team into daring expeditions such as into the Negative Zone in addition to opposing evil. Also, he has felt personally responsible for Ben Grimm&#x27;s grotesque change and has labored off and on to reverse it permanently.

Under his guidance, the team went on to become Earth&#x27;s most celebrated band of heroes. Together, they would save the world countless times. Ever driven by his quest for knowledge, Reed is believed by most to be the Earth&#x27;s foremost intelligence. There is little he cannot create, fix, or understand given time. The patents and royalties on his inventions alone have funded the group over the years.

However, there are drawbacks to his association with the team. Chief among them is the team&#x27;s violent encounters with Doctor Doom, who believes that Reed was responsible for the accident that scarred him. Doom has never forgiven Reed and has sworn revenge. Doom has even gone as far as transforming Reed into a monstrous freak, attacking Reed&#x27;s children, and attempting to seduce Sue.

===Subplots and story arcs===
After many adventures as the Fantastic Four, Reed married Sue. Not long after that, the team encountered the Inhumans for the first time. They next encountered Galactus and the Silver Surfer. Reed then opened a portal to the Negative Zone for the first time. Soon, the team first battled the Psycho-Man. Before long Reed and Sue had a baby, Franklin; the team battled Annihilus right before Franklin&#x27;s birth. Franklin was a mutant with incredible powers, but, due to the cosmic ray alteration to his parents&#x27; DNA, they manifested while he was still very young (in the Marvel world, most mutants like the X-Men get their powers while teenagers). Franklin appears to have power that can rival a member of the Celestials; the power of a god in the body of a small child. The couple briefly separated, and Reed further alienated Sue by shutting down Franklin&#x27;s mind to prevent his power from causing global catastrophe; Sue Storm initiated divorce proceedings but the two were reconciled soon after.

Reed also saved Galactus&#x27;s life during the course of his adventures. He then bought the Baxter Building. Later, he was tried by the Shi&#x27;ar for saving Galactus&#x27;s life, but the charges were dropped when Eternity briefly granted all those attending the trial a moment of &#x27;cosmic awareness&#x27; that allowed them to understand that Galactus was necessary for the continued well-being of the universe. Reed&#x27;s battle with Gormuu prior to getting his powers was recounted. Just after that, Reed was reunited with his father in an alternate timeline. Some time later, Reed and Sue retired from the Fantastic Four, and then joined the Avengers, although Reed&#x27;s past experience as leader of the Fantastic Four meant that he had trouble adjusting to following Captain America&#x27;s lead regardless of his respect for the other man. Eventually, Reed and Sue did rejoin the Fantastic Four.

In the course of fighting an alien called Hunger, Doctor Doom was seriously injured. The Fantastic Four were also part of the battle against Hunger and Doom asked for his old enemy to take his hand. At that point they both disappeared in a flash, leaving nothing but ashes. It would appear as if the two sworn enemies had fittingly died in each other&#x27;s hands.

However, unknown to anyone else at the time, Reed and Doom had actually been thrown back into the time of barbarians and onto an alien world by a being called Hyperstorm, Reed&#x27;s grandchild from an alternate future, the child of Franklin Richards and Rachel Summers, daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey. They were so far into the past, and with no technology, that even their brilliant minds couldn&#x27;t find a way back home. Doom was captured and held prisoner by Hyperstorm. Reed wandered aimlessly for about a year.

Meanwhile, the rest of the FF recruited Scott Lang as scientific advisor. They even confronted an insane alternative version of Reed called the Dark Raider who was traveling from reality to reality, destroying all the various versions of himself after his own failure to save his world from Galactus in their original confrontation.

A while later, the remaining members of the FF along with the Sub-Mariner, Lyja and Kristoff Vernard found themselves trapped in the same era as their Reed and Doom. They found Reed but faced a new problem: during his time alone, Reed had resigned himself to the reality that it was impossible for his old friends to stage a rescue and attacked them but soon realized that these truly were his friends. After returning to their own time period, he sought Galactus, as he was the only being in the Universe who could defeat Hyperstorm. Upon Hyperstorm&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Galactus, the FF returned to the present day where they continued their lives, not only as a team, but as a family.

===Onslaught and Heroes Reborn===

Shortly after their return, the FF were confronted by a being called Onslaught. Onslaught took control of an army of Sentinels and invaded New York City, hunting down every mutant being he could find. Onslaught wished to add the abilities of the godlike Franklin Richards to his own. Only through the apparent sacrifice of the Fantastic Four&#x27;s own lives and that of many of the heroes in the Marvel universe was Onslaught finally vanquished. The heroes would have died then and there if not for Franklin, who created an alternate reality for them to reside in. Completely oblivious to what had taken place, Reed and his compatriots relived most of their lives. In their absence the Fantastic Four&#x27;s headquarters, Four Freedoms Plaza, was annihilated by a super villain group called the Masters of Evil, posing as heroes, The Thunderbolts. One year later, Franklin returned with his family along with the other heroes from the parallel reality. Reed was overjoyed to see his son again, but he and the rest of the FF found themselves without a home, moving into Reed&#x27;s storage warehouse on Pier 4, overlooking the East River. Making this their home, the Fantastic Four continued with their lives, eventually managing to move back into the Baxter Building.

It has emerged that Reed is one of the members of the &quot;Illuminati&quot;, unknown to his wife. He is also in possession of the &quot;Power&quot; gem of the Infinity Gauntlet.

===Pro-Registration===

In Marvel&#x27;s Civil War miniseries and crossover event, Reed Richards is one of the leading figures, along with Iron Man, on the side which is in favor of the Superhuman Registration Act. He speculates that this will lead to conflict with his wife, which came true in issue #4 of the miniseries when a clone of Thor, created by him and Tony Stark, went out of control and killed Goliath and nearly killed all the rest of the Secret Avengers until Sue Storm stepped in and saved them. Soon after, Sue left Reed, along with Johnny, to join the Secret Avengers in hopes that it would drive Reed to end the conflict quickly.

In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #535, which takes place shortly before the events of &quot;Civil War&quot; #5, Peter Parker demands to see the conditions inside the detention facility designed by Reed to hold unregistered superhumans. After being escorted to and from the prison by Iron Man, Parker returns with more doubts than ever about whether he is on the right side and asks Reed why he supports the Superhuman Registration Act, a question Reed answers by telling the story of his paternal uncle, Ted. A professional writer, Reed remembers his uncle as &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;colorful&quot;, and &quot;accepting&quot;. As a boy, Reed loved spending time with Ted. Unfortunately, Ted was also &quot;an eccentric&quot; and &quot;stubborn&quot;. Because he had a career in the arts and because he stood out, Ted was called before HUAC, imprisoned on contempt of Congress charges for six months, and was unable to find work after he&#x27;d served his sentence. He was even shunned by Reed&#x27;s father. Ted lost everything, which Reed says finally &quot;killed him&quot; without going into greater detail. Richards opines that his uncle was wrong to take such a stand, to pick a fight he couldn&#x27;t win, and to fail to respect the law.

However &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #542 reveals that the real reason for supporting the registration act is due to his development of a working version of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional psychohistory concept. His application of this science indicates to him that billions will die in escalating conflicts without the presence of the act. In the final battle of the war, he is shot by Taskmaster, saving Sue Storm&#x27;s life. With Reed on the brink of death, a furious Sue crushes Taskmaster with a telekinetic field. Reed survives, however, and Sue returns to him in the aftermath of the battle, having been granted amnesty. Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war, Sue and Reed take time off from the Fantastic Four, but ask Storm and the Black Panther to take their places in the meantime.

===World War Hulk===
Within the midst of Civil War, Reed Richards learned from a brief conversation with Mastermind Excello that the Hulk is not on the planet where the Illuminati attempted to exile him. After a conversation over the good the Hulk has done for humanity, Reed tells Iron Man of what happened to the Hulk and also states that the Hulk has friends, and &quot;may God help us if they find him before we do&quot;.

Within the aftermath of Civil War, Reed Richards had been keeping tabs on Mastermind Excello and when the She-Hulk learned about the Hulk&#x27;s exile, Reed Richards sends out Doc Samson to confront her when he sees her meeting with Mastermind Excello.

In &quot;World War Hulk&quot; #1, Reed is shown with Tony Stark as Iron Man. Both men were trying to convince Sentry to fight the Hulk, thinking that the calm aura that the Sentry produces may be able to stop the Hulk&#x27;s rampage. In &quot;World War Hulk&quot; #2, with the aid of the rest of the Fantastic Four, Storm, and the Black Panther, Reed is able to create a machine that projects an image of the Sentry and recreates the hero&#x27;s aura of calm. He uses the machine on the Hulk just as he is about to defeat the Thing, but the Hulk knows it is not the real Sentry and destroys the machine. In a last line of defense, Sue Storm tries to protect her husband by encapsulating the Hulk in an energy field while pleading with him to spare Reed. The Hulk does not listen and is able to easily exert enough strength against her force field to cause Susan to collapse and experience a nosebleed from the stress, before she dooms Reed to the Hulk&#x27;s wrath.

Reed is later seen among the various heroes that the Hulk defeated so far, within the depths of the Hulk&#x27;s Gladiator arena located within Madison Square Garden. He and all of the heroes are implanted with &quot;obedience disks&quot; that are used to suppress their powers. These disks are the same that were used upon the Hulk during his time on Sakaar. The Hulk orders Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic to face off in battle. Richards, after having the upper hand on Stark, is then given the thumbs down by Hulk, instructing Richards to kill Stark. However the Hulk spares their lives, showing them that he proved his point to the world. They survived the encounter by Hulk&#x27;s mercy and the timely intervention of the Sentry. The Illuminati are partially cleared from the responsibility of Sakaar&#x27;s destruction when Miek, one of the Hulk&#x27;s alien allies, admits he saw the Red King forces breach the ship&#x27;s warp core. Miek kept quiet to initiate what he felt was Hulk&#x27;s destiny as the &quot;Worldbreaker&quot;.

===Secret Invasion===

Mister Fantastic is at the Illuminati&#x27;s meeting discussing the threat of the Skrulls when the Black Bolt with them is revealed to be a Skrull in disguise.

Mister Fantastic and Hank Pym autopsy the body of the Skrull who impersonated Elektra (with Reed pretending to be seeing the corpse for the first time, thus keeping the secret of the Illuminati). After completing the dissection, Reed claims to have discovered the secret of how the Skrulls have been able to conceal their identities. Before he can elaborate, &quot;Hank Pym&quot; reveals himself to be a Skrull and shoots Richards with a weapon that violently leaves his elastic body in a state of chaotic disarray similar to Silly String. In &quot;Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four&quot; #1, it is shown that a Skrull assumed Reed&#x27;s form to successfully ambush and capture Sue Richards, to facilitate an attack on the Fantastic Four&#x27;s headquarters.

A conscious but still mostly shapeless Reed Richards is seen being forcibly stretched in all directions to cover the floor of a medium-sized arena aboard a Skrull ship, with all of the seats filled by Skrull onlookers. He is freed by Abigail Brand, and then travels with her to the Savage Land and uses a device to reveal all the Skrull invaders present. After helping the Avengers to defeat the imposters and return to New York, Reed aids the heroes and villains of Earth in their battle against the Skrulls.

===Dark Reign===
Mister Fantastic aids the New Avengers in the search for the daughter of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. He and the rest of the Fantastic Four are magically reduced to television signals by the chaotic activities of the Elder God Chthon, to prevent them from intervening, though after Chthon is defeated, he and the other three are turned back.

Norman Osborn has sent H.A.M.M.E.R. agents to shut down the Fantastic Four and capture them, expelling them from the Initiative and stripping them all their rights. Taking place a week from the Secret Invasion, which has caused Richards to seriously reevaluate his own life and the life he has built for his family, resulting in turbulent internal conflicts. Richards, as he takes a long, hard look at the life, is prompted to construct a machine that is capable of bending reality itself, to do so. Agents from H.A.M.M.E.R. (sent by Norman Osborn, a man well aware Reed is one of the few that have intellect exceeding even his own and thus pose a great threat to his carefully constructed shadow world) arrive just as Reed activates the machine, interfacing with the Baxter Building&#x27;s power supply, resulting in an energy fluctuation that sends Sue, Ben and Johnny back to the prehistoric era, fraught with dangers, which manifest in the form of the First Celestial Host. Reed searches for answers which can only be found in alternate timelines as the three find themselves in a super hero Hyborian-age civil war; Franklin and Valeria are the only ones available to confront the agents Osborn sent. Richards studies other parallel Earths to see if any found a peaceful solution to the Civil War, which resulted from the Superhuman Registration Act. Reed peers into different worlds, some more bizarre than our own, to see what they did differently. This is an insightful look into where the Marvel Universe has gone in the past &quot;year&quot; (in Marvel time) and to see who was at fault, if anyone. Reed meets with the other five Illuminati to handle the problem. Ultimately, after seeing about a million alternate Earths, he had concluded that there was no way for the Civil War to be resolved but that he, as the cleverest man in the Marvel Universe, had a responsibility to put things right. But before turning the machine off, he searches for other realities where they have the same machines he is using; the machine locates them and the people he finds tell him that they can help him.

Reed Richards reappeared in &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; #24 refusing to give Hank Pym an invention previously left in the care of the Fantastic Four, following Bill Foster&#x27;s untimely death, causing the Wasp to lead the team of Mighty Avengers to retrieve the device. In the next issue, Pym&#x27;s attempting to knock down the Baxter Building (due to Loki&#x27;s manipulations, likely) sows further displeasure and leads to a direct conflict between the Fantastic Four and Loki&#x27;s Mighty Avengers, stretching across to &quot;The Mighty Avengers #26&quot;. This conflict eventually ends in a new base for the Mighty Avengers and a shockingly disturbing alliance of the &quot;Dark Reign&quot;; the next issue of the Mighty Avengers will show a new character, a ruler known as the Unspoken, one more powerful than any other in the universe, to the point he had to be erased from history, and how his return will impact the planet and the cosmos beyond, in the &quot;War of Kings&quot;.

After the Secret Invasion and some time into the &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, in the &quot;War of Kings&quot;, when Blastaar is about to open the portal to Earth, on the other side in Camp Hammond, Star-Lord and the Guardians tell Reed Richards and others to never open the portal, or they will face the wrath of Blastaar. Mister Fantastic agrees and says they will not open the portal and then asks who they are. Star-Lord replies, &quot;We&#x27;re the Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; before leaving.

===Future Foundation===
Tragedy strikes the team when Johnny is apparently killed in the Negative Zone. As the Fantastic Four recover from Johnny&#x27;s apparent death, Mister Fantastic grows disillusioned at how scientists see science and its applications. Therefore, he creates a new team, the Future Foundation, to help create a better future for mankind. However, the team&#x27;s initial tasks are complicated when they are forced to deal with the &#x27;Council of Reeds&#x27;, a group of alternate versions of Reed Richards who lack his morality or family that became trapped in the FF&#x27;s reality after an accident with Reed&#x27;s dimensional portal.

===The Quiet Man===
After Johnny is returned and the team resume using the Fantastic Four name, they are systematically attacked by the mysterious Quiet Man, a figure who reveals that he has been behind many of the villain attacks the FF have faced over the years, now stepping forward to take a more active role as he shuts down Johnny&#x27;s powers, frames the Thing for murder, has Reed and Sue Richards declared unfit guardians for their children, and then abducts Reed with the intention of framing him for a series of attacks committed by the heroes created in Franklin&#x27;s pocket universe. However, Reed is able to defeat the Quiet Man&#x27;s plan to proclaim himself the hero who defeated Reed&#x27;s &#x27;attack&#x27; on the world when he realizes that the Psycho-Man – one of the Quiet Man&#x27;s allies – intended to betray him, forcing Reed and the Quiet Man to work together to deactivate the Psycho-Man&#x27;s equipment.

===Secret Wars===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Reed is one of the few survivors of Earth-616 to come through with his memories intact, hiding in a &#x27;life raft&#x27; with various other heroes and eventually released by Doctor Strange. Learning that the new &#x27;Battleworld&#x27; is now ruled by Doctor Doom, who has absorbed the power of various Beyonders and Molecule Men to become a virtual god, Reed and the other heroes disperse across Battleworld to come up with a plan. 
Reed eventually starts working with his counterpart from the Ultimate Marvel universe who calls himself Maker. The two find themselves disagreeing on their methods, with Reed preferring to find a way to save the world while Maker is more focused on killing their enemy, Reed countering his other self&#x27;s accusations that he is weak by musing that he simply has things to care for outside of himself. In the final confrontation, Reed and the Maker discover that the source of Doom&#x27;s power is the Molecule Man (Owen Reece), but although the Maker attempts to betray Reed by forcibly devolving him into an ape, Reece reverses the Maker&#x27;s attack and turns him into pepperoni pizza. When Doom comes down to confront Reed, Reed challenges Doom as Reece temporarily deprives Doom of his new god-level powers, Reed proclaiming Doom to be nothing more than a coward for taking control of what was left of existence rather than trying to reshape it. Inspired by Reed&#x27;s words, Reece transfers Doom&#x27;s power to him, with Reed recreating the former Earth-616 before he, Susan, their children, and the rest of the Future Foundation move to use Franklin and Reed&#x27;s powers to rebuild the multiverse.

===Return to Prime Earth===
Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, and the Future Foundation were later confronted by the Griever at the End of All Things after Reed had expended most of his Beyonder-based energies while Franklin was left with only limited reality-warping abilities. Due to the Griever causing the collapse of 100 worlds, the Future Foundation had to make a stand even after Molecule Man was killed. When Mister Fantastic tricked the Griever into bringing their Fantastic Four teammates to them, Thing and Human Torch were reunited as every other superhero that was part of the Fantastic Four showed up as well. Faced with these numbers, the Griever was eventually driven back when most of her equipment was destroyed, forcing her to return to her universe or be trapped in this one, while the heroes were able to repair the damaged equipment to create a new teleporter to send them all home.

==Powers and abilities==
Reed Richards gained the power of elasticity from irradiation by cosmic rays. He has the ability to convert his entire body into a highly malleable state at will, allowing him to stretch, deform, and reform himself into virtually any shape. Richards has been observed as being able to use his stretching form in a variety of offensive and defensive manners, such as compressing himself into a ball and ricocheting into enemies, flattening himself into a trampoline or a parachute to catch a falling teammate, or inflating himself into a life raft to aid in a water rescue. He can willfully reduce his body&#x27;s cohesion until he reaches a fluid state, which can flow through minute openings or into tiny pipes. Reed is also able to shape his hands into hammer and mace style weapons, and concentrate his mass into his fists to increase their density and effectiveness as weapons.

Having an elastic-like texture allows Reed protection from damage. He can be punched with incredible force, flattened, squished, and still re-form or survive without any form of sufficient injury.

Reed&#x27;s control over his shape has been developed to such a point that he has been able to radically alter his facial features and his entire physical form to pass among human and non-humans unnoticed and unrecognized. He has even molded himself into the shapes of inanimate objects, such as a mailbox. He rarely uses his powers in such an undignified fashion. However, he appears to have no qualms about stretching out his ears, taking the shape of a dinosaur, becoming a human trampoline, or inflating his hands into pool toys to entertain his children.

The most extreme demonstration of Reed&#x27;s powers is when at one point he was able to increase his size and mass to Thing-like proportions which also increased his physical strength.

Assuming and maintaining these shapes used to require extreme effort. Due to years of mental and physical training, Reed can now perform these feats at will. His powers (and those of the Red Ghost) were also increased when they were exposed to a second dose of cosmic rays. Maintaining his body&#x27;s normal human shape requires a certain degree of ongoing concentration. When Reed is relaxed and distracted, his body appears to &quot;melt in slow motion&quot; according to Susan Storm. Being forcefully stretched to extremes during a short span of time (by a taffy-puller-type machine or a strong character, for example) causes Reed to suffer intense pain and the temporary loss of his natural elastic resiliency. He possesses other weaknesses too; a great shock to his body – for example, from the likes of Doctor Doom when he constructs around him – can make his body so rubbery he loses motor control. Enough energy can reduce him to a liquid state in which he is immobile.

Mister Fantastic&#x27;s strength comes more from the powers of his mind than the powers of his body; indeed, he once told Spider-Man that he considers his stretching powers to be expendable compared to his intellect. Some stories have implied that his intellect may have been boosted by his powers, as he once visited an alternate universe where his other self-had never been exposed to cosmic rays and was notably less intelligent than him, though purely human versions of Reed that are as or even more intelligent than himself have been shown, particularly among the Council of Reeds. Tony Stark has commented that Reed&#x27;s ability to make his brain physically larger (via his elastic powers) gives him an advantage, though this seems to be meant more as a joke. That said, scenes from the same issue show Reed &quot;inflating&quot; his skull as he calculates the power output of Tony&#x27;s Repulsor-battery heart implant.

For virtually his entire publication history, Mister Fantastic has been depicted as one of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe. A visionary theoretician and an inspired machine smith, he has made breakthroughs in such varied fields as space travel, time travel, extra-dimensional travel, biochemistry, robotics, computers, synthetic polymers, communications, mutations, transportation, holography, energy generation, and spectral analysis, among others. However, he is never afraid to admit when others have greater expertise in certain fields than him, such as recognizing that Doctor Octopus possesses greater knowledge of radiation, that Hank Pym is a superior biochemist, or that Spider-Man can think of a problem from a biology perspective where he would be unable to do so, since his expertise is in physics. Richards has earned PhDs in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering. His patents are so valuable that he is able to bankroll the Fantastic Four, Inc., without any undue financial stress. Mind control is rarely effective on him and when it does work, it wears off sooner than it would on a normal person, due to what he describes as an &quot;elastic consciousness&quot;. However, this intelligence can be a handicap in his dealings with magic, as it required an intense lesson from Doctor Strange and facing the threat of his son being trapped in Hell for Reed to fully acknowledge that the key to using magic was to accept that he would never understand it.

Richards is among Earth&#x27;s greatest experts in judo, and has many years of combat experience with the Fantastic Four.

Following the Battleworld crisis, Reed has acquired the powers of the Beyonders that were once wielded by Doom, but he relies on his son Franklin&#x27;s creativity and new powers to help him recreate the multiverse after the incursions destroyed the other parallel universes.

==Equipment and technology==
Although the Fantastic Four have numerous devices, crafts, and weapons, there are some items that Reed Richards carries with him at all times.

Fantastiflare: Launches a fiery &quot;4&quot; into the sky that is used during combat situations to let other members of the group know their location.

Uniform Computer: Like all the Fantastic Four&#x27;s costumes and the rest of Reed&#x27;s wardrobe, his suit is made of &quot;unstable molecules&quot;. This means that the suit is attuned to his powers, which is why Johnny&#x27;s costume doesn&#x27;t burn when he &quot;flames on&quot;, Sue&#x27;s costume turns invisible when she does, and Reed&#x27;s costume stretches with him. The costume also insulates them from electrical assaults. In addition, the team&#x27;s uniforms are also, in essence, wearable computers. Their costumes have a complete data processing and telemetry system woven into the material of the uniform on a molecular level. This forms a network with the entire team, providing a constant, real-time uplink of everyone&#x27;s physical condition as well as their location and current situation. The suit is capable of displaying data and touch-pad controls on the gauntlets. Its sensors can track all of the team&#x27;s uniforms and provide a picture of their immediate vicinity. The suit has an intricate scanner system which can detect things around the wearer, from how many people are in the next room to what dimension or planet they are on. Reed can also up-link the bodysuit to any computer by stretching his fingertips to filament size and plugging them into an I/O data-port. With this, Reed can establish a fairly comprehensive database of any computer&#x27;s cybernetic protocols and encryption algorithms.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate reality known as the Age of Apocalypse, Richards never received superpowers as he was never bombarded with cosmic radiation in space. Instead, he attempted to evacuate a large group of humans from Manhattan during Apocalypse&#x27;s regime. Along with Ben Grimm as the pilot and his friends Johnny and Susan Storm as crew, Richards used one of his prototype rockets to fly off the island. Unfortunately, a mutant sabotaged the launch and both Reed and Johnny sacrificed themselves to let the others blast off safely.

Following the rise of Weapon Omega, it is revealed that when Apocalypse came into power, Reed became the world&#x27;s foremost authority on the Celestials and had collected all the information he could gather about these cosmic beings in several journals. Apocalypse himself was known to fear Reed Richards&#x27; knowledge and had him targeted and created a special taskforce to locate the journals but while they succeeded in killing him, they weren&#x27;t able to find the journals which eventually came to Victor von Doom&#x27;s possession.

===Amalgam Comics===
Amalgam Comics is a 1997–98 shared imprint of DC Comics and Marvel, which features composites of characters from the two publishers. Two alternate versions of Reed Richards appear in this series.

* The one shot issue &quot;Challengers of the Fantastic&quot; #1 features Reed &quot;Prof&quot; Richards (a composite of Marvel&#x27;s Reed Richards and DC Comics Prof Haley), a nonsuperpowered scientist and leader of the eponymous team of adventurers.
* In &quot;Spider-Boy Team-Up&quot; #1, Elastic Lad makes a cameo appearance as a member of the Legion of Galactic Guardians 2099 (a composite of DC&#x27;s Legion of Super-Heroes and Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy and &quot;2099&quot; imprint). Elastic Lad is a composite of Richards and Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s Elastic Lad character.

===Brute===
Brute, the Reed Richards of Counter-Earth first appeared in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #2 (May 1972), and was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The character subsequently appears as The Brute in &quot;The Power of Warlock&quot; #6–7 (June, August 1973), &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #175–179 (October 1976 – February 1977), #181–183 (April–June 1977), &quot;Fantastic Four Unlimited&quot; #3 (September 1993), &quot;Paradise X: Heralds&quot; #1–2 (December 2001 – January 2002), and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #47 (November 2001), and #49 (January 2002). The Brute received an entry in the &quot;Marvel Legacy: The 1970s Handbook&quot; #1 (2006), and the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z&quot; HC vol. #2 (2008).

Brute is a version of Reed Richards from a world created by the High Evolutionary called Counter-Earth.

He was exposed to cosmic rays that initially did not affect him; Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm were unaffected, and Susan Storm was left in a comatose state. The cosmic rays eventually gave him the ability to change at will into a savage purple-skinned behemoth called the Brute where he has super-strength and enhanced durability. The Brute became evil after being hit on the head with a metallic cylinder.

The Brute made his way to &quot;True Earth&quot; where he joined the Frightful Four to beat the Fantastic Four, Thundra and Tigra. Later, the Impossible Man inadvertently freed the Fantastic Four who overcame the Frightful Four. During the ensuing fight, the Brute managed to trap the original Reed Richards in the Negative Zone and replace him. Once accepted as the leader of the Fantastic Four, he sent the Human Torch and the Thing into the Negative Zone and battled with Invisible Girl. However, the remaining trio made it back from the Negative Zone with the help of Annihilus who lost his Cosmic Rod to Mad Thinker&#x27;s Awesome Android. After seeing Reed Richard&#x27;s selfless dedication to his wife, the concussion that made the Brute evil wore off and he sacrificed himself to keep the original Reed Richards&#x27; promise to return the cosmic Rod to Annihilus.

Brute was glimpsed when Abraxas scanned through the alternate Earths. As Abraxas assaulted Mister Fantastic, he told him &quot;as you die on this Earth, so do your other selves across the realities&quot;. Brute was shown among the Reed Richards to be among the victims of Abraxas&#x27; attack.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Brute was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===Bullet Points===
In &quot;Bullet Points&quot;, Dr. Reed Richards is drafted by the government to act as technical support to Steve Rogers, who in this reality is Iron Man. Along with Sue, Ben and Johnny, he later attempts the rocket flight that in the mainstream continuity saw the creation of the Fantastic Four, but the flight is sabotaged and the rocket crashes, killing everyone aboard except Reed. He thus never develops superpowers, and following the tragedy, he accepts the position as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Having lost his eye in the rocket crash, Reed wears an eyepatch, giving him a strong resemblance to Nick Fury.

===Council of Reeds===
The Interdimensional Council of Reeds first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #570 (Oct. 2009). The council is composed of multiple versions of Reed Richards from alternate universes, each with different powers, intellects, and abilities. Reeds join the council when they are able to invent a device (called &quot;the Bridge&quot;) that allows them to cross into the nothingness between realities. The leaders of the council are the three Reeds that have acquired their reality&#x27;s Infinity Gauntlet. The 616 Reed discovers that the other Reeds have one thing in common: each of them grew up without their father Nathaniel Richards, whose influence made the 616 Reed a more compassionate man. Reed declines membership to the council after realizing he would have to sacrifice his family ties to join. Nearly all the Council members are killed when the mad Celestials of Universe-4280 gain entry to the Council headquarters and attack the Reeds.

Due to an accident caused by Valeria Richards, four Reeds gain access to the Earth-616 reality. 616-Reed is forced to assemble a team of his old enemies – including Doctor Doom, the Wizard, and the Mad Thinker – to try to outthink his alternate selves before they destroy their world.

===Dark Raider===
An alternate Reed Richards from Earth-944, he first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #388 (May 1994). He is driven mad when he fails to save his reality&#x27;s Earth from Galactus. Taking the identity of the Dark Raider, he travels from reality to reality on a quest to destroy every possible version of himself. The Fantastic Four first encounter him when they traveled to an alternate past and see younger versions of themselves die at his hands. When the Dark Raider comes to the Fantastic Four&#x27;s reality, he attempts to activate the Ultimate Nullifier but is apparently destroyed by Uatu the Watcher. This appearance of Uatu is later revealed to be Aron the Rogue Watcher, who had simply teleported the Raider away. The Dark Raider returns, and is finally killed by the Invisible Woman in the Negative Zone.

===Earth-A===
In this reality, only Reed and Ben Grimm go up in the experimental spacecraft. Reed is transformed by cosmic radiation into The Thing, while Ben gains the stretching powers of Mr. Fantastic and the flaming powers of the Human Torch.

===Exiles===
An Earth dominated by hedonistic Skrulls since the late nineteenth century is attacked by Galactus. This Reed Richards is portrayed as an inventive genius with nothing to confirm that he possesses the powers of his 616 counterpart. He leads the super-human effort to drive off Galactus and save the planet. He becomes one of the caretakers of Thunderbird, a dimension-hopping hero who had been severely injured in the battle.

===Heroes Reborn (2021)===
In the 2021 &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; reality, Reed Richards is a scientist at S.H.I.E.L.D. Labs. He alerts Hyperion that the inmates of the Negative Zone have escaped.

===Marvel 1602===
Set in the 17th century &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; universe, Reed (apparently called Sir Richard Reed, although he is often addressed as &quot;Sir Reed&quot; or &quot;Master Richards&quot;) is the leader of &#x27;The Four from the Fantastick&#x27;, and his pliability is compared to water. Sharing the genius of his counterpart, he has devised uses for electrical force, categorized the sciences, and speculated as to whether light has a speed.

According to Peter David, who is writing a &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; miniseries about the Four, Gaiman describes Sir Richard as even more pedantic than the mainstream Mr. Fantastic. During a trip to Atlantis, Richard Reed had trouble accepting the idea that the Atlanteans had a connection to Poseidon or their brief encounter with the Watcher, until Susan helped him realise that just because such things could not be understood by their present standards did not mean that humanity could not come to understand them later.

===Marvel 2099===
On the Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-96943, the Mister Fantastic of 2099 is a clone of Reed Richards. He and his fellow Fantastic Four clones were created by the 2099 version of Uatu the Watcher.

===Marvel Apes===
The Reed of this reality is an intelligent ape given stretching powers by exposure to cosmic radiation, as in the mainstream Marvel universe. He tries to find a way to send Marty &quot;The Gibbon&quot; Blank back to his home reality. He is also one of the few that realizes Captain America is really a disguised Baron Blood. Reed is impaled and killed by Blood in an attempt to stop the vampire from trying to invade Earth-616 for a new source of blood. The rest of the Marvel Ape-verse heroes are led to believe Marty is responsible for Reed&#x27;s death and pursue him until discovering the truth.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the Marvel Mangaverse comics, Reed Richards leads the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four as a commander, not a field operative like Jonatha, Sioux, and Benjamin. In Mangaverse, Richards has been re-imagined as a long-haired intellectual with a laid-back attitude. The other members of the team often describe him as a &quot;smartass&quot;. His team used power packs to manifest their talents on mecha-sized levels so that they may fight the Godzilla-sized monsters from alien cultures that attack Earth for performing experiments which endanger all of reality. Along with assigning battle tactics, Richards okayed the amount of power his team was allowed to use. He has stretching talents which he considered &quot;near useless&quot; except for stretching his neurons, allowing him to brainstorm new ideas. In the New Mangaverse, Richards (along with the rest of the Fantastic Four with the exception of the Human Torch) was murdered by ninja assassins.

===Marvel Zombies===
This version of Reed Richards deliberately infects his team and himself with the zombie virus after suffering a mental breakdown due to the murder of his children at the hands of a zombified She-Hulk. Regarding the zombies as a superior form of life, Reed sets out &quot;to spread the Gospel&quot;, a twisted plan to start turning the survivors of the Marvel Universe into zombies. Reed later assists his fellow zombies in tracking down several Latverian human survivors; they escape to alternate dimensions but Doctor Doom does not. Using a dimensional crossing device created by Tony before his infection, Reed makes contact with his Ultimate counterpart. The Zombie FF attempts to escape into the Ultimate Marvel universe, but the zombie Reed is neutralized when the Ultimate Invisible Girl destroys a chunk of his brain, allowing the Ultimate team to contain their counterparts. When the Zombie FF try to escape after a brief period of imprisonment, Ultimate Reed Richards (in Doctor Doom&#x27;s body) destroys them by covering him with maggots, and their corpses returned to their universe. It is suggested in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution&quot; that Richards was inadvertently responsible for allowing the zombie virus to infect this reality through the construction of a device allowing access to alternate dimensions, namely he was responsible for bringing in the zombie Sentry, the only zombie left.

===MC2===
In the MC2 continuity, Reed Richards designs a small robot into which he claims to have transferred his brain after his body was scarred in an accident; in reality, Richards&#x27; injuries are minor, and he controls the robot remotely from an outpost in the Negative Zone. This robot, called Big Brain, is a member of the Fantastic Five, and is capable of projecting force fields and can hover or fly. When Reed solves the problem keeping Susan in stasis in the Negative Zone, the mental block preventing his scars from healing dissolves, and his appearance returns to normal.

In an alternate universe in the MC2 line, the Red Skull conquered the world and killed Captain America. The Skull is later killed by Doctor Doom, for whom Reed serves as an advisor. After Doom and Crimson Curse fall into a portal, Richards turns on fellow advisor Helmut Zemo. Later Reed becomes a mad scientist, aided by evil versions of Ben Grimm, Franklin Richards and Peter Parker. They are defeated by Spider Girl, Thunderstrike and Stinger.

When Doctor Doom returns, Reed is forced into a mental duel with the villain, which ends in a tie that banishes both their minds to the &quot;Crossroads of Infinity&quot;. He is currently in Latveria, under the care of his wife.

===Mutant X===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; reality visited by Alex Summers, a.k.a. Havok, the Fantastic Four have no powers, though Reed still has his genius-level intelligence. Reed generally wears a battle suit with two extra arms. In his first appearance, he is attempting to build a machine that will allow the Goblin Queen to summon demons from another dimension. In the final issue of the series, Reed joins a makeshift team of villains and heroes to stop the Goblin Queen&#x27;s threat against the entire multiverse. He is interrupted in his work by Dracula, who slices open his throat, killing him.

===Spider-Gwen===
In the universe featuring Gwen Stacy as Spider-Woman, Reed is an African-American child genius that shares his inventions with other kids around his age. He is asked for help by Jessica Drew from the 616 universe to try to get her home, and reveals that he has encountered other Dimensional hoppers before her. He aids the Spider-Women by altering their weaponry for their final battle against his earth&#x27;s Cindy Moon and later serves as an ally to Spider-Gwen.

===Spider-Man: Life Story===
&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In the 1970s, Peter Parker and Otto Octavius began working for Reed at Future Foundations. He and Peter got into several arguments over the Vietnam War and how superheroes should serve humanity, eventually leading Peter to quit. In the 1980s, Peter and Reed made amends while participating in the Secret Wars, though Peter laments that Richards is a ghost of his past self, having pushed away all his friends and loved ones out of a misplaced sense of responsibility for Doctor Doom. In this continuity, Sue left Reed to be with Namor.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Maker, previously known as Ultimate Reed Richards is the Ultimate Marvel&#x27;s version of Mister Fantastic. The origin of Ultimate Reed&#x27;s powers is different from the original Reed. Ultimate Reed Richards gets engulfed in a malfunctioned teleporter experiment to get the superpower to stretch. He founds the Ultimate Fantastic Four that explores the N-Zone and fight various villains. After the Fantastic Four disbands due to the damage caused by &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Reed begins to change his worldview and eventually calls himself Maker and becomes a nemesis to the Ultimates. When Galactus arrives in the Ultimate universe due to a temporal distortion, the Ultimates are forced to approach the Maker for help. Maker travels to Earth-616 to access his counterpart&#x27;s files. Using the information gained, Reed defeats Galactus by sending him to the Negative Zone.

After the events of Secret Wars, Maker moves to the main Marvel universe, also known as Earth-616, where he continues his nefarious plans.

===Ultimate Universe===
In the pages of &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot;, Maker visits Earth-6160 and remakes it in his image, creating a new world order. The shuttle flight that was to carry Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm into outer space was delayed by the Maker so that they would not get their respective powers, turning the Fantastic Four into &quot;something more managable&quot;. This was due to them wanting to do the space program against the orders of Franklin Storm. Because of Maker&#x27;s sabotage, Johnny Storm burned to death, Ben Grimm was later found dead at the bottom of a quarry, and Reed and Susan Storm was detained. Franklin used his high-level connections to let Reed see Susan one more time. After Sue died from the radiation, Franklin lashed out at Reed for killing his children and cursing the day he saw Reed&#x27;s face. One day, he is brought to The City by Maker and tortured to become Doom to the point where his head became bald and shriveled.

When Maker brings Howard Stark into the depths of The City in Latveria to work on the Immortus Engine, he is paired up with Reed who is wearing a Doctor Doom-like mask and suit. After The City is sealed for two years with the Maker, Kang, and Howard inside, Reed gives a piece of the broken Immortus Engine to Tony Stark as well as the Maker&#x27;s files, and a pre-written letter by Howard. However, Reed was unable to answer Tony&#x27;s question as to whether his father is dead or not. When Tony becomes Iron Lad, Reed joins him and they find Captain America&#x27;s frozen body.

Two weeks later, Reed takes on the alias of Doom at the time when he and Iron Lad spring Thor from his prison with Sif being brought along. The group raids Maker&#x27;s castle to access its repositories to work on undoing the changes that Maker has caused to the natural course of history. They only make off with a few assets when Henri Duggary attacks and wounds Thor. The group is stunned when the Maker&#x27;s Council uses a Stark/Stane satellite to frame Tony Stark as a terrorist, as it fires on Stark Tower, hitting a section of New York City as thousands are killed. As Iron Lad uses the Immortus Engine in his armor to get his allies out of their current location, everyone assumes that he and his allies are dead.

While operating in a Stark/Stane corporate satellite with the rest of the team, Iron Lad starts making plans, as they would have 18 months left before The City opens. While noting that some of the heroes in Maker&#x27;s files are dead, Iron Lad states that they can find replacements as they get to work to pull off building a resistance. After they thawed out Captain America, Doom, Iron Lad, and Sif had to restrain him while informing him of what happened while he was frozen in ice, as he learns of the dissolving of the United States into the North American Union. Doom accompanied the Ultimates in confronting exterminators Hank Pym and Wasp and fighting against Henri Duggary. Following their victory with help from Giant-Man and Wasp, Doom was with the Ultimates as Iron Lad formally declares them a team.

After missing another mission with the Ultimates, Doom told Iron Lad that suffers from extreme despair from what Maker did and calls it his &quot;Negative Zone&quot;. He has since been finding the right composition of cosmic radiation to use when testing it on the laboratory mice in his position as they keep dying. Doom tells Iron Lad that the footage of the day Maker brought him to The City was off limits. He also tells Iron Lad that he didn&#x27;t lose anybody to an accident. Doom will try Iron Lad&#x27;s way for now and that the Fantastic Four will return when the laboratory mice stop dying. Iron Lad is told by Doom to close the door on the way out as he has work to do.

===&quot;What If?&quot; ===
Marvel&#x27;s &quot;What If?&quot; comic book series featured several alternate versions of Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four.

====Spider-Man in the FF====
On the world designated Earth-772, in &quot;What If?&quot;, Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four, but his presence resulted in Sue feeling increasingly sidelined in favour of the four male members of the team, resulting in her leaving the team to marry the Sub-Mariner. Although Reed was briefly driven insane and declared war on Atlantis, he eventually recovered and the two apparently reconciled, resulting in the &#x27;Fantastic Five&#x27; reforming once again in time to confront Annihilus in the Negative Zone to help Susan give birth.

====Vol. I #6====
In &quot;What If?&quot; #6 (Dec. 1977), after the team are exposed to cosmic rays, they develop powers based on their personalities. Reed Richards&#x27; vast intellect causes him to become a giant floating brain, and he takes to calling himself &quot;Big Brain&quot;. Reed&#x27;s brain is destroyed during a battle with Doctor Doom, but not before he manages to transfer his mind into Doom&#x27;s body. This version of the Fantastic Four reappeared in the Volume II story arc &#x27;Timestorm&#x27;, summoned by the Watcher to persuade the man who would become Kang/Immortus not to become a threat. Richards&#x27; and the other members of his Fantastic Four are killed by Immortus.

====Vol. I #11====
In &quot;What If?&quot; #11 (May 1978), an alternate universe is shown wherein the original 1960&#x27;s staff of Marvel Comics are exposed to cosmic rays. Stan Lee gains the powers of Mister Fantastic, and is described as slowly gaining Reed&#x27;s scientific intellect as well. Lee continues to write and edit Marvel Comics by day, but fight evil along with his fellow members of the Fantastic Four. The story was written by Lee, and drawn and co-written by Jack Kirby, who in this reality became the Thing.

====Vol. II #11====
In &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #11 (March 1990), the origins of the Fantastic Four are retold, showing how the heroes lives would have changed if all four had gained the same powers as the individual members of the original Fantastic Four.

* Fire Powers: In this alternate history, the cosmic rays give the four the powers of the Human Torch. They decide to use their powers for good, and become the Fantastic Four. They battle such menaces as the Mole Man and the alien race Skrulls. During a battle with the mystic Miracle Man, the villain brings to life a statue advertising a monster movie called &quot;The Monster from Mars.&quot; When the heroes set fire to the statue, the fire spreads to a local apartment building, killing young Angelica Parsons. Feeling responsible for Parsons&#x27;s death, the team disbands: grief-stricken, Sue becomes a nun; Reed devotes his life to science; Johnny becomes a race car driver, no longer having to fear fire, while Ben joins the Avengers as the Human Torch.
* Elastic powers: In this alternate history, Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben develop the ability to stretch. Deciding not to become superheroes, Ben and Sue discover their love for one another and settle down to raise a family, never using their stretching powers again. Reed devotes his life to science, while Johnny becomes the celebrity Mister Fantastic.
* Monstrous forms: The cosmic rays in this alternate history transform the four into monstrous creatures, with Reed taking on a purple-skinned form similar to the Brute. When the public reacts with fright at their appearances, Reed convinces the others to leave civilization and live on Monster Isle.
* Invisibility powers: In the final &quot;What If?&quot; story, Ben Grimm, Reed Richards, Johnny Storm, and Sue Storm gain different aspects of the mainstream Sue Storm&#x27;s power. Reed can project invisibility onto other objects. Reed and his three associates join Colonel Nick Fury&#x27;s new C.I.A. unit, codenamed S.H.I.E.L.D., where he worked as Head of Laboratories. The story retells their initial encounter with Doctor Doom under these circumstances.

<doc id="151155" wikidata="Q973550" url="?curid=151155" title="Ferris, Texas">
<text>Ferris is a city in Dallas and Ellis counties in the U.S. state of Texas. It is south of downtown Dallas. The population was 2,788 in 2020.

==History==
Settlement of the area began in the early 1870s. On September 28, 1874, a local family deeded approximately of land to four trustees for the establishment of a town and railway station. Judge Justus Wesley Ferris of Waxahachie handled the transaction, and the community was named for him. Within ten years, Ferris had a population of 300 with a post office, gristmills, cotton gins, four churches, and a school.

On September 18, 1882, an election was held to incorporate the community. A total of 47 votes were cast, 34 (72%) in favor of incorporation and 13 (28%) against. The results were verified by the Ellis County Judge on September 30, and Ferris officially became a town. By 1900, the town was home to 904 residents. In 1910, that number had increased to 1,233 residents.

Fifty businesses, including six brick plants that benefitted from the area&#x27;s mineral rich soil, were operating in 1914. The population rose to 1,586 by 1925 but declined during the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the Great Depression and World War II.

Ferris thrived during the early post-war years. Four brick plants operated during the 1950s, and the community was known locally as the &quot;Brick Capital of the Nation&quot;. Ferris also has a second nickname – &quot;The City that Bricked the World&quot; – which is still commonly used to date. In 1952, the population had risen to 1,734 and 1,807 by 1964. The Ferris Annual Brick Festival is held every year at the end of April.

The expansion of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metropolitan Area and the construction of Interstate 45 aided the growth of Ferris in the latter half of the twentieth century. Although the number of businesses decreased during the 1980s, the population continued to grow. It stood at 2,212 in 1990, 2,175 in 2000, and 2,436 in 2010. In 1994, Ferris won the 3-A State Championship in men&#x27;s basketball.

<text>Grand Prairie is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Dallas, Tarrant, and Ellis counties with a small part extending into Johnson county. It is part of the Mid-Cities region in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. It had a population of 175,396 according to the 2010 census, making it the fifteenth most populous city in the state. Remaining the 15th-most populous city in Texas, the 2020 census reported a population of 196,100.

==History==

The city of Grand Prairie was first established as Dechman by Alexander McRae Dechman in 1863. He based the name of the town on Big Prairie, Ohio. Prior to then, he resided in Young County near Fort Belknap. The 1860 U.S. Federal Census—Slave Schedules shows an A McR Dechman as having four slaves, ages 50, 25, 37 and 10. Dechman learned that he could trade his oxen and wagons for land in Dallas County. In 1863, Dechman bought of land on the eastern side of the Trinity River and of timber land on the west side of the river for a broken-down wagon, oxen team and US$200 in Confederate money. He tried to establish a home on the property, but ran into difficulties, so he returned to his family in Birdville before joining in the Civil War. In 1867, Dechman filed a town plat with Dallas County, consisting of .

After the war, Dechman returned to Birdville for two years before selling that farm in 1867 and moving to Houston, where yellow fever broke out, causing the family to settle in Bryan. In 1876, Dechman traded half his &quot;prairie&quot; property to the T&amp;P Railroad to ensure the railroad came through the town. The railroad named the depot &quot;Dechman&quot;, prompting its namesake to relocate his home from Bryan to Dechman. His son Alexander had been living in Dechman and operating a trading post and farm. The first church in the area was the Good Hope Cumberland Sabbath School, established in 1870 by Rev. Andrew Hayter. The church was later renamed West Fork United Presbyterian Church and remains an active church.

The first U.S. post office opened in 1877 under the name &quot;Deckman&quot; rather than &quot;Dechman&quot;, because the U.S. Postal Service could not read the writing on the form completed to open the post office. Later that same year, after the Postal Service had adopted the &quot;Deckman&quot; name, confusion resulted from the T&amp;P Railroad designation &quot;Grand Prairie&quot;. This name was based on maps drawn from around 1850 through 1858 that labeled the area between Dallas and Fort Worth &quot;the grand prairie of Texas&quot;. In order to alleviate the confusion, the Postal Service named the post office &quot;Grand Prairie&quot;.

The town of Grand Prairie was eventually incorporated as a city in 1909. During World War I and since, Grand Prairie has had a long history with the defense and aviation industry. While the present-day Vought plant on Jefferson Avenue is part of a small strip within the Dallas city limits, it was originally in Grand Prairie. During World War II, the North American Aviation Plant B produced the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the P-51C and K Mustang variants. After the war, Vought Aircraft took over the plant. This later became Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), then eventually returned to the Vought moniker. The plant was the production site for the F-8 Crusader and the A-7 Corsair II aircraft of the 1950–1989 time period. The LTV Missile and Space division produced missiles such as the Scout and MLRS. This division was eventually sold to Lockheed Martin, which continues to operate in Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie was also the North American headquarters for Aérospatiale Helicopter. This company eventually became Airbus Helicopters, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Airbus Helicopters.

In 1953, the mayor and city council of Grand Prairie attempted to annex nearly of then-unincorporated and largely undeveloped land in southern Dallas and Tarrant counties. Vehement debate ensued, and the legal pressure from cities such as Arlington, Duncanville and Irving wound up overturning part of the annexation attempt.

==Geography==
Grand Prairie is located along the border between Tarrant and Dallas counties, with a small portion extending south into Ellis County. The city is bordered by Dallas to the east, Cedar Hill and Midlothian to the southeast, Mansfield to the southwest, Arlington to the west, Fort Worth to the northwest, and Irving to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 11.08%, is water.

The West Fork of the Trinity River and a major tributary, Johnson Creek, flow through Grand Prairie.

Grand Prairie has a long history of flooding from Johnson Creek. In the 1980s, a major Army Corps of Engineers project was begun to straighten the channel, which has reduced the damage of flooding.

=== Climate ===
Grand Prairie is part of the humid subtropical region.

Most of Grand Prairie&#x27;s K–12 student population attends schools in the Grand Prairie Independent School District, which serves most areas of Grand Prairie in Dallas County. The Mansfield Independent School District serves areas of Grand Prairie in Tarrant County and operates six elementary schools within the Grand Prairie city limits. Other portions of Grand Prairie reside within the Arlington, Cedar Hill, Irving, Mansfield, and Midlothian school districts. Portions in Dallas County are in the Grand Prairie, Cedar Hill, and Irving school districts. Portions in Tarrant County extend into the Arlington and Mansfield school districts. Portions in Ellis County are in the Midlothian school district.

In Texas, school district boundaries do not follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of the school district government apparatus, including school district boundaries, are separated from the city and county government entirely, with the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District in the Houston area.

=====Grand Prairie Independent School District=====

=====Arlington Independent School District=====

The Arlington ISD has the second highest portion of Grand Prairie&#x27;s K–12 student population. Six Arlington ISD elementary schools are within the city limits of Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie residents in the Arlington ISD are located generally west of the Dallas-Tarrant County boundary and north of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge in southwest Grand Prairie. One of the Arlington high schools, James Bowie High, has more Grand Prairie residents than Arlington residents that are students at the school.

Grand Prairie student/residents in the Arlington ISD attend Bowie, Sam Houston, or Lamar High School in the Arlington ISD and their feeder elementary schools and junior high schools.

=====Mansfield Independent School District=====

The Mansfield ISD contains the third highest portion of the Grand Prairie&#x27;s K–12 student population. Grand Prairie residents in the Mansfield ISD are located generally south of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge, and west of Joe Pool Lake to the Tarrant and Ellis County line in southwest Grand Prairie. Three Mansfield ISD schools, Anna May Daulton Elementary; Louise Cabaniss Elementary; and Cora Spencer Elementary, are currently open within the city limits of Grand Prairie. The Mansfield ISD is the fastest growing ISD in Tarrant County, and the population growth in far southwest Grand Prairie is a major factor in the Mansfield ISD&#x27;s subsequent growth.

Grand Prairie students/residents in the Mansfield ISD attend Mansfield Timberview High School, Lake Ridge High School or Mansfield High School in the Mansfield ISD or their feeder elementaries and middle schools. Timberview High School is located on State Highway 360 less than from the Grand Prairie city line.

===Colleges and universities===
Dallas County residents are zoned to Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College District or DCCCD). Tarrant County residents are zoned to Tarrant County Junior College. Ellis County residents are zoned to Navarro College.

===Transportation===
Interstate highways 20 and 30 run east–west through the northern and southern parts of the city. Texas State Highways Spur 303 (named Pioneer Parkway) and 180 (Main Street) also run east–west in the northern and central portions of the city.

SH 360 runs for almost three miles in the northwestern portion of city; most of the highway runs just west of the city limits in Arlington.

SH 161, named the President George Bush Turnpike, runs north–south through western Grand Prairie. The main lanes were opened in late 2012 with frontage roads open since 2010. Portions of the highway located north of SH 180 are depressed while the portion south of SH 180 runs at-grade then becomes elevated. Frontage roads remain at-grade throughout. The frontage road intersection at Main Street will open sometime in 2013.

Belt Line Road is a major north–south thoroughfare in the city. The section of the road south of Main Street is dual-labelled as FM 1382, which travels south, past I-20 and continues south to Cedar Hill. The section of the road north of Main Street keeps its name, continuing north into Irving.

The city declined membership in 1984. In April 2022, Grand Prairie launched &quot;Via Grand Prairie&quot;, an &quot;on-demand, shared public transportation&quot; which connects to DART&#x27;s West Irving station.

In the era of private operation of passenger trains prior to the onset of the Amtrak era in 1971, Texas and Pacific Railway trains such as the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; and the &quot;Louisiana Eagle&quot; made stops in Grand Prairie, on trips between Fort Worth and Dallas. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; (Chicago-San Antonio) makes stops at Dallas Union Station 12 miles to the east.

<text>Grapevine is a city located in northeast Tarrant County, Texas, United States, with minor portions extending into Dallas County and Denton County. The population was 50,631 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 46,334 in the 2010 census. The city is located in the Mid-Cities suburban region between Dallas and Fort Worth and includes a larger portion of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport than other cities.

The city is adjacent to Grapevine Lake, a large reservoir impounded by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1952 that serves as a source of water and a recreational area.

==History==

In October 1843, General Sam Houston and fellow Republic of Texas Commissioners camped at Tah-Wah-Karro Creek, also known as Grape Vine Springs, to meet with leaders of 10 Indian nations. This meeting culminated in the signing of a treaty of &quot;peace, friendship, and commerce,&quot; which opened the area for homesteaders. The settlement that emerged was named Grape Vine due to its location on the appropriately-named Grape Vine Prairie near Grape Vine Springs, both names in homage to the wild grapes that grew in the area. Grapevine is the oldest settlement in Tarrant County, established in 1844, before Texas joined the Union in 1846.

The first recorded white settlement in what would become the modern city occurred in the late 1840s and early 1850s. General Richard Montgomery Gano owned property near Grape Vine and helped organize the early settlement against Comanche raiding parties before leading his band of volunteers to battle in the American Civil War. Growth during the 19th century was slow but steady; by 1890, Grape Vine had about 800 residents supported by such amenities as a newspaper, a public school, several cotton gins, a post office, and railroad service. The settlement made continued gains early in the 20th century and on January 12, 1914, the post office altered the town&#x27;s name to one word: Grapevine.

On Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934, Henry Methvin, an associate of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, killed two police officers, E.B. Wheeler, and H.D. Murphy, during an altercation near Grapevine. A historical marker remains at the intersection of Dove Road and State Highway 114.

Grapevine&#x27;s population fell during the interwar period, as the economy stagnated, though the city was officially incorporated in 1936. Cotton was the primary crop for Grapevine until the early 20th century when it was overtaken by cantaloupe farms that accounted for 25,000 acres. For several decades, until the early 1970s, the Rotary Club sign outside of town boasted Grapevine as the &quot;Cantaloupe Capital of the World&quot;. Population growth and economic gains resumed to some extent in the decades after World War II. The opening of Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport in 1974 spurred massive development. Grapevine depended heavily upon agricultural production prior to the mid-20th century but transformed into a regional center of commerce because of its proximity to the airport&#x27;s north entrance.

In recent years, several wineries have opened in Grapevine, and the city has been active in maintaining its historic downtown corridor.

== Economy ==

Grapevine&#x27;s economy is largely centered around travel and tourism, although those sectors also promote strong growth in other areas such as entertainment, retail trade, and transportation. Travelers arriving to and departing from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport make up the majority of the city&#x27;s visitors. The Gaylord Texan and Great Wolf Lodge are the two biggest hotels in Grapevine and among the biggest in the Metroplex. The hotels also have large convention centers and entertainment venues. In 2020, Coury Hospitality launched Hotel Vin, a new boutique hotel attached to the recently finished TEXRail station.

Nearby Grapevine Mills Mall is a regional outlet shopping center with many amenities, including a movie theater. Embassy Suites Grapevine and the DFW Lakes Hilton complex also lay adjacent to Grapevine Mills and Bass Pro Shops.

In addition to these areas, Main Street in historic downtown Grapevine is a popular attraction. Public amenities like City Hall, the Grapevine Convention and Visitor&#x27;s Bureau, the city library, public parks, and a recreation center are located on Main Street, nestled in between a wealth of small businesses. These include antique stores, restaurants, bars, theaters, and many specialty shops. The Grapevine Vintage Railroad follows a historic route between Grapevine and the Fort Worth Stockyards, departing from a station on South Main Street. The city is also the home of several wineries and tasting rooms including Umbra Winery as well as the Texas Wine and Grape Growers Association.

According to the city&#x27;s 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the city&#x27;s top employers are:

GameStop, a national electronics retailer and one of the city&#x27;s largest corporate employers, is headquartered in Grapevine.

In April 2017, Kubota Corp. established a new U.S. headquarters in Grapevine, moving about 300 employees from California and spending $50 million.

The facility at 1639 West 23rd Street is on the property of DFW Airport and in Grapevine. Tenants include China Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Historically, Grapevine was the headquarters of a collection of now-defunct air carriers. In 1978 Braniff Place, the final world headquarters for Braniff International Airways, was built in what is now Grapevine, on the grounds of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Following Braniff&#x27;s 1982 bankruptcy, the structure is now known as Verizon Place. In the 1990s Metro Airlines maintained its main offices in the city of Grapevine, as did Kitty Hawk Aircargo for a time.

==Transportation==

===Highways===
Two grade-separated highways run through the city. State Highways 114 and 121 trisect Grapevine south and slightly west of downtown. 121 runs from the south and 114 from the northwest. The highways intersect near Mustang Drive and William D. Tate Avenue and continue together towards the airport before splitting again at the north entrance of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Grapevine&#x27;s highways 2010 underwent a significant overhaul to improve traffic flow through the area.

====Major Roads====
* I-635 (Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway)
* SH 26 (Ira E. Woods Avenue)
* SH 114 (Northwest Parkway)
* Bus. SH 114 (Northwest Highway)

===Airports===
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is the main provider of air service to Grapevine and the region, providing connections to places around the state, country, and abroad. DFW is the main hub for American Airlines, though other major carriers maintain a large presence. Love Field in Dallas is relatively close to Grapevine.

===Rail===
The Grapevine Vintage Railroad provides service to and from Fort Worth along the former Cotton Belt Railroad right-of-way. The service acts more as a tourist attraction due to its slow speeds. However, the city&#x27;s 50-year commitment to the Trinity Metro and approval of a half-cent sales tax increase have paid dividends through the introduction of the TEXRail service to northeast Tarrant County since January 10, 2019. New train stations downtown and north of the airport are included in the plans, as is a connection to Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) light rail provides mass transit service to the eastern half of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

TEXRail service is available in Grapevine at both DFW Airport North Station, and Grapevine Main Street Station. DART Silver Line Service is expected to begin at DFW Airport North Station by mid-2026.

===Bus===
The Convention and Visitor&#x27;s Bureau operates the Grapevine Visitor&#x27;s Shuttle between points of interest within the city. Additional information including stops and pricing can be found here.

===Bicycle===

The majority of Grapevine&#x27;s transportation infrastructure is centered around the automobile, though amenities for bicycles can be found. A bicycle route runs along the length of Dove Road beginning at the intersection of Dove and North Main Street, connecting Grapevine and Southlake.

Additionally, the Cotton Belt trail runs parallel to State Highway 26, from the Colleyville city limits to downtown Grapevine. The &quot;Dallas Road&quot; project will stretch over 1.5 miles to extend the Cotton Belt Trail with a 10-foot wide trail section along the north side of western Dallas road between William D Tate Avenue, Ball Street, and Dooley Street. A 10-foot-wide trail will also be added along the east side of Dooley north from Dallas Road to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit right of way. A 12-foot-trail section will be added east from Dooley along the north side of the DART rail corridor to Texan Trail. This will provide a very wide cement trail from Colleyville to the far east side of Grapevine.

Other bicycle paths can be found at the various city parks, most notably the trail from Parr Park to Bear Creek Park. Off-road trails are also available. The Northshore Mountain Bike trail begins at Rockledge Park on the north side of Grapevine Lake and continues into Flower Mound along the shore. Mileage is 22.5 miles broken up into two major loops: East Loops, 1 – 4, which are 12.5 miles, and the West Loops, 5 – 7. Horseshoe Trail begins at Catfish Lane, continues to Dove Road, and loops back to the trailhead, for a total of 5.4 miles.

===Running===
Grapevine received the Runner Friendly Community designation from the Road Runners Club of America. Grapevine has approximately 24 miles of hike and bike trails that link parks, schools, and businesses. The hike and bike trails have mileage markers that also have GPS coordinates for location identification in case of emergencies. The city also has an indoor 1/8 mile walking/jogging track and several outdoor tracks that belong to the local school district. The city has a joint-use agreement with the school district for the use of school facilities.

The hike and bike trails in Grapevine include water fountains, community bathrooms or portable toilets, available parking, signs linking pedestrian networks, mile markers, walk lights at busy intersections, stop signs at residential intersections, and painted crosswalks.

<text>Lewisville ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Denton County with portions extending into Dallas County. As one of the Mid-Cities within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, the 2020 census reported a population of 111,822.

Originally called Holford&#x27;s Prairie, Lewisville dates back to the early 1840s. The arrival of the town&#x27;s first railroad in 1881 engendered its initial growth, and the expansion of the area&#x27;s transportation infrastructure spurred further development in the early part of the 20th century. Lewisville incorporated in 1925, and when construction of Lewisville Lake was completed in the 1950s, the city began to expand rapidly.

Lewisville&#x27;s proximity to Lewisville Lake has made it a recreational hub of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The area&#x27;s transportation infrastructure has evolved around the I-35 Corridor along Interstate 35E. The diversity of its population and industry has created a stable economic climate. Lewisville Independent School District provides most of the area&#x27;s public education programs.

==History==

===Settlement===
In 1841, the Republic of Texas chartered the Peters Colony Land Grant Company (named for William Smalling Peters, publisher of the song &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;) to settle the North Texas area. In 1844, John W. King and his wife settled on the east side of the prairie, where the city now lies. Baptist settlers from Platte County, Missouri, settled on the west side; among them were John and James Holford, who named the area Holford&#x27;s Prairie. Further south, Presbyterians established a church and called it Flower Mound. In the confusion over land ownership after the Hedgcoxe War, Basdeal Lewis purchased Holford&#x27;s Prairie in 1853 and renamed it after himself.

In 1845, the Fox family, which owned about a dozen slaves, buried a slave child called Melinda on the family farm, which eventually became the town&#x27;s cemetery for black residents. Named Fox–Hembry Cemetery, the plot still exists today. After it had fallen into disrepair, local residents and businesses gathered to restore it in 2011. Though Abraham Lincoln was not on the ballot in the area for the 1860 Presidential election, residents of Lewisville (listed as &quot;Hollforts&quot; on election results) still gave John C. Breckinridge only a 44–31 majority over an electoral fusion option.

During Reconstruction, Lewisville became home to Denton County&#x27;s first cotton gin. Built in 1867, it could produce up to three bales per day. The Thirteenth Texas Legislature chartered the Dallas and Wichita Railroad (later the Missouri–Kansas–Texas) on terms requiring 20 miles of track to be in running order by July 1, 1875. Lewisville paid the company $15,000 to come to the city, with a promise of another $5,000 on completion. The company fulfilled the deal by completing the railroad tracks to a point just south of Lewisville on the morning of the deadline, and the line began running full-time in 1881. Republicans in the Fourteenth Texas Legislature passed a law on April 30, 1874, prohibiting alcohol within two miles of the town. Many residents ignored the law, however, and the city retained as many as 17 saloons at one point. The population of the unincorporated town was 500 in 1888.

===Progress===

On January 15, 1925, residents voted by a margin of 17 votes to incorporate Lewisville, which established its official boundaries as a city. By 1930, Lewisville&#x27;s population had increased to 853, making it the fourth-most populous municipality in Denton County (behind Denton, Sanger, and Pilot Point).

Because the city&#x27;s economy had become diversified before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Lewisville was relatively well insulated from the Great Depression. Many residents, including business leaders, nevertheless supported the New Deal programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt. By 1936, the Works Progress Administration operated a cannery in the city to provide temporary jobs for unemployed residents. As an extension of the Good Roads Movement, which had been prominent in Denton County since the early 1910s, residents formed the Good Roads Committee of Lewisville to lobby state and federal officials for funding to create better streets. Lewisville celebrated the paving of the U.S. Route 77 between Denton and Dallas in 1931 with a &quot;Coming Out of the Mud&quot; ceremony. The new pavement closed the &quot;Lewisville Gap&quot; between the two cities, a stretch of dirt road through the city that often became too muddy for travel.

The new road also led indirectly to the downfall of the area&#x27;s public transportation system. Between 1925 and 1932, the Texas Interurban Railway, an electric commuter rail service that ran from Dallas to Denton, operated a station in Lewisville. Business leaders in the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce welcomed the service at the time, proudly citing the city&#x27;s progressive citizenship. The area&#x27;s low population density could not sustain the venture, however, and in 1932, the line went out of business and immediately halted service.

On April 25, 1934, Raymond Hamilton of the Barrow gang robbed the First National Bank of Lewisville. Residents chased him to Howe, Texas, where he was captured at a roadblock and transferred to Dallas County Jail.

===Growth===
Lewisville&#x27;s rapid growth began when construction of the Garza–Little Elm Dam finished in 1954, expanding the Garza–Little Elm Reservoir into what is now Lewisville Lake. The city adopted a home-rule charter for a council–manager style of municipal government in 1963, becoming one of only a few home-rule cities in Texas with a population less than 5,000. In September 1969, 13 days after Woodstock, the city hosted the Texas International Pop Festival, which drew over 150,000 spectators and featured performances by Janis Joplin, B.B. King, and Led Zeppelin. In 2011, the Texas Historical Commission dedicated a historical event marker at the Hebron A-train station in Lewisville to commemorate the event.

When Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport opened to the south of the city in 1974 and Vista Ridge Mall opened at the intersection of Interstate 35E and Round Grove Road in 1989, Lewisville began to undergo rapid suburban growth. Its population increased from 24,273 in 1980 to 46,521 in 1990, making it the 40th-most populous city in Texas. In the early 1990s, the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce marketed the city with the slogan &quot;City of Expanding Horizons&quot;. Its population reached 77,737 in 2000, 95,290 in 2010, and 111,822 in 2020. In November 2021, the city completed the annexation of the Castle Hills development, located northeast of the city, into its boundaries, adding almost 3000 acres and 18,000 residents.

==Geography==
Lewisville has a total area of , of which is covered by water. It lies at the southern end of Denton County and the northern end of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, in the eastern part of the Cross Timbers region of Texas between the Texas Blackland Prairies and the Grand Prairie. Vista Ridge, a small plateau, is in the southeastern corner of Lewisville, and the lowest part of Denton County, at , is found in the city. Lewisville sits above the Barnett Shale, a geological formation containing a large quantity of natural shale gas.

Water constitutes about 14% of the city&#x27;s total area, including Lewisville Lake, the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, and two local tributaries of the Elm Fork - Prairie Creek and Timber Creek. A riparian zone encompasses a portion of the city in the southeast. The intersection of the Elm Fork and Lake Lewisville has given rise to a delta at the southern end of the lake, extending south. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has labeled much of the area surrounding the delta as &quot;Zone AE&quot;, meaning the area is subject to 100-year flood precautions.

===Climate===
Lewisville&#x27;s climate is classified as humid subtropical. Its Köppen climate classification is &quot;Cfa&quot;, which means it has a temperate climate, does not have a dry season, and has a hot summer. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Lewisville is in a hardiness zone of 8a. The city is seldom affected by extreme weather, but Hurricane Carla in 1961 brought winds and caused swells on Lewisville Lake. During heavy rains, Timber Creek can overflow its banks, and on rare occasions, flood some of the surrounding homes. The National Weather Service defines no official borders for Tornado Alley, but Lewisville is considered to be in it.

Lewisville&#x27;s lake and the city&#x27;s location in the DFW metroplex have contributed to the largest boat-sales market in the state by volume in a state second in the nation in overall boat sales. Because of the city&#x27;s proximity to Dallas and Fort Worth, a number of food distribution companies have branches in Lewisville, including Sysco and Meadowbrook Meat Company (MBM). Fleming Companies, one of the United States&#x27; largest food distribution companies, relocated to Lewisville in 2000, but it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2003 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced the company had been hiding massive losses. Responsive Education Solutions, which operates charter schools nationwide, is also headquartered in Lewisville. Adeptus Health, a health-care provider, and the utility company Texas—New Mexico Power are also headquartered in the city.

==Arts and cultural life==

===Lewisville Grand Theater===
The Lewisville Grand Theater, known informally as The Grand, is on the east side of Interstate 35E in Lewisville&#x27;s Old Town. It is a hub for the arts in Lewisville, able to show films, host meetings, and provide a venue for various kinds of artistic performances. The project began in 2004 and aimed to fulfill a long-term goal of building an arts center to coincide with the 2011 opening of the Old Town Station. The facility opened in January 2011 with a series of performances, children&#x27;s shows, concerts, and exhibits, and the Greater Lewisville Arts Alliance presented the theater with a $25,000 contribution to begin their fundraiser to place a Steinway piano in the theater. In 2011 and 2012, &quot;The Flower Mound Connection&quot; newspaper named the MCL Grand the best events venue in Denton County.

The facility originally was called Medical Center of Lewisville Grand Theater as part of a 10-year naming-rights agreement with the local hospital. It later changed name to Medical City Lewisville Grand Theater when the hospital was rebranded. The naming rights agreement with Medical City Lewisville ended in December 2020 and the facility was renamed Lewisville Grand Theater.

===Libraries===
The city government created the Lewisville Public Library in 1968, naming Cindy Bennett as its first director. A structure was built where the city hall now stands. A new library facility was built in 1986 as part of the municipal building on Main Street. In 2001, Lewisville voters approved a 4B tax package, part of which was dedicated to building a new library facility, the children&#x27;s wing of which was dedicated to Bennett. The $11 million renovation opened in 2006, and it received the Achievement of Excellence in Libraries Award in that year and again in 2009. Lewisville was also the temporary home of the George W. Bush Presidential Library until 2013.

===Media===
Lewisville is served mainly by media from the Dallas area, but a number of niche publications focus on local news. &quot;The Lewisville Enterprise&quot; merged with &quot;The Lewisville Leader&quot; in 1962. The paper&#x27;s publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of Lewisville Independent School District, for which he received many anonymous threats from members of the Ku Klux Klan. Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the &quot;Leader&quot;, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of &quot;Neighborsgo&quot;, a weekly section of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, as the city&#x27;s official newspaper of record.

==Parks and recreation==

The city of Lewisville operates public recreation facilities, including parks, two recreation centers, and approximately of trails. The $20 million Railroad Park was built in 2009 using the revenue from a quarter-cent sales tax increase; it was the largest capital project in the city&#x27;s history at the time. It was renamed Toyota of Lewisville Railroad Park in 2010 in a deal worth $1.5 million. The park has a baseball/softball complex, a football complex, eight lighted soccer fields, two concession buildings, a perimeter walking/jogging trail, three man-made lakes, a dog park and the Scion Skate Park. Since 2010, the skate park has hosted the Scion Regional Amateur Tour, part an annual series of six skateboarding competitions held across the country. In 2012, the venue hosted its first annual triathlon event benefiting the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Denton County.

Lewisville Lake Park comprises , which the city leases from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The park includes various amenities, including athletic fields and designated campgrounds. The Lewisville Fishing Barge, an indoor–outdoor fishing facility that opened in 1958, is on the lake. The park also hosts the Rick Neill Memorial, a cross-country running meet the Lewisville High School track and field team organizes each year. In February 2013, the city began to review a development proposal to build a resort hotel and convention center on a parcel of land next to the lake.

Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA) is a nature preserve managed by the city in partnership with Lewisville ISD and UNT. It has over 7 miles of hiking trails as well as opportunities for fishing, kayaking, and canoeing. LLELA serves as the centerpiece for the city&#x27;s Green Centerpiece Master Strategy, which aims to preserve the natural spaces around Lake Lewisville and establish the city as a major recreation destination within the DFW metro area.

Lewisville is also a major hub of the Northern Golf Corridor of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Located on the city&#x27;s southeast edge, the Lakes at Castle Hills is a Jay Morrish-designed course which opened in the late 1990s; critics have rated the course highly, praising its amenities and difficulty level. Lake Park Golf Course, near Lewisville Lake, is noted for its beginner-friendly design. The nine-hole, Lake Park Executive course opened in 1994. Lewisville is also home to professional golfer Chad Campbell, winner of the 2003 Tour Championship.

In 2011, the Lewisville Park Board proposed a new master plan for the city&#x27;s parks and recreation facilities. It specifies a major overhaul of the city&#x27;s trail system, including of off-street trails, of enhanced sidewalks, of bicycle routes, a paddling trail down the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, and 31 major and minor trailheads throughout the area, many of which would connect to other trail networks. The plan includes numerous crossings of Interstate 35E for pedestrian and bicyclist safety. In March 2012, the Park Board began reviewing a new master plan to address the next ten years of park development in the city.

==Education==

Lewisville Independent School District operates the area&#x27;s public school system, including Lewisville High School. Four of the district&#x27;s middle schools feed into two high school feeder campuses; since the 2011–2012 school year, the Killough and Harmon campuses have served the city&#x27;s ninth- and tenth-grade students, while the main campus at the intersection of FM 1171 (Main Street) and Valley Parkway is used primarily for eleventh- and twelfth-grade students. The district also operates the Technology Exploration and Career Center, with two locations (East and West), along with conducting a night high school in Lewisville.

According to American Community Survey results from 2007 to 2011, 86.7% of the city&#x27;s population aged 25 or older had graduated from high school, 29.7% held a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, and 8.4% held a graduate or professional degree. The survey estimated that 24,879 Lewisville residents over the age of three were enrolled in schools.

In addition there are two private schools located in Lewisville: Explorations Preparatory School and Lakeland Christian Academy.

Founders Classical Academy, a charter school operated by Lewisville-based ResponsiveEd, is also located in Lewisville.

==Government==
Since 1963, the City of Lewisville has operated as a home rule city with a council–manager style of municipal government. Residents elect six at-large members to serve on the City Council, including a mayor. Council elections in Texas are nonpartisan. Members are elected to three-year terms and are not term-limited. The mayor does not vote on issues that come before the council except in the case of a tie. There were three female mayors between 1985 and 2000, but no woman has served on the City Council since 2001. In 2011, the Fitch Group upgraded the city&#x27;s general obligation bond rating from &quot;AA+&quot; to &quot;AAA&quot;. Lewisville has the lowest municipal property tax rate in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. In the fiscal year 2012–2013, the city government&#x27;s operating funds totaled $124,845,436.

The Lewisville Police Department had 27 sworn police officers in 1977, and the number had increased to 136 by 2007. As of 2015, the department included 229 full-time employees, four of whom were administrators. The Lewisville Fire Department included 146 full-time employees, six of whom were administrators. After the September 11 attacks, the fire department and its then chief, Rick Lasky, attracted national attention when they raised a large amount of donations for victims&#x27; families. As a reward, John Travolta, Joaquin Phoenix, and Robert Patrick visited the department in 2004 to promote the release of the film &quot;Ladder 49&quot;. In May 2011, Lewisville residents approved a sales tax increase to create two public safety districts. The revenue from the increase will fund investments in the city&#x27;s police and fire departments, including new officers and vehicles, as well as a new fire station in the eastern part of the city.

Lewisville is in the 26th Congressional district in Texas, which is represented in the United States House of Representatives by Michael C. Burgess. As of 2023, the city is represented in District 12 of the Texas Senate by Tan Parker. The city is split between two Texas House of Representatives districts: District 63, represented by Ben Bumgarner, and District 65, represented by Kronda Thimesch. Lewisville is a voluntary member of the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the purpose of which is to coordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.

==Transportation==
The primary freeway running through Lewisville is Interstate 35E, which runs north–south through the city. Before it was built, US Highway 77 (now Mill Street) was the main through route, connecting the city with Denton to the north and Dallas to the south. In 1998, the Texas Department of Transportation carried out a Major Investment Study to examine the possibility of expanding the section of Interstate 35E between Interstate 635 and U.S. Route 380, the primary focus being an stretch from Texas State Highway 121 to the bridge crossing Lewisville Lake. The project is scheduled to add one general-purpose lane in each direction, in addition to a managed toll lane. The project is expected to allow the city to substantially renovate its portion of the I-35 Corridor. Construction on the first phase of the project is projected to begin in summer 2013 and finish in late 2016.

Texas State Highway 121, which runs along the Sam Rayburn Tollway, intersects with Interstate 35E in the southeastern edge of the city. Farm to Market Road 1171, known in the city as Main Street, runs east–west across the middle part of the city from Interstate 35E to Interstate 35W. Farm to Market Road 407 runs east–west across the northern part of the city. Lewisville also encompasses most of Farm to Market Road 3040, which runs east–west towards Carrollton and Flower Mound.

Lewisville residents voted in a special election held on September 13, 2003, to become a full member of the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA). The authority began running a regional bus service in November 2006. In 2011, the Old Town, Hebron, and Highland Village/Lewisville Lake stations opened as commuter stops along the route of the DCTA&#x27;s A-train. The route continues north to Denton and south to Trinity Mills Station in Carrollton, where it connects with the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Green Line to Dallas. DCTA also owns a Rail Operation and Maintenance Facility in Lewisville.

In September 2021, DCTA launched GoZone, an on-demand transit service in partnership with Via Transportation, throughout Denton County. In December 2021, fixed-route Lewisville Connect bus services ceased operating, with GoZone in place to cover transit throughout the city.

<text>Mesquite is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Dallas County with portions extending into Kaufman County. The population was 150,108 at the 2020 census, and making it the 22nd-most populous city in Texas. Mesquite is positioned at the crossroads of four major highways (Interstates 30, 635, 20, and U.S. Route 80), making locations such as downtown Dallas, Lake Ray Hubbard, Dallas Love Field, and DFW International Airport accessible.

According to legislative action, the city is the &quot;Rodeo Capital of Texas&quot;. In 2016, Mesquite received a Playful City USA designation for the fourth year in a row. The city has been named a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation for over 25 years. The city of Mesquite holds the 10th-longest reign in all of Texas.

Unique to suburbs of Dallas and Fort Worth, the city of Mesquite is served by its own local airport, Mesquite Metro Airport. Companies and institutions with a major presence in the city are the United Parcel Service, Sears, AT&amp;T, Charter Spectrum, Eastfield College, Ashley Furniture, and FedEx.

==History==
===Before settlement===
Centuries before American settlers moved into the area, Mesquite was an open prairie land and a key trading ground for indigenous peoples. The Ionies were a western tribe located close to present-day Fort Worth. The Tawakonies were in present-day Dallas. Finally, the Caddo were the native farmers of the Mesquite land. From 1680 to 1790, after harvest was over, these three tribes held an annual tournament and trading fair.

===Settlement===
The city of Mesquite was founded on March 14, 1878, on land along the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway, which ran from Dallas to Shreveport, Louisiana. The locals then named the town after Mesquite Creek. The city was officially incorporated on December 3, 1887, after electing Mayor J.E. Russell.

In the city&#x27;s earliest years, it was known for many outlaws residing in the area. A prominent outlaw was Sam Bass, historically known for his train robberies in Texas. In 1878, he robbed a train in downtown Mesquite, escaping with only $152. Bass missed the $30,000 hidden by the express agent in the unused pot belly stove. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Mesquiter&quot;, established in 1882 by R.S. Kimbrough, was Dallas County&#x27;s longest-running newspaper.

===Development===
Mesquite prospered through the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a farming community, growing cotton, hay, corn, and sugarbeets, and using the railroad to ship raw goods. The town remained predominantly agrarian until after World War II, when the suburban boom took root in Mesquite.

In 1946, the Mesquite Rodeo was founded by Charlie Columbus McNally, and was one of the only rodeos that had a permanent location. By the mid-1980s, the events were being broadcast by ESPN.

In 1959, Big Town Mall opened as the first air-conditioned shopping mall in the United States. Portions of the Talking Heads movie &#x27;True Stories&#x27; were filmed at this mall. The mall was demolished in the summer of 2006, and FedEx opened a logistics center on the property in 2017.

By 1970, the LBJ Freeway (I-635) was constructed, connecting Mesquite to its neighbors, Garland to the north and Balch Springs to the south. Also, in 1971, Town East Mall was constructed. The mall was used by director Ron Howard to film portions of the movie &quot;Cotton Candy&quot; in 1978. It can also be seen in drive-by footage in the Talking Heads movie &#x27;True Stories&#x27;, by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne. The mall&#x27;s associated traffic and shops would continue to grow the town.

In 1986, the Mesquite Arena opened its doors as the new home for the Mesquite ProRodeo. By 1998, the facility was expanded to include a convention center, exhibition hall, and a Hampton Inn and Suites.

By the 1990 census, the city had grown to 101,484 people, up from 1,696 residents in 1950.

In 2011, Mesquite passed a law allowing beer and wine sales in the city. The measure had been considered several times for many years, but was always blocked by strong protest against the proposed sales. It was one of the few cities without beer and wine sales in eastern Dallas County before the law came into effect.

In June 2015, the Mesquite Arts Center added a Freedom Park exhibit, in memorial of September 11. The park displays a beam that was recovered from the remains of Ground Zero. The Mesquite Fire Department received the beam in 2011.

<text>Ovilla is a city in Dallas and Ellis Counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 4,304 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
===Original settlement===

Ovilla, on upper Red Oak Creek in northern Ellis County, is the oldest town in the county. It began in 1844 as a fortified settlement known as McNamara&#x27;s to repel Indian incursions. James McNamara arrived in 1843 with his new wife, Joanna (Hale) McNamara as the first Peters Colony settlers of this area for which they received 640 acres that made up the beginning of the locale that was later to be called &#x27;Shiloh&#x27; for a nearby creek and a newly formed church. The McNamaras arrived with other Peters colonists: the Billingsleys; Mrs. McNamara&#x27;s family, the McCommases; and James Sterrett (Mrs. McNamara&#x27;s brother-in-law, who established Sterrett, Texas). The marriage of James Sterrett to Clarinda (Hale) Squires of 7 July 1844 was the first marriage to be performed within the future boundaries of Ellis County, which was still within old Robertson County at the time. James McNamara served as sergeant in Smith&#x27;s Company of Texas Mounted Volunteers during the War with Mexico in 1846–1847 along with his brother-in-law, James Sterrett. The little village grew as other Peters Colony settlers arrived in the area to attend brush arbor meetings of the Shiloh Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which was started by Rev. Finis E. King in 1847. James McNamara died in New Orleans on 5 May 1852, and his widow liquefied his assets and left Texas for the gold fields in Tuolumne County, California, with all of her remaining maternal family members.

===First public buildings===
The church met in a brush arbor until 1853, when a log cabin, which served as both church and schoolhouse, was built. A frame church building was finished in 1872; in 1984, about 190 members still met in the structure, which had been enlarged and remodeled. The church was instrumental in moving Trinity University to Waxahachie in 1902 and in establishing a girls&#x27; school in the nearby town of Milford.

===20th century breakthrough===
Although Ovilla was a thriving farming community by the 1850s, it remained unnamed. Mrs. M. M. Molloy, wife of Rev. D. G. Molloy, formed the name from the Spanish word &quot;villa&quot;. Ovilla continued to grow, and by the early 1900s, had a post office, a bank, a cotton gin, a pharmacy, a blacksmith shop, and several dry-goods stores. Its post office closed in 1906. Fires in 1918 and 1926 destroyed most of the downtown buildings, and this destruction, together with the fact that Ovilla was bypassed by railroads and major highways, led to a decline in growth.

===City incorporation===
As Dallas grew, however, and people started moving from the city to the suburbs, Ovilla once again began to grow. To escape annexation by DeSoto or any other neighboring city, the town of Ovilla was incorporated in 1963. In the first census after incorporation, its population was 339; by 1980, it had risen to 1,067. Its 1984 population was estimated to be nearly 1,300. In 1990, it was 2,027, and the community had extended into Dallas County. The 2000 census showed a population of 3,405, rising to 3,492 as of the 2010 census.

===Famous history===
Boxcar Willie was born in the area surrounding Ovilla; the overpass at Interstate 35E and FM 664 in Red Oak is named in his memory.

Several episodes of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; with Chuck Norris were shot in part here. Downtown Ovilla was the set of an old Indian town.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.7 square miles (14.8 km), all land.

==Demographics==

<doc id="151162" wikidata="Q976950" url="?curid=151162" title="Rowlett, Texas">
<text>Rowlett (, traditionally ) is a city in Dallas and Rockwall Counties in Texas, United States, and an eastern suburb of Dallas. It is a growing, upscale community with nearly $1.5 billion in development in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, located on Lake Ray Hubbard.

The population was 62,535 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 66,813.

==History==
Rowlett derives its name from Rowlett Creek, which flows into Lake Ray Hubbard and is a major tributary of the east fork of the Trinity River. The creek in turn was named for a waterway running through the property of Daniel Rowlett who moved from Kentucky to Bonham, Texas, in 1835. Daniel, who was a member of the Smoot-Rowlett political family, had no direct dealings with the town that now bears his name.

The first post office opened on April 5, 1880, and it was called &quot;Morris&quot; after Postmaster Austin Morris.

The town was later renamed &quot;Rowlett&quot;. The Dallas and Greenville Railway passed through the town in 1886, connecting Dallas with Greenville, Texas, and the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Shortly after its opening, the line was formally sold to the MKT.

In 1921, the town was a stop on the Bankhead Highway.

The town incorporated in 1952 when its population was 250. In the 1960s, the town languished as Interstate 30 bypassed Rowlett.

The town has had a building boom since the completion of Lake Ray Hubbard in 1971 – growing to 1,600 by 1973; 10,573 by 1989; 23,260 by 1990; and 44,503 by 2000.

Rowlett gained international notoriety in 1996 when local resident Darlie Routier was convicted of murdering her children as they slept.

In 2003, the town made an unsuccessful formal proposal to get the Dallas Cowboys to move to a &quot;5-Point Park&quot; on the banks of Lake Ray Hubbard when the lease for Texas Stadium expires.

In 2013, the Rowlett City Council was challenged by the Freedom From Religion Foundation and Metroplex Atheists regarding opening prayer invocations at city hall meetings. In a court case in May 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed a previous court ruling (Marsh v. Chambers) upholding the tradition of opening legislative sessions with sectarian prayer and additionally ruled in favor of a town&#x27;s right to have invocations given by the predominant religion within its borders as long as it did not discriminate or coerce participation. (Town of Greece v. Galloway) Atheist proponents then asked the Rowlett City Council to be included in giving invocations. They were denied based on the Supreme Court ruling and city policy stating the invocation should be given by members of the community&#x27;s locally established religious congregations.&quot;

On the evening of December 26, 2015, a violent storm produced a deadly EF4 tornado that tore a 13-mile path from the neighboring cities of Sunnyvale, Texas and Garland, Texas through the southeast portion of Rowlett, severely damaging or destroying hundreds of homes and vehicles along with several businesses and a city water tower.

On February 8, 2017, the historic water tower on Martha Lane built in 1980 was demolished two years after it suffered damage from the EF4 tornado on December 26, 2015.

In 2019, the City of Rowlett gained regional recognition when Sapphire Bay Development, LLC and the City published plans to construct a master planned community in the middle of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The 116-acre development will be Texas&#x27; first resort destination anchored by a man-made lagoon, offering guests a luxurious stay along its shore at the 500 room Sapphire Bay Resort, operated and managed by Destination Hotels by Hyatt. The project will also feature a surf village and a water park, 1,500+ residential units, 1.7 million square feet of mixed-use restaurant, retail, entertainment, office and hospitality space, 20+ acres of parks and trails, a 1,000 slip marina.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 21.2% of the population. 23.4% of residents were under the age of 18, 6.1% were under 5 years of age, and 11.7% were 65 and older.

<doc id="151163" wikidata="Q976464" url="?curid=151163" title="Seagoville, Texas">
<text>Seagoville ( ) is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States, and a suburb of Dallas. A small portion of Seagoville extends into Kaufman County. The population was 18,446 at the 2020 census. The city is located along U.S. Highway 175, from downtown Mesquite.

==History==
Seagoville was originally called Seago, and under this name was laid out in 1876 by T. K. Seago (1836–1904), and named after him. The United States Post Office changed the town&#x27;s name to &quot;Seagoville&quot; in 1910 to prevent confusion with another city in Texas called Sego.

During World War II, the Federal Reformatory for Women in Seagoville was the site of an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention camp for Japanese, German, and Italian Americans classified as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; and women of Japanese and German ancestry deported from Latin America. Internees at Seagoville published a German language newsletter called the &quot;Sägedorfer Fliegende Blätter&quot;. The camp housed up to 647 people, and was closed in June 1945, after the internees were either &quot;repatriated&quot; to Japan or Germany, or transferred to Crystal City, Texas.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.58%, is covered by water.

==Demographics==


At the 2020 United States census, there were 18,446 people, 4,283 households, and 3,445 families residing in the city.

==Government and infrastructure==

Federal Correctional Institution, Seagoville is located in Seagoville.

The United States Postal Service operates the Seagoville Post Office on Seagoville Road in Kleberg, Dallas. It was previously located at 314 Glendale Avenue, in a rented facility in Seagoville. Since around 1882 a post office had been located in the Seagoville city limits. In 2011, the USPS announced that it was closing the existing Seagoville post office and consolidating it into the Kleberg Post Office, a USPS-owned facility since renamed to the Seagoville Post Office, citing cost-cutting reasons in response to a budget shortfall. Though individuals had offered to pay for the rental costs at Seagoville, the USPS insisted on closing the city post office. As of 2011, the Seagoville city post office was busier than the Kleberg one.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====

Portions of Seagoville are within three separate independent school districts.

=====Dallas Independent School District=====

Almost all of the Dallas County portion of Seagoville is served by the Dallas Independent School District. The area is within the Board of Trustees District 4. Portions of Seagoville are zoned to Central Elementary School, Seagoville North Elementary School, and Seagoville Elementary School. All of the city is zoned to Seagoville Middle School (6–8), and Seagoville High School (9–12).

Seagoville North Elementary School was scheduled to open in 2012. Prior to 2012, the students in the Dallas County portion were zoned to Seagoville Elementary School (at the time, grades Pre-K–2) and Central Elementary School (at the time, grades 3–5).

Seagoville Elementary, Seagoville North, and Central Elementary are within the Seagoville city limits, while Seagoville Middle and Seagoville High are in Dallas, near the city of Seagoville. Seagoville Alternative Center, an alternative school is within the city limits.

DISD maintains the Seagoville Stadium.

Seagoville Independent School District was previously the town&#x27;s school district. In 1965, the district was absorbed into the Dallas Independent School District.

=====Crandall Independent School District=====

The minuscule Kaufman County portion is served by Crandall Independent School District. The students in the Crandall portion are zoned to Wilson Elementary School, Crandall Middle School, and Crandall High School. Wilson Elementary and Crandall Middle are within the city of Crandall. Crandall High is partially in Crandall and partially in unincorporated Kaufman County.

=====Mesquite Independent School District=====

A very small portion of northeast Seagoville is within the boundaries of Mesquite Independent School District. That portion is served by Achziger Elementary School, Terry Middle School, and John Horn High School (all three schools are in Mesquite). The area was formerly zoned to Thompson Elementary School.

=====History of schools=====

The first school established in Seagoville was the Brinegar School. The one-room log schoolhouse, which featured split-log seating, was constructed around 1867 in the area of the modern-day Heard Park. Professor J.T. Doss built a new school building in 1880; it was called Woodside. Another school opened in a four-frame building. A cyclone destroyed one of its rooms in 1903, and in 1909 that school was destroyed in a fire. In 1910 a new brick high school building opened on the site of what is now Seagoville Elementary School. The building, a two-story facility with four rooms for upper grades upstairs and four rooms for lower grades downstairs, on land on North Kaufman Street was donated by Ben H. Fly. It was built for about $10,000 ($283,000 adjusted for inflation to 2022), and was known as &quot;The High School&quot; and &quot;the Old Red Schoolhouse&quot;.

Seagoville High School first opened in 1928 on land purchased in 1927. This high school building later burned down, and Central Elementary School opened on the former high-school site. The current high school facility and Seagoville Middle School opened on a plot of land donated by M.D. Reeves in 1952: one building opened in 1955 and the other opened in September 1958. Seagoville was in the Seagoville Independent School District until August 1964, when it merged into DISD.

===Public libraries===

Seagoville has its own public library, the Seagoville Public Library, at 702 North U.S. Highway 175.

===Community colleges===

The Texas Legislature defines all of Dallas County (including the vast majority of Seagoville) as being in the Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College or DCCCD) district. The portion in Kaufman County is within the Trinity Valley Community College district.

==Parks and recreation==
The Dallas Independent School District operates the Seagoville Stadium in Seagoville.

<doc id="151166" wikidata="Q977197" url="?curid=151166" title="Pecan Gap, Texas">
<text>Pecan Gap is a city in Delta and Fannin counties within the U.S. state of Texas. It is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;The Gap&quot; by area residents. The population was 178 at the time of the 2020 census. It is named for the gap between two pecan trees, but unfortunately one of the two pecan trees was destroyed by a tornado in 1963.

==History==

The first inhabitants of the area that is now Pecan Gap were the Caddo people, who settled large portions of eastern Texas as early as 800 CE. The Caddo were highly advanced, living in large wooden structures, and were skilled farmers. The first European to visit the area was French explorer François Hervey, around 1750. A few decades afterwards, European disease and attacks from neighboring tribes as well as attacks from European settlers forced the Caddo out of the area around Pecan Gap. Around 1820, Delaware, Quapaw, and Seminole tribes began settling in the area. In 1836, the Republic of Texas officially recognized the region around Pecan Gap as part of Red River County. In 1840, Lamar County was formed, which absorbed much of the area just south of Pecan Gap. However, just six years later, the region was designated as part of the newly formed Hopkins County. In 1870 Delta County was created. As Pecan Gap grew it expanded west into Fannin County.

==Geography==
Pecan Gap is located at the junction of Farm to Market Roads 64 and 128.

Pecan Gap is one of just two incorporated communities in Delta County. The city is the second largest in the county, population-wise, behind Cooper. According to statistics from the Census Bureau, the city covers a total area of , of which , or 1.13%, is water.

The region&#x27;s elevation rarely varies from around . The area&#x27;s geology consists mainly of deep clay, or clay mixed with a dark-colored loam. However, the county is also known to have high-quality topsoil, ideal for crop growing. A specific layer of the soil in the region is known as Pecan Gap Chalk, named for the city when it was discovered nearby in 1918. The layer is a blue-gray, sandy chalk substance, which is fossil-rich and is located in much of the Pecan Gap vicinity.

<doc id="151167" wikidata="Q976183" url="?curid=151167" title="Flower Mound, Texas">
<text>Flower Mound is an incorporated town located in Denton and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas. Located northwest of Dallas and northeast of Fort Worth adjacent to Grapevine Lake, the town derives its name from a prominent mound located in the center of town.

After settlers used the site for religious camps during the 1840s, the area around Flower Mound was first permanently inhabited in the 1850s; however, residents did not incorporate until 1961. Although an effort to create a planned community failed in the early 1970s, Flower Mound&#x27;s population increased substantially when Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport opened to the south in 1974. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 75,956, reflecting a 17% increase over the 64,669 counted in the 2010 census. Of the Texas municipalities that label themselves &quot;towns&quot;, Flower Mound has the largest population. Flower Mound was the only town with a population greater than 20,000 in the 2020 census.

Flower Mound&#x27;s municipal government, operating under a council–manager system, has invested in a public park system highlighted by an extensive network of trails. Lewisville Independent School District, which operates public schools, covers the majority of Flower Mound. With its moderately affluent population and proximity to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Flower Mound has used a smart growth system for urban planning, and has recently experienced more rapid light industrial growth to match the growing needs of the primarily residential community.

==History==
Settlement in the area around Flower Mound began when the Presbyterians established a camp in the area in the 1840s. A log cabin, dated around 1850, was discovered preserved within the walls of a home near Liberty Elementary in 2016, providing further proof of settlement. At first, the group held religious camps for two to three weeks at a time. By 1854, residents had established the Flower Mound Presbyterian Church southwest of Lewisville in an area commonly referred to as &quot;Long Prairie&quot;. By 1920, the church had 126 members, and the pine-framed building was expanded in 1937. Early settlers such as Andrew Morriss and David Kirkpatrick are memorialized with street names in the town. The area remained sparsely populated for many decades after its initial settlement.

On February 25, 1961, the town voted to incorporate to avoid annexation by the City of Irving. William Wilkerson, who became the town&#x27;s second mayor, led the incorporation effort and helped improve the town&#x27;s phone service and water supply. In 1970, when Flower Mound had 1,685 residents, Edward S. Marcus and Raymond Nasher began a planned community project with $18 million in loan guarantees from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development through their New Community program. Called &quot;Flower Mound New Town&quot;, the project included elements of the new towns movement, including collaboration with North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) to move the school&#x27;s administrative offices to Flower Mound and conduct all research for the project. The project was featured in advertisements as late as 1974, but it was abandoned after residents threatened to disannex a portion of the town to thwart the development. The disannexation effort sharply divided the town, and led to a number of strongly contested elections between 1971 and 1976. In 1976, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; awarded the project its &quot;Bum Steer Award&quot; after the project lost its federal loan guarantees.

The construction of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport south of the town in 1974 sparked a period of rapid growth. Between 1980 and 1990, Flower Mound&#x27;s population increased from 4,402 to 15,896. It reached 50,702 in 2000, an average annual increase of nearly 13 percent per year during the 1990s, making it the nation&#x27;s tenth fastest-growing community. Between 2000 and 2002, Flower Mound was the ninth fastest-growing municipality in the United States with a population of more than 50,000, and its population continued to increase by approximately five percent each year between 2000 and 2005. Controlled growth continues in central and western Flower Mound.

==Geography==
Flower Mound is located approximately northwest of Dallas and northeast of Fort Worth on the border between Denton and Tarrant counties. The town is located almost entirely in Denton County, however it has areas that extend into Tarrant County. It is situated on the basin of the Trinity River in the Eastern Cross Timbers subregion in Texas.

The fossilized creature from the Cenomanian age was named &quot;Protohadros byrdi&quot; in Byrd&#x27;s honor.

===“The Mound”===
Flower Mound was named for a hill approximately in height located close to the intersection of FM 3040 and FM 2499. The formation attracted the attention of early settlers to the area, and is often simply referred to as &quot;The Mound&quot;. Part of the Texas blackland prairies, The Mound is typically covered by big bluestem, little bluestem, and Indian grasses. During blooming seasons, dozens of varieties of flowers can grow on its slopes, often aided by the water retained by gilgai formations. Though surrounded by commercial and residential development, The Mound is owned and maintained by The Mound Foundation, a non-profit private–public partnership. The group has advocated for a controlled burn on The Mound for many years, and it expressed relief when an accidental New Year&#x27;s Eve fire in late 2011 spurred the growth of wildflowers for the first time in years.

<doc id="151170" wikidata="Q980506" url="?curid=151170" title="Trophy Club, Texas">
<text>Trophy Club is an affluent suburb of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in the U.S. state of Texas. When established in the 1970s, it was one of the earliest premier planned communities in Texas, built around the only golf course designed by Ben Hogan. It is located west of the DFW Airport and south of the western edge of Grapevine Lake, spanning the county line separating Denton and Tarrant along State Highway 114. The population was 13,688 in 2020.

==History==

Trophy Club&#x27;s history dates back to 1847 when Charles and Matilda Medlin and twenty other families left the state of Missouri to settle in the then-thriving Elizabethtown, Texas. The Medlin&#x27;s were part of the Peters Colony, a group of settlers in the 19th century that settled in various areas in Texas in hopes to acquire land grants. The families in Elizabethtown remained there until the Elizabeth Creek flooded, causing the families to relocate to higher ground. That area is now present-day Trophy Club.

The Medlins made a lasting impact on the development of the town, and a cemetery was constructed in honor of the Medlins&#x27; daughter, Mittie Ann Medlin. The middle school in Trophy Club was also named after the Medlins. The cemetery has information on the settlers that lived in the area.

Long after the time of the Medlins, citizens of DFW began talk about restoring the town. Eventually, the community was developed in 1973 by developers Johnson and Loggins, who created the community as a housing development surrounding the country club. The town was named for the original plan that the country club would house the trophy collections of golf legend Ben Hogan, who designed its golf course. Originally part of Westlake, the town was incorporated in 1985. The first Mayor of Trophy Club was James &quot;Jim&quot; P. Carter, who served as Mayor from 1985 until 1999.

==Geography==

Council members are elected at-large-by-place for a term of three years. All powers of the Town are vested in the Council, including but not limited to: enacting legislation, adopting budgets and determining policies. The Mayor participates in the discussion and votes on all matters coming before the Council. Additionally, the Mayor, after Council authorization, signs all contracts, conveyances made or entered into by the Town, all bonds, warrants and any other obligations issued under the Town Charter. The Mayor is recognized as the official head of the Town by the courts for the purpose of serving civil process, by the Governor for the purpose of enforcing military law and for all ceremonial purposes.

<text>Westlake is a town in Denton and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas, and a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in North Texas. The population is 1,623 as of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
The area known as Westlake was originally settled in 1847 by Charles and Matilda Medlin with about 20 other families. In the mid-twentieth century, what is now Westlake was known as Circle T Ranch, a 2,000 acre ranch founded by Dallas attorney and oilman J. Glenn Turner. When incorporated in the late 1950s, the name Southlake, Texas already existed, so ranchers and homeowners took the name Westlake.

During the late 1990s, the Board of Alderman attempted to disband the town. The large Solana development was annexed by Southlake, while several large tracts of land were annexed by Fort Worth, Texas. A local district judge ruled the annexations in violation of state law, and the properties returned under Westlake jurisdiction.

In 2000, the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot; featured a story about the battle to disband the town in the face of development by Ross Perot, Jr.

The city does not provide its own police force. Instead, law enforcement services are contracted from the City of Keller, which provides patrol and traffic enforcement officers to serve Westlake. The city does, however, provide its own Fire-EMS services.

The Town of Westlake has quickly established itself as a Financial Service Industry Cluster within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The Town is home to multiple financial-based institutions, with more to come.

=== The Plaza at Solana ===
The Plaza at Solana, built in the 1980s and designed by famous architect Ricardo Legorreta, was the first of its kind for the DFW Metroplex. At its inception, the Solana Business Park housed the IBM Corporation with more than 1,000,000 square feet of office space. Today, The Plaza at Solana contains a variety of over 30 businesses and a few restaurants that brings in a daytime population of over 3,000 employees. The properties are also home to the Solana Marriott Hotel. Currently, the Westlake Town Hall and municipal court is located in the Solana Terrace portion of the business park. Solana is also home to the headquarters of technology services provider Sabre Corporation.

In January 2017, a fast-growing agency and franchise announced plans to relocate its corporate headquarters from Irving, TX to the Solana business park in Westlake. The company signed a lease for 62,000 square foot in office space at Solana, which recently completed a $70 million renovation. Goosehead said it planned to move about 150 employees to Westlake from its headquarters in Irving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaskovich, Star-Telegram 1/11/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Chicago based real estate property manager, Glenstar Properties, bought the Solana Terrace and its related buildings.

The 1,160,000 square foot Charles Schwab Corporation campus houses over 5,000 employees. 

=== Entrada ===
Entrada is a mixed-use project in the Town that runs along Highway 114 East meant to emulate a village in Catalonia. The buildings have no setbacks and can be somewhat taller echoing the European-inspired design. Once completed, Entrada will contain large amounts of retail, restaurants, offices, entertainment, and at least one hotel in the project. Entrada also will have 322 residential units, including 170 single family villas, 50 townhomes and 100 condominiums.

The first phase of the $500 million walkable village is at the corner of F.M. 1938 and Texas 114. A one of a kind CVS Pharmacy was the first business to open its doors in October 2016. Shortly thereafter a Primrose School opened in August 2016. Since then Entrada has gained multiple retail tenants. The heart of the development, however, will be the Plaza Mayor which will contain a large one acre or more plaza surrounded by condominiums and at least one hotel along with ground floor retail components.

Project Blizzard is a 44-acre planned mixed-use development on the 114/170 merge and next to Lake Turner to be developed by Hillwood Properties, a Ross Perot Jr. company, and the Howard Hughes Corporation. The southern portion of the project will be used as Charles Schwab&#x27;s Corporate Campus. The Schwab project includes a $315 million, 1,160,000 square-foot regional campus in Westlake that ultimately will bring 5,000 jobs to the North Texas within 10 years. Developers also plan a hotel, retail stores, and residences. The Schwab campus will be on the Westlake-Roanoke border, just north of JT Ottinger Road and west of Turner Lake. Governor Greg Abbott says the project will get a $6 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund, creating the most new jobs of any enterprise fund grant made during his administration.
