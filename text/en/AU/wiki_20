<text>Rocky II is a 1979 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film is the sequel to &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976) and the second installment in the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series. It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), struggling to adjust to his newfound fame and family life, finds himself in a rematch fiercely demanded by Apollo Creed (Weathers).

Development of &quot;Rocky II&quot; began in 1977, after Stallone completed the screenplay. United Artists was reluctant to allow Stallone to direct after John G. Avildsen, the director of the first film, was unable to return. Stallone was eventually hired after refusing to allow the film to be made without him as director, and the returns of the rest of the cast were secured soon thereafter. Principal photography commenced in 1978, with filming held primarily on location in Philadelphia, during which Stallone sustained several injuries. The film is dedicated to the late Jane Oliver who was Stallone&#x27;s first agent.
&quot;Rocky II&quot; was theatrically released in the United States by United Artists on June 15, 1979. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its characterization, finale, and Stallone&#x27;s performance. It grossed $200 million worldwide and $85 million in North America, making it the third highest-grossing film of 1979 domestically and the second highest-grossing film worldwide. The sequel, &quot;Rocky III&quot;, was released in 1982.

==Plot==

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1976, world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed has successfully defended his title in a split decision against challenger Rocky Balboa. He and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Despite their agreement that there would be no rematch, Apollo challenges Rocky again that night to prove that Rocky going the distance with him was a fluke, but Rocky declines and retires from professional boxing. Balboa&#x27;s girlfriend, Adrian, supports his choice as do his doctors who go on to reveal that Rocky will require surgery for a detached retina, a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and asks whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Apollo confirms that he did.

After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his newfound celebrity status. An agent sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian; she happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Adrian reveals that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Apollo, fueled by hate mail claiming he fixed the fight in order to protect his reign as champ, becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to discredit Rocky&#x27;s performance. Determined to rectify his boxing career&#x27;s only blemish, Apollo demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement, despite the pleas of his friends and family that Rocky&#x27;s ability to absorb punishment is too dangerous for his chances to successfully defend the title a second time.

Rocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo&#x27;s smear campaign, but his limited education and poor manners soon lead him into financial problems. After several unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of facing Apollo. Mickey declines out of concern for Rocky&#x27;s health, but he changes his mind after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight, but he retorts that fighting is all he knows. Adrian backs down but refuses to support him.

Rocky and Mickey begin training, but Rocky is unfocused due to Adrian&#x27;s disapproval. Adrian&#x27;s brother, Paulie, confronts his sister about not supporting her husband, but Adrian faints during the confrontation and is rushed to the hospital, where she goes into labor. Despite being born prematurely, the baby is healthy, but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what happened and refuses to leave her bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until the baby can be together with his mother. When Adrian comes out of her coma she finds Rocky by her bedside, and the couple is soon shown their new baby boy, who they name Robert &quot;Rocky Jr&quot;. Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch and Rocky quickly gets into shape for the fight.

On Thanksgiving, the night of the match, Apollo makes a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the distance was a fluke. Unlike the first fight, Apollo has trained heavily. In order to protect his vulnerable eye, Rocky opts to fight right-handed rather than his natural southpaw, but this leaves him at a major disadvantage, as he is knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight. Going into the fifteenth and final round, Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. However, Creed wants to win by knock-out in order to erase any doubts about his superiority and ignores his trainer&#x27;s pleas to stay back.

In the final round, Rocky switches back to his natural stance and, in dramatic fashion, unleashes a series of counter punches on Creed. Both men, exhausted, trade punches until Rocky is able to gain the upper hand and knock Creed down. The blow causes Rocky to also lose his balance and fall at the same time. As both men struggle to regain their feet, Rocky is able to will himself up at the count of 9 while Apollo collapses from exhaustion, giving Rocky the win by knockout and making him the new heavyweight champion. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech to the crowd and holds the belt over his head with a message for his wife, who is watching the fight on television: &quot;Yo, Adrian, I did it!&quot;

== Cast ==

* Sylvester Stallone as Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa, &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot;: the underdog who was given one chance at winning the heavyweight championship from Apollo Creed in the first film. Due to the public&#x27;s belief that it was very possible that Rocky could have won, he gets a second shot at the title in this film.
* Talia Shire as Adrian Balboa: Rocky&#x27;s love interest-turned-wife. During labor, with their first son, she enters a coma for a large portion of the film.
* Burt Young as Paulie Pennino: Rocky&#x27;s best-friend-turned-brother-in-law
* Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed: The current world heavyweight champion who gave Rocky a shot at the title in the first film, during which he won by split-decision. Because of the close outcome of the fight the general public believes that Apollo did not necessarily win, and thus he gives Rocky a second chance in a rematch.
* Burgess Meredith as Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Goldmill: Rocky&#x27;s friend, manager and trainer; a former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s and the owner of the local boxing gym.
* Tony Burton as Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers: Apollo&#x27;s father-figure, friend, trainer, and manager.
* Sylvia Meals as Mary Anne Creed: Apollo Creed&#x27;s wife.
* Seargeoh Stallone as Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa Jr.: Rocky and Adrian&#x27;s newborn child. Seargeoh appeared in the film uncredited.
* Paul Micale as Father Carmine: Rocky&#x27;s priest.
* Joe Spinell as Tony Gazzo: loan shark and Rocky&#x27;s former employer.
* Frank McRae as meat foreman.
Jeff Temkin portrays the ring announcer. Appearing as themselves are referee Lou Filippo and commentators Brent Musburger, Stu Nahan and Bill Baldwin. LeRoy Neiman makes an uncredited non-speaking cameo appearance during the training scenes in the film; he is shown drawing a picture of Apollo while he is training.

==Production==

===Development and writing===

After the enormous success of the first &quot;Rocky&quot;, the producers were anxious to make a sequel. Stallone again wrote the script, originally titled &quot;Rocky II: Redemption&quot;, but John G. Avildsen declined to direct again because he was busy with pre-production on &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. Stallone wanted the job and waged as big a campaign as he had for the lead role in the previous film. United Artists executives were reluctant to give the actor the directing reins because, while he had previously directed the drama &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;, it was not a success. However, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff understood how much of the success of the first &quot;Rocky&quot; had come from Stallone&#x27;s enormous input and lobbied hard to get him the job. Stallone wanted boxer Chuck Wepner to play Rocky&#x27;s sparring partner, but Wepner was in a destructive cycle and failed his audition.

===Filming===
The story development of Rocky surprising Creed by switching to fighting right-handed was not in the original script and only came about because of an accident on set. While getting in shape for the film, Stallone experienced an almost complete tear on his right pectoralis major muscle while trying to bench press 100 kg with bodybuilder Franco Columbu and underwent a partially successful surgery in order to try to reattach the muscle. Therefore, he could not fight with his left hand.

The film&#x27;s ending fight sequence also posed a challenge because at the time Talia Shire was busy making the drama &quot;Old Boyfriends&quot; and couldn&#x27;t be on the set. So Stallone came up with the idea of having her watch the fight from home because of the new baby. Adrian&#x27;s scenes were actually filmed some months later, toward the end of the shoot.

An estimated 800 school children were used as extras in the scene in which Rocky runs through Philadelphia and climbs the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
==Music==
===Soundtrack===

Just as in the previous installment, Bill Conti composed the film&#x27;s music. A soundtrack album containing Conti&#x27;s score was released on August 25, 1979, and charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for five consecutive weeks.

====Chart positions====
==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Rocky II&quot; opened in 805 theatres and grossed $6,390,537 during its opening weekend, and $11 million in its first week, to rank number one at the US box office. It went on to gross $85,182,160 in the United States and Canada, and $200,182,160 worldwide. It finished in the top three highest-grossing films of 1979, in both the North American market and worldwide.

&quot;Rocky II&quot; returned to UA 75% of &quot;Rocky&quot;&#x27;s rentals in the United States and Canada ($42 million vs. $56 million) when the rule of thumb at the time was that a sequel would only do 30% to 40% of the business of its predecessor.

===Critical response===
&quot;Rocky II&quot; holds a 73% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Rocky II&quot; is a movie that dares you to root again for the ultimate underdog – and succeeds due to an infectiously powerful climax.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on nine critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has a waxy feeling, and it never comes to life the way its predecessor did.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;In its boxing and training scenes &quot;Rocky II&quot; packs much of the punch the original did, complete with an exciting pugilistic finale that&#x27;s even better than its predecessor. However, in an attempt to tell the new story—that of Rocky&#x27;s adjustment to near-success and an attempt to live a non-boxing life—the plot tends to drag and the picture takes on a murky quality.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;What is most remarkable about &quot;Rocky II&quot; is that it recalls so many scenes from the original film, which is only three years old and was shown on national television last fall, and yet—amazingly—it all works. Almost every bit of it.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Rocky II&quot; does not merely exploit the original, it extends it logically and grippingly, preserving all the traits of character (and of movie character) that made &quot;Rocky I&quot; work so well—those notions that ordinary people are worth knowing about, that love is the surpassing emotion in our lives and that some things are worth struggling hard for, even if there may only be the honor of the struggle to show in the end.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;slavishly repeats the plot of &quot;Rocky&quot;, achieving differentiation only in dubious forms: soap opera detours, delaying tactics and an ugly new mood of viciousness surrounding a rematch between the boxers.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film won Best Picture at the American Movie Awards and won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture. Dre Rivas of Film.com included it in his list of top ten films of 1979.

==Other media==

===Sequel===

A sequel titled &quot;Rocky III&quot;, was released in May 1982.

===Novelization ===
A novelization was published by Ballantine Books in 1979. Sylvester Stallone was credited as the author. The book is a first-person narrative told by Rocky himself.

===Video games===
In 1987, &quot;Rocky&quot; was released, based on the first four &quot;Rocky&quot; films. In 2002, another &quot;Rocky&quot; was released, based on the first five &quot;Rocky&quot; films. In 2004, &quot;Rocky Legends&quot; was released, based on the first four &quot;Rocky&quot; films.

<doc id="149435" wikidata="Q185151" url="?curid=149435" title="Ronnie James Dio">
<text>Ronald James Padavona (July 10, 1942 – May 16, 2010), known professionally as Ronnie James Dio, was an American heavy metal singer. He fronted numerous bands throughout his career, including Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio and Heaven &amp; Hell.

Dio&#x27;s music career began in 1957 as part of the Vegas Kings (later Ronnie and the Rumblers). In 1967, he formed the rock band Elf, in which he sang and played bass. In 1975, Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore founded the band Rainbow and hired Dio to be the lead singer; during his tenure, the band released three studio albums. Dio quickly emerged as one of heavy rock&#x27;s pre-eminent vocalists. In 1979, Dio replaced Ozzy Osbourne as Black Sabbath&#x27;s lead singer and appeared on three studio albums with the band, all three of which met with success: &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; (1980), &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (1981) and &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; (1992). In 1982, he left to form the band Dio, which itself had two albums certified platinum by the RIAA. In 2006, he founded the band Heaven &amp; Hell with ex-bandmate Tony Iommi. In November 2009, Dio was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died of the disease six months later.

Dio is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal vocalists of all time. He is known for popularizing the &quot;devil horns&quot; hand gesture in metal culture and his medieval-themed song lyrics. According to a version provided by the singer himself, the act derives directly from the classic Italian apotropaic gesture, which his grandmother often displayed. Dio had a powerful, versatile vocal range and was capable of singing both hard rock and lighter ballads. He was awarded the &quot;Metal Guru Award&quot; by &quot;Classic Rock Magazine&quot; in 2006. He was also named the &quot;Best Metal Singer&quot; at the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods Awards in 2010 and ranked as the genre&#x27;s best vocalist in 2013 by music journalist Sacha Jenkins.

== Early life ==
Ronnie James &quot;Dio&quot; Padavona was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Italian-American parents Patrick and Anna from Cortland, New York. His family moved to Portsmouth from Cortland as part of his father&#x27;s service in the U.S. Army during World War II, and they resided there for only a short time before returning to Cortland. Padavona listened to a great deal of opera while growing up and was influenced vocally by American tenor Mario Lanza. His first formal musical training began at age 5, learning to play the trumpet. It was during high school that Padavona formed his first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group, The Vegas Kings, which would later be named Ronnie and the Rumblers and then Ronnie and the Red Caps. Though Padavona began his rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll career on trumpet, he added singing to his skill set and also assumed bass guitar duties for the groups.

Padavona graduated from Cortland High School in 1960. He was allegedly offered a scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School of Music but did not take up the offer due to his interest in rock music. He instead attended the University at Buffalo to major in pharmacology. There, he played trumpet in the university&#x27;s concert band; however, he only attended the university from 1960 to 1961 and did not graduate. Then he enrolled at Cortland State College but dropped out as well. In a 2000 interview, he stated that he majored in history and minored in English.

Despite being known for his powerful singing voice, Padavona claimed to have never received any vocal training. He instead attributed his singing ability to the use of breathing techniques he learned while playing trumpet.

==Career==
===Early career===
Dio&#x27;s musical career began in 1957, when he and several Cortland, New York, musicians formed the band The Vegas Kings. The group&#x27;s lineup consisted of Dio on bass guitar, Billy DeWolfe on lead vocals, Nick Pantas on guitar, Tom Rogers on drums and Jack Musci on saxophone. The band changed its name to Ronnie and the Rumblers. In 1958, the band again changed its name to Ronnie and the Redcaps. Musci left the band in 1960 and a new guitarist, Dick Botoff, joined the lineup. The band released two singles: The first single was &quot;Conquest&quot;/&quot;Lover&quot; with the A-side being an instrumental track reminiscent of the Ventures and the B-side featuring DeWolfe on lead vocals. The second was &quot;An Angel Is Missing&quot;/&quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; featuring Dio on lead vocals for both tracks.

Explanations vary for how Padavona adopted the stage name &quot;Dio&quot;. One is that Padavona&#x27;s grandmother said he had a gift from God and should be called &quot;Dio&quot; (&quot;God&quot; in Italian), although this was disputed by Padavona&#x27;s widow, Wendy, in a February 2017 interview. Another is that Dio was a reference to mafia member Johnny Dio; this explanation was confirmed in his autobiography. Padavona first used the name on a recording in 1960, when he added it to the band&#x27;s second release on Seneca. Soon after that, the band modified its name to Ronnie Dio and the Prophets. The Prophets lineup lasted for several years, touring throughout New York and playing college fraternity parties. They produced one single for Atlantic Records and one album. Some of the singles (such as &quot;Mr. Misery,&quot; released on Swan) were labeled as being by Ronnie Dio as a solo artist, even if the rest of the Prophets contributed to the recording. The group released several singles during the following years until early 1967. Dio continued to use his birth name on any songwriting credits on those releases.

In late 1967, Ronnie Dio and the Prophets transformed into a new band called the Electric Elves and added a keyboard player. In February 1968, the band was involved in a fatal car accident that killed guitarist Nick Pantas and briefly put Dio and the other band members in hospital. Following the accident, the group shortened its name to the Elves and used that name until mid-1972, when it released its first proper album under the name Elf. Over the next few years, the group went on to become a regular opening act for Deep Purple. Elf recorded three albums until the members&#x27; involvement in recording the first Rainbow album in early 1975, resulting in Elf disbanding.

===Rainbow===

In the mid-1970s, Dio&#x27;s vocals caught the ear of Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, who was planning on leaving Deep Purple due to creative differences over the band&#x27;s new direction. Blackmore invited Dio, along with Gary Driscoll, to record two songs in Tampa, Florida, on December 12, 1974. Blackmore stated in 1983, &quot;I left Deep Purple because I&#x27;d met up with Ronnie Dio, and he was so easy to work with. He was originally just going to do one track of a solo LP, but we ended up doing the whole LP in three weeks, which I was very excited about.&quot; Being satisfied with the results, Blackmore decided to recruit more of Elf&#x27;s musicians and form his own band, initially known as Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow. They released the self-titled debut album &quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in early 1975. After that, Dio recorded two more studio albums &quot;Rising&quot; (1976) and &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1978), the live album &quot;On Stage&quot; and two archival live albums – (&quot;Live in Munich 1977&quot; and &quot;Live in Germany 1976&quot;) – with Blackmore. During his tenure with Rainbow, Dio and Blackmore were the only constant members. Dio is credited on those albums for all lyrical authorship as well as collaboration with Blackmore on musical arrangement. Dio and Blackmore split, with Blackmore taking the band in a more commercial direction, with Graham Bonnet on vocals and the album &quot;Down to Earth&quot;.

===Black Sabbath===
Following his departure from Rainbow in 1979, Dio joined Black Sabbath, replacing the fired Ozzy Osbourne. Dio met Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi by chance at the Rainbow on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in 1979. The two musicians were in similar situations, as Dio was seeking a new project and Iommi needed a vocalist. Dio said of the encounter, &quot;It must have been fate, because we connected so instantly.&quot; The pair kept in touch until Dio arrived at Iommi&#x27;s Los Angeles house for a relaxed, getting-to-know-you jam session. On that first day, the duo wrote the song &quot;Children of the Sea,&quot; which appeared on the &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; album, the first the band recorded with Dio as its vocalist, being released in 1980.

The follow-up album, &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (1981), featured new drummer Vinny Appice. Personality conflicts began emerging within the band. &quot;Ronnie came into the band and he was doing whatever we told him, basically because he wanted the gig. The next album was a little different,&quot; Iommi recalled. In 1982, conflict arose over the mixing of the &quot;Live Evil&quot; album. Iommi asserted that the album&#x27;s engineer began complaining to him that he would work all day long on a mix, only to have Dio return to the studio at night to &quot;do his own mix&quot; in which his vocals were more prominent. This was denied by Dio. The conflict led to Dio and Appice ultimately quitting the band later that year.

In 1991, Dio returned to Black Sabbath to record the &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; album. The album was a minor hit, reaching the Top 40 in the United Kingdom and No. 44 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The single &quot;Time Machine&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, the tenth highest-grossing film of 1992. Close to the end of 1992, Dio and Appice again left the band, citing an inability to work with Iommi and Butler.

===Dio===

Wanting to continue together as a band, Dio and Appice formed the eponymous heavy metal band Dio in 1982. Vivian Campbell played guitar and Jimmy Bain played bass, the latter of whom Dio had known since his time with Rainbow. Their 1983 debut album, &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, included the hit singles &quot;Rainbow in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, which have remained the band&#x27;s signature songs.

The band added keyboardist Claude Schnell and recorded two more full-length studio albums with this lineup, &quot;The Last in Line&quot; (1984) and &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; (1985). A 1984 live recording, &quot;A Special from the Spectrum&quot;, was filmed during the band&#x27;s second world tour and released in VHS format only. The band changed members over the years, eventually leaving Dio as the only original member in 1990. Except for a few breaks, the band was constantly touring or recording. They released 10 albums, with &quot;Master of the Moon&quot; being the last one, recorded in 2004.

===Heaven &amp; Hell===
In October 2006, Dio joined Black Sabbath members Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and former Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice to tour under the moniker Heaven &amp; Hell, the title of the first Dio-era Black Sabbath album. They chose the name Heaven &amp; Hell as Iommi and Butler were still in Black Sabbath with Osbourne and felt it was best to use a different moniker for the Dio version of the band. Original Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward was to be involved in this project, but later withdrew.

In 2007, the band recorded three new songs under the Black Sabbath name for the compilation album &quot;Black Sabbath: The Dio Years&quot;.

In 2008, the band completed a 98-date world tour. The band released one album under the Heaven &amp; Hell name, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, to critical and commercial acclaim. They also had planned to release a follow-up in 2010.

===Other projects===
In 1974, Dio sang on the Roger Glover conducted and produced concept album &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;. Along with other guest-singers, the album featured Deep Purple alumni Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale. Dio provided vocals for the songs &quot;Homeward&quot;, &quot;Sitting in a Dream&quot; and the UK single &quot;Love Is All&quot;.

In 1980, Dio made vocal contributions to Kerry Livgren&#x27;s Christian themed progressive rock album Seeds of Change, where he sang on the tracks &quot;Live For the King&quot; and &quot;The Mask of the Great Deceiver.&quot;

In 1985, Dio contributed to the metal world&#x27;s answer to Band Aid and USA for Africa with the Hear &#x27;n Aid project. With a heavy metal all-star ensemble—the brainchild of his fellow Dio bandmates Campbell and Bain—he sang some of the vocals on the single &quot;Stars&quot; and an album full of songs from other artists given to charity. The project raised $1 million within a year.

In 1997, Dio made a cameo on Pat Boone&#x27;s &quot;In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;, an album of famous heavy metal songs played in big band style. Dio can be heard singing backup on Boone&#x27;s take of &quot;Holy Diver&quot;.

In 1999, he was parodied in the TV show &quot;South Park&quot;, in the episode &quot;Hooked on Monkey Fonics&quot;, which he later described as &quot;wonderful.&quot;

Tenacious D included a tribute song entitled &quot;Dio&quot; that appeared on their self-titled album. The song explains how he has to &quot;pass the torch&quot; for a new generation. Reportedly, Dio approved of it and had Tenacious D appear in his video &quot;Push&quot; from &quot;Killing the Dragon&quot; in 2002. He also appeared in the film &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, playing himself and providing guest vocals in the movie&#x27;s opening musical number &quot;Kickapoo.&quot;

In 2005, Dio was revealed to be the voice behind Dr. X in &quot;&quot;, the sequel to Queensrÿche&#x27;s seminal concept album &quot;&quot;. His part was shown in a prerecorded video on the subsequent tour and Dio appeared onstage to sing the part live on at least one occasion (both shown on the &quot;Mindcrime at the Moore&quot; DVD).

Though he was unable to finish writing it, Dio&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;Rainbow in the Dark: The Autobiography&quot;, was completed by Wendy Dio and Mick Wall and published posthumously on July 27, 2021.

A documentary about Dio&#x27;s life titled &quot;DIO: Dreamers Never Die&quot; premiered at SXSW on March 21, 2022. The film received a limited theatrical release on September 28, and premiered on television on Showtime December 1, 2022.

==Personal life==

Dio married his first wife Loretta Berardi (born 1941) in 1963. They adopted a son but divorced in 1972.

In 1978, Dio married Wendy Walters (born 1945), ex-wife of drummer Aynsley Dunbar and guitarist Ricardo Gaxiola. She also served as Dio&#x27;s manager. In the 1980s, she managed the Los Angeles rock bands Rough Cutt, NuHaven, Cold Sweat and Hellion. The couple separated but did not divorce. (In 2012, after Dio&#x27;s death, she married her longtime partner Omar Gimenez.)

In September 2003, Dio accidentally severed his thumb during a gardening accident when a heavy garden gnome fell onto it. Dio was concerned he would no longer be able to do his signature &quot;devil&#x27;s horns&quot; hand gesture, but a doctor managed to re-attach it.

=== Illness and death ===
On November 25, 2009, Dio announced that he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and underwent treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

On May 4, 2010, Heaven &amp; Hell announced they were canceling all summer dates as a result of Dio&#x27;s health condition. His last live performance was with Heaven &amp; Hell on August 29, 2009, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Dio died of the illness on May 16, 2010.

Two weeks after his death, a public memorial service was held at The Hall of Liberty, Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. The hall was filled to capacity, with many more fans sitting outside the hall watching the memorial on multiple giant screens on both the east and south sides of the hall. Friends, family, and former and current bandmates of Dio, including Rudy Sarzo, Geoff Tate, John Payne, Glenn Hughes, Joey Belladonna and Heaven &amp; Hell keyboard player, Scott Warren, gave speeches and performed. On the screen was an accompanying documentary covering Dio&#x27;s career from his early days with Elf to his final project with Heaven &amp; Hell.

==Legacy and popular culture==
Dio&#x27;s career spanned more than 50 years. During this period and particularly in the 21st century, he received a number of distinctions and awards. He was inducted into the Cortland City Hall of Fame in 2004 and has a street named after him there called Dio Way. &quot;Classic Rock Magazine&quot; awarded Dio the &quot;Metal Guru Award&quot; at their yearly &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; awards ceremony in 2006. On January 17, 2007, Dio was inducted into Guitar Center&#x27;s Rock Walk of Fame in Hollywood. Dio was named &quot;Best Metal Singer&quot; at the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods Awards in April 2010 for his work on &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, making him the oldest recipient of this award at age 67. He accepted the award in person at what was to be his final public appearance, just one month before his death.

The main stage of Bloodstock Open Air is also named after him in tribute after Heaven &amp; Hell pulled out upon his death. Also, the main stage on Masters of Rock festival carries his name since summer 2010. A Dio monument has been unveiled in Kavarna, Bulgaria. In Mexico the biggest metal fest was named &quot;Hell and Heaven&quot; in honor of Dio; the organization says that the festival was named that way since they had worked with Dio, referring to him as &quot;the greatest singer and person we ever had worked with, a really humble person.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine eulogized Dio with these words: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just his mighty pipes that made him Ronnie James Dio — it was his moral fervor...what always stood out was Dio&#x27;s raging compassion for the lost rock &amp; roll children in his audience. Dio never pretended to be one of the kids — he sang as an adult assuring us that we weren&#x27;t alone in our suffering, and some day we might even be proud of conquering it.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Dio at number 165 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

On July 10, 2011, in parallel to Dio&#x27;s birthday, his hometown of Cortland, New York held a day-long event featuring many central New York local bands and talent for a benefit to the Stand Up and Shout Cancer foundation for cancer research and Dio Memorial concert. Part of the proceeds from the event went to fund a memorial music scholarship for the local city high-school in his name.

On March 31, 2014, the tribute album &quot;Ronnie James Dio This Is Your Life&quot; was released. It was organized and produced by Wendy Gaxiola, with album proceeds benefitting the Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund.

On August 6, 2016, a hologram of the singer, created by Eyellusion, made its live debut at the Wacken Open Air Festival. A second hologram was created for a subsequent world tour, which began on December 6, 2017, in Bochum, Germany.

On January 18, 2017, Dio was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History.

&quot;I guess if I&#x27;ve left any kind of legacy&quot;, Dio remarked in 1987, &quot;it&#x27;s been &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and a lot of &quot;Rainbow Rising&quot;.&quot;

&quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;″s main villain, Dio Brando, gets his name from a combination of Dio and Marlon Brando&#x27;s surnames.

In the fourth season of television series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, character Eddie Munson wears a denim vest that includes a large back panel of the artwork on the cover of Dio&#x27;s &quot;The Last in Line&quot;.

<text>Matteo Bandello ( 1480–1562) was an Italian writer, soldier, Dominican friar and bishop, best known for his novellas. His collection of 214 novellas made him the most popular short-story writer of his day.

==Biography==
Matteo Bandello was born at Castelnuovo Scrivia, near Tortona (current Piedmont), 1480. He received a good education, and entered the church, but does not seem to have been very interested in theology. For many years he lived at Mantua and Castel Goffredo, and superintended the education of the celebrated Lucrezia Gonzaga, in whose honour he composed a long poem. The decisive Battle of Pavia, as a result of which Lombardy was taken by the emperor, compelled Bandello to flee; his house at Milan was burnt and his property confiscated. He took refuge with Cesare Fregoso, an Italian general in the French service, whom he accompanied into France.

He was later raised to the bishopric of Agen, a town in which he resided for many years before his death in 1562. Bandello wrote a number of poems, but his fame rests entirely on his extensive collection of Novelle, or tales (1554, 1573), which have been extremely popular. They belong to the same genre as Boccaccio’s &quot;Decameron&quot; and Marguerite de Navarre’s &quot;Heptaméron&quot;. The common origin of them all is to be found in the old French &quot;fabliaux&quot;, though some well-known tales are evidently Eastern, and others classical. Bandello’s novellas are thought the best of those written in imitation of the Decameron, though Italian critics find fault with them for negligence and inelegance of style.

The stories on which William Shakespeare based several of his plays (&quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in particular) were supplied by Bandello, probably through Belleforest and Pierre Boaistuau whose stories were later translated into English by William Paynter and included in his &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot;. Another of his stories includes &quot;The countess of Cellant&quot;, a distortion of Challand, a northwest region of Italy.

==English translations of novellas==
The only nearly complete translation of Bandello&#x27;s tales into English is &quot;The novels of Matteo Bandello&quot;, translated by John Payne in 6 volumes, 1890. This edition is separated into 4 parts, containing 51, 43, 51, and 21 stories, respectively, for a total of 166, minus two (part 2, story 35 and part 4, story 6), omitted because of their being almost identical to those of Marguerite de Navarre&#x27;s &quot;Heptaméron&quot; (stories 30 and 17, respectively), though keeping Bandello&#x27;s dedicatory preface.

There is a second book of Bandello in an English translation (1892) by Percy Edward Pinkerton and containing twelve tales. This translation uses more modern modes of expression than Payne&#x27;s translation.

In 2023 Michael Curtotti published a translation of Bandello’s Romeo and Juliet story into modern English: &quot;Romeo and Juliet: A New English Translation&quot;. There is critical apparatus on the similarities between Bandello’s and Shakespeare’s versions; and Bandello’s text is divided into paragraphs for ease of comparison with the translation on facing pages.

==Source material==
The vast majority of the stories derive from those Bandello heard from contemporaries, reported as real life events. Far more rarely, some stories are based on literary or historical sources, such as book 5 of Dante&#x27;s Purgatory (part 1, story 11), the Lucretia and Tarquin episode in Livy&#x27;s History of Rome (part 2, story 15), story #23 of the &quot;Heptaméron&quot; (part 2, story 17), and Francesco Petrarch&#x27;s Triumph of Love from &quot;Triumphs&quot; (part 2, story 41). Some derive from English history, such as the chronicle of Mary Douglas, niece to King Henry VIII of England (part 3, story 44) and Henry VIII&#x27;s six wives (part 3, story 45), some from Spanish history, such as Alfonso X (part 4, story 10). All of them were told to him by men, but a minority of dedicatory prefaces are offered to women. Bandello writes that the dedicatory prefaces to the nobility or to worthy persons are useful to him as a shield in case someone becomes offended by one of the stories and is tempted to attack him (part 2, story 32). He shows psychological insight into jealousy, in particular the description of two types of jealous men, the first from feelings of inadequacy and the second from feelings of the fickleness of women (part 3, story 47).

The most striking stories include two whores seeking to win their husbands back (part 1, story 17), two brother thieves in cahoots to rob the treasures of the king of Egypt (part 1, story 23), a disdained lover voluntarily choosing to live inside a cave (part 1, story 25), a woman killing herself only out of fear that her good fortune will turn bad (part 1, story 48), Filippo Lippi, released from slavery in Africa because of his talent as a celebrated painter (part 1, story 50), a woman disdaining a man and then killing herself when he no longer pursues her (part 2, story 16), an abbot making music from a chorus of pigs (part 2, story 23), an adulterous lover buried alive and then saved (part 3, story 1), a merchant&#x27;s murder of another (part 4, story 1), a case of double adultery whereby each husband cuckolds the other (part 4, story 11), and two women yelling at each other after being falsely told they are hard of hearing (part 4, story 21).

==Plays by Shakespeare==
Four Bandello stories were adapted by Shakespeare, including &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (part 1, story 19), the Claudio subplot of &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; (part 1, story 22), &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (part 2, story 6), and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (part 2, story 28), plus one from the Shakespeare Apocrypha, &quot;Edward III&quot; (part 2, story 29).

==Plays by others==
Bandello stories have also been adapted by other dramatists, including John Webster, &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (part 1, story 24), Philip Massinger, &quot;The Picture&quot; (part 1, story 19), the same source as that of Cymbeline, John Marston and Jean Mairet, &quot;Sophonisba&quot; (part 1, story 35), John Fletcher, &quot;The Maid in the Inn&quot; (part 2, story 11), the anonymous 17th century French author of &quot;The Cruel Moor&quot; (1618) (part 3, story 17), Giuseppe Giacosa, &quot;La Signora di Challant&quot;, &quot;The Lady of Challand&quot; (part 1, story 4) and more than 15 plays by Spanish Lope de Vega, among which &quot;Castelvines y Monteses&quot; (published in 1647 and written between 1604 and 1618) follows the same famous story of Romeo and Juliet (part 2, story 9).

<doc id="149439" wikidata="Q183226" url="?curid=149439" title="Charles IV of Spain">
<text>Charles IV (; 11 November 1748 – 20 January 1819) was King of Spain and ruler of the Spanish Empire from 1788 to 1808.

The Spain inherited by Charles IV gave few indications of instability, but during his reign, Spain entered a series of disadvantageous alliances and his regime constantly sought cash to deal with the exigencies of war. He detested his son and heir Ferdinand, who led the unsuccessful El Escorial Conspiracy and later forced Charles&#x27;s abdication after the Tumult of Aranjuez in March 1808, along with ousting Charles&#x27;s widely hated first minister Manuel Godoy. Summoned to Bayonne by Napoleon Bonaparte, who forced Ferdinand VII to abdicate, Charles IV also abdicated, paving the way for Napoleon to place his older brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne of Spain. The reign of Charles IV turned out to be a major negative turning point in Spanish history.

==Early life==
Charles was the second son of Charles III and his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. He was born in Naples (11 November 1748), while his father was King of Naples and Sicily. His elder brother Don Felipe was passed over for both thrones, due to his learning disabilities and epilepsy. In Naples and Sicily, Charles was referred to as the &quot;Prince of Taranto&quot;. He was called (meaning &quot;the Hunter&quot;), due to his preference for sport and hunting, rather than dealing with affairs of the state. Charles is considered by historian Stanley G. Payne as &quot;good-hearted but weak and simple-minded&quot;.

==Reign==
In 1788, Charles III died and Charles IV succeeded to the throne and ruled for the next two decades. Even though he had a profound belief in the sanctity of the monarchy and kept up the appearance of an absolute, powerful king, Charles never took more than a passive part in his own government. The affairs of government were left to his wife, Maria Luisa, and the man he appointed first minister, Manuel de Godoy. Charles occupied himself with hunting in the period that saw the outbreak of the French Revolution, the executions of his Bourbon relative Louis XVI of France and his queen, Marie Antoinette, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. Ideas of the Age of Enlightenment had come to Spain with the accession of the first Spanish Bourbon, Philip V. Charles&#x27; father, Charles III, had pursued an active policy of reform that sought to reinvigorate Spain politically and economically and make the Spanish Empire more closely an appendage of the metropole. Charles III was an active, working monarch with experienced first ministers to help reach decisions. Charles IV, by contrast, was a do-nothing king, with a domineering wife and an inexperienced but ambitious first minister, Godoy. The combination of a king not up to the task of governance, the queen widely perceived to take lovers (including Godoy) and the first minister with an agenda of his own earned the monarchy increased alienation from its subjects.

Upon ascending to the throne, Charles IV intended to maintain the policies of his father and, accordingly, retained his prime minister, the Count of Floridablanca. Floridablanca avoided war with Great Britain in the Nootka Sound crisis, where a minor trade and navigation dispute off the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1789 could have blown up into a major conflict. Spain could have drawn on its French ally in support against Britain but they refused. In a humiliating move Floridablanca had no choice but to capitulate to British terms and thereby negotiated with them. In 1792, political and personal enemies ousted Floridablanca from office, replacing him with the Count of Aranda. However, in the wake of the war against Republican France, the liberal-leaning Count of Aranda was himself replaced by Manuel de Godoy, a favorite of the Queen and widely believed to be her lover, who enjoyed the lasting favor of the King.

Under Charles IV, scientific expeditions continued to be sent by the crown, some of which were initially authorized by Charles III. The Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada (1783–1816), and the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain (1787–1803), were funded by the crown. The Malaspina Expedition (1789–94) was an important scientific expedition headed by Spanish naval commander Alejandro Malaspina, with naturalists and botanical illustrators gathering information for the Spanish crown. 
In 1803, he authorized the Balmis Expedition, aimed at vaccinating Spain&#x27;s overseas territories against smallpox. In 1799, Charles IV authorized Prussian aristocrat and scientist Alexander von Humboldt to travel freely in Spanish America, with royal officials encouraged to aid him in his investigation of key areas of Spain&#x27;s empire. Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot; was a key publication from his five-year travels.

Spain&#x27;s economic problems were of long standing, but deteriorated further when Spain was ensnared in wars that its ally France pursued. Financial needs drove his domestic and foreign policy. Godoy&#x27;s economic policies increased discontent with Charles&#x27;s regime. In an attempt to implement major economic changes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, a reformist, Jansenist conservative proposed major structural reform of land tenure to promote the revival of agriculture. His 1795 work, &quot;Informe en el expediente de ley agraria&quot; argued that Spain needed thriving agriculture to allow its population to grow and prosper. In his analysis, the concentration of land ownership and traditions and institutional barriers were at the heart of agriculture&#x27;s problems. He called for division and sale of public lands, which were held by villages, as well as the swaths of Spanish territory controlled by the Mesta, the organization of livestock owners who had kept grazing lands as an asset for their use. Jovellanos also argued for the abolition of entailed properties (&quot;mayorazgos&quot;), which allowed landed estates to pass undivided through generations of aristocrats, as well as sale of lands held by the Catholic Church. The aim of these policies was to create in Spain yeoman farmers, who would pursue their self-interest and make agricultural land more productive. The cost would be to undermine the power of the Church and the aristocracy.

As the situation with immediate revenue became more fraught, the crown in 1804 imposed measures in its overseas empire forcing the church to call in immediately the mortgages it had extended on a long-term by the Catholic Church. Although aimed at undermining the wealth and power of the church, the wealthy landowning elites were faced with financial ruin, since they had no way to make full payment on their mortgaged properties. This ill-considered royal decree has been seen as a major factor in the independence movement in New Spain (Mexico). The decree was in abeyance once Charles and Ferdinand abdicated, but it undermined elite support while in force.

In foreign policy Godoy continued Abarca de Bolea&#x27;s policy of neutrality toward as France, but after Spain protested the execution of Louis XVI of France in 1793, France declared war on Spain. After the declaration, Portugal and Spain signed a treaty of mutual protection against France. In 1796 France forced Godoy to enter into an alliance, and declare war on the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a consequence, Spain became one of the maritime empires to have been allied with Republican France in the French Revolutionary War, and for a considerable duration.

Spain remained an ally of France for a while, lost against the British in the battle of Trafalgar, and supported the Continental Blockade. After Napoleon&#x27;s victory over Prussia in 1807, Godoy kept Spain with the French side.

But the switching of alliances devalued Charles&#x27;s position as a trustworthy ally, increasing Godoy&#x27;s unpopularity, and strengthening the &quot;fernandistas&quot; (supporters of Crown Prince Ferdinand), who favoured an alliance with the United Kingdom.

Economic troubles, rumors about a sexual relationship between the Queen and Godoy, and the King&#x27;s ineptitude, caused the monarchy to decline in prestige among the population. Anxious to take over from his father, and jealous of the prime minister, Crown Prince Ferdinand attempted to overthrow the King in an aborted coup in 1807. He was successful in 1808, forcing his father&#x27;s abdication following the Tumult of Aranjuez.

=== Abdications of Bayonne ===
Riots, and a popular revolt at the winter palace Aranjuez, in 1808 forced the king to abdicate on 19 March, in favor of his son. Ferdinand took the throne as Ferdinand VII, but was mistrusted by Napoleon, who had 100,000 soldiers stationed in Spain by that time due to the ongoing War of the Third Coalition.

The ousted King, having appealed to Napoleon for help in regaining his throne, was summoned before Napoleon in Bayonne, along with his son, in April 1808. Napoleon forced both Charles and his son to abdicate, declared the Bourbon dynasty of Spain deposed, and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King Joseph I of Spain, which began the Peninsular War.

==Later life and death==

Following Napoleon&#x27;s deposing of the Bourbon dynasty, the ex-King, his wife, and former Prime Minister Godoy were held captive in France first at the château de Compiègne and three years in Marseille (where a neighborhood was named after him). After the collapse of the regime installed by Napoleon, Ferdinand VII was restored to the throne. The former Charles IV drifted about Europe until 1812, when he finally settled in Rome, in the Palazzo Barberini. His wife died on 2 January 1819, followed shortly by Charles, who died on 20 January of the same year. Sir Francis Ronalds included a detailed description of the funeral in his travel journal.

==Character==
Well-meaning and pious, Charles IV floundered in a series of international crises beyond his capacity to handle. He was said to be &#x27;despotic, sluggish and stupid&#x27;. He was also noted as a former wrestler who spent many a time hunting. He was painted by Francisco Goya in a number of official court portraits, which numerous art critics have seen as satires on the King&#x27;s stout vacuity.

==Marriage and children==

Charles IV married his first cousin Maria Louisa, the daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma, in 1765. The couple had fourteen children, seven of whom survived into adulthood:

<text>Charles III (; 20 January 1716 – 14 December 1788) was King of Spain in the years 1759 to 1788. He was also Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Charles I (1731–1735); King of Naples, as Charles VII; and King of Sicily, as Charles III (1735–1759). He was the fourth son of Philip V of Spain and the eldest son of Philip&#x27;s second wife, Elisabeth Farnese. He was a proponent of enlightened absolutism and regalism.

In 1731, the 15-year-old Charles became Duke of Parma and Piacenza following the death of his childless grand-uncle Antonio Farnese. In 1734, at the age of 18, he led Spanish troops in a bold and almost entirely bloodless march down Italy to seize the Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sicily and enforce the Spanish claim to their thrones. In 1738, he married the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, daughter of Augustus III of Poland, who was an educated, cultured woman. The couple had 13 children, eight of whom reached adulthood. They resided in Naples for 19 years. Charles gained valuable experience in his 25-year rule in Italy, so that he was well prepared as the monarch of the Spanish Empire. His policies in Italy prefigured ones he would put in place in his 30-year rule of Spain.

Charles succeeded to the Spanish throne in 1759 upon the death of his childless half-brother Ferdinand VI. As king of Spain, Charles III made far-reaching reforms to increase the flow of funds to the crown and defend against foreign incursions on the empire. He facilitated trade and commerce, modernized agriculture and land tenure, and promoted science and university research. He implemented regalist policies to increase the power of the state regarding the church. During his reign, he expelled the Jesuits from the Spanish Empire and fostered the Enlightenment in Spain. Charles launched enquiries into the Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s Muslim past, even after succeeding to the Spanish throne. He strengthened the Spanish Army and the Spanish Navy. Although he did not achieve complete control over Spain&#x27;s finances, and was sometimes obliged to borrow to meet expenses, most of his reforms proved successful in providing increased revenue to the crown and expanding state power, leaving a lasting legacy.

In the Spanish Empire his regime enacted a series of sweeping reforms with the aim of bringing the overseas territories under firmer control by the central government, reversing the trend toward local autonomy, and gaining more control over the Church. Reforms including the establishment of two new viceroyalties, realignment of administration into intendancies, creating a standing military, establishing new monopolies, revitalizing silver mining, excluding American-born Spaniards (&quot;criollos&quot;) from high civil and ecclesiastical offices, and eliminating many privileges (&quot;fueros&quot;) of clergy.

Historian Stanley Payne writes that Charles &quot;was probably the most successful European ruler of his generation. He had provided firm, consistent, intelligent leadership. He had chosen capable ministers... [his] personal life had won the respect of the people.&quot; John Lynch&#x27;s assessment is that in Bourbon Spain &quot;Spaniards had to wait half a century before their government was rescued by Charles III.&quot;

==Spanish imperial legacy==
In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht concluded the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) and reduced the political and military power of Spain, which the House of Bourbon had ruled since 1700. Under the terms of the treaty, the Spanish Empire retained its American territories and the Philippines, but ceded the Spanish Netherlands, the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia, the Duchy of Milan, and the State of Presidi to Habsburg Austria. The House of Savoy gained the Kingdom of Sicily, and the Kingdom of Great Britain gained the island of Menorca and the fortress at Gibraltar.

In 1700, Charles&#x27;s father, originally a French Bourbon prince, Philip of Anjou, became King of Spain as Philip V. For the remainder of his reign (1700–46), he continually attempted to regain the ceded territories in Europe. In 1714, after the death of the king&#x27;s first wife, the Princess Maria Luisa Gabriella of Savoy, the Piacenza Cardinal Giulio Alberoni successfully arranged the swift marriage between Philip and the ambitious Elisabeth Farnese, niece and stepdaughter of Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma. Elisabeth and Philip married on 24 December 1714; she quickly proved a domineering consort and influenced King Philip to make Cardinal Giulio Alberoni the prime minister of Spain in 1715.

On 20 January 1716, Elisabeth gave birth to the Infante Charles of Spain at the &quot;Royal Alcázar of Madrid&quot;. He was fourth in line to the Spanish throne, after three elder half-brothers: the Infante Luis, Prince of Asturias (who ruled briefly as Louis I of Spain before dying in 1724); the Infante Felipe (who died in 1719); and Ferdinand (the future Ferdinand VI). Because the Duke Francesco of Parma and his heir were childless, Elisabeth sought the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza for Charles, since he was unlikely to be king of Spain. She also sought for him the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, because Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1671–1737) was also childless. He was a distant cousin of hers, related via her great-grandmother Margherita de&#x27; Medici, giving Charles a claim to the title through that lineage.

== Early years ==
The birth of Charles encouraged Prime Minister Alberoni to start laying out grand plans for Europe. In 1717 he ordered the Spanish invasion of Sardinia. In 1718, Alberoni also ordered the invasion of Sicily, which was also ruled by the House of Savoy. In the same year Charles&#x27;s first sister, Infanta Mariana Victoria was born on 31 March. In reaction to the Quadruple Alliance of 1718, the Duke of Savoy then joined the Alliance and went to war with Spain. This war led to the dismissal of Alberoni by Philip in 1719. The Treaty of The Hague of 1720 included the recognition of Charles as heir to the Italian Duchies of Parma and Piacenza.

Charles&#x27;s half-brother, Infante Philip Peter, died on 29 December 1719, putting Charles third in line to the throne after Luis and Ferdinand. He would retain his position behind these two until they died and he succeeded to the Spanish throne. His second full brother, Infante Philip of Spain, was born on 15 March 1720.

Beginning in 1721, King Philip had been negotiating with the Duke of Orléans, the French regent, to arrange three Franco-Spanish marriages that could potentially ease tense relations. The young Louis XV of France would marry the three-year-old Infanta Mariana Victoria and thus she would become Queen of France; Charles&#x27;s half-brother Louis would marry the fourth surviving daughter of the regent, Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans. Charles himself would be engaged to Philippine Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, who was the fifth surviving daughter of the Duke of Orléans.

In 1726 Charles met Philippine Élisabeth for the first time; Elisabeth Farnese later wrote to the regent and his wife regarding their meeting:

And to the duchesse d&#x27;Orléans she writes:

Out of these proposed marriages, only Louis and Louise Élisabeth would wed. Elisabeth Farnese looked for other potential brides for her eldest son. For this, she looked to Austria, Spain&#x27;s principal opponent for influence on the Italian Peninsula. She proposed to Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, that the Infante Charles marry the eight-year-old Archduchess Maria Theresa and that her second surviving son, the Infante Philip, marry the seven-year-old Archduchess Maria Anna.

The alliance of Spain and Austria was signed on 30 April 1725 and included Spanish support for the Pragmatic Sanction, a document drafted by Emperor Charles in 1713 to assure support for Maria Theresa in the succession to the throne of the Habsburgs. The emperor also relinquished all claims to the Spanish throne and promised to support Spain in its attempts to regain Gibraltar. The ensuing Anglo-Spanish War stopped the ambitions of Elisabeth Farnese, and the marriage plans were abandoned with the signing of the Treaty of Seville on 9 November 1729. Provisions of the treaty did allow the Infante Charles the right to occupy Parma, Piacenza, and Tuscany by force if necessary.

After the Treaty of Seville, Philip V disregarded its provisions and formed an alliance with France and the Kingdom of Great Britain. Antonio Farnese, the Duke of Parma, died on 26 February 1731 without naming an heir. This was because the widow of Antonio, Enrichetta d&#x27;Este was thought to have been pregnant at the time of his death. The Duchess was examined by many doctors without any confirmation of her pregnancy. As a result, the Second Treaty of Vienna on 22 July 1731 officially recognized the young Infante Charles as Duke of Parma and Piacenza.

The duchy was occupied by Count Carlo Stampa, who served as the lieutenant of Parma for the young Charles. Charles was from then on known as &quot;HRH Don Charles of Spain (or Borbón), Duke of Parma and Piacenza, Infante of Spain&quot;. Since he was still a minor, his maternal grandmother, Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg, was named regent.

==Rule in Italy==
===Arrival in Italy===

After a solemn ceremony in Seville, Charles was given the &quot;épée d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;sword of gold&quot;) by his father; the sword had been given to Philip V of Spain by his grandfather Louis XIV before his departure to Spain in 1700. Charles left Spain on 20 October 1731 and traveled overland to Antibes; he then sailed to Tuscany, arriving at Livorno on 27 December 1731. His cousin Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, was named his co-tutor and despite Charles being the second in line to inherit Tuscany, the Grand Duke still gave him a warm welcome. En route to Florence from Pisa, Charles was taken ill with smallpox. Charles made a grand entrance to the Medici capital of Florence on 9 March 1732 with a retinue of 250 people. He stayed with his host at the ducal residence, the Palazzo Pitti.

Gian Gastone staged a fête in honor of the Patron Saint of Florence, St. John the Baptist, on 24 June. At this fête Gian Gastone named Charles his heir, giving him the traditional Tuscan title of &quot;Hereditary Prince of Tuscany&quot;, and Charles paid homage to the Florentine senate, as was the tradition for heirs to the Tuscan throne.
When Emperor Charles VI heard about the ceremony, he was enraged that Gian Gastone had not informed him, since he was overlord of Tuscany and the nomination should have been his prerogative. Despite the celebrations, Elisabeth Farnese urged her son to go on to Parma, which he did in October 1732, where he was warmly greeted. On the front of the ducal palace in Parma was written &quot;Parma Resurget&quot; (Parma shall rise again). At the same time the play &quot;La Venuta di Ascanio in Italia&quot; was created by Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni. It was later performed at the Teatro Farnese in the city.

===Conquest of Naples and Sicily===

In 1733, the death of Augustus II, King of Poland, sparked a succession crisis in Poland. France supported one pretender, and Austria and Russia another. France and Savoy formed an alliance to acquire territory from Austria. Spain, which had allied with France in late 1733 (the Bourbon Compact), also entered the conflict. Charles&#x27;s mother, as regent, saw the opportunity to regain the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which Spain had lost in the Treaty of Utrecht.

On 20 January 1734, Charles, now 18, reached his majority, and was &quot;free to govern and to manage in a manner independent its states&quot;. He was also named commander of all Spanish troops in Italy, a position he shared with the Duke of Montemar. On 27 February, King Philip declared his intention to capture the Kingdom of Naples, claiming he would free it of &quot;excessive violence by the Austrian Viceroy of Naples, oppression, and tyranny&quot;. Charles, now &quot;Charles I of Parma&quot;, was to be in charge. Charles inspected the Spanish troops at Perugia, and marched toward Naples on 5 March. The army passed through the Papal States then ruled by Clement XII.

The Austrians, already fighting the French and Savoyard armies to retain Milan, had only limited resources for the defense of Naples and were divided on how best to oppose the Spanish. The Emperor wanted to keep Naples, but most of the Neapolitan nobility was against him, and some conspired against his viceroy. They hoped that Philip would give the kingdom to Charles, who would be more likely to live and rule there, rather than having a viceroy and serve a foreign power. On 9 March the Spanish took Procida and Ischia, two islands in the Bay of Naples. A week later they defeated the Austrians at sea. On 31 March, his army closed in on the Austrians in Naples. The Spanish flanked the defensive position of the Austrians under General von Traun and forced them to withdraw to Capua. This allowed Charles and his troops to advance on to the city of Naples itself.

The Austrian viceroy, Giulio Borromeo Visconti, and the commander of his army, Giovanni Carafa , left some garrisons holding the city&#x27;s fortresses and withdrew to Apulia. There they awaited reinforcements sufficient to defeat the Spanish. The Spanish entered Naples and laid siege to the Austrian-held fortresses. During that interval, Charles received the compliments of the local nobility, and the city keys and the &quot;privilege book&quot; from a delegation of the city&#x27;s elected officials. Chronicles of the time reported that Naples was captured &quot;with humanity&quot; and that the combat was only due to a general climate of courtesy between the two armies, often under the eyes of the Neapolitans that approached with curiosity

The Spanish took the Carmine Castle on 10 April; Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo fell on 27 April; the Castel dell&#x27;Ovo on 4 May, and finally the Castel Nuovo on 6 May. This all occurred even though Charles had no military experience, seldom wore uniforms, and could only with difficulty be persuaded to witness a review.

===Arrival in Naples and Sicily, recognition as king 1734-35===
Charles had his triumphant entrance to Naples on 10 May 1734, through the old city gate at Capuana surrounded by the city councilors along with a group of people who threw money to the locals. The procession went on through the streets and ended up at the Naples Cathedral, where Charles received a blessing from the local archbishop, Cardinal Pignatelli. Charles took up residence at the Royal Palace of Naples, which had been built by his ancestor, Philip III of Spain.

Two chroniclers of the era, the Florentine Bartolomeo Intrieri, and the Venetian Cesare Vignola made conflicting reports on the view of the situation by Neapolitans. Intrieri writes that the arrival was a historic event and that the crowd cried out that &quot;His Royal Highness is beautiful, that his face is as the one of San Gennaro on the statue that the representative&quot;. Vignola wrote in contrast that &quot;there were only some acclamations&quot;, and that the crowd applauded with &quot;a lot of languors&quot; and only &quot;to incite those that threw the money to throw it in more abundance&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s father, King Philip V of Spain, wrote the following letter to Charles.
The letter began with the words &quot;To the King of Naples, My Son, and My Brother&quot;. Charles was unique in the fact that he was the first ruler of Naples to actually live there, after two centuries of viceroys. However, Austrian resistance had not yet been completely eliminated. The emperor had sent reinforcements to Naples directed by the Prince of Belmonte, which arrived at Bitonto.

Spanish troops led by the Count of Montemar attacked the Austrians on 25 May 1734 at Bitonto, and achieved a decisive victory. Belmonte was captured after he fled to Bari, while other Austrian troops were able to escape to the sea. To celebrate the victory, Naples was illuminated for three nights, and on 30 May, the Duke of Montemar, Charles&#x27;s army commander, was named the Duke of Bitonto. Today there is an obelisk in the city of Bitonto commemorating the battle constructed and designed by Giovanni Antonio Medrano.

After the fall of Reggio Calabria on 20 June, Charles also conquered the towns of L&#x27;Aquila (27 June) and Pescara (28 July). The last two Austrian fortresses were Gaeta and Capua. The Siege of Gaeta, which Charles observed, ended on 6 August. Three weeks later, the Duke of Montemar left the mainland for Sicily where they arrived in Palermo on 2 September 1734, beginning a conquest of the island&#x27;s Austrian-held fortresses that ended in early 1735. Capua, the only remaining Austrian stronghold in Naples, was held by von Traun until 24 November 1734. In the kingdom, independence from the Austrians was popular.

In 1735, pursuant to the treaty ending the war, Charles formally ceded Parma to Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in exchange for his recognition as King of Naples and Sicily. Following the loss of Parma, Charles removed the Farnese Collection to Naples.

===Conflict with the Holy See===

During the early years of Charles&#x27;s reign, the Neapolitan court was engaged in a dispute with the Holy See over jurisdiction, clerical appointments, and revenues. The Kingdom of Naples was an ancient fief of the Papal States. For this reason, Pope Clement XII considered himself the only one entitled to invest the king of Naples, and so he did not recognize Charles of Bourbon as a legitimate sovereign. Through the apostolic nuncio, the Pope let Charles know he did not consider valid the nomination received by him from Charles&#x27;s father, Philip V, King of Spain. In response, a committee headed by the Tuscan lawyer Bernardo Tanucci in Naples concluded that papal investiture was not necessary because the crowning of a king could not be considered a sacrament.

The situation worsened when, in 1735, just a few days before the coronation of Charles, the Pope chose to accept the traditional offering of a Hackney horse from the Holy Roman Emperor rather than from Charles. The Hackney was a white mare and a sum of money which the King of Naples offered the Pope as feudal homage every 29 June, at the feast of Saints Peter and Paul. The reason for this choice was that Charles had not yet been recognized as ruler of the Kingdom of Naples by a peace treaty, and so the Emperor was considered still de jure King of Naples. Receiving the Hackney from the Holy Roman Empire was common while receiving it from a Bourbon was unusual. The Pope, therefore, considered the first option a less dramatic gesture, and in doing so provoked the wrath of the religious Spanish infante.

Meanwhile, Charles had landed in Sicily. Although the Bourbon conquest of the island was not complete, he was crowned King of the Two Sicilies (&quot;utriusque Siciliae rex&quot;) on 3 July in the ancient Palermo Cathedral, after having traveled overland to Palmi, and by sea from Palmi to Palermo. The coronation bypassed the authority of the Pope thanks to the apostolic legation of Sicily, a medieval privilege which ensured the island a special legal autonomy from the Church. Thus, the papal legate did not attend the ceremony as Charles would have wanted.

In March 1735 a new discord developed between Rome and Naples. In Rome, it was discovered that the Bourbons had confined Roman citizens in the basement of Palazzo Farnese, which was the personal property of King Charles; people were brought there to impress them into the newborn Neapolitan army. Thousands of inhabitants in the suburb of Trastevere stormed the palace to liberate them. The riot then degenerated into pillage. Next, the crowd directed itself toward the embassy of Spain in Piazza di Spagna. During the clashes that followed, several Bourbon soldiers were killed, including an officer. The disturbances spread to the town of Velletri, where the population attacked Spanish troops on the road to Naples.

The episode was perceived as a serious affront to the Bourbon court. Consequently, the Spanish and Neapolitan ambassadors left Rome, the seat of the papacy, while apostolic nuncios were dismissed from Madrid and Naples. The regiments of Bourbon troops invaded the Papal States. The threat was such that some of the gates of Rome were barred and the civil guard was doubled. Velletri was occupied and forced to pay 8000 crowns for the occupation. Ostia was sacked, while Palestrina avoided the same fate by the payment of a ransom of 16,000 crowns.

The commission of cardinals to whom the case was assigned decided to send a delegation of prisoners of Trastevere and Velletri to Naples as reparations. The papal subjects were punished with just a few days in jail and then, after seeking royal pardon, were granted it. The Neapolitan king subsequently managed to iron out his differences with the Pope, after long negotiations, through the mediation of its ambassador in Rome, Cardinal Acquaviva, the archbishop Giuseppe Spinelli and the chaplain Celestino Galiani. The agreement was achieved on 12 May 1738.

After the death of Pope Clement in 1740, he was replaced by Pope Benedict XIV, who the following year allowed the creation of a concordat with the Kingdom of Naples. This allowed the taxation of certain property of the clergy, the reduction of the number of the ecclesiastical, and the limitation of their immunity and autonomy of justice via the creation of a mixed tribunal.

===Choice of name===
Charles was the seventh king of that name to rule Naples, but he never styled himself Charles VII. He was known simply as Charles of Bourbon (Italian: &quot;Carlo di Borbone&quot;). This was intended to emphasize that he was the first King of Naples to live there, and to mark the discontinuity between him and previous rulers named Charles, specifically his predecessor, the Habsburg Charles VI.

In Sicily, he was known as &quot;Charles III of Sicily and of Jerusalem&quot;, using the ordinal &quot;III&quot; rather than &quot;V&quot;. The Sicilian people had not recognized Charles I of Naples (&quot;Charles d&#x27;Anjou&quot;) as their sovereign (they rebelled against him), nor Emperor Charles, whom they also disliked.


===Peace with Austria===

A preliminary peace with Austria was concluded on 3 October 1735. However, the peace was not finalized until three years later with the Treaty of Vienna (1738), ending the War of the Polish Succession.

Naples and Sicily were ceded by Austria to Charles, who gave up Parma and Tuscany in return. (Charles had inherited Tuscany in 1737 on the death of Gian Gastone.) Tuscany went to Emperor Charles VI&#x27;s son-in-law Francis Stephen, as compensation for ceding the Duchy of Lorraine to the deposed Polish King Stanislaus I.

The treaty included the transfer to Naples of all the inherited goods of the House of Farnese. He took with him the collection of artwork, the archives and the ducal library, the cannons of the fort, and even the marble stairway of the ducal palace.

===War of the Austrian Succession===

The peace between Charles and Austria was signed in Vienna in 1740. That year, Emperor Charles died leaving his Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary (along with many other lands) to his daughter Maria Theresa; he had hoped the many signatories to the Pragmatic Sanction would not interfere with this succession. However, this was not the case, and the War of the Austrian Succession broke out. France was allied with Spain and Prussia, all of whom were against Maria Theresa. Maria Theresa was supported by Great Britain, ruled by George II, and the Kingdom of Sardinia, which was then ruled by Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia.

Charles had wanted to stay neutral during the conflict, but his father wanted him to join in and gather troops to aid the French. Charles arranged for 10,000 Spanish soldiers that were to be sent to Italy under the command of the Duke of Castropignano, but they were obliged to retreat when a Royal Navy squadron under Commodore William Martin threatened to bombard Naples if they did not stay out of the conflict.

The decision to remain neutral was again revived and was poorly received by the French and his father in Spain. Charles&#x27;s parents encouraged him to take arms as his brother Infante Felipe had done. After publishing a proclamation on 25 March 1744 reassuring its subjects, Charles took the command of an army against the Austrian armies of the prince of Lobkowitz, who were at that point marching for the Neapolitan border.

In order to oppose the small but powerful pro-Austrian party in Naples, a new council was formed under the direction of Tanucci that resulted in the arrest of more than 800 people. In April Maria Theresa addressed the Neapolitans with a proclamation in which she promised pardons and other benefits for those who rose against the &quot;usurpers&quot;, meaning the Bourbons.

The participation of Naples and Sicily in the conflict resulted, on 11 August in the decisive Battle of Velletri, where Neapolitan troops directed by Charles and the Duke of Castropignano, and Spanish troops under the Count of Gages, defeated the Austrians of 
Lobkowitz, who retreated with heavy losses. The courage shown by Charles caused the King of Sardinia, his enemy, to write that &quot;he revealed a worthy consistency of his blood and that he behaved gloriously&quot;.

The victory at Velletri assured Charles the right to give the title &quot;Duke of Parma&quot; to his younger brother Infante Felipe. This was recognized in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle signed in 1748; it was not until the next year that Infante Felipe would officially be the Duke of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla.

===Impact of rule in Naples and Sicily===

Charles left a lasting legacy on his kingdom, introducing reforms during his reign. In Naples, Charles began internal reforms that he later continued in peninsular Spain and the ultramarine Spanish Empire. His chief minister in Naples, Bernardo Tanucci, had a considerable influence over him. Tanucci had found a solution to Charles&#x27;s acceding to the throne, but then implemented a major regalist policy toward the Church, substantially limiting the privileges of the clergy, whose vast possessions enjoyed tax exemption and their own jurisdiction. His realm was financially a backward, underdeveloped stagnant agrarian economy, with 80% of the land being owned or controlled by the church and therefore tax-exempt. Landlords often registered their properties with the church to benefit from tax exemptions. Their rural tenants were under their landlords&#x27; control rather than royal jurisdiction. Taxes were collected by tax farming through low paid employees who supplemented their income by the exploitation of their position. &quot;Smuggling and corruption were institutionalized at all levels.&quot;

Charles encouraged the development of skilled craftsmen in Naples and Sicily, after centuries of foreign domination. Charles is recognized for having recreated the &quot;Neapolitan nation&quot;, building an independent and sovereign kingdom. He also instituted reforms that were more administrative, more social and more religious than the kingdom had seen for a long time. In 1746 the Inquisition was introduced in domains bought by the Cardinal Spinelli, though this was not popular and required intervention by Charles.

Charles was the most popular king the Neapolitans had had for many years. He was very supportive of the people&#x27;s needs, regardless of class, and has been hailed as an Enlightenment king. Among the initiatives aimed at bringing the kingdom out of difficult economic conditions, Charles created the &quot;commerce council&quot; that negotiated with the Ottomans, Swedes, French, and Dutch. He also founded an insurance company and took measures to protect the forests, and tried to start the extraction and exploitation of the natural resources.
On 3 February 1740, King Charles issued a proclamation containing 37 paragraphs, in which Jews were formally invited to return to Sicily, from where they had been brutally expelled in 1492. This move had a little practical effect: though a few Jews did come to Sicily, though there was no legal impediment to their living there, they felt their lives insecure, and they soon went back to Turkey. Despite the King&#x27;s goodwill, the Jewish community of Sicily which had flourished in the Middle East was not re-established. Still, this was a significant symbolic gesture, the King clearly repudiating a past policy of religious intolerance. Moreover, the expulsion of the Jews from Sicily had been an application of the Spanish Alhambra Decree - which would be repudiated in Spain itself only much later.

The Kingdom of Naples remained neutral during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). The British Prime Minister, William Pitt wanted to create an Italian league where Naples and Sardinia would fight together against Austria, but Charles refused to participate. This choice was sharply criticized by the Neapolitan Ambassador in Turin, Domenico Caraccioli, who wrote:
&quot;The position of Italian matters is not more beautiful; but it is worsened by the fact that the King of Naples and the King of Sardinia, adding troops to larger forces of the others, could oppose itself to the plans of their neighbors; to defend itself against the dangers of the peace of the enemies themselves they were in a way united, but they are separated by their different systems of government.&quot;
With the Republic of Genoa relations were stretched: Pasquale Paoli, general of Corsican pro-independence rebels, was an officer of the Neapolitan army and the Genoese suspected that he received the assistance of the Kingdom of Naples.

He constructed a collection of palaces in and around Naples. Charles was in awe of the Palace of Versailles and the Royal Palace of Madrid in Spain (the latter being modeled on Versailles itself). He undertook and oversaw the construction of one of Europe&#x27;s most lavish palaces, the Royal Palace of Caserta (&quot;Reggia di Caserta&quot;). Construction ideas for the stunning palace started in 1751 when he was 35 years old. The site had previously been home to a small hunting lodge, as had Versailles, which he was fond of because it reminded him of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso in Spain. Caserta was also much influenced by his wife, the very cultured Maria Amalia of Saxony. The site of the palace was also far away from the large volcano of Mount Vesuvius, which was a constant threat to the capital, as was the sea. Charles himself laid the foundation stone of the palace amid many festivities on his 36th birthday, 20 January 1752. Other buildings he had built in his kingdom were the Palace of Portici (&quot;Reggia di Portici&quot;), he had Giovanni Antonio Medrano design the Teatro di San Carlo—constructed in just 270 days—and the Palace of Capodimonte (&quot;Reggia di Capodimonte&quot;); he also had the Royal Palace of Naples renovated. He and his wife had the Capodimonte porcelain Factory constructed in the city. He also founded the Accademia Ercolanese and the National Archaeological Museum, Naples, which still operates today.

During his rule the Roman cities of Herculaneum (1738), Stabiae and Pompeii (1748) were re-discovered. The king encouraged their excavation and continued to be informed about findings even after moving to Spain. Camillo Paderni who was in charge of excavated items at the king&#x27;s palace in Portici was also the first to attempt in reading obtained scrolls from the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum.

After Charles departed for Spain, Minister Tanucci presided over the Council of Regency that ruled until Charles&#x27; third son Ferdinand reached 16, the age of majority.

==King of Spain, 1759–1788==
Charles was not expected to ascend to the throne of Spain, since his father had sons from his first wife who were more likely to rule. As the first son of his father&#x27;s second wife, Charles benefited from his mother&#x27;s ambition that he have a kingdom to rule, an experience that served him well when he ascended to the throne of Spain and ruled the Spanish Empire.

===Accession to the Spanish throne===

At the end of 1758, Charles&#x27;s half brother Ferdinand VI was displaying the same symptoms of depression that their father used to suffer from. Ferdinand lost his devoted wife, Barbara of Portugal, in August 1758, and fell into deep mourning for her. He named Charles his heir presumptive on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón, where he died on 10 August 1759.

At that point, Charles was proclaimed King of Spain under the name of Charles III of Spain. Upon gaining the Spanish throne, he abdicated those of Naples and Sicily, respecting the third Treaty of Vienna that stated he would not be able to join the Neapolitan and Sicilian territories to the Spanish throne.

===Continued connection to Italy===
Charles was later given the title of &quot;Lord of the Two Sicilies&quot;. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which Charles had not ratified, foresaw the eventuality of his accession to Spain; thus Naples and Sicily went to his brother Philip, Duke of Parma, while the possessions of the latter were divided between Maria Theresa (Parma and Guastalla) and the King of Sardinia (Piacenza).

Determined to maintain the hold of his descendants on the court of Naples, Charles undertook lengthy diplomatic negotiations with Maria Theresa, and in 1758 the two signed the Fourth Treaty of Versailles, by which Austria formally renounced the Italian Duchies. Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, however, continued to pressure on the possible gain of Piacenza and even threatened to occupy it.

In order to defend the Duchy of Parma from Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s threats, Charles deployed troops on the borders of the Papal States. Thanks to the mediation of Louis XV, Charles Emmanuel renounced his claims to Piacenza in exchange for financial compensation. Charles thus assured the succession of one of his sons, the protection of his brother Philip&#x27;s duchy and, at the same time, reduced Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s ambitions. According to Domenico Caracciolo, this was &quot;a fatal blow to the hopes and designs of the king of Sardinia&quot;.

The eldest son of Charles, Infante Philip, Duke of Calabria, had learning difficulties and was thus taken out of the line of succession to any throne; he died in Portici, where he had been born, in 1747. The title of Prince of Asturias was given to Charles, the second-born. The right of succession to Naples and Sicily was reserved for his third son, Ferdinand; he would stay in Italy while his father was in Spain. Charles formally abdicated the crowns of Naples and Sicily on 6 October 1759 in favor of Ferdinand. Charles left his son&#x27;s education and care to a regency council composed of eight members, which would govern the kingdom until the young king was 16 years old. Charles and his wife arrived in Barcelona on 7 October 1759.

===Ruler of Spain===

His twenty years in the Italian Peninsula had been very fruitful, and he came to the throne of Spain with significant experience. Internal politics, as well as diplomatic relationships with other countries, underwent complete reform. Charles represented a new type of ruler, who followed &quot;Enlightened absolutism&quot;. This was a form of absolute monarchy or despotism in which rulers embraced the principles of the Enlightenment, especially its emphasis upon rationality, and applied them to their territories. They tended to allow religious toleration, freedom of speech and the press, and the right to hold private property. Most fostered the arts, sciences, and education. Charles shared these ideals with other monarchs, including Maria Theresa of Austria, her son Joseph, and Catherine the Great of Russia.

The principles of the Enlightenment were applied to his rule in Naples, and he intended to do the same in Spain though on a much larger scale. Charles went about his reform along with the help of the Marquis of Esquilache, Count of Aranda, Count of Campomanes, Count of Floridablanca, Ricardo Wall and the Genoan aristocrat Jerónimo Grimaldi.
Under Charles&#x27;s reign, Spain began to be recognized as a nation state rather than a collection of kingdoms and territories with a common sovereign. This was a long process that his Bourbon predecessors had initiated. Philip V had abolished the special privileges (&quot;fueros&quot;) of the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, subordinating them to the Crown of Castile and ruled by the Council of Castile. In the Nueva Planta decrees, Philip V also disbanded the Generalitat de Catalunya, abolished its Constitutions, banned the Catalan language from any official use and mandated the use of Castilian Spanish in legal affairs. He incorporated these formerly privileged entities into the Cortes of Castile, in effect, the Cortes of Spain. When Charles III became King of Spain, he further solidified the standing of the nation as a single political entity. He created the national anthem and a flag, a capital city worthy of the name, and the construction of a network of coherent roads converging on Madrid. On 3 September 1770 Charles III declared that the &quot;Marcha Real&quot; was to be used in official ceremonies. It was Charles who chose the colors of the present flag of Spain: two red stripes above and below a central yellow stripe double in width and the arms of Castile and León. The flag of the military navy was introduced by the king on 28 May 1785. Until then, Spanish vessels sported the white flag of the Bourbons with the arms of the sovereign. Charles replaced it due to his concern that it looked too similar to the flags of other nations.

===Military conflicts===
Bourbon Spain, like their Habsburg predecessors, were drawn into European conflicts, not necessarily to Spain&#x27;s benefit. The traditional friendship with Bourbon France brought about the idea that the power of Great Britain would decrease and that of Spain and France would do the opposite; this alliance was marked by a &quot;Family Compact&quot; signed on 15 August 1761 (called the &quot;Treaty of Paris&quot;). Charles had become deeply concerned that British success in the Seven Years War would upset the balance of power, and they would soon seek to declare war against the Spanish Empire as well. The French government ceded its largest territory in North America, New France, to Britain as a result of the conflict.

In early 1762, Spain entered the war. The major Spanish objectives to invade Portugal and capture Jamaica were both failures. Britain and Portugal not only repulsed the Spanish attack on Portugal, but captured the cities of Havana, Cuba, a strategic port for all of Spanish America, and Manila, in the Philippines, Spain&#x27;s stronghold for its Asian trade and colony of strategic islands. Charles III wanted to keep fighting the following year, but he was persuaded by the French leadership to stop. In the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for the return of Havana and Manila. This was partly compensated by the acquisition of French Louisiana, given to Spain by France as compensation for Spain&#x27;s war losses. Britain&#x27;s easy victories in capturing Spanish ports prompted Spain to create a standing army and local militias in key parts of Spanish America and fortify vulnerable forts.

In the Falklands Crisis of 1770 the Spanish came close to war with Great Britain after expelling the British garrison of the Falkland Islands. However, Spain was forced to back down when it realized its vulnerability to the British Royal Navy and France declined to support Spain.

On 7 July 1771, Tadeo de Medrano y Acedo wrote a letter to Joaquín López de Zúñiga y Castro, 12th Duke of Béjar. In this letter, Tadeo informs the Duke of a military campaign in which Charles III of Spain led an army of over 14,000 men, including Turks and Moors, and recounts how he had the fortune to witness the first shots fired during the battle.

The invasion of Algiers in 1775 was ordered by Charles, who was attempting to demonstrate to the Barbary States the power of the revitalized Spanish military after the disastrous Spanish experience in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The assault was also meant to demonstrate that Spain would defend its North African territories against any Ottoman or Moroccan encroachment.

Continuing territorial disputes with Portugal led to the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, on 1 October 1777, in which Spain got Colonia del Sacramento, in present-day Uruguay, and the Misiones Orientales, in present-day Brazil, but not the western regions of Brazil, and also the Treaty of El Pardo, on 11 March 1778, in which Spain again conceded that Portuguese Brazil had expanded far west of the longitude specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas, and in return Portugal ceded present-day Equatorial Guinea to Spain.

Concerns about the intrusions of British and Russian merchants into Spain&#x27;s colonies in California prompted the extension of Franciscan missions to Alta California, as well as presidios.

The rivalry with Britain also led him to support the American revolutionaries in their war of independence (1776-1783), despite his misgivings about the example it would set for Spain&#x27;s overseas territories. During the war, Spain recovered Menorca and West Florida in several military campaigns, but failed in their attempt to capture Gibraltar. Spanish military operations in West Florida and on the Mississippi River helped the Thirteen Colonies secure their southern and western frontiers during the war. The capture of Nassau in the Bahamas enabled Spain to also recover East Florida during peace negotiations. The Treaty of Paris of 1783 confirmed the recovery of the Floridas and Menorca and restricted the actions of British commercial interests in Central America.

===Domestic political policies===

Charles had able and enlightened ministers who helped craft his reform policies. During his early rule in Spain, he appointed Italians, including the Marquess of Esquilache and Duke of Grimaldi, who supported reforms by the Count of Campomanes. The Count of Floridablanca was an important minister late in Charles&#x27;s reign, who was carried over as minister after Charles&#x27;s death. Also important was the Count of Aranda, who dominated the Council of Castile (1766-1773).

His internal government was, on the whole, beneficial to the country. He began by compelling the people of Madrid to give up emptying their slops out of the windows, and when they objected he said they were like children who cried when their faces were washed. At the time of his accession to Spain, Charles named secretary to the Finances and Treasurer the Marquis of Esquillache and both realized many reforms. The Spanish Army and Navy were reorganized despite the losses from the Seven Years War.

Charles also eliminated the tax on flour and generally liberalized most commerce. Despite this action, it provoked the overlord to charge high prices because of the &quot;monopolizers&quot; speculating on the bad harvests of the previous years. On 23 March 1766, his attempt to force the &quot;madrileños&quot; to adopt French dress for public security reasons was the excuse for a riot (&quot;Motín de Esquilache&quot;), during which he did not display much personal courage. For a long time after, he remained at Aranjuez, leaving the government in the hands of his minister the Count of Aranda. Not all his reforms were of this formal kind.

The Count of Campomanes tried to show Charles that the true leaders of the revolt against Esquilache were the Jesuits. The wealth and power of the Jesuits were very great; and by the royal decree of 27 February 1767, known as the &quot;Pragmatic Penalty of 1767&quot;, the Jesuits were expelled from Spain, and all their possessions were confiscated. His quarrel with the Jesuits, and the memory of those with the Pope while he was King of Naples, turned him towards a general policy of restriction of what he saw as the overgrown power of the Church. The number of reputedly idle clergy, and more particularly of the monastic orders, was reduced, and the Spanish Inquisition, though not abolished, was rendered torpid.

In the meantime, much-antiquated legislation that tended to restrict trade and industry was abolished, and roads, canals, and drainage works were established. Many of his paternal ventures led to little more than the wasting of monies, or the creation of hotbeds of jobbery; on the whole, however, the country prospered. The result was largely due to the king who, even when ill-advised, did at least work steadily at his task of government.

Charles also sought to reform Spanish colonial policy, in order to make Spain&#x27;s colonies more competitive with the plantations of the French Antilles (particularly the French colony of Saint-Domingue) and Portuguese Brazil. This resulted in the creation of the &quot;&quot;Códigos Negros Españoles&quot;, or Spanish Black Codes. The Black Codes, which were partly based on the French Code Noir and 13th-century Castilian Siete Partidas, aimed to establish greater legal control over slaves in the Spanish colonies, in order to expand agricultural production. The first code was written for the city of Santo Domingo in 1768, while the second code was written for the recently acquired Spanish territory of Louisiana in 1769. The third code, which was named the &quot;Código Negro Carolino&quot;&quot; after Charles himself, divided the freed black and slave populations of Santo Domingo into strictly stratified socio-economic classes.


In Spain, he continued with his work trying to improve the services and facilities of his people. He created the Luxury Porcelain factory under the name of Real Fábrica del Buen Retiro in 1760; Crystal followed by the &quot;Real Fábrica de Cristales de La Granja&quot; and then there was the &quot;Real Fábrica de Platería Martínez&quot; in 1778. During his reign, the areas of Asturias and Catalonia industrialized quickly and produced much revenue for the Spanish economy. He then turned to the foreign economy looking towards his colonies in the Americas. In particular, he looked at the finances of the Philippines and encouraged commerce with the United States, starting in 1778. He also carried out a number of public works; he had the Imperial Canal of Aragon constructed, as well a number of routes that led to the capital of Madrid, which is located in the center of Spain. Other cities were improved during his reign; Seville for example saw the introduction of many new structures such as hospitals and the Archivo General de Indias. In Madrid, he was nicknamed &quot;el Mejor Alcalde de Madrid&quot; (&quot;the Best Mayor of Madrid&quot;). Charles was responsible for granting the title &quot;Royal University&quot; to the University of Santo Tomás in Manila, which is the oldest in Asia.

In the capital, he also had the famous Puerta de Alcalá constructed along with the statue of Alcachofa fountain, and moved and redesigned the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid. He had the future Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía built, as well as the Museo del Prado. At Aranjuez he added wings to the palace.

He created the Spanish Lottery and introduced Christmas cribs following Neapolitan models. During his reign, the movement to found &quot;Economic Societies&quot; (an early form of Chamber of Commerce) was born.

The Royal Palace of Madrid underwent many alterations under his rule. It was in his reign that the huge &quot;Comedor de gala&quot; (Gala Dining room) was built during the years of 1765–1770; the room took the place of the old apartments of Queen Maria Amalia. He died in the palace on 14 December 1788.

==Ruler of the Spanish Empire==

===Centralizing rule and raising revenue===
The policies that centralized the Spanish state on the Iberian Peninsula were extended to its overseas territories, especially after the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, when Havana and Manila were captured (1762–63) by the British. Charles&#x27;s predecessors on the throne had begun reforming the relationship between the Iberian metropole Spanish American and Philippine possessions, to create a centralized and unified empire. The Seven Years&#x27; War had demonstrated to Charles that Spain&#x27;s military was insufficient for a war with Britain. Military defense of the empire was a top priority, an expensive but necessary undertaking. With the 1763 peace treaty ending the Seven Years&#x27; War, Spain regained its ports of Havana, Cuba, and Manila, in the Philippines. Esquilache needed to find revenue to support the establishment of a standing military and fortification of ports. To raise funds, the sales tax alcabala was increased from 2% to 5%. To increase trade, Havana and other Caribbean ports were allowed to trade with other ports within the Spanish empire, not full trade, but &quot;comercio libre&quot; was freer trade. With the expansion, Spain hoped to undermine Britain&#x27;s secret trade with Spanish America, and gain more revenue for the Spanish crown.

Charles sent José de Gálvez as inspector general (&quot;visitor&quot;) to New Spain in 1765 to find ways to extract further revenue from its richest overseas possession and to observe conditions. The position gave sweeping powers to its holder, sometimes greater than that of the viceroy. Following his return to Spain in 1771, Gálvez became Minister of the Indies and proceeded with sweeping administrative changes, replacing the old system of governance with administrative districts (&quot;intendancies&quot;) and strengthening centralized crown control.

===Expulsion of the Jesuits, 1767===
Charles&#x27;s Italian minister Esquilache was hated in Spain, seen as a foreigner, and responsible for policies that many Spaniards opposed. Bread riots in 1766, known as the Esquilache Riots, pinned the blame on the minister, but behind the uprising, the Society of Jesus was seen as the real culprit. After exiling Esquilache, Charles expelled the Jesuits from Spain and its empire in 1767. In Spanish America, the impact was significant, since the Jesuits were a wealthy and powerful religious order, owning lucrative haciendas that produced revenue funding its missions on the frontier and its educational institutions. For American-born Spaniards, at a stroke, the most wealthy and prestigious religious order that educated their sons and accepted a chosen few into their ranks were consigned to Italian exile. Jesuit properties, included thriving haciendas, were confiscated, the &quot;colleges&quot; educating their sons closed, and frontier missions were turned over to other religious orders. Politically, culturally, and economically the expulsion was a blow into the fabric of the empire.

===Bourbon Reforms===
The government of Spain, in an effort to streamline the operation of its colonial empire, began introducing what became known as the Bourbon Reforms throughout South America. In 1776, as part of these reforms, it created the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata by separating Upper Peru (modern Bolivia) and the territory that is now Argentina from the Viceroyalty of Peru. These territories included the economically important silver mines at Potosí, whose economic benefits began to flow to Buenos Aires in the east, instead of Cuzco and Lima to the west. The economic hardship this introduced to parts of the Altiplano combined with systemic oppression of Indian and mestizo underclasses created an environment in which a large-scale uprising could occur. In 1780 an indigenous insurrection of mostly Aymara and Quechua peoples took place against the colonial rulers of the Viceroyalty of Peru, led by Túpac Amaru II. Túpac Amaru&#x27;s uprising was simultaneous with the rebellion of Túpac Katari in colonial-era Upper Peru.

==Personal life==
Charles received the strict and structured education of a Spanish Infante by Giovanni Antonio de Medrano; he was very pious and was often in awe of his domineering mother, who according to many contemporaries, he resembled greatly. The Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo, Doge of Venice and Ambassador of Venice to Naples declared that &quot;...he received an education removed from all studies and all applications in order to be able to govern himself&quot; (&quot;...tenne sempre un&#x27;educazione lontanissima da ogni studio e da ogni applicazione per diventare da sé stesso capace di governo&quot;).

Giovanni Antonio de Medrano taught him geography, history and mathematics, as well as military art and architecture during his stay in the cities of Florence, Parma and Piacenza. He was also educated in printmaking (remaining an enthusiastic etcher), painting, and a wide range of physical activities, including a future favourite of his, hunting. Sir Horatio Mann, a British diplomat in Florence noted that he was greatly impressed at the fondness Charles had for the sport.

His physical appearance was dominated by the Bourbon nose that he had inherited from his father&#x27;s side of the family. He was described as &quot;a brown boy, who has a lean face with a bulging nose&quot;, and was known for his happy and exuberant character.

Charles&#x27;s mother Elisabeth Farnese sought potential brides for her son, when he was formally recognized as King of Naples and Sicily. It was impossible to get an Archduchess of Austria as a bride, so she looked to Poland, choosing Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, a daughter of the newly elected Polish king Augustus III and his (ironically) Austrian wife Maria Josepha of Austria. Maria Josepha was a niece of Emperor Charles; the marriage was seen as the only alternative to an Austrian marriage. Maria Amalia was only 13 when she was informed of her proposed marriage. The marriage date was confirmed on 31 October 1737. Maria Amalia was married by proxy at Dresden in May 1738, with her brother Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony representing Charles. This marriage was looked upon favorably by the Holy See and effectively ended its diplomatic disagreement with Charles. The couple met for the first time on 19 June 1738 at Portella, a village on the frontier of the kingdom near Fondi. At court, festivities lasted till 3 July. As part of the celebration, Charles created the Order of Saint Januarius—the most prestigious order of chivalry in the kingdom. He later had the Order of Charles III created in Spain on 19 September 1771.

The first crisis that Charles had to deal with as King of Spain was the death of his beloved wife Maria Amalia. She died unexpectedly at the Buen Retiro Palace on the eastern outskirts of Madrid, aged 35, on 27 September 1760. She was buried at the El Escorial in the royal crypt. Charles did not marry again. The example of his actions and works was not without effect on other Spanish nobles. In his domestic life, King Charles was regular, and was a considerate master, though he had a somewhat caustic tongue and took a rather cynical view of humanity. He was passionately fond of hunting. During his later years he had some trouble with his eldest son and daughter-in-law.

Charles was one of the largest slave owners in the Spanish Empire, owning 1,500 slaves in the Iberian Peninsula and a further 18,500 in Spain&#x27;s American colonies. His slave ownership influenced the Spanish nobility, which started to emulate Charles by purchasing more slaves, to the point where by the 1780s 4% of Madrid&#x27;s population was enslaved. Charles was buried at the Pantheon of the Kings located at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial.

==Relationship with Freemasonry==

Freemasonry arrived in Spain in 1726, by the year 1748, there were already 800 members in Cádiz, which was the door to Spanish America. During the reign of Carlos III, Freemasonry enjoyed wide liberties, where the most influential political leaders and social figures were distinguished members of the lodges (rumored to be the Rodríguez Campomanes, Esquilache, Wall, Azara, Miguel de la Nava, Pedro del Río, Jovellanos, Valle, Salazar, Olavide, Roda, the Duke of Alba, the Count Floridablanca and the Count of Aranda), managing to convince the king to limit the authority of the Spanish Inquisition (even being behind the Expulsion of the Jesuits), because the presence of Freemasonry was very influential in the Cortes of Carlos III and Carlos IV to encourage enlightened despotism, being almost omnipresent in the noble, literary and military aristocracies that surrounded him. It is not surprising that in the year 1751, when the Peruvian Inquisition had a case of accusation against a Frenchman, this revealed that in the city of Lima there were already at least 40 initiates in Freemasonry. It is also mentioned that through Francisco Saavedra and the Gálvez brothers (Matías de Gálvez y Gallardo together with José de Gálvez y Gallardo), Freemasonry presented links with the government of the colonial territories in Hispanic America.

However, despite this rosy legend of his relative tolerance, Charles III remained a devout Catholic who persecuted Freemasonry, first in the Kingdom of Naples (where in 1751 he had published an edict prohibiting Freemasonry as disturbing public tranquility and of violating the rights of Royal sovereignty) and later in Spain, gaining the fame of being the most distinguished European monarch in repressing Freemasonry (according to the record of his letters) and being obedient to the anti-Masonic indications of the bull Providas Romanorum Pontificum of Pope Benedict XIV, which made impossible the development of an organized Freemasonry in Spain until the Napoleonic Era. Authors such as José Antonio Ferrer Benimeli came to deny the Masonic influence during the Enlightenment in Spain.

However, authors such as Miguel Morayta (endorsing the thesis that Charles III was a Freemason) that his anti-Masonic attitudes were actually due to his concern &quot;for his foreign dependence&quot; (for the interests of the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent of his rivals in the French Enlightened), or that even his anti-Masonic policies were apparent, according to the Masonic oath of obedience and his vow of secrecy about his activities within Freemasonry (being, then, apparent and agreed persecutions). Despite this, there is a consensus that the expansion of Freemasonry in the enlightened Spain of Charles III unquestionably developed, in the same way as it was developed in the other European countries (specifically in the royal and noble houses of Germany, France and England). According to the Freemason Carlos José Gutiérrez de los Ríos, he believes that the increase in the number of people joining Freemasonry, during the reign of Charles III, was the product of the naivety of many Spaniards:
==Legacy==
The rule of Charles III has been considered the &quot;apogee of empire&quot; and not sustained after his death. Charles III ascended the throne of Spain with considerable experience in governance, and enacted significant reforms to revivify Spain&#x27;s economy and strengthen its empire. Although there were European conflicts to contend with, he died in 1788, months before the eruption of the French Revolution in July 1789. Charles III did not equip his son and heir, Charles IV with skills or experience in governance. Charles IV continued a number of policies of his more distinguished father, but was forced to abdicate by his son Ferdinand VII of Spain and then imprisoned by Napoleon Bonaparte who invaded Spain in 1808.

The arms used by Charles while King of Spain were used until 1931 when his great-great-great grandson Alphonso XIII lost the crown, and the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed (there was also a brief interruption from 1873 to 1875). Felipe VI of Spain, Spain&#x27;s current monarch, is a direct male-line descendant of Charles the and a descendant by four of his great-great-grandparents. Felipe VI is also a descendant of Maria Theresa of Austria.

Charles III University of Madrid, established in 1989 and one of the world&#x27;s top 300 universities, is named after him.

<text>The brothers Attilio (1811–1844) and Emilio Bandiera (1819–1844) were Italian nationalists during the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;.

==Background==

Emilio was born in Venice and Attilio was born in Spalato: both were sons of Baron Francesco Bandiera, an admiral in the Austrian Navy, and were themselves members of that service. At an early age they were won over to the ideas of Italian unification, and corresponded with Giuseppe Mazzini and other members of the Giovine Italia, a patriotic revolutionary secret society.

During the year 1843 the air was full of different conspiracies and various other ill-starred attempts at nationalist uprisings were made. The Bandiera brothers spread propaganda among the officers and enlisted men of the Austrian navy, nearly all Italians, and planned to seize a warship to bombard the city of Messina. Having been betrayed by informants they fled to Corfu early in 1844.

==Events==

Rumours reached them in Corfu of agitation in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, where the people were being represented as ready to rise &quot;en masse&quot; at the first appearance of a leader. The Bandiera brothers, encouraged by Mazzini, consequently determined to make a raid on the Calabrian coast. They assembled a band of about twenty men ready to sacrifice their lives, and set sail on their venture on 12 June 1844. Four days later they landed near Crotone, intending to go to Cosenza, liberate the political prisoners and issue their proclamations. Tragically for the Bandiera brothers, they did not find the insurgent band they were told awaited them, so they moved towards La Sila. They were ultimately betrayed by one of their party, the Corsican Boccheciampe, and by some calabrese peasants who believed them to be Turkish pirates.

A detachment of gendarmes and volunteers were sent against them, and after a short fight the whole band was taken prisoner and escorted to Cosenza, where a number of Calabrians who had taken part in a previous rising were also under arrest. First, the Calabrians were tried by court-martial, and a large number were condemned to death or the galleys. The raiders’ turn came next, and the whole party, save the traitor Boccheciampe, were condemned to be shot, but in the case of eight of them the sentence was commuted to the galleys. On 23 July the two Bandiera brothers and their nine companions were executed by firing squad; some accounts state they cried &quot;&quot;Viva l’Italia&quot;!&quot; (Long live Italy!) as they fell.

The remains of the Bandiera Brothers and of their companion Domenico Moro were brought back to Venice on 18 June 1867, following the liberation of that city after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The three remains are buried in the Church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, at the Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, where the equestrian monument of Colleoni is located.

==Aftermath==

The moral effect was enormous throughout Italy, the action of the authorities was universally condemned, and the martyrdom of the Bandiera brothers bore fruit in the subsequent revolutions. It also created a profound impression in Great Britain, where it was believed that the Bandiera brothers’ correspondence with Mazzini had been tampered with, and that information as to the proposed expedition had been forwarded to the Austro-Hungarian and Bourbon governments by their own Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen. This has been proven by way of diplomatic and Parliamentary records by the historian Salvo Mastellone, in his work Mazzni &amp; Marx: Thoughts upon Democracy in Europe (Prager Publisher, 2003).

<text>Ferdinand VI (; 23 September 1713 – 10 August 1759), called the Learned (&quot;el Prudente&quot;) and the Just (&quot;el Justo&quot;), was King of Spain from 9 July 1746 until his death in 1759. He was the third ruler of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty. He was the son of King Philip V and Queen Maria Luisa.

Ferdinand succeeded his father upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1746. His reign proved peaceful, as he avoided involving Spain in any European conflicts. Moderate changes to Spain were initiated under the king, including reforms of taxation, advance commerce, and the Spanish navy, as well as a ban on freemasonry. However, the last years of Ferdinand&#x27;s reign were marked by mental instability, much like his direct predecessor Philip V. Upon his death, Ferdinand was succeeded by his younger half-brother, Charles III.

==Early life==

Born at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid, Ferdinand was the last of the four sons that Philip V had in his first marriage to Maria Luisa of Savoy. The young &quot;infante&quot; endured a sad and lonely childhood. When he was just five months old, his mother died from tuberculosis, and seven months later, his father remarried the ambitious and domineering Elisabeth Farnese, who had no affection except for her own children, and looked upon Ferdinand and her other stepsons as an obstacle to their fortunes. The hypochondria of his father left Elisabeth mistress of the palace.

Philip, the second oldest of his three brothers, only lived for two weeks, dying before Ferdinand was born, while Philip Peter died at the age of 7, when Ferdinand was six years old. At the age of 10, Ferdinand became Prince of Asturias after his oldest brother, Louis, died of smallpox at the age of 17, after only seven months as King following the abdication of their father. But on Elizabeth&#x27;s insistence, Philip returned to the throne. However, due to Philip V&#x27;s declined mental condition, Elizabeth was the more proactive of the two.

Ferdinand, along with his brothers, the infantes, was tutored by the noble Giovanni Antonio Medrano. Ferdinand was by temperament melancholic, shy and distrustful of his own abilities. When complimented on his shooting, he replied, &quot;It would be hard if there were not something I could do.&quot; Shooting and music were his only pleasures, and he was the generous patron of the famous singer Farinelli, whose voice soothed his melancholy.

===Marriage===
Ferdinand was married on January 20, 1729, to Infanta Barbara of Portugal, daughter of John V of Portugal and Maria Anna of Austria. He was sixteen and she was eighteen.

==Reign==
When Ferdinand came to the throne in 1746, Spain was embroiled in the War of the Austrian Succession, which ended with little benefit for Spain. He started his reign by eliminating the influence of his stepmother and her group of Italian courtiers. As king he followed a steady policy of neutrality in the conflict between the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Great Britain. He refused to be tempted by the offers of either kingdom into declaring war on the other.

Prominent figures during his reign were Marquis of Ensenada, a Francophile; and José de Carvajal y Lancáster, a supporter of the alliance with Great Britain. The fight between both ended in 1754 with the death of Carvajal and the fall of Ensenada, after which Ricardo Wall became the most powerful advisor to the monarch.

===Reforms===
The most important tasks during the reign of Ferdinand VI were carried out by the Marquis of Ensenada, the Secretary of the Treasury, Navy and Indies. He suggested that the state help modernize the country. To him, this was necessary to maintain a position of exterior strength so that France and Great Britain would consider Spain as an ally without supposing Spain&#x27;s renunciation of its claim to Gibraltar.

A new model of the Treasury was suggested by Ensenada in 1749. He proposed substitution of the traditional taxes with a special tax, the cadastre, that weighed the economic capacity of each contributor based on their property holdings. He also proposed a reduction of subsidies by the state to the Cortes and the army. The opposition by the nobility caused the abandonment of the project.

In 1752, the bank Giro Real was created. It favored the transfer of public and private funds outside of Spain keeping all of the foreign exchanges in the hands of the Royal Treasury, enriching the State. It is considered the predecessor to the Bank of San Carlos, introduced during the reign of Charles III. Commerce was stimulated in the Americas, in an attempt to end the monopoly in the Indies and eliminate the injustices of colonial commerce. Ferdinand leaned toward registered ships rather than fleets of ships. The new system consisted of the substitution of the fleets and galleons so that a Spanish ship, previously authorized, could conduct trade freely in the Americas. This increased revenues and decreased fraud. Even so, this system provoked many protests among merchants in the private sector.

According to Ensenada, a powerful navy was fundamental to power of an overseas empire and aspirations of being respected by France and Great Britain. He increased the navy&#x27;s budget and expanded the capacity of the shipyards of Cádiz, Ferrol, Cartagena and Havana which marked a commitment to extending the naval policies already underway in his predecessor&#x27;s reign.

Church relations were really tense from start of the reign of Philip V because of the recognition of Charles of Austria as the King of Spain by the pope. A regalist policy was maintained that pursued as much political as fiscal objectives and whose decisive achievement was the Concord of 1753. From this the right of universal patronage was obtained from Pope Benedict XIV, giving important economic benefits to the Crown and a great control over the clergy.

King Ferdinand helped create the Royal Academy of the Fine Arts of San Fernando in 1752. The noted composer Domenico Scarlatti, music teacher to Queen Barbara, wrote many of his 555 harpsichord sonatas at Ferdinand&#x27;s court.

===Ban on freemasonry===

In 1751, Ferdinand VI banned freemasonry in Spain, following a papal condemnation in 1738. During the reign of his successor, Charles III, freemasonry would make its return to Spain in a number of small lodges.

===Foreign policy===

During the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years&#x27; War, Spain reinforced its military might.

The main conflict was its confrontation with Portugal over the colony of Sacramento, from which British contraband was transferred down the Río de la Plata. In 1750 José de Carvajal helped Spain and Portugal strike a deal. Portugal agreed to renounce the colony and its claim to free navigation down the Río de la Plata. In return, Spain ceded to Portugal two regions on the Brazilian border, one in the Amazon and the other to the south, in which were seven of the thirty Jesuit Guaraní towns. The Spanish had to expel the missionaries, generating a conflict with the Guaraní people that lasted eleven years.

The conflict over the towns provoked a crisis in the Spanish Court. Ensenada, favorable to the Jesuits, and Father Rávago, confessor of the King and members of the Society of Jesus, were fired, accused of hindering the agreements with Portugal.

===Death===
During his last year of reign, Ferdinand VI was rapidly losing his mental capacity and he was held in the Castle of Villaviciosa de Odón until his death on 10 August 1759. That period of time between August 1758 and August 1759 is known in Spanish historiography as the year without a king, due to the absence of the royal figure as ruler. The cause of the disease is still debated. 
Some authors suggest that the king suffered a depressive episode. The death of his wife Barbara, who had been devoted to him, and who carefully abstained from political intrigue, broke his heart. Between the date of her death in August 1758 and his own on 10 August 1759, he fell into a state of prostration in which he would not even dress, but wandered unshaven, unwashed and in a nightgown about his park.

Another opinion is that Ferdinand VI suffered a rapidly progressive clinical syndrome where behavioral disorganization with apathy and impulsivity, loss of judgment, and epileptic seizures of the right frontal lobe semiology were predominant. This semiology is highly suggestive of a right frontal lobe syndrome.

As the couple had no children, Ferdinand VI was succeeded as King by his half-brother Charles III.

==Legacy==
Historian Stanley G. Payne regards him positively, writing that &quot;The great virtue of Fernando VI as ruler was that he kept Spain at peace and avoided further entanglement in European struggles&quot;. However, he also notes that &quot;The last five years of Fernando VI, who ultimately lapsed into madness like his father, were a time of vacuity and inaction.&quot;

===In popular culture===
A fictionalized version of Ferdinand VI appears in the 2011 adventure film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;. In the film, after learning about the discovery of the Fountain of Youth, Ferdinand (portrayed by Sebastian Armesto) sends his most trusted agent, known only as &quot;The Spaniard&quot;, to find and destroy the Fountain, because he saw it as the abomination in the eyes of God. Also, his residence, for unknown reasons, is situated in Cádiz, not in Madrid, the capital of Spain.

<doc id="149451" wikidata="Q358348" url="?curid=149451" title="Baccio Bandinelli">
<text>Baccio Bandinelli (also called Bartolomeo Brandini; 12 November 1493 – shortly before 7 February 1560), was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, draughtsman, and painter.

==Biography==


Bandinelli was the son of a prominent Florentine goldsmith, and first apprenticed in his shop. As a boy, he was apprenticed under Giovanni Francesco Rustici, a sculptor friend of Leonardo da Vinci. Among his earliest works was a &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; in wax, made for Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, identified as Bandinelli&#x27;s by John Pope-Hennessy.

Giorgio Vasari, a former pupil in Bandinelli&#x27;s workshop, claimed Bandinelli was driven by jealousy of Benvenuto Cellini and Michelangelo; and recounts that:
Bandinelli&#x27;s lifelong obsession with Michelangelo is a recurring theme in assessments of his career.

Bandinelli was a leader in the group of Florentine Mannerists who were inspired by the revived interest in Donatello attendant on the installation of Donatello&#x27;s bas-relief panels for the pulpit in San Lorenzo, 1515. The artist presented his relief of the &quot;Deposition&quot; to Charles V at Genoa in 1529; though the relief has been lost, a bronze from it by Antonio Susini in 1600 (Musée du Louvre) shows the decisive inspiration of Donatello&#x27;s emotional pitch and intensity; Bandinelli made several drawings of the Donatello reliefs, though later in life he disparaged them in a letter to Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici.

His sculptures have never inspired the admiration given those of Michelangelo, especially the colossal (5.05 m) marble group of &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; (completed in 1534) in the Piazza della Signoria, Florence, and &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, which both stand within sight of some of Michelangelo&#x27;s masterworks. Vasari said of him &quot;He did nothing but make &quot;bozzetti&quot; and finished little&quot;, and modern commentators have remarked on the vitality of Bandinelli&#x27;s terracotta models contrasted with the finished marbles: &quot;all the freshness of his first approach to a subject was lost in the laborious execution in marble... A brilliant draughtsman and excellent small-scale sculptor, he had a morbid fascination for colossi which he was ill-equipped to execute. His failure as a sculptor on a grand scale was accentuated by his desire to imitate Michelangelo.&quot;

&quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; was commissioned by the Medici pope Clement VII, who had been shown a wax model. The supplied block of Carrara marble was not big enough to execute Bandinelli&#x27;s original design. He had to make new wax models, one of which was chosen by the pope as the final draft. Bandinelli had already carved the sculpture as far as the abdomen of Hercules, when during the 1527 Sack of Rome, the pope was taken prisoner. Meanwhile, in Florence, republican enemies of the Medici took advantage of the chaos to exile Ippolito de&#x27; Medici. Bandinelli, a supporter of the Medici, was also exiled. In 1530 Emperor Charles V retook Florence after a long siege. Pope Clement VII subsequently installed his illegitimate son Alessandro de&#x27; Medici as duke of Tuscany. Bandinelli then returned to Florence and continued work on the statue, which was completed in 1534 and transported from the Opera del Duomo to its present marble pedestal. But from the moment it was unveiled, it faced ridicule; Cellini compared the ponderous group to &#x27;a sack full of melons&#x27;. Afterwards, Bandinelli tried to sabotage Cellini&#x27;s career. The statue was restored between February and April 1994.

Bandinelli&#x27;s drawings, which have in the past masqueraded as Michelangelo&#x27;s in connoisseurs&#x27; collections, came into their own in the later twentieth century.

Among Bandinelli&#x27;s pupils were Vasari and Francesco de&#x27; Rossi (Il Salviati). His sons Clemente, a collaborator in his studio, and Michelangelo Bandinelli were also sculptors.

==Selected works==
Baccio Bandinelli&#x27;s works include:

* copy of the Laocoön group, at the time in the Cortile del Belvedere, commissioned by Pope Leo X as a gift to François I. Bandinelli boasted that he would exceed the original, and when he was finished, after a hiatus during the pontificate of Adrian VI, the Medici Pope Clement VII could not bear to part with it, sent some antiquities to the King of France in its stead, and sent Baccio&#x27;s &quot;Laocoön&quot; to Florence. It remains at the Uffizi.
*Tombs of the Medici popes Leo X and Clement VII in Santa Maria sopra Minerva (1536–41).
*&quot;Bust of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici&quot; (c. 1539–40) (Metropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 1987.280) This had been locked away in a vault in a Swiss bank until a dealer&#x27;s tip led the curator Olga Raggio to its rediscovery.
*&quot;Monument to Giovanni delle Bande Nere&quot; (1540–54), a seated figure on a magnificent pedestal, in piazza San Lorenzo, Florence
* &quot;Pietà&quot; in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata, Florence, where Bandinelli portrayed himself in the figure of Joseph of Arimathea. Bandinelli is buried in the chapel, with his wife Giacoma Doni.
*&quot;Ceres&quot; and &quot;Apollo&quot; (1552–1556) for niches in the façade of Buontalenti&#x27;s grotto in the Boboli Gardens
* &quot;Orpheus&quot; for Palazzo Vecchio, now in the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. One of Bandinelli&#x27;s few signed works.
* Works for the Duomo, Florence, including the high altar and its &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1551), now in the Bargello and &quot;Pietà&quot; now in the crypt of Santa Croce; much-praised bas-reliefs made for the enclosure of the choir, designed by the architect Giuliano di Baccio d&#x27;Angnolo (1555), now in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo; &quot;Saint Peter&quot;, one of eight apostles by various sculptors in the piers of the crossing.
* Works in Palazzo Vecchio, including, in the Audience Hall, a statue of &quot;Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici&quot; and one of &quot;Pope Leo X blessing&quot; (finished after Bandinelli&#x27;s death by Vincenzo de&#x27; Rossi)
*&quot;God the Father&quot; (1549) in Santa Croce cloister
*&quot;Andrea Doria as Neptune&quot;, outside Carrara Cathedral. When Carrara was lost for a short while to the Genoese Republic, Bandinelli was commissioned to sculpt Andrea Doria. But after the city was retaken by the Florentine Republic, being such a symbol of Genoese dominion was impermissible, the statue was renamed Neptune, the Roman sea divinity, a rechristening suggested by the fountain sea creatures at the statue&#x27;s base.
*In the Bargello are also a number of lesser works: &quot;Noah&quot; (bas-relief), portrait busts of Eleonora di Toledo and Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, &quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;Leda&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Bacchus&quot; &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and a portrait bust of an unknown man.
*A youthful portrait by Andrea del Sarto c. 1517 is conserved at the Uffizi.

<text>Farinelli (; 24 January 1705 – 16 September 1782) was the stage name of Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi (), a celebrated Italian castrato singer of the 18th century and one of the greatest singers in the history of opera. Farinelli was a soprano castrato, with a range from approximately F3-D6.

==Early years==
Broschi was born in Andria (in what is now Puglia, Italy) into a family of musicians. As recorded in the baptismal register of the church of S. Nicola in Andria, his father Salvatore was a composer and &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the city&#x27;s cathedral, and his mother, Caterina Barrese, a citizen of Naples. The Duke of Andría, Fabrizio Carafa, a member of the House of Carafa, one of the most prestigious families of the Neapolitan nobility, honored Maestro Broschi by taking a leading part in the baptism of his second son, who was baptised Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola. [In later life, Farinelli wrote: &quot;Il Duca d&#x27;Andria mi tenne al fonte&quot; (&quot;The Duke of Andria held me at the font&quot;)], though this may only have been meant in a figurative sense. In 1706 Salvatore also took up the non-musical post of governor of the town of Maratea (on the western coast of what is now Basilicata), and in 1709 that of Terlizzi (some twenty miles south-east of Andria).

From 1707, the Broschi family lived in the coastal city of Barletta, a few miles from Andria, but at the end of 1711, they made the much longer move to the capital city of Naples, where, in 1712 Carlo&#x27;s elder brother Riccardo was enrolled at the Conservatory of S. Maria di Loreto, specialising in composition. Carlo had already shown talent as a boy singer, and was now introduced to the most famous singing-teacher in Naples, Nicola Porpora. Already a successful opera composer, in 1715 Porpora was appointed at the Conservatory of S. Onofrio, where his pupils included such well-known castrati as , Felice Salimbeni, and Gaetano Majorano (known as Caffarelli), as well as distinguished female singers such as Regina Mingotti and Vittoria Tesi; Farinelli may well have studied with him privately.

Salvatore Broschi died unexpectedly on 4 November 1717, aged only 36, and perhaps the consequent loss of economic security for the whole family provoked the decision for Carlo to be castrated. As was often the case, an excuse had to be found for this operation, and in Carlo&#x27;s case it was said to have been necessitated by a fall from a horse. It is, however, also possible that he was castrated earlier, since, at the time of his father&#x27;s death, he was already twelve years old, quite an advanced age for castration.

Under Porpora&#x27;s tutelage, his singing progressed rapidly, and at the age of fifteen, he made his debut a by his master entitled . The text of this work was the first by the soon-to-be-famous Pietro Trapassi (known as Metastasio), who became a lifelong friend of the singer. Farinelli remarked that the two of them had made their debuts on the same day, and each frequently referred to the other as his (&quot;dear twin&quot;).

In this Serenata &quot;Angelica e Medoro&quot;, the two leading roles were entrusted to two highly acclaimed singers: Marianna Benti Bulgarelli (aka &quot;la Romanina&quot;) and Domenico Gizzi, Soprano castrato at the Royal Chapel of Naples.

The derivation of Broschi&#x27;s stage name is not certain, but it was possibly from two rich Neapolitan lawyers, the brothers Farina, who may have sponsored his studies.

Farinelli quickly became famous throughout Italy as (&quot;the boy&quot;). In 1722, he first sang in Rome in Porpora&#x27;s &quot;Flavio Anicio Olibrio&quot;, as well as taking the female lead in &quot;Sofonisba&quot; by Luca Antonio Predieri. (It was common practice for young castrati to appear &quot;en travesti&quot;). All these appearances were greeted with huge public enthusiasm, and an almost legendary story arose that he had to perform an aria with trumpet &quot;obbligato&quot;, which evolved into a contest between singer and trumpeter. Farinelli surpassed the trumpet player so much in technique and ornamentation that he &quot;was at last silenced only by the acclamations of the audience&quot; (to quote the music historian Charles Burney). This account, however, cannot be verified, since no surviving work which Farinelli is known to have performed contains an aria for soprano with trumpet &quot;obbligato&quot;.

==Career in Europe==
In 1724, Farinelli made his first appearance in Vienna, at the invitation of Prince Luigi Pio di Savoia, director of the Imperial Theatre. He spent the following season in Naples. 

In 1726, Farinelli performed in Parma and Milan, where Johann Joachim Quantz heard him and commented: &quot;Farinelli had a penetrating, full, rich, bright and well-modulated soprano voice, with a range at that time from the A below middle C to the D two octaves above middle C. ... His intonation was pure, his trill beautiful, his breath control extraordinary and his throat very agile, so that he performed the widest intervals quickly and with the greatest ease and certainty. Passagework and all kinds of melismas were of no difficulty to him. In the invention of free ornamentation in adagio he was very fertile.&quot; Quantz is certainly accurate in describing Farinelli as a soprano - since several arias in his repertoire require a sustained C6 - these include &quot;Fremano l&#x27;onde&quot; in Pietro Torri&#x27;s opera &quot;Nicomede&quot; (1728) and &quot;Troverai se a me ti fidi&quot; in Niccolò Conforto&#x27;s &quot;La Pesca&quot; (1737) His low range apparently extended to F3, as in &quot;Al dolor che vo sfogando&quot;, an aria written by himself and incorporated in a pasticcio called Sabrina, and as in two of his own cadenzas for &quot;Quell&#x27; usignolo innamorato&quot; from Geminiano Giacomelli&#x27;s &quot;Merope&quot;.

Farinelli sang at Bologna in 1727, where he met the famous castrato Antonio Bernacchi, twenty years his senior. In a duet in Orlandini&#x27;s &quot;Antigona&quot;, Farinelli showed off all the aspects of the beauty of his voice and refinements of his style, executing a number of passages of great virtuosity, which were rewarded with tumultuous applause. Undaunted, Bernacchi repeated every trill, roulade, and cadenza of his young rival, but performing all of them even more exquisitely, and adding variations of his own. Farinelli, admitting defeat, entreated Bernacchi to give him instruction in (&quot;ultra-refined graces&quot;); Bernacchi agreed.

In 1728, as well as performing in Torri&#x27;s &quot;Nicomede&quot; at the Munich court, Farinelli performed another concert before the Emperor in Vienna. In 1729, during the Carnival season in Venice, he sang in two works by Metastasio: as Arbace in Metastasio&#x27;s &quot;Catone in Utica&quot; (music by Leonardo Leo) and Mirteo in &quot;Semiramide Riconosciuta&quot; (music by Porpora).
In these important drammi per musica, performed at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo of Venice, at his side sang some other singers of the first rank: Nicola Grimaldi, detto Nicolino (a mezzo-soprano castrato, who had earlier performed for Handel), the female soprano Lucia Facchinelli, another castrato Domenico Gizzi (&quot;Virtuoso della Cappella Reale di Napoli&quot;), and the renowmed bass Giuseppe Maria Boschi.

During this period it seemed Farinelli, loaded with riches and honors, was so famous and so formidable as a performer that his rival and friend, the castrato Gioacchino Conti (&quot;Gizziello&quot;) is said to have fainted from sheer despondency on hearing him sing. George Frideric Handel was also keen to engage Farinelli for his company in London, and while in Venice in January 1730, tried unsuccessfully to meet him.

In 1731, Farinelli visited Vienna for a third time. There he was received by the Emperor Charles VI, on whose advice, according to the singer&#x27;s first biographer, Giovenale Sacchi, Farinelli modified his style, singing more simply and emotionally. Sacchi&#x27;s source for this must have been Charles Burney&#x27;s notes on his visit to Farinelli in 1770, published in London in 1773 in &quot;The present state of music in France and Italy...&quot;, here pp. 215-216. After further seasons in Italy, and another visit to Vienna, during which he sang in oratorios in the Imperial chapel, Farinelli came to London in 1734.

==Farinelli in London==
In London the previous year, Senesino, a singer who had been a part of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Second Academy&quot; which performed at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket, quarrelled with Handel and moved to a rival company, the Opera of the Nobility, operating from a theatre in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. This company had Porpora as composer and Senesino as principal singer, but had not been a success during its first season of 1733–34. Farinelli, Porpora&#x27;s most famous pupil, joined the company and made it financially solvent.

He first appeared in &quot;Artaserse&quot;, a with music by his brother Riccardo and Johann Adolph Hasse. He sang the memorable arias &quot;Per questo dolce amplesso&quot; (music by Hasse) and &quot;Son qual nave&quot; (music by Broschi), while Senesino sang &quot;Pallido il sole&quot; (music by Hasse). Of &quot;Per questo dolce amplesso&quot;, Charles Burney reported: &quot;Senesino had the part of a furious tyrant, and Farinelli that of an unfortunate hero in chains; but in the course of the first air, the captive so softened the heart of the tyrant, that Senesino, forgetting his stage-character, ran to Farinelli and embraced him in his own&quot;. &quot;Son qual nave&quot;, on the other hand, was composed by Riccardo Broschi as a special showpiece for his brother&#x27;s virtuosic skills. Burney described it thus: &quot;The first note he was taken with such delicacy, swelled by minute degrees to such an amazing volume, and afterwards diminished in the same manner to a mere point, that it was applauded for full five minutes. After this he set off with such brilliancy and rapidity of execution, that it was difficult for the violins of those days to keep pace with him.&quot; In 1735 Farinelli and Senesino also appeared in Nicola Porpora&#x27;s &quot;Polifemo&quot;.

Both the cognoscenti and the public adored him. The librettist Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: &quot;Farinelli has surprised me so much that I feel as though I had hitherto heard only a small part of the human voice, and now have heard it all. He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...&quot;. Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: &quot;One God, one Farinelli!&quot;, and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series &quot;Marriage A-la-Mode&quot; of 1745).

Though Farinelli&#x27;s success was enormous, neither the Nobility Opera nor Handel&#x27;s company was able to sustain the public&#x27;s interest, which waned rapidly. Though his official salary was £1500 for a season, gifts from admirers probably increased this to something more like £5000, an enormous sum at the time. Farinelli was by no means the only singer to receive such large amounts, which were unsustainable in the long term. As one contemporary observer remarked: &quot;within these two years we have seen even Farinelli sing to an audience of five-and-thirty pounds&quot;. Nonetheless, he was still under contract in London in the summer of 1737 when he received a summons, via Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, Secretary of the Spanish Embassy there, to visit the Spanish court.

==At the court of Spain==

Apparently intending to make only a brief visit to the Continent, Farinelli stopped at Paris on his way to Madrid, singing on 9 July at Versailles to King Louis XV, who gave him his portrait set in diamonds, and 500 &quot;louis d&#x27;or&quot;. On 15 July he left for Spain, arriving about a month later. Elisabeth Farnese, the Queen, had come to believe that Farinelli&#x27;s voice might be able to cure the severe depression of her husband, King Philip V (some contemporary physicians, such as the Queen&#x27;s doctor Giuseppe Cervi, believed in the efficacy of music therapy). By royal decree Farinelli was named chamber musician to the king and queen on 28 August 1737; two days later the title , meaning something like family servant to the king, was added. The decree provided Farinelli with an enormous salary, a coach with the necessary mules and residence wherever the king happened to be.

For the remaining nine years of Philip&#x27;s life, Farinelli was obliged to give nightly recitals, accompanied by other musicians, for King Philip, the queen and some select company in the king&#x27;s chamber. In 1738 he may have assisted in arranging for the visit of an entire Italian opera company to Madrid, beginning a fashion for &quot;opera seria&quot; in Madrid. The Coliseo of the royal palace of Buen Retiro was remodelled. The operas given there were not public but attended by the king, the queen, the court and various important persons such as officers and ambassadors.

On the accession of Philip&#x27;s son, Ferdinand VI, Farinelli&#x27;s influence increased. Ferdinand was a keen musician, and his queen consort, Maria Bárbara of Portugal, was a highly accomplished harpsichordist for whom Domenico Scarlatti wrote most of his sonatas. Scarlatti had been her music master when she was a princess in Lisbon and followed her to Spain after her marriage in 1729. Scarlatti became the music master to both Maria Bárbara and Ferdinand and died in their service in 1757; the musicologist Ralph Kirkpatrick acknowledges Farinelli&#x27;s correspondence as having provided &quot;most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day&quot;). Under Phillip V Farinelli had gradually assumed a role in the production of operas, encouraged by Queen Isabel Farnesio (Elisabeth Farnese), although having little or nothing to do with the musical side of the performances. When Ferdinand came to the throne in 1746, Farinelli was made Director of the Court Opera. His production of a magnificent opera in 1750 caused the king to make him a Knight of the Order of Calatrava. In the same year the Felipe ordained that the house Farinelli shared at Aranjuez should be much enlarged and made more beautiful and that it should become a residence just for Farinelli himself together with his staff. As producer and director of the court operatic events at the Buen Retiro palace in Madrid and at the royal seat at Aranjuez, Farinelli gradually extended his work to the creation of extraordinary illuminations and firework displays, once involving 60 thousand candles, both as part of the operas and as independent events, for instance on the king&#x27;s name day. He also became involved in the small fleet of royal vessels on which the king, the queen and most of the court made excursions on the Tagus at Aranjuez. These excursions were probably instigated in 1752 without Farinelli&#x27;s participation, but it may have been he who added two gilded barges to the fleet in 1753. On the excusions from 1754 to 1757 Farinelli, who directed these royal excusions from 1755 onwards (if not earlier) sang arias on board one of the gilded barges, &#x27;La Real&#x27;, accompanied by the king or the queen on the harpsichord. Sometimes the king played solo sonatas and Farinelli and the queen once sang a duet. By nightfall, the vessels would have returned to find the riverbanks and the point of disembarkation all lit up by tens of thousands of candles, organized beforehand by Farinelli. On these evenings, Farinelli sang again in public, the star in an informal concert given on a gilded barge on the river, his accompanists the king and queen. The last excursion took place in July 1757. Farinelli&#x27;s last illuminations and his last operatic production were for the king&#x27;s nameday in May 1758. Queen Maria Bárbara, who attended these final festivities, died at the end of August the same year; King Ferdinand died in August 1759.

==Retirement and death==
Ferdinand was succeeded by his half-brother Charles III in 1759. He had no time for music, so it seems: he disbanded the opera and discharged Farinelli but granted him his full salary for the rest of his life. Farinelli returned to Italy where he lived out his days at the beautiful villa he had built outside Bologna (he had acquired citizenship of that city as well as the necessary land as long ago as 1732). Though rich and still famous, visited by such notable figures as Charles Burney, Leopold Mozart and his son Wolfgang Amadeus, and Casanova, he would have been lonely in his old age, having outlived many of his friends and former colleagues. One distinguished friend of his later years was the music historian, Giovanni Battista (known as &quot;Padre&quot;) Martini who lived in Bologna. Farinelli also continued his correspondence with Metastasio, court poet at Vienna, dying a few months after him. In his will (Achivio Notarile Gambarini Lorenzo 1782 10 Gennaio - 23 Xbre, 5/14, Achivio di Stato di Bologna), dated 20 February 1782, Farinelli asked to be buried in the mantle of the Order of Calatrava, as ordained in the statutes of the order, and was interred at the city&#x27;s Capuchin monastery of Santa Croce. His estate included gifts from royalty, a large collection of paintings including works by Velázquez, Murillo, and Jusepe de Ribera, as well as portraits of his royal patrons, and several of himself, some by his friend Jacopo Amigoni and one by Corrado Giaquinto now in the Museo Civico di Bologna. The inventory of his estate includes a collection of seven keyboard instruments in which he took great delight, especially a piano made in Florence in 1730 (called in the will ), inherited from Queen Maria Bárbara, and violins by Stradivarius and Amati (Achivio Notarile Gambarini Lorenzo 1782 BIS, 5/14, 17, Achivio di Stato di Bologna).

Farinelli died in Bologna on 16 September 1782. His original place of burial was destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars, and in 1810 Farinelli&#x27;s great-niece Maria Carlotta Pisani had his remains transferred to the cemetery of La Certosa in Bologna. Maria Carlotta bequeathed many of Farinelli&#x27;s letters to University of Bologna&#x27;s library and was buried in the same grave as Farinelli in 1850.

==Farinelli&#x27;s other musical activities==
Farinelli not only sang, but like most musicians of his time, was a competent harpsichordist. He also played the viola d&#x27;amore. He occasionally composed, writing a cantata of farewell to London (entitled , for which he also wrote the text), and a few songs and arias, including one dedicated to Ferdinand VI.

==The artist and his times==
Farinelli is widely regarded as the greatest, most accomplished, and most respected opera singer of the &quot;castrato&quot; era, which lasted from the early 1600s into the early 1800s, and while there were a vast number of such singers during this period, originating especially from the Neapolitan School of such composers as Nicola Porpora, Alessandro Scarlatti, and Francesco Durante, only a handful of his rivals could approach his skill as a singer. Caffarelli, Matteuccio, Siface, Senesino, Gizziello, Marchesi, Carestini, and some others were very famous and extremely gifted in their own right, with Caffarelli probably being the most vocally proficient – but Farinelli was also admired for his modesty, his intelligence, his unassuming attitude, and his dedication to his work. He respected his colleagues, composers, and impresarios, often earning their lifelong friendship as a result, whereas Caffarelli was notoriously capricious, malicious, and disrespectful of anyone sharing the stage with him, to the point of cackling and booing fellow singers during their own arias.

Farinelli&#x27;s technical proficiency allowed him to be comfortable in all vocal registers from tenor to soprano; he himself favoured the medium-to-high register rather than the very high, thus enabling himself to convey emotion rather than to astonish by sheer technique (unlike most of his colleagues who preferred to startle audiences with vocal stunts). This &quot;soft&quot; approach to music no doubt helped him survive his 22-year private engagement at the court of Spain, after his theatrical career had ended when he was aged only 32, a career in which he had already achieved every possible success on every European stage, and, even in retirement in Bologna, was still regarded by every foreign dignitary visiting the city as the preferred music star to meet.

==Farinelli Study Centre==
Farinelli lived in Bologna from 1761 until his death. The Farinelli Study Centre () was opened in Bologna in 1998, Major events and achievements in which it was involved have included:
* The restoration of Farinelli&#x27;s grave in the Certosa of Bologna (2000)
* An historical exhibition (2001 and 2005)
* The inauguration of a City Park in the name of Farinelli, near the site where the singer lived in Bologna (2002)
* An international symposium on the occasion of Farinelli&#x27;s 300th anniversary of his birth (2005)
* An official publication (2005)
* The disinterment of Farinelli at the Certosa of Bologna (2006)

==Portrayals of Farinelli in literature, film, radio, opera and theatre==
Farinelli is represented in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;.

A film, &quot;Farinelli&quot;, directed by Gérard Corbiau, was made about Farinelli&#x27;s life in 1994. This takes considerable dramatic licence with history, emphasising the importance of Farinelli&#x27;s brother and reducing Porpora&#x27;s role, while Handel becomes an antagonist; the singer&#x27;s 22 years spent in the Spanish court is only vaguely hinted at, as well as his brother being appointed Minister of War. Farinelli&#x27;s supposed sexual escapades are a major element of the film&#x27;s plot, and are totally spurious according to historians (primarily, Patrick Barbier&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des castrats&quot;, Paris 1989).

In opera: Farinelli is a character in the opera La Part du Diable, composed by Daniel Auber to a libretto by Eugène Scribe; the title-role in the opera &quot;Farinelli&quot; by the English composer John Barnett, first performed at Drury Lane in 1839, where his part is written for a tenor (this work is itself an adaptation of the anonymous , premiered in Paris in 1835). More recent operas include Matteo d&#x27;Amico&#x27;s (1996) and by Siegfried Matthus (1998).

Composer and performer Rinde Eckert gives Farinelli&#x27;s time in Spain a contemporary treatment in his 1995 work for radio, &quot;Four Songs Lost in a Wall&quot;, commissioned by &quot;New American Radio&quot;.

That period in his life is also the setting for &quot;Farinelli and the King&quot; (the king in question being Philip V of Spain), a play by Claire van Kampen, which premiered at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse from 11 February to 7 March 2015. It was transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in the final months of 2015, with the role of Farinelli doubled between speaking and singing, with Iestyn Davies performing the latter. Van Kampen&#x27;s &quot;Farinelli and the King&quot; was performed on Broadway at the Belasco Theatre from 5 December 2017, to 25 March 2018.

Farinelli is portrayed by Raúl Ferrando in the episode &quot;Fly Away&quot; of the 2021 Netflix Original Series &quot;The Cook of Castamar&quot;.

<text>Angelo Maria Bandini (25 September 1726 – 1803) was an Italian author and librarian born in Florence.

==Biography==
Orphan since infancy, Angelo Maria was supported by his uncle, Giuseppe Bandini, a lawyer of some note. He was initially educated among the Jesuits, and showed a special inclination for the study of antiquities. In 1747 he undertook a journey to Vienna with the bishop of Volterra, for whom he acted in the capacity of secretary. He was introduced to the emperor and took the opportunity of dedicating to that monarch his &quot;Specimen Litteraturae Florentinae,&quot; which was then printed at Florence. On his return he took holy orders, and settled in Rome, passing the whole of his time in the library of the Vatican, and in those of the cardinals Passionei and Corsini.

The famous obelisk of Augustus, at that time removed from the ruins of Campus Martius, was described by Bandini in a learned folio volume entitled &quot;De Obelisco Augusti&quot;. Shortly after, he was compelled to leave Rome on account of his health and returned to Florence, where he was appointed librarian to the valuable Biblioteca Marucelliana bequeathed to the public by abbott Marucelli. In 1756 he was assigned by the emperor to a prebend at Florence, and appointed principal librarian to the Laurentian Library, vacant with the death of Antonio Maria Biscioni.

<text>Henry the Fat (Basque: &quot;Henrike I.a, Gizena&quot;, French: &quot;Henri le Gros&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Enrique el Gordo&quot;) (c. 1244 – 22 July 1274) was King of Navarre (as Henry I) and Count of Champagne and Brie (as Henry III) from 1270 until his death.

== Early life ==

Henry was the youngest son of Theobald I of Navarre and Margaret of Bourbon. During the reign of his childless older brother Theobald II he held the regency during many of Theobald&#x27;s numerous absences. In 1269, Henry married Blanche of Artois, daughter of the then-reigning King Louis IX of France&#x27;s brother Count Robert I of Artois. He was thus in the &quot;Angevin&quot; circle in international politics.

== Reign ==

Recognized as heir presumptive during his brother&#x27;s reign, Henry succeeded to the thrones of the Kingdom of Navarre and County of Champagne upon Theobald II&#x27;s death in December 1270. Henry I&#x27;s proclamation at Pamplona, however, did not take place until the following year, 1 March 1271, and his coronation was delayed until May 1273. His first act was the swear to uphold the Fueros of Navarre and then go to perform homage to Philip III of France for Champagne.

Henry came to the throne at the height of an economic boom in Navarre that was not happening elsewhere in Iberia at as great a rate. But by the Treaty of Paris (1259), the English had been ceded rights in Gascony that effectively cut off Navarrese access to the ocean (since France, Navarre&#x27;s ally, was at odds with England). Henry allowed the Pamplonese burg of Navarrería to disentangle itself from the union of San Cernin and San Nicolás, effected in 1266. He also granted privileges to the towns of Estella, Los Arcos, and Viana, fostering urban growth. His relations with the nobility were, on the whole, friendly, though he was prepared to maintain the peace of his realm at nearly any cost.

Henry initially sought to recover territory lost to Castile by assisting the revolt of King Alfonso X of Castile&#x27;s brother Philip in 1270. He eventually declined, preferring to establish an alliance with Castile through the marriage of his son Theobald to Alfonso X&#x27;s daughter Violant in September 1272. This failed with the death of the young Theobald after he fell from a battlement at the castle of Estella in 1273.

== Death and legacy ==

Henry did not long outlive his son. He was suffocated, according to the generally received accounts, by his own fat. His only legitimate child, a one-year-old daughter named Joan, succeeded him under the regency of her mother Blanche. Joan&#x27;s marriage in 1284 to Philip the Fair, the future King of France, in the same year united the crown of Navarre to that of France and saw Champagne devolve to the French royal domain.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante Alighieri, a younger contemporary, sees Henry&#x27;s spirit outside the gates of Purgatory, where he is grouped with a number of other European monarchs of the 13th century. Henry is not named directly, but is referred to as &quot;the kindly-faced&quot; and &quot;the father-in-law of the Plague of France&quot;.

<doc id="149459" wikidata="Q313260" url="?curid=149459" title="Al Green">
<text>Albert Leornes Greene (born April 13, 1946), known professionally as Al Green, is an American singer, songwriter, pastor and record producer. He is best known for recording a series of soul hit singles in the early 1970s, including &quot;Tired of Being Alone&quot; (1971), &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You&quot; (1972), &quot;Love and Happiness&quot; (1973), &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; (1974), and his signature song, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; (1972). After his girlfriend died by suicide, Green became an ordained pastor and turned to gospel music. He later returned to secular music.

Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. He was referred to on the museum&#x27;s site as being &quot;one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music&quot;. He has also been referred to as &quot;The Last of the Great Soul Singers&quot;. Green is the winner of 11 Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also received the BMI Icon award and is a Kennedy Center Honors recipient. He was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2008 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, ranking at No. 65, as well as its 2023 list of the &quot;200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, at No. 10. 

Green is a canonical Memphis soul artist. He collaborated closely with many of Memphis&#x27;s most notable R&amp;B musicians; a long and prolific partnership with producer/arranger Willie Mitchell and the Hi Rhythm Section yielded Green&#x27;s greatest commercial success.

==Early life==
Albert Leornes Greene was born on April 13, 1946, in Forrest City, Arkansas, as the sixth of ten children born to Cora Lee and sharecropper Robert G. Greene Jr. At around the age of ten, Al began performing with his sister in a group called the Greene Brothers. During the late 1950s, the Greene family relocated to Grand Rapids, Michigan.

While still a teenager, Al was kicked out of the family home after his devoutly religious father caught him listening to Jackie Wilson. He then lived with a prostitute, began hustling, and indulged in recreational drugs.

&quot;[I listened to] Mahalia Jackson, all the great gospel singers. But the most important music to me was those hip-shakin&#x27; boys: Wilson Pickett and Elvis Presley. When I was 13, I just loved Elvis Presley. Whatever he got, I went out and bought.&quot;

In high school, Al formed a vocal group called Al Greene &amp; the Creations. Two of the group&#x27;s members, Curtis Rodgers and Palmer James, formed an independent label called Hot Line Music Journal. In 1966, having changed their name to Al Greene &amp; the Soul Mates, they recorded the song &quot;Back Up Train&quot;, releasing it on Hot Line Music. The song was a hit on the R&amp;B charts and peaked at No. 46 in the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100. However, the group&#x27;s subsequent follow-ups failed to chart, as did their debut album &quot;Back Up Train&quot;. While performing with the Soul Mates, Green came into contact with Memphis record producer Willie Mitchell, who hired him in 1969 to be a vocalist for a Texas show with Mitchell&#x27;s band. Following the performance, Mitchell asked Green to sign with his Hi Records label.

==Career==
===Early success===
Having noted that Green had been trying to sing like Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, and James Brown, Mitchell became his vocal mentor, coaching him into finding his own voice. Before releasing his first album with Hi Records, Green removed the final &quot;e&quot; from his name. Subsequently, he released &quot;Green Is Blues&quot; (1969), which was a moderate success. His follow-up album, &quot;Al Green Gets Next to You&quot; (1971), featured the hit R&amp;B cover of the Temptations&#x27; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Next to You&quot;, recorded in a slow blues-oriented style. The album also featured his first significant hit, &quot;Tired of Being Alone&quot;, which sold a million copies and was certified gold, becoming the first of eight gold singles Green would release between 1971 and 1974.

Green&#x27;s next album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; (January 1972), solidified his place in soul music. The title track was his biggest hit to date, reaching number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts. The album became his first to be certified gold. His follow-up, &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You&quot; (October 1972), went platinum with the help of the singles &quot;Look What You Done for Me&quot; and the title track, both of which went to the top 10 on the Hot 100. His next album, &quot;Call Me&quot; (April 1973), produced three top-10 singles: &quot;You Ought to Be with Me&quot;, &quot;Call Me (Come Back Home)&quot;, and &quot;Here I Am (Come and Take Me)&quot;. In addition to these hit singles, Green also had radio hits with songs such as &quot;Love and Happiness&quot;, his cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Simply Beautiful&quot;, &quot;What a Wonderful Thing Love Is&quot;, and &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; (later covered successfully by new wave band Talking Heads and blues artist Syl Johnson).

Green&#x27;s album &quot;Livin&#x27; for You&quot; (December 1973) was certified gold. He continued to record successful R&amp;B hits in the next several years, including &quot;Livin&#x27; for You&quot;, &quot;Sha-La-La (Makes Me Happy)&quot; from his album &quot;Al Green Explores Your Mind,&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Married&quot;, &quot;L-O-V-E (Love)&quot; and &quot;Full of Fire&quot;.

By the time Green released &quot;The Belle Album&quot; in 1977, however, his record sales had plummeted, partially due to Green&#x27;s own personal issues during this time and his desire to become a minister. His last Hi Records album, &quot;Truth n&#x27; Time&quot;, was released in 1978 and failed to chart top 40.

=== Gospel recordings ===
Continuing to record R&amp;B, Green saw his sales start to slip and drew mixed reviews from critics. In 1979, he injured himself falling off the stage while performing in Cincinnati and took this as a message from God. He then concentrated his energies towards pastoring his church and gospel music.

From 1981 to 1989, Green recorded a series of gospel albums. While still under contract with Hi Records, Green released the 1980 album &quot;The Lord Will Make a Way&quot;, his first of six albums on the Christian label Myrrh Records. The title song from the album would later win Green his first of eight Grammy Awards in the Best Soul Gospel Performance category. In 1982, Green co-starred with Patti LaBelle in the Broadway play &quot;Your Arms Too Short to Box with God&quot;. In 1984, director Robert Mugge released a documentary film, &quot;Gospel According to Al Green&quot;, including interviews about his life and footage from his church. In 1985, he reunited with Willie Mitchell along with Angelo Earl for &quot;He Is the Light&quot;, his first album for A&amp;M Records. His 1987 follow-up, &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, featured the minor hit, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gonna Be Alright&quot;, which reached No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, his first top-40 R&amp;B hit since &quot;I Feel Good&quot; in 1978.

=== Return to secular music ===
&quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; was later covered by Tina Turner, her second collaboration with the British Heaven 17 and British Electric Foundation production team after &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot; in 1982, and served as her comeback single in late 1983. Unlike Al Green&#x27;s version, Turner sings verse 2 first, then verse 1 when the band starts playing. Green returned to secular music in 1988 recording &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot; with Annie Lennox. Featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Scrooged&quot;, the song became Green&#x27;s first top-10 pop hit since 1974. Green had a hit in 1989 with &quot;The Message is Love&quot; with producer Arthur Baker. Two years later, he recorded the theme song to the short-lived show &quot;Good Sports&quot;. In 1993, he signed with RCA and with Baker again as producer, released the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;. Green received his ninth Grammy award for his collaboration with Lyle Lovett for their duet of &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;. Green&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Your Heart&#x27;s In Good Hands&quot;, was released around the time that Green was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The one single released from the album, &quot;Keep On Pushing Love&quot;, was described as &quot;invoking the original, sparse sound of his [Green&#x27;s] early classics&quot;.
In 2000, Green released his autobiography, &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;. Two years later, he earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and recorded a hit R&amp;B duet with Ann Nesby on the song, &quot;Put It On Paper&quot;. Green again reunited with Willie Mitchell in 2003 for the album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;. A year later, Green re-recorded his previous song, &quot;Simply Beautiful&quot;, with Queen Latifah on the latter&#x27;s album, &quot;The Dana Owens Album&quot;. In 2005, Green and Mitchell collaborated on &quot;Everything&#x27;s OK&quot;.

Green&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, was produced by Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson and James Poyser. It became Green&#x27;s first album to reach the top 10 since the early 1970s. The album features a minor R&amp;B hit with the ballad, &quot;Stay with Me (By the Sea)&quot;, featuring John Legend, and also includes duets with Anthony Hamilton and Corinne Bailey Rae. During an interview for promotion of the album, Green admitted that he would have liked to duet with Marvin Gaye: &quot;In those days, people didn&#x27;t sing together like they do now.&quot;

In 2009, Green recorded &quot;People Get Ready&quot; with Heather Headley on the album &quot;Oh Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration&quot;. In 2010, Green performed &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. On September 13, 2018, Al Green released his first new recording in almost over ten years, &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls&quot;, most famously recorded by Freddy Fender in 1975. It was produced by Matt Ross-Spang and is part of Amazon Music&#x27;s new &quot;Produced By&quot; series.

==Personal life==
On October 18, 1974, Green&#x27;s girlfriend, Mary Woodson, assaulted him and then died by suicide at his Memphis home. Although unbeknownst to Green she was already married with three children, Woodson became upset when Green refused to marry her. She doused him with a pot of boiling grits as he was preparing for bed in the bathroom, causing second-degree burns on his back, stomach, and arms which required skin grafts. Shortly after, Woodson fatally shot herself with his .38 handgun. Police found an apparent suicide note inside Woodson&#x27;s purse that declared her intentions and her reasons. A few days prior, Green had sent Woodson to convalesce at the home of his friend after she had taken a handful of sleeping pills and slit her wrists. Green cited this incident as a wake-up call to change his life.

Days after Green was released from Baptist Memorial Hospital Memphis, where he was treated for his burns, he was reportedly held hostage at gunpoint by his cousin, who claimed he owed her money. Green refused to press charges.

In 1976, Green established the Full Gospel Tabernacle church in Memphis. Green resides in Millington, and preaches near Memphis. He is a member of the Prince Hall Masons, the African-American wing of Freemasonry, at the Thirty-Third Degree.

In September 2013, Green&#x27;s sister Maxine Green was reported missing from her assisted living home in Grand Rapids, Michigan. According to her daughter Lasha, Green has not reached out to the family about his sister. As of March 2023, she is still missing.

=== Marriages and children ===
On June 15, 1977, Green married his first wife Shirley Green (née Kyles) in Memphis. Originally from Chicago, she was one of his backing vocalists and an employee at his church. Together they have three daughters. Shirley first filed for divorce in 1978 on the ground of cruelty and irreconcilable differences. She filed again in 1981, charging that Green had subjected her to domestic violence throughout their marriage. Green accused her of cruel and inhuman treatment in a countercomplaint. In a sworn deposition in 1982 as part of her divorce filing, Shirley testified that in 1978 while she was five months pregnant, Green beat her with a boot for refusing to have sex. She claimed that the assault resulted in head wounds, one of which required stitches. After the incident she filed for divorce, but they reconciled. According to Shirley, they separated several times when the beatings became &quot;too frequent and too severe&quot;. Initially, Green denied beating his wife, but under oath in 1982 he admitted to striking her. Their divorce was finalized in February 1983. Green agreed to pay her $432,800 in alimony and child support. In 1995, the story of Nicole Brown Simpson inspired Shirley to go public with the abuse she endured in order to help other victims.

Green has seven children: three sons, Chris Burse Sr., Al Green Jr., and Trevor, plus four daughters, Alva Lei, Rubi Renee, Kora Kishe (with Shirley Green), and Kala.

Green was reportedly remarried by the 1990s.

=== Assault charges ===
Green&#x27;s former secretary, Linda Wills, filed a $25,000 civil suit against him in 1974. Wills alleged that Green beat her and shoved her through a glass door in his Memphis office after a dispute about how much back pay she was entitled to for her duties. The civil suit was dropped because of &quot;conflicting testimony&quot;, but in 1975, they settled a $100,000 lawsuit for assault and battery charges.

In 1977, Green and his former organ player Larry Robinson were arrested for assault on Memorial Day in Irving, Texas. According to Robinson, Green and his bodyguards jumped him when he confronted Green about owed money from previous gigs. They both posted bond on a misdemeanor charge.

In 1978, Green was charged with assault and battery for allegedly beating Lovie Smith unconscious with a tree limb. The charges were dismissed after Smith, who had moved, did not receive a subpoena and therefore missed the court date.

==Discography==

==Awards and honors==
Green has been nominated for 21 Grammy Awards, winning 11, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Two of his songs, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; and &quot;Take Me To the River&quot; have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2004, he was inducted into the Gospel Music Association&#x27;s Gospel Music Hall of Fame. That same year, he was inducted into The Songwriters Hall of Fame. Also in 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him No. 65 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 BET Awards on June 24, 2009.

On August 26, 2004, Green was honored as a BMI Icon at the annual BMI Urban Awards. He joined a list of previous Icon honorees that included R&amp;B legends James Brown, Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Bo Diddley. Green was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2009. He was recognized on December 7, 2014, as a Kennedy Center Honors recipient.

<doc id="149460" wikidata="Q317506" url="?curid=149460" title="Henry II of Navarre">
<text>Henry II (18 April 1503 – 25 May 1555), nicknamed &quot;Sangüesino&quot; because he was born in Sangüesa, was the King of Navarre from 1517. The kingdom had been reduced to a small territory north of the Pyrenees mountains by the Spanish conquest of 1512. Henry succeeded his mother, Queen Catherine, upon her death. His father was her husband and co-ruler, King John III, who died in 1516.

==King of Navarre==
After the failed reconquest attempt of Navarre in 1516, John III died, followed by Catherine I&#x27;s demise in her independent dependencies of Béarn one year later, in 1517. Heir apparent Henry was proclaimed King of Navarre, and was lavishly crowned in Lescar. The title was also claimed by Ferdinand II of Aragon, who had invaded the realm in 1512 and usurped the title, and the claim was continued by his grandson Charles V. Henry II enjoyed the protection of Francis I of France.

Henry II was 13 years old when he became King in February 1517, and his sister Anne of Navarre functioned as his regent until he was 15 and was declared of legal majority on 18 April 1518. As Henry was often absent from Navarre, his sister Anne continued to act as his regent during his absences. 

After ineffectual conferences in Noyon in 1516 and in Montpellier in 1518, an active effort was made in 1521 to establish him in &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty in Pamplona and occupied territory. A French and Navarrese expedition made another attempt at reconquering occupied Navarre, conquered Pamplona in May 1521, but were ultimately repelled by Charles after the Battle of Noain in June 1521.
In 1525, Henry was taken prisoner during the Battle of Pavia, but he managed to escape and in 1526, married Margaret, the sister of King Francis I of France and the widow of Charles, Duke of Alençon. In 1530, after the Treaty of Cambrai between Castile and France, Charles V evacuated the northernmost county (&quot;merindad&quot;) of Navarre, Lower Navarre, allowing Henry to seize it. The Pyrenean border between Lower and Upper Navarre now constitutes the Franco-Spanish border in this sector.

Henry had some strong sympathy with the Huguenots, and was fluent in both French and Spanish, according to the seigneur de Brantôme. He died at Hagetmau on 25 May 1555.

==Marriage==
In 1526, he married Margaret of Angoulême, who became known as Marguerite de Navarre (11 April 1492 – 21 December 1549) and had issue:
* Jeanne III of Navarre (16 November 1528 – 9 June 1572); mother of Henry IV of France
* John (7 July 1530 – 25 December 1530)

<text>Black Flag is the oldest insecticide brand in the United States. Established in 1833, Black Flag makes a variety of products designed for killing and controlling insects and other arthropods including ants, cockroaches, spiders, fleas, flies, yellowjackets, wasps, bees, hornets, and scorpions.
Black Flag also makes a series of pesticide-free insect traps, under the &quot;Motel&quot; brand, including its Roach Motel, Fly Motel, and Yellow Jacket Motel. The common slogan for all of these is that the insects thus trapped &quot;check in, but they don&#x27;t check out.&quot; The traps are disposable and are meant to be discarded once full.

In 2011, Black Flag was purchased by Spectrum Brands.

<doc id="149462" wikidata="Q12015622" url="?curid=149462" title="Marrella">
<text>Marrella is an extinct genus of marrellomorph arthropod known from the Middle Cambrian of North America and Asia. It is the most common animal represented in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada, with tens of thousands of specimens collected. Much rarer remains are also known from deposits in China.

==History==
&quot;Marrella&quot; was the first fossil collected by Charles Doolittle Walcott from the Burgess Shale, in 1909. Walcott described &quot;Marrella&quot; informally as a &quot;lace crab&quot; and described it more formally as an odd trilobite. It was later reassigned to the now defunct class Trilobitoidea in the &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot;. In 1971, Whittington undertook a thorough redescription of the animal and, on the basis of its legs, gills and head appendages, concluded that it was neither a trilobite, nor a chelicerate, nor a crustacean.

&quot;Marrella&quot; is one of several unique arthropod-like organisms found in the Burgess Shale. Other examples are &quot;Opabinia&quot; and &quot;Yohoia&quot;. The unusual and varied characteristics of these creatures were startling at the time of discovery. The fossils, when described, helped to demonstrate that the soft-bodied Burgess fauna was more complex and diverse than had previously been anticipated.

==Morphology==

Specimens of &quot;Marrella&quot; range from in length. The head shield had two pairs of long posteriorly curved projections/spines, the posterior pair of which had a serrated keel. There is no evidence of eyes. On the underside of the head was a pair of long and sweeping flexible antennae, composed of about total 30 segments, projecting forward at an angle of 15 to 30 degrees away from the midline. On part of the antennae, the joints between segments bear setae. Behind and slightly above the antennae attached a pair of short and stout paddle-like swimming appendages, composed of one long basal segment and five shorter segments, the edges of the latter of which were fringed with setae (hair-like structures).

The body had a minimum of 17 segments (tagma), increasing to over 26 segments in larger specimens, each with a pair of biramous (two-branched) appendages. The lower branches of each appendage (the endopod) were elongate and leg-like with 5 segments/podomeres excluding the basal segment/basipod, with the terminal segments being tipped with claws. The endopods sequentially decreased in size posteriorly, with the size reduction accelerating beyond the 9th pair. The upper branch (the exopod), which functioned as gill was segmented and bore thin filamentous structures. There is a tiny, button-like telson at the end of the thorax.

A 1998 paper suggested that striations present on the front projection of well-preserved specimens of &quot;Marrella&quot; represented a diffraction grating pattern, that in life would have resulted in an iridescent sheen. However the conclusions of the paper regarding other animals with supposed iridescent diffraction gratings have been questioned by other authors. Dark stains are often present at the posterior regions of specimens, probably representing extruded waste matter or hemolymph. A single specimen caught in the act of ecdysis (moulting) is known, which shows that the exoskeleton split at the front of the shield.

==Ecology==
&quot;Marrella&quot; is likely to have been an active swimmer that swam close to the seafloor (nektobenthic) with its swimming appendages used in a backstroke motion, with the large spines acting as stabilizers, as well as possibly also having a defensive function. They have been suggested to be filter feeders, with food particles sifted out of the water column by the posterior appendages during swimming before being passed forward by the appendages towards the mouth.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Marrella&quot; is placed within the Marrellida clade of the Marrellomorpha, a group of arthropods with uncertain affinities known from the Cambrian to Devonian. Within the Marrellida, is it placed as the most basal known member of the group. Cladogram of Marrellida after Moysiuk et al. 2022 

==Occurrence==
Marrella is the most abundant genus in the Burgess Shale. Most &quot;Marrella&quot; specimens herald from the &#x27;Marrella bed&#x27;, a thin horizon, but it is common in most other outcrops of the shale. Over 25,000 specimens have been collected. 5028 specimens of &quot;Marrella&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 9.56% of the community.

A few dozen specimens of an indeterminate species of &quot;Marrella&quot; have been reported from the Kaili Formation of Yunnan, China, dating to the Wuliuan stage of the Cambrian. A single fragmentary specimen of an indeterminate species is also known from the Balang Formation of Yunnan, China, dating to Cambrian Stage 4. Both deposits are earlier than the Burgess Shale.

<doc id="149463" wikidata="Q181322" url="?curid=149463" title="Insecticide">
<text>Insecticides are pesticides used to kill insects. They include ovicides and larvicides used against insect eggs and larvae, respectively. The major use of insecticides is in agriculture, but they are also used in home and garden settings, industrial buildings, for vector control, and control of insect parasites of animals and humans.

Acaricides, which kill mites and ticks, are not strictly insecticides, but are usually classified together with insecticides. Some insecticides (including common bug sprays) are effective against other non-insect arthropods as well, such as scorpions, spiders, etc. Insecticides are distinct from insect repellents, which repel but do not kill. 

== Sales ==
In 2016 insecticides were estimated to account for 18% of worldwide pesticide sales. Worldwide sales of insecticides in 2018 were estimated as $ 18.4 billion, of which 25% were neonicotinoids, 17% were pyrethroids, 13% were diamides, and the rest were many other classes which sold for less than 10% each of the market.

==Synthetic insecticides==
Insecticides are most usefully categorised according to their modes of action. The insecticide resistance action committee (IRAC) lists 30 modes of action plus unknowns. There can be several chemical classes of insecticide with the same mode or action. IRAC lists 56 chemical classes plus unknowns.

The mode of action describes how the insecticide kills or inactivates a pest.

=== Development ===
Insecticides with systemic activity against sucking pests, which are safe to pollinators, are sought after, particularly in view of the partial bans on neonicotinoids. Revised 2023 guidance by registration authorities describes the bee testing that is required for new insecticides to be approved for commercial use.

=== Systemicity and translocation ===
Insecticides may be systemic or non-systemic (contact insecticides). Systemic insecticides penetrate into the plant and move (translocate) inside the plant. Translocation may be upward in the xylem, or downward in the phloem or both. Systemicity is a prerequisite for the pesticide to be used as a seed-treatment. Contact insecticides (non-systemic insecticides) remain on the leaf surface and act through direct contact with the insect.

Insects feed from various compartments in the plant. Most of the major pests are either chewing insects or sucking insects. Chewing insects, such as caterpillars, eat whole pieces of leaf. Sucking insects use feeding tubes to feed from phloem (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers, scales and whiteflies), or to suck cell contents (e.g. thrips and mites). An insecticide is more effective if it is in the compartment the insect feeds from. The physicochemical properties of the insecticide determine how it is distributed throughout the plant.

=== Organochlorides ===
The best known organochloride, DDT, was created by Swiss scientist Paul Müller. For this discovery, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. DDT was introduced in 1944. It functions by opening sodium channels in the insect&#x27;s nerve cells. The contemporaneous rise of the chemical industry facilitated large-scale production of chlorinated hydrocarbons including various cyclodiene and hexachlorocyclohexane compounds. Although commonly used in the past, many older chemicals have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects (&quot;e.g.&quot; DDT, chlordane, and toxaphene).

=== Organophosphates ===
Organophosphates are another large class of contact insecticides. These also target the insect&#x27;s nervous system. Organophosphates interfere with the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases, causing an increase in synaptic acetylcholine and overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, killing or disabling the insect. Organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (such as sarin, tabun, soman, and VX) have the same mechanism of action. Organophosphates have a cumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity. In the US, organophosphate use declined with the rise of substitutes. Many of these insecticides, first developed in the mid 20th century, are very poisonous. Many organophosphates do not persist in the environment.

=== Carbamates ===
Carbamate insecticides have similar mechanisms to organophosphates, but have a much shorter duration of action and are somewhat less toxic.

=== Pyrethroids ===
Pyrethroid insecticides mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound pyrethrin, the biopesticide found in &quot;Pyrethrum&quot; (Now &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; and &quot;Tanacetum&quot;) species. They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment. These compounds are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators and are less toxic than organophosphates and carbamates. Compounds in this group are often applied against household pests. Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.

=== Neonicotinoids ===
Neonicotinoids are a class of neuro-active insecticides chemically similar to nicotine.(with much lower acute mammalian toxicity and greater field persistence). These chemicals are acetylcholine receptor agonists. They are broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, with rapid action (minutes-hours). They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and soil treatments. Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, stylet withdrawal (aphids), disoriented movement, paralysis and death.Imidacloprid, of the neonicotinoid family, is the most widely used insecticide in the world. In the late 1990s neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impact and were linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids. and its potential to increase the susceptibility of rice to planthopper attacks.

=== Phenylpyrazoles ===
Phenylpyrazole insecticides, such as fipronil are a class of synthetic insecticides that operate by interfering with GABA receptors.

=== Butenolides ===
Butenolide pesticides are a novel group of chemicals, similar to neonicotinoids in their mode of action, that have so far only one representative: flupyradifurone. They are acetylcholine receptor agonists, like neonicotinoids, but with a different pharmacophore. They are broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, applied as sprays, drenches, seed and soil treatments. Although the classic risk assessment considered this insecticide group (and flupyradifurone specifically) safe for bees, novel research has raised concern on their lethal and sublethal effects, alone or in combination with other chemicals or environmental factors.

=== Diamides ===
Diamides selectively activate insect ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are large calcium release channels present in cardiac and skeletal muscle, leading to the loss of calcium crucial for biological processes. This causes insects to act lethargic, stop feeding, and eventually die. The first insecticide from this class to be registered was flubendiamide.

=== Insect growth regulators ===
Insect growth regulator (IGR) is a term coined to include insect hormone mimics and an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit chitin (exoskeleton) biosynthesis in insects Diflubenzuron is a member of the latter class, used primarily to control caterpillars that are pests. Of these, methoprene is most widely used. It has no observable acute toxicity in rats and is approved by World Health Organization (WHO) for use in drinking water cisterns to combat malaria. Most of its uses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including mosquitoes, several fly species, and fleas. Two very similar products, hydroprene and kinoprene, are used for controlling species such as cockroaches and white flies. Methoprene was registered with the EPA in 1975. Virtually no reports of resistance have been filed. A more recent type of IGR is the ecdysone agonist tebufenozide (MIMIC), which is used in forestry and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects than other insect orders.

==Biological pesticides==

===Definition===
The EU defines biopesticides as &quot;a form of pesticide based on micro-organisms or natural products&quot;. The US EPA defines biopesticides as “certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals”. Microorganisms that control pests may also be categorised as biological pest control agents together with larger organisms such as parasitic insects, entomopathic nematodes etc. Natural products may also be categorised as chemical insecticides.

The US EPA describes three types of biopesticide. Biochemical pesticides (meaning bio-derived chemicals), which are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms. Microbial pesticides consisting of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient. Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant (thus producing transgenic crops).

===Market===
The global bio-insecticide market was estimated to be less than 10% of the total insecticide market. The bio-insecticide market is dominated by microbials. The bio-insecticide market is growing more that 10% yearly, which is a higher growth than the total insecticide market, mainly due to the increase in organic farming and IPM, and also due to benevolent government policies.

Biopesticides are regarded by the US and European authorities as posing fewer risks of environmental and mammalian toxicity. Biopesticides are more than 10 x (often 100 x) cheaper and 3 x faster to register than synthetic pesticides.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
There is a wide variety of biological insecticides with differing attributes, but in general the following has been described.

They are easier, faster and cheaper to register, usually with lower mammalian toxicity. They are more specific, and thus preserve beneficial insects and biodiversity in general. This makes them compatible with IPM regimes. They degrade rapidly cause less impact on the environment. They have a shorter withholding period.

The spectrum of control is narrow. They are less effective and prone to adverse ambient conditions. They degrade rapidly and are thus less persistent. They are slower to act. They are more expensive, have a shorter shelf-life, and are more difficult to source. They require more specialised knowledge to use.

===Plant extracts===
Most or all plants produce chemical insecticides to stop insects eating them. Extracts and purified chemicals from thousands of plants have been shown to be insecticidal, however only a few are used in agriculture. In the USA 13 are registered for use, in the EU 6. In Korea, where it is easier to register botanical pesticides, 38 are used. Most used are neem oil, chenopodium, pyrethrins, and azadirachtin. Many botanical insecticides used in past decades (e.g. rotenone, nicotine, ryanodine) have been banned because of their toxicity.

=== Genetically modified crops ===
The first transgenic crop, which incorporated an insecticidal PIP, contained a gene for the CRY toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) and was introduced in 1997. For the next ca 25 years the only insecticidal agents used in GMOs were the CRY and VIP toxins from various strains of B.t, which control a wide number of insect types. These are widely used with &gt; 100 million hectares planted with B.t. modified crops in 2019. Since 2020 several novel agents have been engineered into plants and approved.  ipd072Aa from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, ipd079Ea from Ophioglossum pendulum, and mpp75Aa1.1 from Brevibacillus laterosporus code for protein toxins. The trait dvsnf7 is an RNAi agent consisting of a double-stranded RNA transcript containing a 240 bp fragment of the WCR Snf7 gene of the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera).

=== RNA interference ===
RNA interference (RNAi) uses segments of RNA to fatally silence crucial insect genes. In 2024 two uses of RNAi have been registered by the authorities for use: Genetic modification of a crop to introduce a gene coding for an RNAi fragment, and spraying double stranded RNA fragments onto a field. Monsanto introduced the trait DvSnf7 which expresses a double-stranded RNA transcript containing a 240 bp fragment of the WCR Snf7 gene of the Western Corn Rootworm. GreenLight Biosciences introduced Ledprona, a formulation of double stranded RNA as a spray for potato fields. It targets the essential gene for proteasome subunit beta type-5 (PSMB5) in the Colorado potato beetle.

=== Spider toxins ===
Spider venoms contain many, often hundreds, of insecticidally active toxins. Many are proteins that attack the nervous system of the insect. Vestaron introduced for agricultural use a spray formulation of GS-omega/kappa-Hxtx-Hv1a (HXTX), derived from the venom of the Australian blue mountain funnel web spider (Hadronyche versuta). HXTX acts by allosterically (site II) modifying the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (IRAC group 32).

=== Entomopathic bacteria ===
Entomopathic bacteria can be mass-produced. The most widely used is &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (B.t.), used since decades. There are several strains used with different applications against lepidoptera, coleoptera and diptera. Also used are Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Burkholderia spp, and Wolbachia pipientis. Avermectins and spinosyns are bacterial metabolites, mass-produced by fermentation and used as insecticides. The toxins from &quot;B.t.&quot; have been incorporated into plants through genetic engineering.

=== Entomopathic fungi ===
Entomopathic fungi have been used since 1965 for agricultural use. Hundreds of strains are now in use. They often kill a broad range of insect species. Most strains are from Beauveria, Metarhizium, Cordyceps and Akanthomyces species.

=== Entomopathic viruses ===
Of the many types of entomopathic viruses, only baculaviruses are used commercially, and are each specific for their target insect. They have to be grown on insects, so their production is labour-intensive.

== Environmental toxicity==

=== Effects on nontarget species ===

Some insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill. For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake an insecticide granule on the ground for food and eat it. Sprayed insecticide may drift from the area to which it is applied and into wildlife areas, especially when it is sprayed aerially.

=== Persistence in the environment and accumulation in the food chain ===
DDT was the first organic insecticide. It was introduced during WW2, and was widely used. One use was vector control and it was sprayed on open water. It degrades slowly in the environment, and it is lipophilic (fat soluble). It became the first global pollutant, and the first pollutant to accumulate and magnify in the food chain. During the 1950s and 1960s these very undesirable side effects were recognized, and after some often contentious discussion, DDT was banned in many countries in the 1960s and 1970s. Finally in 2001 DDT and all other persistent insecticides were banned via the Stockholm Convention. Since many decades the authorities require new insecticides to degrade in the environment and not to bioaccumulate.

=== Runoff and percolation ===
Solid bait and liquid insecticides, especially if improperly applied in a location, get moved by water flow. Often, this happens through nonpoint sources where runoff carries insecticides in to larger bodies of water. As snow melts and rainfall moves over and through the ground, the water picks applied insecticides and deposits them in to larger bodies of water, rivers, wetlands, underground sources of previously potable water, and percolates in to watersheds. This runoff and percolation of insecticides can effect the quality of water sources, harming the natural ecology and thus, indirectly effect human populations through biomagnification and bioaccumulation.

=== Insect decline ===

Both number of insects and number of insect species have declined dramatically and continuously over past decades, causing much concern. Many causes are proposed to contribute to this decline, the most agreed upon are loss of habitat, intensification of farming practices, and insecticide usage. Domestic bees were declining some years ago but population and number of colonies have now risen both in the USA and worldwide. Wild species of bees are still declining.

=== Bird decline ===
Besides the effects of direct consumption of insecticides, populations of insectivorous birds decline due to the collapse of their prey populations. Spraying of especially wheat and corn in Europe is believed to have caused an 80 per cent decline in flying insects, which in turn has reduced local bird populations by one to two thirds.

== Alternatives ==
Instead of using chemical insecticides to avoid crop damage caused by insects, there are many alternative options available now that can protect farmers from major economic losses. Some of them are:

# Breeding crops resistant, or at least less susceptible, to pest attacks.
# Releasing predators, parasitoids, or pathogens to control pest populations as a form of biological control.
# Chemical control like releasing pheromones into the field to confuse the insects into not being able to find mates and reproduce.
# Integrated Pest Management: using multiple techniques in tandem to achieve optimal results.
# Push-pull technique: intercropping with a &quot;push&quot; crop that repels the pest, and planting a &quot;pull&quot; crop on the boundary that attracts and traps it.

<text>The House of Albret, which derives its name from the lordship (&quot;seigneurie&quot;) of Albret (Labrit), situated in the Landes, was one of the most powerful feudal families of France and Navarre during the Middle Ages.

==History==
The work of Anthony M. H. J. Stokvis establishes the genealogy of the Albrets to start with the 800s AD Basque nobleman Jimeno of Pamplona, patriarch of the Spanish Jiménez dynasty. Members of the House of Albret distinguished themselves during the major local wars of that era. During the 14th century they espoused the English cause for some time, afterwards transferring their support to the side of France.

Arnaud Amanieu I, Lord of Albret, helped to take Guienne from the English. His son Charles became constable of France, and was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.
At that time the House of Albret had attained considerable territorial importance, due in great part to the liberal grants which it had obtained from successive kings of France.

The House of Albret then continued its ascension, favored by both Charles VI and Charles VII. It reached its apogee in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They familiarized themselves with the court of France through their alliances. In 1470, they inherited the County of Périgord and the Viscounty of Limoges. Their new strength then allowed them to claim the inheritance of the Duchy of Brittany.

Alain the Great, Lord of Albret (died 1522), wished to marry Anne of Brittany, and to that end fought against Charles VIII; but his hopes being ended by the betrothal of Anne to Maximilian of Austria, he surrendered Nantes to the French in 1486.

They took possession of the county of Foix, when Jean I of Albret, son of Alain, became King of Navarre by his marriage with Catherine of Foix, Queen of Navarre in 1484. Their son Henry II, King of Navarre, was created Duke of Albret and a peer of France in 1550. By his wife Marguerite d&#x27;Angoulême, sister of Francis I, Henry II had a daughter, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, Queen of Navarre, who married Anthony de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, and became the mother of Henry IV, King of France.

These new possessions (Bearne, Foix, Bigorra, Tartas, Castres, Dreux, etc.) gave them a real political role in the Renaissance century. 
However, the Albrets did not stay long at the top of the society of orders. Navarre was invaded by Spain in 1512, and the house of Albret kept only the small part on the French side of the Pyrenees (Lower-Navarre), and Joan of Albret is the last of her name to sit on the throne, because the Dukedom of Albret, was united to the crown of France by the accession of the crown prince.

The title of Duke of Albret was later granted to the family of La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne (see duc de Bouillon) in 1651, in exchange for Sedan and Raucourt.

A cadet of this house was , seigneur of Orval, count of Dreux and of Rethel, governor of Champagne (died 1524), who was employed by Francis I in many diplomatic negotiations, more particularly in his intrigues to get himself elected emperor in 1519.

Notable descendants include the Kings of Navarre (basque region), French-Mexican politicians, and Luis Ruben de Valadéz (née Valadez-Hernandez II) from the marriage of Carlos Beaumont de Navarre, Count of Beaumont and Ana de Curton d&#x27;Albret, Dame of Curton and Guiche.

<text>This is a list of flags which are entirely or largely black.

==In history==

* The Black Banner or Black Standard used by Abu Muslim in his uprising leading to the Abbasid Revolution in 747.
* During the German Peasants&#x27; War in the 16th century, the white, black and pink flag was used by the revolting farmers.
*Afghanistan flew a solid black flag from 1709 to 1738 and from 1880 to 1901 (see Flag of Afghanistan).
* The black flag with the motto &quot;Viurem lliures o morirem&quot; (We live free or we will die) was flown by Catalan army and militia corps during the final stages of the War of the Spanish Succession, when the Allies had already abandoned Catalonia that fought alone against the Spanish and French armies during 1713–1714. This black flag was packaged in 2012 with the historical novel &quot; Lliures o Morts&quot; (Free or Dead) authored by Jaume Clotet and David de Montserrat.
* The Anarchist black flag has been an anarchist symbol since the 1880s. Anarchists use either a plain black flag or a black flag with an &quot;A&quot; and an &quot;O&quot; around it, this symbol is a reference to a Proudhon quote &quot;Anarchy is Order Without Power&quot;. Since the Spanish Revolution of 1936, the diagonal red-and-black flag became more widely used.
* The color black was famous as the flag of Italy&#x27;s National Fascist Party, designed after the party&#x27;s paramilitary Blackshirts. The Blackshirts had chosen this color to recall the Arditi, the elite Italian special forces of World War I, whose flag featured a skull with a dagger in its teeth against a black field.
* Schutzstaffel used black flag with double sig runes.
* Upon the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II German U-boats were ordered to fly a black flag and sail to an Allied port and surrender.

* The Jolly Roger, or skull and crossbones, is flown to identify a ship&#x27;s crew as pirates about to attack. The flag most commonly identified as the Jolly Roger today is the skull and crossbones (although swords are also common), a flag consisting of a human skull above two long bones (probably tibias) set in an x-mark arrangement, most usually depicted crossing each other directly under the skull, on a black field. This design was used by several pirates, including Captains &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy, Edward England, and John Taylor. Some Jolly Roger flags also include an hourglass, another common symbol representing death in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. Despite the prominence of flags with art in popular culture, plain black flags with no art were often employed by most pirates in the 17th–18th century. Historically, the flag was flown to frighten the pirates&#x27; victims into surrendering without a fight, since it conveyed the message that the attackers were outlaws who would not consider themselves bound by the usual rules of engagement—and might, therefore, slaughter those they defeated (since captured pirates were usually hanged, they did not have much to gain by asking quarter if defeated). Since the decline of piracy, various military units have used the Jolly Roger, usually in skull-and-crossbones design, as a unit identification insignia or a victory flag to ascribe to themselves the proverbial ferocity and toughness of pirates. In a non-naval context the skull and crossbones motif has additional meanings, for example, to signify a hazard such as poison.
* The Ahmadiyya flag, first designed in the 1930s during the second Caliphate. Just as the black colour absorbs visible light, similarly the black colour symbolizes the absorption of spiritual light.
* The flag of the Chetnik movement in Serbia and former Yugoslavia during the 20th century, with the words &quot;&quot;Sloboda ili smrt&quot; (&#x27;liberty or death&#x27;) inscribed in white under a skull.
* The flags of the Makhnovshchina and Kholodnyi Yar Republic during the Ukrainian War of Independence (1917-1921).
* The National League of Families POW/MIA flag was adopted in 1972 and represents support for U.S. Vietnam War soldiers, airmen, and sailors, especially those captured by the enemy.

===Jihadism in the 20th/21st century===

In Ali Soufan&#x27;s book &quot;The Black Banners&quot;, he explains the title by noting that quotes from various Hadiths regarding &quot;Black Banners&quot; of a &quot;new army&quot; taking over Khorasan have some kind of prophetic significance with many modern adherents of extremist jihadism. He notes that it is &quot;not a coincidence&quot; that Osama bin Laden made al-Qaeda&#x27;s flag black. Soufan also notes that there is debate about whether the prophet Mohammed actually spoke some of the quoted Hadiths (such as one attributed to Abu Hurairah). He also notes that Sheikh Salman al-Ouda has said the Black Banner hadiths are not able to be authenticated.

==In society==


* Black flags are often associated with funerals in the West, particularly state funerals and public mourning. In the former Yugoslavia, a plain black flag is the flag of mourning. It is displayed for 40 days after death on the deceased person&#x27;s house.
* The black flag is the symbol of the Jewish ultra-Orthodox, anti-Zionist group, Neturei Karta. It is flown as a sign of mourning over the creation of the State of Israel, most commonly on Israeli Independence Day.
* The Swedish Pirate Party has a black flag as a symbol, shaped like the letter P.
* In the German and Finnish militaries, black has been the traditional color of armored troops, which carries over to the flags of armored units. In Finland, also combat engineers have a black flag. The Armoured Brigade has a black flag defaced with a helmet, and engineer battalions have the black flags defaced with various symbols.
* The New Zealand Rugby Union team, commonly known as the All Blacks, have a predominantly black flag with a white fern superimposed: see List of New Zealand flags.
* The flag of Cornwall is mostly black with a white cross on it.

==As a signal in competitions and sports==
The black flag is a racing flag used to signal a driver&#x27;s disqualification. In sail racing, when the black flag is displayed with the preparatory signal, a boat that is over the starting line in the minute before the starting signal is immediately disqualified without a hearing. In some forms of racing, a black flag is used to disqualify competitors or indicate some other penalty (such as a forced pit stop in NASCAR).

==Fictional black flags==
In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and other Middle-earth writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, the banner of the evil overlord Morgoth is described as being entirely black with no insignia. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; set several thousand years subsequently, the good Dúnedain bore a flag with solid black background as their royal standard, charged in silver with depictions of heirlooms from the founding of Gondor and Arnor including the Palantiri and the White Tree.

<doc id="149467" wikidata="Q474959" url="?curid=149467" title="Myalgia">
<text>Myalgia or muscle pain is a painful sensation evolving from muscle tissue. It is a symptom of many diseases. The most common cause of acute myalgia is the overuse of a muscle or group of muscles; another likely cause is viral infection, especially when there has been no injury.

Long-lasting myalgia can be caused by metabolic myopathy, some nutritional deficiencies, ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome.

==Causes==
The most common causes of myalgia are overuse, injury, and strain. Myalgia might also be caused by allergies, diseases, medications, or as a response to a vaccination. Dehydration at times results in muscle pain as well, especially for people involved in extensive physical activities such as workout.

Muscle pain is also a common symptom in a variety of diseases, including infectious diseases, such as influenza, muscle abscesses, Lyme disease, malaria, trichinosis or poliomyelitis; autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome or polymyositis; gastrointestinal diseases, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (which can also occur without digestive symptoms) and inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis).

The most common causes are: 
===Overuse===
Overuse of a muscle is using it too much, too soon or too often. One example is repetitive strain injury. See also:
* Exercise
* Weight lifting

====Injury====
The most common causes of myalgia by injury are: sprains and strains.

===Autoimmune===
* Multiple sclerosis (neurologic pain interpreted as muscular)
* Myositis
* Mixed connective tissue disease
* Lupus erythematosus
* Fibromyalgia syndrome
* Familial Mediterranean fever
* Polyarteritis nodosa
* Devic&#x27;s disease
* Morphea
* Sarcoidosis

===Metabolic defect===
* Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency
* Conn&#x27;s syndrome
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Hyperthyroidism
* Hypothyroidism
* Diabetes
* Hypogonadism
* Postorgasmic illness syndrome

===Other===
* Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
* Channelopathy
* Ehlers Danlos Syndrome
* Stickler Syndrome
* Hypokalemia
* Hypotonia
* Exercise intolerance
* Mastocytosis
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Eosinophilia myalgia syndrome
* Barcoo Fever
* Herpes
* Hemochromatosis
* Delayed onset muscle soreness
* HIV/AIDS
* Generalized anxiety disorder
* Tumor-induced osteomalacia
* Hypovitaminosis D
* Infarction

===Withdrawal syndrome from certain drugs===
Sudden cessation of high-dose corticosteroids, opioids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, caffeine, or alcohol can induce myalgia.

==Treatment==
When the cause of myalgia is unknown, it should be treated symptomatically. Common treatments include heat, rest, paracetamol, NSAIDs, massage, cryotherapy and muscle relaxants.

* Arthralgia
* Myopathy
* Myositis

<doc id="149469" wikidata="Q299650" url="?curid=149469" title="John V of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; John V (; 22 October 1689 – 31 July 1750), known as the Magnanimous (&quot;o Magnânimo&quot;) and the Portuguese Sun King (&quot;o Rei-Sol Português&quot;), was King of Portugal from 9 December 1706 until his death in 1750. His reign saw the rise of Portugal and its monarchy to new levels of prosperity, wealth, and prestige among European courts.

John V&#x27;s reign saw an enormous influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the royal fifth (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the Portuguese colonies of Brazil and Maranhão. John spent lavishly on ambitious architectural works, most notably Mafra Palace, and on commissions and additions for his sizable art and literary collections. Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition, John also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe, the most famous being those he sent to Paris in 1715 and Rome in 1716.

Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V ruled as an absolute monarch. In keeping with a traditional policy pursued by previous monarchs of the House of Braganza which stressed the importance of good relations with Europe, John&#x27;s reign was marked by numerous interventions into the affairs of other European states, most notably as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. On the imperial front, John V pursued an expansionist policy, with significant territorial gains in Portuguese India and Portuguese America.

John V was a very pious man who devoted large parts of his day to prayer and religious study. He rewarded his long-awaited recognition as a lawful monarch by Pope Benedict XIV with a fervent devotion to the Catholic Church and some very large donations to the Holy See. The Pope granted John V the style &quot;Most Faithful Majesty,&quot; which appealed to him greatly. However, John&#x27;s relationship with the papacy varied at different periods in his reign; there were both close relations and conflicts at different times during the reigns of five different popes.

== Early life ==

John was born on 22 October 1689 at Ribeira Palace in Lisbon as the second son of King Peter II and Maria Sophia of Neuburg. He was baptized on 19 November at the Royal Palace Chapel and given the full name John Francis Anthony Joseph Benedict Bernard (&quot;João Francisco António José Bento Bernardo&quot;). The King and Queen had had a son the previous year, another John, but the prince had died a few weeks after his birth. The court was thus overjoyed to have a new male heir to the kingdom. Upon his baptism, John was not given the traditional titles of the heir apparent to the Portuguese throne, Prince of Brazil and Duke of Braganza, but merely the default title Infante of Portugal. This was intended as a sign of respect for his elder brother&#x27;s death.

=== Education ===
John had a stimulating upbringing surrounded by some of the most brilliant minds of Europe at the time. It was agreed by the court that John&#x27;s care as a child was to be strictly run by women only, a custom of the Portuguese court and the Portuguese nobility as a whole. John&#x27;s governess was Maria de Lencastre, Marchioness of Unhão. She was given the position more for her beauty and status than for her suitability as a carer. The Marchioness was later governess for John&#x27;s younger brothers Francisco, António, and Manuel.

The policies that John&#x27;s father had pursued made the Portuguese court wealthy, the national economy stable, and the imperial military strong. This made a richly varied and interesting childhood possible for John. As a child, he was under the tutelage and heavy influence of the Jesuit Fathers Francisco da Cruz, João Seco, and Luís Gonzaga. Father Luís Gonzaga was in charge of the education of all of King Peter&#x27;s children; he taught them military education, politics, astronomy, nautical studies, mathematics, and history. As John grew up, he was mentored in political affairs by Luís da Cunha, a prominent Portuguese diplomat.

=== Maturity ===

When John reached the age of seven, his father determined that his eldest sons were sufficiently educated in basic subjects and decided to take over supervision of their instruction himself, though his interest in mentoring them quickly faded. This was formalised when he and his brother Francisco were admitted into the Order of Christ on 7 April 1696. Later that year, the King finally decided to confer on John the titles of the heir apparent, namely Prince of Brazil and Duke of Braganza. On 1 December 1696, on the anniversary of the Portuguese Restoration War of 1640, a grand ceremony was held in which John was invested with his titles. The ceremony involved the placing of a large ermine and red velvet mantle on his shoulders, as well as the adornment of his person with various jewels and royal regalia.

Just over a month before John&#x27;s tenth birthday in 1699, his mother Queen Maria Sofia died at the age of 33. This caused John to retreat from court and become depressed for many months. His aunt Catherine of Braganza, the former queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland, then took control of his education. She resided in the palace she had built, Bemposta Palace, and remained John&#x27;s main tutor and female role model until her death in 1705.

In April 1700, John fell terribly ill; it was assumed that he was on his death bed. Fearing his imminent demise, he asked for his last rites and confessed his sins. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, he rallied and soon returned to his normal activities, his complete recovery being considered a miracle by the court.

John was greatly saddened by the death of his sister Teresa Maria in February 1704. Her death caused John to avoid appearing at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John&#x27;s younger brother Manuel. During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression. In May of that year, he eventually returned to the court and reconciled with the King, saying that his &quot;saudade&quot; for his sister would not get in the way of his performing his duty to the King.

== Succession ==

In early December 1706, King Peter II moved himself to the Royal Quinta in Alcântara, as he was growing ill and needed space from the court. On the fifth of that month, the King caught a high fever, and the court doctors met to examine him fully. They determined his health was greatly deteriorating. The next day, Peter called all of his children to his bedside and told them of his coming demise. He appointed John as prince regent of the kingdom and asked that all of his children follow John&#x27;s wishes. The King still favoured his youngest son, Manuel, and he gave Manuel a special gift that none of his other children received.

=== Acclamation ===
Peter II died in his sleep on 9 December 1706. Following his death, Ribeira Palace was redecorated as a reflection of the mourning. On the façade towards the Terreiro do Paço, large black banners were hung from the windows for this purpose. A month later, the time was declared to be appropriate for John to be acclaimed king. Preparations for John&#x27;s acclamation had already been started and once allowed, the royal palace was redecorated; the black banners were replaced with red ones, and fruit wreaths were hung throughout all of the palace.

On the day of John&#x27;s acclamation, 1 January 1707, his new throne was placed on the balcony of the &quot;Torre do Rei&quot; (Tower of the King) of Ribeira Palace. Specially-made tapestries illustrating the allegories of Justice and Prudence were hung high above the Terreiro do Paço to remind the public that these were the traits their king would have. Once John sat down on his throne, wreaths made of gold were laid around the throne and balcony. Wearing his Cross of the Order of Christ, and with the Portuguese Crown Jewels beside him, and not on him, as was the Portuguese royal custom, John was acclaimed &quot;His Majesty, by the Grace of God, King of Portugal and the Algarves, before and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India, our Lord, John, the fifth of that name in the table of the Kings of Portugal.&quot;

John was now king of an empire that stretched four continents. He was also the head of state of a kingdom that was at war with Spain and France. His first regnal act was to renew Portugal&#x27;s membership in the League of Augsburg and continue in the war alongside the English and the Habsburgs. Portugal quickly supplied more troops to aid her allies in the war. This new level of Portuguese involvement allowed John&#x27;s general, António Luís de Sousa, Marquis of Minas, to capture Madrid on 28 June 1706. While Portugal put vast resources into the war, contrary to John&#x27;s predecessors, who avoided conflicts in Europe, activity in the war soon lost the interest of the King, who had more pressing affairs to attend to.

=== Marriage ===

During his life, Peter II had worked a long time to secure John a marriage with an Austrian archduchess in order to guarantee Portugal&#x27;s alliance with the Habsburgs. John continued these negotiations and finally succeeded in negotiating a deal. On 27 June 1707, Fernão Teles da Silva, Count of Vilar Maior, signed a marriage contract with Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I that made official a match between John and the emperor&#x27;s sister, the Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria, who was John&#x27;s first cousin: their mothers were sisters. The contract also set the archduchess&#x27;s dowry at 100,000 crowns, a vast sum for the day.

The armada that Portugal sent to escort Maria Anna from the Low Countries to Lisbon arrived in the Tagus river estuary on 26 October 1708. The flagship, in which Maria Anna travelled, berthed at the docks of the private garden of Ribeira Palace, where John and a party of the kingdom&#x27;s richest and most powerful nobles met the new queen for the first time. The marriage celebrations lasted until 27 December; they were sumptuous and very costly.

By late 1710, John and Maria Anna had not produced an heir to the throne. It had been two years since the couple had been married, and the court was starting to question the future of the House of Braganza. In early 1711, the King met with Franciscan Cardinal Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde, High Inquisitor of the Portuguese Inquisition, who told him that if he promised God to build a Franciscan convent in Mafra, God would deliver his long desired heir. Accordingly, John promised such a convent if Maria Anna became pregnant before the end of 1711. John&#x27;s wish would come true later that year when Maria Anna gave birth to a daughter, Maria Barbara, on 4 December 1711.

John and Maria Anna had a successful marriage, but lived largely separate lives. Maria Anna devoted herself to preserving the decorum of the royal court and her own religious interests, while John concerned himself with whatever pleased him at the moment. John kept many mistresses throughout his royal career, including Filipa de Noronha, Paula de Odivelas, Luísa Inês Antónia Machado Monteiro, Madalena Máxima de Miranda, Inácia Rosa de Távora, and Luísa Clara de Portugal.

=== Offspring ===

Maria Barbara&#x27;s birth was followed by the birth of Pedro, Prince of Brazil, on 19 October 1712, which temporarily gave John a male heir. Prince Pedro&#x27;s death on 29 October 1714 greatly saddened the King, but he took solace in the fact that his son Joseph (now Prince of Brazil) had been born on June 6 earlier that same year. After Joseph, three more infants were born to John and Maria Anna: Carlos on 2 May 1716, Pedro on 5 July 1717, and Alexandre on 24 September 1723. Only two of their three youngest sons would survive to adulthood, Infante Carlos and Infante Pedro; only Pedro continued the Braganza line.

John&#x27;s children were trained rigorously growing up. His plan was to have an intelligent son who could take his place as king, a strategically married daughter, and well-prepared statesmen sons, but he would achieve only part of his goal. From her birth, Infanta Maria Barbara&#x27;s marriage had been closely arranged and monitored by John. When the engagement of Mariana Victoria of Spain to Louis XV of France was nullified, John proposed Maria Barbara as a possible bride for Louis XV, but in the end she was refused. John still managed to gain something from the dissolution of the engagement between Louis XV and Mariana Victoria: John&#x27;s heir Prince José would be engaged to Mariana Victoria, and Maria Barbara would marry Mariana Victoria&#x27;s older half-brother Prince Don Ferdinand (later King Don Ferdinand VI of Spain). Negotiations between Portugal and Spain began in 1725, and four years later John&#x27;s eldest children would be matched with their spouses-to-be. The infantas Maria Barbara and Mariana Victoria were exchanged at a ceremony, called the Exchange of the Princesses (&quot;Troca das Princesas&quot;), held on the Caia River on 19 January 1729. Prince José married Mariana Victoria on 19 January 1729 in Elvas, and Infanta Maria Barbara married Prince Ferdinand on 20 January 1729 in Badajoz.

None of John&#x27;s three other sons would marry in his lifetime. Infante Alexandre died at the age of five, and Infante Carlos died at the age of twenty without any marriage proposals or children. Only Infante Pedro would live long enough to marry, but John did not live long enough to see it. Pedro married his niece Maria Francisca, Princess of Brazil, on 6 June 1760; she was the daughter of his elder brother, King Dom Joseph I. When Joseph died in 1777, Maria Francisca and Pedro became Queen Dona Maria I and King Dom Pedro III.

John fathered at least four children from various extramarital affairs. António of Braganza by Luísa Inês Antónia Machado Monteiro; Gaspar of Braganza, Archbishop of Braga, by Madalena Máxima de Miranda; José of Braganza, High Inquisitor of Portugal, by Paula de Odivelas; and Maria Rita of Braganza by Luísa Clara de Portugal. António, Gaspar, and José were all recognized as John&#x27;s sons and were collectively known as the Children of Palhavã, after the Palace of Palhavã that belonged to Luís Carlos Inácio Xavier de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Louriçal, where they lived at John&#x27;s expense. The Children of Palhavã received educations worthy of nobility and went on to become noteworthy members of the clergy. Maria Rita was never officially recognized as John&#x27;s daughter, but he informally arranged for her life at the Convent of Santos and managed her expenses. Maria Rita&#x27;s stepfather, Jorge de Meneses, attempted to stop John&#x27;s actions for Maria Rita, but the King had de Meneses exiled to Spain and then to England.

== Regnal politics ==
John reigned as an absolute monarch. Notably, he never convened the Portuguese Cortes, the ancient parliament of the three estates in Portugal, and actively ignored meetings of the Council of State. However, John did not act by himself when making decisions; rather, he frequently consulted a close circle of well-informed advisers and held weekly intimate audiences with members of all three estates, which he preferred to larger institutions, such as the Cortes and the Council of State, which he viewed as incompetent and bloated. The Count of Povolide remarked on John&#x27;s governance style, stating that &quot;he established a predominance of personal consultation over institutional consultation.&quot;

=== Government ===

The highest position in the King&#x27;s government was that of Secretary of State of Portugal, the equivalent of a modern-day prime minister. This position was always filled by a favourite of John, the most notable one Diogo de Mendonça Corte-Real, whom the King consulted with on every matter, to such a degree that it often appeared that he was the King&#x27;s only minister. When John became king, he inherited a powerful and large Council of State made up of numerous bishops, nobles, and bureaucrats, which was charged with being the utmost consultory body to the King, as it was during the reign of John&#x27;s father. However, John&#x27;s dislike of institutions and consultative bodies led him to cease convening the council formally, leading the prominent politician and diplomat Luís da Cunha to refer to the king as a despot and his government as absolutist. The historian A.R. Disney writes of John that he &quot;was an absolutist by conviction and believed secular power and authority emanated by right solely from the king, to whom all other persons and jurisdictions were completely subordinate.&quot;

Although the Council of State was never convened, several of its members were nonetheless close advisers to the King. Alongside Diogo de Mendonça Corte-Real, Cardinal João da Mota e Silva and High-Inquisitor Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde were close advisers to the king, the former eventually substituting Mendonça Corte-Real as Secretary of State when he died in 1736. Though he disbanded most institutions, John notably maintained the Junta of the Three Estates, a governing junta created by John IV (John V&#x27;s grandfather) which managed the finances and maintenance of military installations, troop raising, and taxation related to defense. Having engaged in multiple conflicts throughout his reign, both in Europe and his empire, John V understood the necessity of the junta and carefully picked its members, only selecting those deemed the most knowledgeable and competent. Similarly, he maintained the Council of the Treasury, which managed the finances of Portugal and its empire, including tax collection and budget accounting for the majority of Portugal&#x27;s organizations (except the military), and exerted authority over the Casa da Índia, the Royal Mint, and the custom houses across Portuguese territory.

=== European relations ===

John pursued a generally dovish foreign policy which sought to maintain Portugal&#x27;s neutrality. The main exception to this was Portuguese intervention in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–13); Portugal intervened reluctantly and due to British pressure.

When John ascended the throne, he found himself entangled in the War of the Spanish Succession, as King Peter II had signed the Methuen Treaty in 1703, which aligned Portugal to the Grand Alliance against the House of Bourbon and allowed Grand Alliance forces to launch their invasion of Spain from Portugal. Only months after assuming the throne, John saw his forces overwhelmingly defeated in at the Battle of Almansa, a defeat that jeopardized Portuguese forces in Spain and the outcome of the war. Portuguese forces continued to fight alongside the Grand Alliance until agreeing to an armistice with Spain and France on 8 November 1712. The war finally came to an end in 1713 with the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, whereby Portugal regained possession of territories conquered by the Bourbon coalition and acquired new territories in South America.

With the War of the Spanish Succession ended, John could re-establish relations with the courts of Europe. His first grand act of diplomacy was the dispatch of Luís Manuel da Câmara, 3rd Count of Ribeira Grande, as his ambassador to the court of Louis XIV of France, in early August 1715. The grandson of François, Prince of Soubise, and cousin of Hercule Mériadec, Prince of Guéméné, the Count of Ribeira Grande was personally chosen by John to foster amicable relations with the French court. No expense was spared on the Count&#x27;s triumphal entry into Paris, which cost 100 Louis d&#x27;or and received such great applause from the people of Paris that Alexandre de Gusmão, the Count&#x27;s secretary, stated that &quot;the Count of Ribeira Grande has eternalized the grandness of our generous king.&quot; Although King Louis would die only weeks after the Portuguese embassy&#x27;s arrival to France, the richness and extravagance of its entry to Paris was noted at the French court and across Europe and gained a new level of prestige for John and his kingdom.

As John concerned himself with the presentation of Portugal at the court of Europe from home through the planning and organization of important embassies, the King&#x27;s brother Infante Manuel, Count of Ourém, was similarly raising the name of Portugal throughout Europe. Having left the country in 1715 without the King&#x27;s permission (as was required for royalty and high nobility), Manuel traveled throughout Europe, staying with Portuguese ambassadors and nobles across the continent, causing quite a fanfare. The King was displeased that Manuel left without permission, but he forgave his brother, writing to Manuel &quot;your age absolves your mistake&quot;. Now having the King&#x27;s permission, Manuel entered the service of Prince Eugene of Savoy, serving alongside him at the successful Battle of Petrovaradin. Over the next 17 years, Infante Manuel moved from court to court as a celebrity and military hero and was even considered as a candidate as King of Poland by provision of the 1732 Treaty of the Three Black Eagles. Manuel&#x27;s adventures throughout the continent inspired several literary works and gained him celebrity, raising Portugal&#x27;s prestige in the eyes of Europe.

=== Catholic Church ===

John&#x27;s reign was characterized by a stressed importance of relations with Rome and the Papacy, though the state of relations with the Holy See largely depended on the pope at the time. John sought acknowledgement by the pope as a lawful and righteous monarch as a means of international recognition of his capabilities and authority. Relations with John&#x27;s first pope, Clement XI, were largely successful, resulting from mutual beneficial agreements. In 1716, in response to a request by Pope Clement XI to John for aid in the fight against the Turks, the King sent an armada of Portuguese ships to assist Venice and Austria in their conflicts with the Turks that was led by his brother Infante Francisco, Duke of Beja, and Lopo Furtado de Mendonça, Count of Rio Grande. In the same year, John ordered a formal, triumphal entry for his ambassador in Rome, Rodrigo Anes de Sá Almeida e Meneses, 3rd Marquis of Fontes. Seeking to mimic the response received at the French court, 5,000 cruzados were spent on a luxurious entry for the Portuguese envoy. The ceremonial procession included a convoy of 300 carriages surrounding the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; of the procession, the Oceans Coach, an ornate carriage made in Lisbon to demonstrate the wealth of the Portuguese empire to Rome. This impressed the papal court, and Pope Clement raised the dignity of the Archdiocese of Lisbon to the Patriarchate of Lisbon, making the Portuguese capital only one of two dioceses with this title in Europe, alongside Venice. John&#x27;s good fortune with the papacy and Italy would continue to raise the next year, in 1717, when the aid of a Portuguese squadron of ships helped win the Battle of Matapan, in the ongoing Ottoman-Venetian War.

Clement XI&#x27;s successor, Innocent XIII, had served as Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal from 1697 to 1710, at the court of John and his father King Peter II. However, Innocent XIII&#x27;s time in Portugal is cited to have been the source of his dislike of the Society of Jesus, owing to the immense power that the Jesuits held at the Portuguese court and the concessions they held across the Portuguese Empire at the time. An ongoing issue of importance to the Portugal was the long-standing Chinese Rites controversy, which largely concerned the methods used in Asia by the Jesuits, which were largely under patronage of the Portuguese. Innocent&#x27;s decision to prohibit the Jesuits from continuing their missions in China caused great upset at the Portuguese court. Though Innocent XIII&#x27;s successor, Benedict XIII, was the only pope to descend from Portuguese royalty (descending from King Denis), relations were no warmer with Portugal than under his predecessor. Discontent with the Vatican&#x27;s dismissal of his requests, John retaliated against Benedict XIII in 1728, closing the Papal Nunciature in Lisbon, recalling all Portuguese cardinals from Rome, and prohibiting official relations between Portuguese subjects and the Holy See. Benedict sought to resolve the issues through an amicable intermediary, King Don Philip V of Spain, though John refused.

An issue of significance to John concerned the rank and appointment of the Apostolic Nuncio in Portugal, which the King wished to be raised to the dignity of a crown-cardinal and demanded input in the selection process. Both Clement XI and Innocent XIII had denied John&#x27;s requests and Benedict XIII had failed to mediate a resolution. Only during the fourth papacy of John&#x27;s reign was the issue resolved, when Pope Clement XII acquiesced to the king&#x27;s demands, in 1730, elevating the Portuguese nunciature to the dignity shared only with France, Austria, and Spain. John&#x27;s last pope and Clement XII&#x27;s successor, Benedict XIV, had a markedly better relation with the King, granting the King his desired recognition as a lawful Christian monarch. In 1748, the Pope awarded the title of &quot;Most Faithful Majesty&quot; to John and his successors.

=== Imperial administration ===
John&#x27;s reign saw the rise of the Americas as the bastion of Portuguese imperial power, as fortunes became less lucrative in Asia and Africa. Under John, the Portuguese Empire saw territorial gains in modern-day Brazil, India, Kenya, Uruguay, East Timor, Angola, and Mozambique, among others. John sought to exert strict control over the government, trade and communications of his overseas imperial possessions.

;Americas
Portuguese America occupied the highest priority in John&#x27;s administration of the Portuguese Empire. The American colonies of Brazil and Maranhão had become vital sources of wealth to the royal treasury, making the protection, expansion, and good governance of Portuguese America crucial to imperial policy in the Joanine era. Expansion of Portuguese territory in the Americas was also a concern, which was primarily achieved through military incursions into the interior of the continent by &quot;Bandeirantes&quot;. Portugal also regained control of Uruguay following the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1714, and successfully defended it against an attempted Spanish reconquest in the Spanish–Portuguese War of 1735–37.

In the 1690s, during the final years of King Peter II&#x27;s reign, precious resources were discovered in Brazil, namely vast gold and diamond deposits. However, exploitation of the resources primarily began in John&#x27;s reign, with the establishment of mining companies, taxation systems, and a mercantilist supply chain, which ushered in a period known as the Brazilian Gold Rush. The royal fifth was instituted as a form of taxation on mining activities, requiring a fifth of all gold to go directly to the King&#x27;s treasury. In an effort to consolidate royal authority while promoting efficient governance, John took control of the Captaincy of São Vicente (in 1709) and the Captaincy of Pernambuco (in 1716), establishing direct royal governance in the two most valuable provinces of Brazil. In 1721, John ordered the separation of the region of intense mining from the rest of the Captaincy of São Vicente, into the autonomous captaincy of &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; (General Mines), allowing for the colonial administration to collect taxation more effectively.

;Asia

Asia had been the traditional base of the Portuguese Empire&#x27;s wealth and power, but its declining returns became especially noticeable during John&#x27;s reign as gold and diamonds from the Americas flowed to Lisbon. Portuguese India, historically the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the empire, was economically constrained, especially under the restrictive rule of the Portuguese Inquisition in Goa, which prohibited commerce with non-Christian merchants. Concurrently, Portugal&#x27;s most important ally in the Indian subcontinent was the Mughal Empire, which entered into a drastic decline following 1707, coinciding with the rise of the Maratha Empire, long-time enemies of the Portuguese. Portugal suffered territorial losses after the Battle of Vasai and the Maratha conquest of Baçaim, although the size of Portuguese India would triple from 1713 to 1788, in an era known as the &quot;Novas Conquistas&quot; (New Conquests). The declining importance of Portuguese India resulted in numerous administrative reorganizations during John&#x27;s reign, including the independence of Portuguese Mozambique from rule by the Viceroy of Portuguese India, as well as the creation of a direct commercial route from Portugal to Portuguese Macau (present day China), which eliminated the stop at the Indian port of Goa.

;Africa
The Portuguese colonization of Africa was less important to John&#x27;s colonial priorities compared to the Americas and Asia. Minor contentions with Dutch corsairs blocking shipments to and from the Portuguese Gold Coast in the 1720s resulted in successful Portuguese victory over the Dutch in minor naval battles. Notable, tensions were also raised with Britain in 1722 when British forces established a fortification in Cabinda (in modern-day Angola), which had been claimed and evangelized by the Portuguese since the 15th century. A notable rare exception to the long-standing Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, John ordered galleons from the &quot;Armada do Brasil&quot; to dispatch to Cabinda, known as the Cabinda Expedition, to either take possession of the fort or destroy it and its men, resulting in a Portuguese victory in 1723. Portugal briefly reconquered Mombasa (modern-day Kenya) in 1728, only to lose control over it again in 1729, ending the last period of Portuguese rule in Mombasa.

== Joanine culture ==

=== Mafra ===

John is often remembered as one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Portuguese history, having commissioned numerous construction projects and artistic studies. The King&#x27;s most famous and important work was the Royal Palace-Convent of Mafra. By early 1711, John was worried for the future of the House of Braganza, since his marriage to Maria Anna of Austria had produced no issue. He met with Dom Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde, High-Inquisitor of Portugal, who assured the King that if he promised to build a convent for Franciscans in Mafra, in the Lisbon countryside, Maria Anna would bear him a child by the end of 1711. John agreed to do so. Construction started in 1717, with plans for a modest church convent for one hundred friars. However, in the following years, with a gratuitous flow of gold from slave labour in the American colonies of Brazil and Maranhão, the plans were altered to become a &quot;magnum opus&quot; of John&#x27;s reign, accommodating three hundred friars and adjusted to become a hybrid convent-palace, including a royal library, a basilica, and a vast set of apartments for the royal family. Noting the vast size and scope of the project, Charles de Merveilleux, a Swiss nobleman living in Portugal in 1726, remarked that &quot;King John has decided to build a second Escorial.&quot;

With the new plans for a palatial complex, the project at Mafra, entrusted to royal architect João Frederico Ludovice, became much more than a fulfillment of a religious promise, but rather a demonstration of monarchical power and wealth. By 1729, 15,470 workers from throughout Portugal and its colonies were contributing to the construction of the palace, alongside a total of 6,124 infantrymen and cavalrymen, making a total of 21,594 persons involved in the building process and site that year. While the majority of the palace was completed by 1730, John was so consumed in completing the project that he decreed it mandatory for all inhabitants of the villages of Mafra and Ericeira to work at the palace, requiring an excused permission not to participate, and only under extraordinary circumstances. In regard to the exuberant cost of the palatial complex, Merveilleux remarked that &quot;three quarters of the royal treasury and nearly all of the gold brought on the fleets from Brazil were here, at Mafra, turned into stone.&quot;

Mafra stood as a monument to regal power, even though it would become only a pleasure palace and never a seat of authority. John commissioned numerous operas, comedies, and serenades to be celebrated at the palace with great pomp, and its enormous property became the favoured hunting grounds of the royal family for centuries to come. In 1732, the King also began to celebrate his birthday annually at Mafra. John housed one of the largest and most sumptuous libraries in Europe within the palace, with over 36,000 volumes dating from the 14th to the 18th centuries. Works at Mafra would continue until 1755, when the devastation wreaked by the Great Lisbon earthquake required as many workers as possible to rebuild the city.

<text>Rosa Mina Schärer (3 March 1924 – 24 March 2018), known by her stage name Lys Assia, was a Swiss singer who won the first Eurovision Song Contest in . Assia was born in Rupperswil, Aargau, and began her stage career as a dancer, but changed to singing in 1940 where she met her first musical success in 1950 with &quot;O mein Papa&quot;. 

==Eurovision Song Contest==
In , she was the winner of the first Eurovision Song Contest, in which she sang for Switzerland with the song &quot;Refrain&quot;. She returned to the contest again for Switzerland in and .

In , Assia performed at the &quot;&quot; event.

In , together with the previous year&#x27;s winner Dima Bilan, Assia presented the Eurovision trophy to that year&#x27;s winner Alexander Rybak.
In September 2011, Assia entered her song &quot;C&#x27;était ma vie&quot;, written by Ralph Siegel and Jean Paul Cara, into the Swiss national selection &quot;Die grosse Entscheidungs Show&quot; for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The song came eighth in a closely fought national selection. She attended the event in Baku as a guest of honour.

In 2012, Assia again submitted a song to the Swiss national selection to represent Switzerland in Malmö, Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 with the song &quot;All in Your Head&quot; featuring the hip-hop rap group New Jack. This entry, however, was not chosen to compete at the national selection. There were rumours of Assia representing San Marino, but it was announced on 30 January 2013 that Valentina Monetta would do so. She later made a guest appearance during the contest&#x27;s second semi-final. In 2015, at age 91, Assia attended the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; special concert celebrating the contest&#x27;s 60th anniversary. This was her last public appearance.

==Personal life==
Assia married Johann Heinrich Kunz on 11 January 1957 in Zürich. Kunz died just nine months later after battling a serious illness. In 1963, she married Danish businessman Oscar Pedersen, who died in 1995. She died on 24 March 2018 in Zürich.

<text>Jealous Again is the second EP by American hardcore punk band Black Flag, and the third-ever release on SST Records.

==History==
Although eventually released as a 12&quot; 45 RPM extended-play, &quot;Jealous Again&quot; was initially intended to be Black Flag&#x27;s first full-length album.

Spurred on by the reception to their first release, the EP &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;, Black Flag entered the studio in late 1979 with new drummer Robo and original singer Keith Morris to begin recording their first LP. Basic tracks for all of the songs were cut live in the studio with Morris singing temporary vocal parts. Almost without warning, however, according to bassist Chuck Dukowski, Morris &quot;smashed his records and guitar and walked out screaming for a week,&quot; quitting the band and refusing to complete the album.

The band then recruited former Redd Kross member Ron Reyes, (credited on the record as &quot;Chavo Pederast&quot; after a falling out with the band) to be their new vocalist; however, guitarist and band leader Greg Ginn felt he was not yet ready to record, and the tapes were put aside for several months. After several shows with Reyes, one of which was filmed for the movie &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, the sessions resumed, first with Ginn overdubbing new guitar parts and then Reyes doing his vocals. However, the initial attempts to record with Reyes proved fruitless when he started walking out of the vocal booth, and sometimes the studio entirely, in the middle of takes. Reyes later quit the band in the middle of a live performance, derailing the sessions entirely for a second time.

Ginn and Dukowski were already talking with another former Redd Kross member, Dez Cadena, about joining the band as a second guitarist; when Reyes quit the group, Cadena was invited to take his place. The band&#x27;s producer/engineer Spot took an incentive and brought Cadena into the studio to record his own vocals for the album. Several tracks were done in one night with Cadena, but were shelved when Reyes agreed to complete the project. These new vocal sessions, according to Spot, went so smoothly that he could not resist jokingly asking Reyes, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you quit the band before this?&quot;

Ginn and Dukowski decided to release five tracks from the finished Reyes sessions as the 12&quot; EP known to Black Flag fans today, and elected to make a second attempt at a debut album with Cadena as lead vocalist.

==Song history==
Early versions of &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;White Minority&quot; with Reyes on vocals, along with an early version of the later &quot;Damaged&quot; track &quot;Depression&quot;, were recorded and filmed for &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. In the movie and on the soundtrack album, Reyes defiantly dedicates the former song to the LAPD. Already, Black Flag (and many other Los Angeles punk bands) were getting harassed by police; &quot;Revenge&quot; was undoubtedly inspired at least in part by the band&#x27;s unprovoked encounters with them.

&quot;You Bet We&#x27;ve Got Something Personal Against You!&quot; initially started life as a Greg Ginn/Keith Morris composition, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, recorded during the original album sessions with Morris on vocals. When Morris quit the band, however, he took both &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; and &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Wasted&quot; (the only other Morris/Ginn songwriting collaboration under the Black Flag moniker) with him and recorded them with his new band The Circle Jerks on their debut album &quot;Group Sex&quot;. Offended by what they saw as the misappropriation of two Black Flag songs, Dukowski wrote new lyrics to Ginn&#x27;s music for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; and recorded what is essentially an attack on Morris and the Circle Jerks. &quot;You Bet...&quot; is also the only time Dukowski sings lead vocals on a Black Flag song.

==Existing outtakes==
Outtakes from all three vocalist&#x27;s attempts at recording for the EP, including Cadena&#x27;s version of the title track, dominate the band&#x27;s 1982 compilation double album &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;.

==Reissued variations==
*The entire &quot;Jealous Again&quot; EP appeared on the singles compilation &quot;The First Four Years&quot;, but is also still available separately. It has also been reissued as a 3&quot; CD and as a 10&quot; vinyl EP.
*The initial CD version of &quot;Damaged&quot;, for reasons unknown, appended the &quot;Jealous Again&quot; EP to the CD as bonus tracks.

==Reception==

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote in his review of the EP: &quot;Black Flag are committed to rage, not in itself—I don&#x27;t believe their &#x27;I&#x27;ve got something personal against you&#x27; even though I know it&#x27;s true—but as a musical principle. Five songs, seven minutes, as arty as no wave, with a comparable relationship to punk precedents, which for L.A. are basic Brit. The sound is extreme and unique, all forced rhythm and guitar blur with no ingratiating distractions—no humor, irony, hooks, or (God knows) melody. Well, maybe irony.&quot;

<text>Abelardo Díaz Alfaro (July 24, 1916 – July 22, 1999) was an author from Puerto Rico who achieved great fame throughout Latin America during the 1940s. His book &quot;Campo Alegre&quot; is a text that has been studied at schools in Austria, Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand as well as all over the Americas.

== Life and career ==
Díaz Alfaro was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, but soon after his family moved to Ponce. He was the son of Abelardo Díaz Morales, a Baptist minister, and Asunción Alfaro Pratts (Doña Sunchita). His siblings were Abigail, Dalila, Miriam, Priscilla, Raquel, Lydia and Samuel. He returned to Caguas to attend University and married Gladys Meaux, with whom he had two daughters (Dalila and Nanette) and one son (Abelardo).

Díaz Alfaro obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in arts at the &quot;Instituto Politécnico de San Germán&quot;, which is now known as Universidad Interamericana de Puerto Rico. He also obtained a title as a social worker, and certificates in Spanish and Psychology.

He obtained many honorary doctorates from different universities.

Some of his short stories, like &quot;Peyo Mercé enseña inglés&quot; or &quot;Santa Cló va a la Cuchilla&quot; (in &quot;Terrazo&quot;) create a Manichaean dichotomy between unlearned Puerto Rican peasants and American invaders (portrayed through the mandatory teaching of the English language in Puerto Rico). Thus, a praise of layman culture is expressed throughout his short stories. The metaphor of weak or feminine Americans versus uneducated but brave Puerto Ricans is taken later by other writers like Ana Lydia Vega.

He presented at conferences in many parts of Latin America after reaching fame, including in Mexico (at the &quot;Ateneo Español&quot;), Venezuela and many other countries. His books have been translated into English, Polish, Russian, German, French, Italian and Czech, among other languages.

==Works==
Among the books he wrote are:

* &quot;Terrazo&quot; (published in 1947)
* &quot;Mi Isla Soñada&quot;
* &quot;Los Perros&quot;
* &quot;The Eye of the Heart&quot;
* &quot;United States in Literature&quot;
* &quot;Classic Tales of Spanish America&quot;
* &quot;Cuentos del Mundo Hispano&quot; (Spanish version of &quot;Classic Tales&quot;)
* &quot;Changes Antología Mundial&quot;
* &quot;The Green Antilles&quot;
* &quot;Contemporary Readers&quot;
* &quot;National Catholic&quot;
* &quot;The Princeton Tiger&quot;
* &quot;Europe in France&quot;
* &quot;Campo Alegre&quot;.
*&quot;Santa Clo va a la cuchilla (cuento)&quot;

<doc id="149481" wikidata="Q48284" url="?curid=149481" title="Midnight Oil">
<text>Midnight Oil (known informally as &quot;The Oils&quot;) are an Australian rock band composed of Peter Garrett (vocals, harmonica), Rob Hirst (drums), Jim Moginie (guitar, keyboard) and Martin Rotsey (guitar). The group was formed in Sydney in 1972 by Hirst, Moginie and original bassist Andrew James as Farm: they enlisted Garrett the following year, changed their name in 1976, and hired Rotsey a year later. Peter Gifford served as bass player from 1980 to 1987, with Bones Hillman then assuming the role until his death in 2020. Midnight Oil have sold over 20 million albums worldwide as of 2021.

Midnight Oil issued their self-titled debut album in 1978 and gained a cult following in their homeland despite a lack of mainstream media acceptance. The band achieved greater popularity throughout Australasia with the release of &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; (1982) – which spawned the singles &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; and &quot;US Forces&quot; – and also began to attract an audience in the United States. They achieved their first Australian number one album in 1984 with &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;, and topped their native country&#x27;s singles chart for six weeks with the EP &quot;Species Deceases&quot; (1985).

The group garnered worldwide attention with 1987 album &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot;. Its singles &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; and &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; illuminated the plight of Indigenous Australians, with the latter charting at number one in multiple countries. Midnight Oil had continued global success with &quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot; (1990) and &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; (1993) – each buoyed by an international hit single in &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot; and &quot;Truganini&quot;, respectively – and remained a formidable album chart presence in Australia until their 2002 disbandment. The group held concerts sporadically during the remainder of the 2000s and announced a full-scale reformation in 2016. The band released their 15th and final studio album, &quot;Resist&quot;, on 18 February 2022, and announced an accompanying tour.

The band&#x27;s music often broaches political subjects, and they have lent their support to multiple causes. They have won eleven ARIA Awards and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2006. Midnight Oil&#x27;s legacy has grown since the late 1970s, with the outfit being cited as an influence, and their songs covered, by numerous popular artists. Aside from their studio output, the group are celebrated for their energetic live performances, which showcase the frenetic dancing of Garrett. &quot;Guardian&quot; writer Andrew Street described Midnight Oil as &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s most beloved bands&quot;.

== Overview ==
While studying at Australian National University in Canberra, vocalist Peter Garrett answered an advertisement for a spot in Farm, and by 1975 the band had started touring the east coast of Australia. By late 1976 Garrett had moved to Sydney to complete his law degree, and Farm changed its name to &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; by drawing the name out of a hat. The name was coined by Peter Watson, a short-term keyboard player with Farm.

Important to their development was manager Gary Morris, who successfully negotiated favourable contracts with tour promoters and record companies and frustrated rock journalists. Guitarist Martin Rotsey joined in 1977 and Midnight Oil, with Morris, established their own record label, Powderworks, which released their debut eponymous album in November 1978. Their first single &quot;Run by Night&quot; followed in December. Founding bass-guitarist James, forced to leave due to illness in 1980, was replaced by Peter Gifford. Gifford was himself replaced by Bones Hillman in 1987. Through a long and distinguished career, the band became known for its driving hard-rock sound, intense live performances and political activism, particularly in aid of anti-nuclear, environmentalist and indigenous causes.

The following Midnight Oil albums peaked in the Australian Top Ten:

* &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot;
* &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;
* &quot;Species Deceases&quot;
* &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot;
* &quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot;
* &quot;Scream in Blue (Live)&quot;
* &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot;
* &quot;Breathe&quot;
* &quot;20,000 Watt R.S.L.&quot;
* &quot;Redneck Wonderland&quot;
* &quot;The Real Thing&quot;
* &quot;Capricornia&quot;
* &quot;Flat Chat&quot;
* &quot;The Makarrata Project&quot;
* &quot;Resist&quot;

The following Midnight Oil releases peaked in the Top Ten of the Australian singles chart:

* &quot;Power and the Passion&quot;
* &quot;Species Deceases EP&quot; (&quot;Progress&quot;/&quot;Hercules&quot;/&quot;Blossom and Blood&quot;/&quot;Pictures&quot;)
* &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;
* &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot;
* &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot;

Aside from chart success, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in 2001 listed both &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; and &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; in the Top 30 best Australian songs of all time,
a chart in which Midnight Oil are the only artists to feature twice. In December 2002 Garrett announced that he would seek to further his political career and Midnight Oil disbanded, but they reformed for two warm-up shows in Canberra leading up to their performance, at one of the &quot;Sound Relief&quot; charity concerts, in honour of the victims of the 2009 &quot;Black Saturday&quot; fires in Victoria and floods in Queensland.

In 2010 their album &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; ranked no. 1 in the book &quot;The 100 Best Australian Albums&quot; by Toby Creswell, Craig Mathieson and John O&#x27;Donnell.

== History ==
=== Farm: 1972–1976 ===
In 1971 drummer Rob Hirst, bass guitarist Andrew James, and keyboard player/lead guitarist Jim Moginie were performing together. They adopted the name &quot;Farm&quot; in 1972, and played covers of Cream, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Led Zeppelin songs. They placed an advert for a band member; Peter Garrett (ex-Rock Island Line) became their new vocalist and synthesizer player and began introducing progressive rock elements of Focus, Jethro Tull and Yes, as well as their own material. Garrett was studying at the Australian National University in Canberra, so Farm was only a part-time band. They played for the northern-Sydney surfing community and, by 1975, were touring the east coast. In late 1976 Garrett moved to Sydney to complete his law degree. Farm then became a full-time group and changed its name to &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; by drawing a name out of a hat, leaving behind &quot;Television&quot;, &quot;Sparta&quot;, and &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.

The name &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; was inspired by the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, although the word &quot;oil&quot; appears nowhere in the lyrics. The expression &quot;midnight oil&quot; first appeared in a 1635 poem by Francis Quarles (1592-1644):
=== 1976–1981 ===
After changing its name to Midnight Oil, the group began to develop an aggressive, punk-hard rock sound for their pub rock audiences. Guitarist Martin Rotsey joined in 1977 and Midnight Oil, with their manager Gary Morris, established their own record label Powderworks. In June 1978 they entered the Alberts Studio in Sydney with producer Keith Walker, from local radio station 2JJ, to record their debut eponymous album, &quot;Midnight Oil&quot;, which was released by Powderworks in November 1978 and peaked at No. 43 on the Australian albums charts. Midnight Oil&#x27;s first single &quot;Run by Night&quot; followed in December, but had very little chart success, peaking at No. 100 on the singles charts.

The band built a dedicated fan base, initially restricted to Sydney, which was extended to other Australian cities through constant touring – performing some 200 gigs in their first year. They became known for their furious live performances, which featured the two guitarists Moginie and Rotsey, the drumming and vocals of Hirst and the presence of the towering, bald Garrett as lead singer.

The &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; LP disappointed some critics as it did not capture their powerful live performances, with undemanding playing and Garrett&#x27;s vocals sounding stilted. Their second album &quot;Head Injuries&quot;, released on Powderworks in October 1979, was produced by former Supercharge member Leszek Karski. It mixed solid guitar rock with progressive flourishes and was an improvement by highlighting the group&#x27;s strengths and growth. It peaked at No. 36 and by mid-1980 had achieved gold status. In April 1980 founding bass guitarist Andrew James left because of ill-health and was replaced by Peter Gifford (ex-Huntress, Ross Ryan Band).

Further interest in Midnight Oil was generated by the popular &quot;Bird Noises&quot; EP, also produced by Karski, which peaked at No. 28 on the Australian singles charts. One of its four tracks was the surf-instrumental &quot;Wedding Cake Island&quot; named after the rock outcrop in the ocean off Sydney&#x27;s Coogee Beach. The band&#x27;s third LP &quot;Place without a Postcard&quot;, released by CBS Records in November 1981, was recorded in Sussex with English producer Glyn Johns (The Rolling Stones, The Who). Creative tensions between the band and Johns plagued the recording and the group were not totally happy with the outcome. Johns had an arrangement with A&amp;M Records and they asked Midnight Oil to return to the studio to record material suitable for an American single release – they refused and returned to Australia. &quot;Place without a Postcard&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the albums charts and related singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna be the One&quot; and &quot;Armistice Day&quot; reached the Top 40 in Australia.

=== Fans, music industry, media ===
Driven largely by commercial pressures to stay with reliable chart-toppers and teenage pop sensations, the Australian music industry in the mid-1970s cast a dismissive eye toward most bands with an alternative outlook. Although consistently championed by Sydney alternative rock station Double Jay and its FM band successor Triple J, Midnight Oil were almost totally ignored by Australia&#x27;s mainstream commercial radio stations in their early career. Manager Morris developed a reputation as one of the toughest managers and became notorious for banning critics or journalists, who were usually given free admission to concerts, for writing unfavourable reviews. Writer and critic Bruce Elder, in a mid-1980s newspaper review described their music as &quot;narrow and xenophobic&quot; and declared Midnight Oil were:

In retaliation, Morris banned Elder from Oils shows permanently. Elder later recanted, describing them as the only Australian band to have developed a truly Australian sound.

The frostiness of Midnight Oil&#x27;s relationship with the traditional music media quickly saw the band develop a strong &quot;street cred&quot; and a reputation for making no compromises with the music industry. In the early 1980s the band was scheduled to appear on an episode of the all-powerful Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV pop show &quot;Countdown&quot; but on the day of the show they were &quot;bumped&quot; from the line-up. &quot;Countdown&quot; required artists to mime their songs during &#x27;live&#x27; performances, Midnight Oil and Morris insisted they perform completely live and have their sound engineer supervising – neither side backed down. According to &quot;Countdown&quot; producer Michael Shrimpton, the band had arrived late for rehearsal and, due to the show&#x27;s very tight schedule and budget, there was a strict policy that latecomers were not allowed to appear; and, as such, they were told they could not perform that day. In response, the group declared that they would never appear on the show, a promise they faithfully kept. &quot;Countdown&quot; presenter Molly Meldrum shaved his head bald, imitating Garrett, for its final show on 19 July 1987 and expressed regret that Midnight Oil had never appeared on the show.

Fans of the group were drawn to the band&#x27;s &quot;us and them&quot; mindset, and fan loyalty to the Oils&#x27; ideas and music was fierce. Two venues at which they built significant fan bases from their early live performances were the Sydney northern beaches pub The Royal Antler at Narrabeen and the Bondi Lifesaver club near Sydney&#x27;s Bondi Beach. Politically oriented rock of the style produced by the band was something of a new concept for the Australian music scene, and Peter Garrett quickly earned a reputation as one of the most charismatic and outspoken musicians in the country. He recalled that there were dangers in playing the pub scene:

=== Rise to fame: 1982–1985 ===
==== &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; ====
Their Australian breakthrough and first international recognition came in 1982, with the release of &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot;, which included the singles &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; and &quot;Read about It&quot;. The album peaked at No. 3 and &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; peaked at No. 8. The album also includes their denunciation of American military interference in foreign affairs in &quot;US Forces&quot; and their critique of imperialist repression in &quot;Short Memory&quot;. &quot;10 to 1&quot; was recorded in London during September and produced by Englishman Nick Launay, who had previously worked with acts including The Jam, XTC, Peter Gabriel, PiL, Gang of Four and The Birthday Party. Launay worked on several other major Australian recordings in this period including INXS&#x27; &quot;The Swing&quot;, Models&#x27; &quot;The Pleasure of Your Company&quot; and The Church&#x27;s &quot;Seance&quot;.

The album remained in the Australian charts for 171 weeks. It retained their live energy but was more adventurous and radical than previous work. Their ascendancy was signalled by a series of concerts on the release of the album at Sydney&#x27;s Capitol Theatre, one of which was filmed and recorded and later released on their 2004 &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; DVD. The band also played their first shows outside Australia during this time, with the album being released in the US on Columbia Records, where it charted in 1984 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; in the UK it was released on CBS.

==== &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; ====
Midnight Oil undertook more politically motivated benefit concerts, including organising the Stop The Drop nuclear disarmament concert in 1983, which received a United Nations Association of Australia Media Peace Prize. &quot;10 to 1&quot; was followed by &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; in October 1984, which was recorded in Japan, produced by Launay again. It peaked at No. 1 for four weeks on the Australian charts, and charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Singles from the album were released in US and UK but had no chart success. Whilst the album showed an overreliance on technical wizardry, their lyrical stance was positive. The band continued to expand their sound and explore themes of politics, consumerism, militarism, the threat of nuclear war and environmental issues. The album cover by Japanese artist Tsunehisa Kimura featured a photomontage of Sydney – both city and harbour – cratered and devastated after a hypothetical nuclear attack. Live concert footage of &quot;Short Memory&quot; was used in the Australian independent anti-nuclear war movie &quot;One Night Stand&quot;. A promotional video for &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, later on &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, received airplay worldwide on cable music TV station MTV.

Garrett ran as a Nuclear Disarmament Party (NDP) candidate for a NSW seat in the Australian Senate during the December 1984 federal election, Garrett obtained 9.6% of votes but was unable to obtain the required quota of 12.5%. In April 1985, Garrett, with some 30 other members, walked out of the national conference and resigned from the NDP claiming it had been infiltrated by a Trotskyist group. Although unsuccessful in that federal election, Garrett was now a recognised public figure.

==== Goat Island Triple J concert ====
In January 1985, Midnight Oil performed &quot;Oils on the Water&quot;, a concert on Goat Island in Sydney Harbour to celebrate Triple J&#x27;s tenth birthday, before a select audience of fans who had won tickets in a radio competition. The concert was filmed, simulcast on ABC-TV and Triple J, and released on video, which was remastered for their 2004 &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; DVD.

=== International success and activism: 1985–2002 ===
==== &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; ====
In December 1985 the four-track EP &quot;Species Deceases&quot; produced with Francois Kevorkian was released by CBS/Columbia; it peaked at No. 1 on the Australian singles charts for six weeks. &quot;Species Deceases&quot;, featuring the track &quot;Hercules&quot;, featured a return to their pub rock sound with hard hitting firepower. Midnight Oil spent several months in 1986 on the Blackfella/Whitefella tour of outback Australia with indigenous groups Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, playing to remote Aboriginal communities and seeing first hand the seriousness of the issues in health and living standards. The tour was criticised by some journalists for being a one-off event instead of a long-term attempt to build bridges between communities. The band was galvanised by the experiences and made them the basis of &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot;, released in 1987 and produced by Warne Livesey. The album focused on the need for recognition by white Australia of past injustices involving the Aboriginal nations and the need for Reconciliation in Australia. Peter Gifford left the band before the album&#x27;s release due to extensive touring schedules, and was replaced by Bones Hillman, formerly of The Swingers.

&quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the Australian albums charts for six weeks, No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard 200 charts&quot; in 1988, and No. 19 on the UK albums charts. &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; was their biggest international hit single, peaking at No. 6 in Australia, and No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 6 on the UK singles charts. &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; peaked at No. 6 in Australia, and charted on the Hot 100 and in the UK. &quot;Put Down that Weapon&quot; also charted in Australia, while &quot;Dreamworld&quot; charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks and at No. 16 on its Modern Rock Tracks.

At the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) 1988 Awards ceremony, Midnight Oil won &quot;Best Cover Art &quot; for &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; and both &quot;Best Single&quot; and &quot;Best Song&quot; for &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot;. A fracas developed between Morris, accepting awards for Midnight Oil, and former &quot;Countdown&quot; compere Ian Meldrum who was presenting: Meldrum objected to Morris making political commentary from the podium.

There were concerns about &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; and Midnight Oil&#x27;s attempts to express indigenous issues to white urban audiences – namely, the question &quot;who holds the power to tell whose history?&quot; The lyrics of &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; tell the story of colonisation from an indigenous point of view but some critics felt they reinforced the &quot;primitive&quot; stereotype. Use of the bullroarer was criticised as belonging to sacred rituals and therefore not appropriate for rock songs. &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; had been written in response to a request by organisers of the 1985 ceremony to return control of Uluru to its indigenous caretakers; Midnight Oil had originally resisted, arguing it would be more appropriate for an indigenous band to release the single. However, the organisers insisted, arguing that the band would reach a wider audience within the predominantly Caucasian urban centres. Midnight Oil requested that all royalties from the song go to indigenous communities. In addition, two indigenous groups, Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, toured with them.

Following the 1988 American tour in support of &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; with Australian band Yothu Yindi, Midnight Oil launched the &quot;Building Bridges – Australia Has A Black History&quot; album with various artists contributing, including Paul Kelly, Scrap Metal, Coloured Stone, Hunters &amp; Collectors, James Reyne, The Saints, Crowded House, INXS and Yothu Yindi. All sales proceeds were donated to the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations.

During 1989–1993 and 1998–2002 Garrett was the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, whilst during 1993–1998 he was on the International Board of Greenpeace. In 1990 Midnight Oil played an impromptu lunchtime set in front of Exxon headquarters in New York with a banner reading, &quot;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick,&quot; protesting the Exxon Valdez oil spill the previous year.

==== &quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot; ====
In February 1990, &quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot;, produced by Livesey, was released by CBS/Columbia. It peaked at No. 1 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums charts. It stayed at No. 1 for two weeks in Australia and had Top 5 chart success in Sweden, Switzerland and Norway. It peaked at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 28 on the UK charts. The album was more defiant and outspoken; the single &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot; describes asbestos exposure in the Wittenoom mine tragedy. The single peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA singles charts, top 15 in Norway and Switzerland, No. 47 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on both their Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and appeared on the UK charts. The second single, &quot;Forgotten Years&quot;, was more moderately successful, reaching No. 26 on the ARIA singles chart, No. 97 in the UK, No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, and No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks.

In Sydney in 1990, while Midnight Oil were taking a break, Hirst joined up with guitarist Andrew Dickson, drummer Dorland Bray of Do-Ré-Mi, guitarist Leszek Karski (Midnight Oil producer) and bass guitarist Rick Grossman of Hoodoo Gurus to form a side project called Ghostwriters. The name refers to the practice of ghostwriting, wherein famous writers contribute under assumed names in order to remain anonymous. Ghostwriters&#x27; line-ups – both live and in the studio – changed considerably through the years, with only founders Hirst and Grossman being mainstays. Between successive album releases Hirst and Grossman returned to active involvement with Oils and Gurus respectively. Ghostwriters have released &quot;Ghostwriters&quot; (1991), &quot;Second Skin&quot; (1996), &quot;Fibromoon&quot; (1999) and &quot;Political Animal&quot; (2007).

At the 1991 ARIA Awards ceremony, Midnight Oil won &#x27;Best Group&#x27; and an &#x27;Outstanding Achievement Award&#x27; and &#x27;Best Cover Artist&#x27;, &#x27;Best Video&#x27; and &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; for &quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot;. Morris, accepting awards for Midnight Oil, was criticised for a speech lasting 20 minutes.

&quot;Scream in Blue (Live)&quot;, their June 1992 live album produced by Keith Walker, contained material from concerts between 1982 and 1990, including &quot;Progress&quot; from their Exxon Valdez protest gig. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA albums charts; Top 50 in Austria, Sweden and Switzerland; and appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==== &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; ====
Midnight Oil&#x27;s &quot; Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; album, produced with Nick Launay, was released in April 1993 and also drew critical acclaim and international success, peaking at No. 2 on the ARIA albums charts, top 20 in Sweden and Switzerland, Top 50 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and top thirty in the UK albums chart. The single &quot;Truganini&quot; referenced multiple issues, including the &#x27;last&#x27; Tasmanian Aboriginal person, the treatment of Aboriginal artist Albert Namatjira, the Australian flag debate, and republicanism. Liner notes for the single claimed &quot;Truganini was the sole surviving Tasmanian Aborigine, the last of her race, when she died in 1876.&quot; The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, representing over 7000 contemporary Tasmanians, called for the single to be boycotted as it perpetuated a &#x27;white&#x27; myth about the extinction of Aboriginal Tasmanians. Their Native Title claims hinged upon establishing links with ancestral lands. Morris responded with, &quot;My suggestion to these people is to stop shooting themselves in the foot and let a band like Midnight Oil voice its appeal to White Australia on behalf of Black Australia&quot;.

Critics contended that Morris disparaged Indigenous Australians&#x27; ability to represent themselves and overestimated Midnight Oil&#x27;s ambassadorial powers while diminishing their errors, while some indigenous activists saw benefit in Midnight Oil&#x27;s highlighting of the issues. Nevertheless, &quot;Truganini&quot; released in March peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA singles charts, No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks and No. 4 on their Modern Rock Tracks charts, and top thirty for the UK charts. Peter Garrett issued an apology for the mistake in the liner notes. The band performed the song along with &quot;My Country&quot; from the album on the American sketch-comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the 8 May 1993 episode hosted by Christina Applegate.

In 1993, the band also participated in the Another Roadside Attraction tour in Canada and collaborated with The Tragically Hip, Crash Vegas, Hothouse Flowers and Daniel Lanois on the one-off single &quot;Land&quot; to protest forest clearing in British Columbia.

==== &quot;Breathe&quot; to &quot;Capricornia&quot; ====
&quot;Breathe&quot; was released in 1996. It was produced by Malcolm Burn and had a loose, raw style with almost a low-key sound. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA albums chart, and had Top 40 success in New Zealand and Switzerland. They returned to No. 1 on the ARIA albums charts with the compilation &quot;20,000 Watt R.S.L.&quot; in 1997 on Sony Records, which achieved 4×Platinum sales. Later album releases include the electro tinged hard rock &quot;Redneck Wonderland&quot; in 1998, live album &quot;The Real Thing&quot; in 2000 and the more stripped back &quot;Capricornia&quot; in 2002 again renuniting with producer Warne Livesey, all charted into the ARIA Top Ten.

==== Sydney 2000 Olympic Games performance ====
Midnight Oil again brought the politics of Reconciliation to the fore during their performance at the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. Then Prime Minister John Howard had triggered controversy that year with his refusal to embrace symbolic reconciliation and apologise to Indigenous Australians and members of the Stolen Generations. But he had also said their reconciliation-themed single &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; was his favourite Midnight Oil song. Midnight Oil performed the song at the ceremony with the word SORRY conspicuously printed on their clothes as a form of apology to Indigenous people for their suffering under white settlement and to highlight the issue to Howard, who was in the audience at the Olympic stadium as an estimated one billion people watched on television. Midnight Oil had consulted with tour mates Yothu Yindi and other Indigenous activists, so that their performance would bring popular protest to the world arena.

In 2001, when Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) surveyed 100 music industry people for their Top 10 Best Australian songs of all time, &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; was voted No. 3 behind The Easybeats&#x27; &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; and Daddy Cool&#x27;s &quot;Eagle Rock&quot;. At the 2001 APRA Awards ceremony &quot;Beds are Burning&quot; was shown on video and introduced by Australian Democrats Senator Aden Ridgeway as an Indigenous spokesperson on Reconciliation. &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; was also listed in APRA&#x27;s Top 30 best Australian songs.

=== Dissolution and reunion ===

Garrett announced his decision to quit Midnight Oil on 2 December 2002, to refocus on his political career. In the 1984 federal election, Garrett had stood for the Australian Senate under the Nuclear Disarmament Party banner and narrowly lost. He won the seat of Kingsford Smith at the 2004 General Election for the Australian Labor Party and was selected as Shadow Minister for Climate Change, Environment, Heritage and the Arts. On Thursday, 29 November 2007, Prime Minister elect Kevin Rudd named Garrett as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. The other members of the band continued to work together, but not under the Midnight Oil name.

After a warm up gig the previous evening at the Manly-Warringah Leagues Club, the band, including Garrett, reunited to perform at the WaveAid concert on 29 January 2005 to raise funds for the victims of the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The concert, which took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, also included performances by Powderfinger, Silverchair, Nick Cave, John Butler Trio, Finn Brothers, and others.

On 29 October 2006, Midnight Oil was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame with ARIA chairman Denis Handlin describing them:

Rob Hirst, in his acceptance speech, thanked his family, bandmates, and support from fellow Australians. He also lamented the fact that unlike the Vietnam war, which had inspired some of the best protest songs ever written, very few had been written in reaction to the invasion of Iraq.

&quot;Flat Chat&quot;, another compilation album, was released in November 2006 and peaked at No. 21 on the ARIA album charts. Rumours of an appearance by Midnight Oil at the Sydney leg of the Live Earth concert in July 2007 were false. However Ghostwriters, founded by drummer Hirst and Hoodoo Gurus bass guitarist Rick Grossman and including former Oils guitarist Martin Rotsey, performed six tracks including the Oils&#x27; song &quot;When the Generals Talk&quot;, whilst Peter Garrett gave a speech introducing a reformed Crowded House.

Aside from Ghostwriters, Hirst has also been a member of Backsliders, performed with former Olympian Paul Greene, with fellow Backsliders member Dom Turner on &quot;The Angry Tradesmen&quot;, and, with Rotsey, assisted on Jim Moginie&#x27;s solo album &quot;Alas Folkloric&quot; in 2006.

=== 2009 reformation ===
On the evenings of 12 and 13 March 2009 a reformed Midnight Oil, with Garrett, played at the Royal Theatre in Canberra. The following day, 14 March they headlined the Sound Relief concert in Melbourne. This event was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) to raise money for victims of Victoria&#x27;s February bushfire disaster. The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All proceeds from the Melbourne Concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Appearing with Midnight Oil in Melbourne were Augie March, Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Jack Johnson, Kasey Chambers &amp; Shane Nicholson with Troy Cassar-Daley, Kings of Leon, Liam Finn, Crowded House, Jet, Paul Kelly, Split Enz and Wolfmother.

=== Reunion, the Great Circle Tour, &quot;Midnight Oil: 1984&quot; and &quot;Armistice Day&quot; ===
On 4 May 2016 it was announced on the band&#x27;s website that Midnight Oil intended to reform and embark on a tour in 2017 (their first concerts in Australia since 2002 and their first world tour since 1997). Such plans were confirmed in February 2017, when the band announced &quot;The Great Circle Tour&quot;, which kicked off in April. After three warm up concerts in their native Australia, the band toured Brazil, the U.S., Canada, Europe, South Africa, Singapore and New Zealand before going back to play a series of concerts around the whole of Australia. The band performed 77 concerts in 16 countries during the tour.

In March 2018, the band announced the release of a new documentary film entitled &quot;Midnight Oil: 1984&quot;. Directed by Ray Argall, the film primarily consists of previously-unseen footage from the band&#x27;s tour in support of &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;. The film was given an Australian cinematic release in May 2018, an Australian DVD/Blu-ray release the following July and a limited North American and New Zealand cinematic release that August.

One of the Great Circle tour&#x27;s final concerts was held on Armistice Day at The Domain, in Sydney on 11 November 2017. Both shows at the Domain (the band also performed there on 17 November) were filmed and recorded, being turned into the live album and film &quot;Armistice Day: Live at the Domain, Sydney&quot;. The film was given a one-night cinematic release on 24 October 2018. On 9 November 2018, &quot;Armistice Day&quot; was released as a live album, as well as on DVD and Blu-ray.

In December 2018, the band announced a European and UK tour for June and July 2019. The band were also announced as the headlining act of the Big Red Bash festival, taking place in Birdsville, Queensland. In April 2019, the band announced headlining shows in Thirroul and Canberra as warm-up shows for their European tour. With the announcement came news that the band intended to record new material for a projected 2020 release.

=== 2020: &quot;The Makarrata Project&quot; and &quot;Gadigal Land&quot; ===

On 7 August 2020, Midnight Oil released their first song in 18 years titled &quot;Gadigal Land&quot;, with all earnings going to organisations promoting the &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot;. The song featured poetry spoken in the Gadigal language. It is the first song from a mini-album titled &quot;The Makarrata Project&quot;, whose name is related to one of the elements of the &quot;Uluru Statement&quot;, a Yolngu word approximating a peace agreement or type of treaty. &quot;Gadigal Land&quot; peaked at number 5 on the Australian digital sales song chart.

&quot;The Makarrata Project&quot; was released on 30 October 2020 and reached Number 1 in the Australian albums chart on 6 November 2020.

Bass guitarist Bones Hillman died on 7 November 2020 of cancer at his home in the United States. The surviving members of Midnight Oil announced Hillman&#x27;s death in a statement that remembered him as &quot;the bassist with the beautiful voice, the band member with the wicked sense of humour, and our brilliant musical comrade.&quot;

=== 2021–present: &quot;Resist&quot; and final tour ===

On 18 May 2021, Midnight Oil announced on Twitter that their thirteenth album, with the working title &quot;Show of Hands&quot;, was scheduled for release during their performance at the 2021 Byron Bay Bluesfest. As the event was cancelled in mid-August and the majority of lineup was confirmed for the 2022 edition (set to 14 April), the band&#x27;s plans to release the album remained undefined for some six months.

On 28 October 2021, the band released on YouTube a video for their first single from the album, &quot;Rising Seas&quot;. They announced the single on Twitter: &quot;The uncompromising song, released on the eve of [the United Nations Climate Change Conference] (COP26), adds the band&#x27;s unique voice to billions of others around the world seeking a safe, habitable, and fair future for our planet.&quot; The band featured no bassist in the video, leaving only a bass guitar in a stand in the background beside the drums as a tribute to Hillman.

On 26 November 2021, the band officially announced the album &quot;Resist&quot;, which was released 18 February 2022. With the announcement of the album came the release of national Australian tour dates for 2022, which the band confirmed would be their last, while simultaneously confirming that the band will continue to make music together in the future. &quot;Resist: The Final Tour&quot; concluded on 3 October 2022 at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney with a 40-song, three-and-a-half-hour set from the band.

== Legacy ==
Midnight Oil initially faced resistance from the mainstream media, but went on to sell over 20 million albums. They were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2006, having won 11 ARIA Awards during their career. AllMusic noted that the band &quot;brought a new sense of political and social immediacy to pop music&quot;, and were &quot;inspirational and successful in their homeland&quot;, while critic Bernard Zuel wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s been said of Midnight Oil that &#x27;this is what Australia sounds like&#x27;.&quot; Author Tim Winton remarked, &quot;It was almost too much to believe that rock music could be about anything but itself. You know: life on the road and the inconvenience of VD. Dicks and chicks. Faux Americana. Finally someone was playing stuff that was musically idiosyncratic, fresh and strong. And authentic.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; founder Bob Guccione Jr. said of Midnight Oil, &quot;If they were from New Jersey they&#x27;d be bigger than U2.&quot; &quot;Guardian&quot; writer Andrew Street called them &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s most beloved bands&quot;.

The group have influenced international acts such as Green Day, R.E.M., Pearl Jam, Garbage, The Cranberries, Biffy Clyro, Candlebox, Maná, Hot Water Music and Shades Apart, as well as Australian performers like Crowded House, Powderfinger, The Living End, John Butler, DMA&#x27;s and Tim Freedman. R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe described Peter Garrett as a &quot;brilliant&quot; songwriter who is &quot;able to imagine a situation, put [himself] into it and write about it&quot;, adding, &quot;That, to me, is incredible&quot;. Crowded House singer Neil Finn went on to have multiple collaborations with Jim Moginie, whom he called &quot;a great guy and an amazing guitar player&quot;. Biffy Clyro vocalist Simon Neil said of Midnight Oil, &quot;Every night for about three weeks, driving home from the studio I would just put &#x27;Beds Are Burning&#x27; on, just on loop... They&#x27;re a really underrated band.&quot; The Living End founder Chris Cheney reported that his ensemble listened to &quot;a lot of [Midnight Oil&#x27;s] &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; and &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;, and were blown away by their fearlessness in not being shackled to a style&quot;. The group have also inspired artists outside the realm of popular music, including poet Daniel Nester and painter Nicholas Harding.

Midnight Oil&#x27;s songs have been covered by performers such as Pearl Jam (and frontman Eddie Vedder solo), U2, Patti Smith, The Killers, Imagine Dragons, Silverchair, Tom Morello (as The Nightwatchman), Billy Bragg and Anti-Flag. U2 singer Bono recorded a speech for Midnight Oil&#x27;s ARIA Hall of Fame induction, sections of which aired intermittently. He recited the chorus lyrics of their song &quot;Forgotten Years&quot; and hailed the outfit as an &quot;extraordinary&quot; band whose music &quot;brought people&#x27;s differences together; not to resolve them, just to get them in the same room, up each other&#x27;s noses&quot;. Killers vocalist Brandon Flowers said, &quot;I wish I&#x27;d written &#x27;Forgotten Years&#x27;... That song touches my heart.&quot; Midnight Oil&#x27;s music is the subject of 2001 tribute album &quot;The Power &amp; The Passion&quot;, which features covers by several mainstream rock acts from Australia and New Zealand, including Something for Kate, Regurgitator, Grinspoon, Jebediah, Augie March and Shihad. In 2009, a version of &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; was recorded by numerous musicians – among them Duran Duran, Lily Allen, Bob Geldof, Fergie, Mark Ronson and Scorpions – in protest of global warming and climate change.

Music journalist Kurt Loder once noted that Midnight Oil were &quot;reputed to be Australia&#x27;s most formidable live act&quot;; Tomas Mureika in AllMusic argued they were &quot;the tightest band on the planet for a time&quot;. Writer John O&#x27;Donnell said that the group&#x27;s performances &quot;quickly became the stuff of legend and earned the band a large and fiercely loyal following&quot;. Cold Chisel singer Jimmy Barnes called them &quot;one of the greatest bands ever and one of my favourite live bands in the world&quot;. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan referred to the 2016 announcement of Midnight Oil&#x27;s impending reformation as &quot;awesome news&quot;, noting that they are &quot;one of the greatest live bands I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Corgan had previously likened his dancing to that of Peter Garrett. Garrett&#x27;s onstage routine – described by critic Richard McGregor as &quot;mesmerising&quot; – incorporates a wild and eccentric dance style; &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Andrew Stafford wrote that Garrett has a &quot;unique dance step that captivated audiences for over 20 years&quot; prior to the group&#x27;s 2002 disbandment. His dancing was imitated in Parliament by Australian politicians Peter Costello and John Elferink.

<doc id="149495" wikidata="Q3312714" url="?curid=149495" title="Midnight Oil (Midnight Oil album)">
<text>Midnight Oil is the debut album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil which was recorded in 1977 and released in November 1978 on the band&#x27;s independent Powderworks label. It reached the top 50 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. The album was later distributed by CBS Records and issued as a CD. The LP has a blue cover, however, the CD has a black cover. Because of the blue cover, the former version is often referred to, by fans, as the &quot;blue album&quot; or &quot;the Blue Meanie&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Run by Night&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first minor hit in Australia and appeared on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart Top 100. It also had a video clip.

==Background==
&quot;Midnight Oil&quot; is the debut album by the Australian rock group of the same name. In late 1976, the line-up of Peter Garrett on vocals and synthesiser, Rob Hirst on drums, Andrew James on bass guitar and Jim Moginie on keyboards and lead guitar were performing together in Sydney as the progressive and surf rock group, Farm. They changed their name to Midnight Oil and began to develop an aggressive, punk-hard rock sound for their pub rock audiences. Guitarist Martin Rotsey joined in 1977 and Midnight Oil, with their manager Gary Morris, established their own record label Powderworks.

In June 1978 they entered the Alberts Studio in Sydney with producer Keith Walker, from local radio station 2JJ, to record their debut eponymous album, &quot;Midnight Oil&quot;, which was released by Powderworks in November 1978 and peaked at No. 43 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Midnight Oil&#x27;s first single &quot;Run by Night&quot; followed in December, but had very little chart success peaking at No. 100 on the related singles chart.

The band built a dedicated fan base, initially restricted to Sydney, which was extended to other Australian cities through constant touring – performing some 200 gigs in their first year. They became known for their furious live performances, which featured the two guitarists Moginie and Rotsey, the drumming and vocals of Hirst and the presence of the towering, bald Garrett as lead singer. The &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; LP disappointed some critics as it did not capture their powerful live performances, with undemanding playing and Garrett&#x27;s vocals sounding stilted.

==Recording==
In his autobiography, Moginie said the studio &quot;consisted of white rendered walls with a big mirror along one wall. There was no acoustical treatment, just a small living-room sized rectangle. Rob was at the far end of the room. Bear was across from me. Martin had his amp in another room at the end of a long lead, but was right next to me. Pete was in another room, singing along. The recording was pure joy.

==Reception==
Reviewed in Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, by Richard McGregor, it was described as, &quot;a reasonably accurate showcase for the talents of the band, and as such it emphasises all the strengths and weaknesses. The main problem seems to be Peter Garrett&#x27;s voice. Stripped of the menace of his mesmerising onstage presence, it often sounds fragile&quot;. McGregor noted that, &quot;Midnight Oil&#x27;s strength is in the kinetic energy of their playing&quot; and described them as &quot;an authentic Sydney band, unlike The Angels, Cold Chisel, and Dragon&quot;.

<doc id="149496" wikidata="Q3128977" url="?curid=149496" title="Head Injuries">
<text>Head Injuries is the second studio album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil, released in October 1979 on their own Powderworks label and distributed by Columbia Records. The album was produced by Leszek J. Karski, recorded at &#x27;Trafalgar Studios&#x27; in Sydney (Engineer: Peter J. Walker, Photography: Philip Morris). It was the last Midnight Oil album to feature founding bass guitarist Andrew James, who quit the band due to illness. It peaked at No. 36 on the Australian Kent Music Report and by mid-1980 had achieved gold status in Australia.

The iconic Midnight Oil logo with the open hand, appeared first on the back cover of the 1978 eponymous album &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; (Design: Jan Paul &amp; Midnight Oil). It is featured on all other albums, publications, merchandise and their touring equipment. It comes from a photo of Peter Garrett&#x27;s left hand on the inner sleeve of the first album. 
(On the back of &quot;Head Injuries&quot; the hand is incorrectly facing up, turned 90 degrees).

The album was certified platinum in Australia in 2014.

==Background==
&quot;Head Injuries&quot; is the second studio album by Australian rock band, Midnight Oil. They had formed in 1971 with Rob Hirst on drums, Andrew James on bass guitar, and Jim Moginie on keyboards and lead guitar. By 1972 they added Peter Garrett on vocals and synthesiser. The group began to develop an aggressive, punk-hard rock sound for their pub rock audiences. In 1977 Martin Rotsey joined on guitar. Their debut eponymous album, &quot;Midnight Oil&quot;, was released by their own label, Powderworks, in November 1978. The band built a dedicated fan base, initially restricted to Sydney, which was extended to other Australian cities through constant touring – performing some 200 gigs in their first year. They became known for their furious live performances, which featured the two guitarists Moginie and Rotsey, the drumming and backing vocals of Hirst and the presence of the towering, bald Garrett as lead singer. The first album had disappointed some critics as it did not capture their powerful live performances, with undemanding playing and Garrett&#x27;s vocals sounding stilted.

In October 1979 &quot;Head Injuries&quot; was released on Powderworks, it was produced by former Supercharge member, Leszek J. Karski. It mixed solid guitar rock with progressive flourishes and was an improvement by highlighting the group&#x27;s strengths and growth. It peaked at No. 36 on the Australian Kent Music Report and by mid-1980 had achieved gold status. In April 1980 founding bass guitarist James left because of ill-health and was replaced by Peter Gifford (ex-Huntress, Ross Ryan Band). Further interest in Midnight Oil was generated by the popular &quot;Bird Noises&quot; EP, also produced by Karski, which peaked at No. 28 on the Australian singles charts. One of its four tracks was the surf-instrumental &quot;Wedding Cake Island&quot; named after the rock outcrop in the ocean off Sydney&#x27;s Coogee Beach. The band&#x27;s third LP, &quot;Place without a Postcard&quot;, was released by CBS Records in November 1981.

In his autobiography, Moginie says, &quot;We sent Les a demo tape and he came back with a letter full of critical and funny comments. For &quot;Profiteers&quot; he wrote &#x27;too much hippy waffle&#x27;. He was brutally direct, all for tightening up arrangements and cutting out superfluous sections, and had a punk-pop ethos.&quot;

==Critical reception==

At the time of release, Stuart Coupe said, &quot;Right from the opening bars of &#x27;Cold Cold Change&#x27;, it&#x27;s obvious that &quot;Head Injuries&quot; is a major development for Midnight Oil. This really sounds like the band live – soaring guitars, relentless thrashing of drums, Peter&#x27;s strong voice... gee wiz, he&#x27;s learnt how to pronounce words. You can understand the lyrics without referring to the lyric sheet.&quot;

<doc id="149497" wikidata="Q3390731" url="?curid=149497" title="Place without a Postcard">
<text>Place Without a Postcard is the third studio album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil, released in November 1981 under Sprint Music and the Columbia Records label. It peaked at No. 12 on the Kent Music Report albums chart and the related singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be the One&quot; and &quot;Armistice Day&quot; reached the associated Top 40 chart.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s third LP &quot;Place Without a Postcard&quot;, released by CBS Records in November 1981, was recorded in Sussex with English producer Glyn Johns (The Rolling Stones, The Who) at a studio/barn on Johns&#x27; property. Creative tensions between the band and Johns plagued the recording and the group were not totally happy with the outcome. Johns had an arrangement with A&amp;M Records and they asked Midnight Oil to return to the studio to record material suitable for an American single release – the group refused and returned to Australia. &quot;Place without a Postcard&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the albums charts and related singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be the One&quot; (No. 40) and &quot;Armistice Day&quot; reached the Top 40 in Australia. Cover and other photography by Robert Butcher.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; praised the &quot;fatter sound and more focused songs.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;the experimentation yielded valuable lessons, and James Moginie, the group&#x27;s most prolific composer, also began to jell his distinctive guitar sound, as well as creatively exploring keyboards.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann wrote:

&quot;Midnight Oil went to England to record and turned to a major label (CBS Records) and a name producer (Glyn Johns) for its third full-length album. You might have expected this to make for a sonic breakthrough, but you&#x27;d be wrong. The band was experiencing growing pains, trying to stretch musically, and, at least at first, this made for a dilution of their hard rock focus moving toward a pop style they hadn&#x27;t fully developed. &quot;Place Without a Postcard&quot; had its share of powerfully performed songs, but its sound was light compared to the band&#x27;s first two albums, the stylistic experiments were not yet bearing fruit, and, with an emphasis placed on the vocals, Peter Garrett sounded overly strident.&quot;

<text>10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 is the fourth studio album by Midnight Oil, released in 1982 by Columbia Records. It hit number 3 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart during 171 total weeks. The band&#x27;s first US release, it peaked at number 178 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. At the Countdown Music Awards, it was nominated for Best Australian Album.

In October 2010, the album made the Top 40 of the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. It is listed in the Triple J Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time, 2011, at number 21. In December 2021, it was number 19 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;&#x27;s &quot;200 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; countdown.

==Content==
The album&#x27;s closing track &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Trying to Tell Me Something&quot; contains a note held by the group which continues into the album&#x27;s runout groove, and emulated on the CD version for just over 40 seconds. This is an approximation of a locked groove, a method used a number of times on vinyl albums (such as &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;) wherein the ending sound continues into the runout groove indefinitely until the turntable arm is lifted or the automatic return, present on some turntables, kicks in.

Garrett noted: &quot;We wanted, as a band, to make this album lyrically stronger, because these are fucking desperate times. It&#x27;s very important for us to get immediate, because we can&#x27;t go on making records like this for years and years and people can&#x27;t go on ignoring it.&quot;

==Reception==
Mark Deming at AllMusic wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s remarkably listenable and catchy, offering up one passionate anthem after another. The band&#x27;s politics are both well considered and unapologetically upfront throughout ... &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; was [Midnight Oil&#x27;s] first undeniably great album and still ranks with their very best.&quot; &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; added: &quot;This extraordinary collection of songs marked the evolution of Midnight Oil from explosive live band to studio act capable of great invention without ever sounding poxy.&quot;

David Fricke said the album &quot;sounds like the end of the world turned up to 10&quot;.

<text>Philip R. J. Pope is a British composer and actor.

==Education==

He was educated at Downside School and New College, Oxford.

==Performer ==
Pope appeared in the Oxford Revue in Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1978 and 1979, both with Angus Deayton. He performed in the BBC radio comedy series &quot;Radio Active&quot; (1980–87) and has also starred in a number of television comedy series, including &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; (1983–88), &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot; (1988–90), &quot;Round the Bend&quot; (1989–91) and &quot;KYTV&quot; (1989–93). He made guest appearances in &quot;Blackadder&quot; as the painter Leonardo Acropolis and Horatio Nelson, and in &quot;Shelley&quot; as pop star Hobo. Pope also appeared as Tony Angelino, the singing dustman, in the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, in 1991.

Pope toured the UK as a member of the cast of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Radio Series Live&quot;, for which he was also musical director. Pope portrayed several minor parts in the original radio series, as well as the subsequent adaptations of the later novels.

Pope appeared in the radio series &quot;Old Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; (1995–2009), and he has performed as a singer with the Thame Chamber Choir.

==Composer==
With Richard Curtis, Pope co-wrote the Hee Bee Gee Bees&#x27; single &quot;Meaningless Songs&quot; (the B-side of which was &quot;Posing in the Moonlight&quot;), released in 1980 to parody the style of a series of disco hits by The Bee Gees. The Hee Bee Gee Bees went on to record two albums spoofing numerous acts including Eagles, Michael Jackson, The Police, Status Quo and Supertramp. Pope also wrote or co-wrote many comic songs for &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, the latter of which included the British Number 1 hit single &quot;The Chicken Song&quot;, for which Rob Grant and Doug Naylor wrote the lyrics. Along with Simon Franglen, Pope wrote the main theme for &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, a three-series children&#x27;s comedy produced by Yorkshire Television for CITV, and later shown on Channel 4 and Nickelodeon.

Pope has also composed a large amount of music for radio and television, including the theme tunes for &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;, &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;KYTV&quot;, &quot;My Hero&quot; and &quot;Ruddy Hell! It&#x27;s Harry and Paul&quot;. He was the musical director and composer for &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, as well as the popular BBC children&#x27;s programmes &quot;Words and Pictures&quot;, &quot;Fimbles&quot; and &quot;The Roly Mo Show&quot;. Pope also provided the voice for the characters of Yugo and Migo from &quot;The Roly Mo Show&quot;.

Pope has scored numerous dramas and comedy-dramas for television, including &quot;Ted &amp; Ralph&quot;, &quot;Midnight Flight&quot;, &quot;Crazy for A Kiss&quot;, &quot;Hospital!&quot; and &quot;Margery &amp; Gladys&quot; as well as the film &quot;Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large&quot; (2000).

He was invited to arrange Snow Patrol&#x27;s &quot;Run 12&quot; remixed by Jacknife Lee, to which he contributed additional guitar.

On 5 October 2004, Pope featured in an episode of the radio series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, entitled &quot;Fit the Fifteenth&quot;, as one of three aliens from the planet of Krikkit. They sang a song called &quot;Under the Ink Black Sky&quot;, which Pope wrote and performed.

On 13 February 2013, Pope and his wife Rosie appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;From The Heart&quot;, a programme about organ donation and which featured their 20-year-old son Will, who was seriously unwell with a failing heart, had only months to live, and was in desperate need of heart transplantation. He finally obtained a new heart in a successful operation, and was slowly nursed back to health by his family.

In 2002, Pope and Jules de Jongh did stage productions with Iain Lauchlan at Imagine Theatre in Coventry.

In 2007, Pope composed the music for the radio adaptations of &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;.

In 2014, Pope appeared in &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot; as Mike Philips.

<text>Red Sails in the Sunset is the fifth studio album by Australian group Midnight Oil which was released in October 1984 under the Columbia Records label. It was recorded and produced in Tokyo, Japan and is significant for becoming their first No. 1 album in Australia – it also entered the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The cover image, by Japanese artist Tsunehisa Kimura, depicts Sydney Harbour after a hypothetical nuclear strike. Some of its tracks were performed live in January 1985 at a Sydney Harbour Goat Island concert to celebrate radio station Triple J&#x27;s 10th birthday, which was simulcast on ABC Television and subsequently re-broadcast on their then-Tuesday night music program &quot;Rock Arena&quot;. In 2004 the film footage later became part of a DVD album, &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;. &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; contains the only Midnight Oil tracks with lead vocals provided by their drummer Rob Hirst, &quot;When the Generals Talk&quot; and &quot;Kosciusko&quot;. The album spawned two singles, &quot;When the Generals Talk&quot; and &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; but neither appeared on the Australian singles chart.

At the 1984 Countdown Music Awards, the album was nominated for Best Australian Album.

==Background==
Midnight Oil released &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; in October 1984. It was recorded in June to August in Japan, and was produced by Nick Launay, who had worked on their breakthrough album, &quot;10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&quot; (1982). Columbia asked the band to return to the studio and record a more commercial single that could chart in America, but the band refused. Drummer Rob Hirst said that the band told Columbia to take it or leave it, and Columbia released the album as-is. It peaked at No. 1 for four weeks on the Australian charts, and charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Singles from the album were also released in the United States and United Kingdom but had no chart success. Whilst the album showed a reliance on technical wizardry, their lyrical stance was positive. The band continued to expand their sound and explore themes of politics, consumerism, militarism, the threat of nuclear war and environmental issues.

The album cover by Japanese artist Tsunehisa Kimura featured a photomontage of Sydney – both city and harbour – cratered and devastated after a hypothetical nuclear attack. A promotional video for &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; received airplay worldwide on cable music TV station MTV. In January 1985, Midnight Oil performed &quot;Oils on the Water&quot;, a concert on Goat Island in Port Jackson to celebrate Triple J&#x27;s tenth birthday, before a select audience of fans who had won tickets in a radio competition. The concert was filmed, simulcast on ABC-TV and Triple J, and released on video, which was remastered for their 2004 Best of Both Worlds&quot; DVD.

==Reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann found that group were &quot;ambitiously taking on a variety of lyrical causes in a variety of musical styles&quot; and the album&#x27;s &quot;martial rhythms, chanted vocals, and guitar textures, served as a jumping-off place&quot;. However Garrett&#x27;s vocals showed an &quot;unrelentingly judgmental tone ... sung with dead seriousness ... tended to douse the album&#x27;s potential enjoyment&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Don Shewey felt their music &quot;combines the postpunk abrasiveness of the Clash and Gang of Four with the Kinks&#x27; music-hall variety and the pure pop of groups like Cheap Trick&quot;. Shewey wrote that their &quot;references to local politics and history that stud the group&#x27;s songs and account in large part for its huge appeal down under may seem exotic or puzzling to Americans&quot;. Bill Wolfe of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;Midnight Oil is not only the &quot;Australian&quot; band of the &#x27;80s, it may very well be &quot;the&quot; band of the &#x27;80s. Period.&quot;

<text>Diesel and Dust is the sixth studio album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil, released in August 1987 by SPRINT Music label under Columbia Records. &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; was produced by Warne Livesey and the band. It is a concept album about the struggles of Indigenous Australians and environmental causes, issues important to the band. It drew inspiration from the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour of remote Indigenous communities with the Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland in 1986. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart for six weeks.

&quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; has been critically lauded since its release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editors named it the best album of 1988 (the year of its United States release), and later ranked it the 13th greatest record of the 1980s. In October 2010, &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; was listed at number 1 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. In December 2021, the album was listed at no. 5 in Rolling Stone Australia&#x27;s &quot;200 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; countdown.

==Background==
Midnight Oil spent several months in mid-1986 on the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour of outback Australia with indigenous music groups Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, playing to remote Aboriginal communities and seeing first hand the seriousness of the issues in health and living standards. The tour was criticised by some journalists for being a one-off event instead of a long-term attempt to build bridges between communities. The band was galvanised by the experiences and made them the basis of their next album, &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot;, which was released in August 1987 and produced by Warne Livesey and the band. The album focused on the need for recognition by white Australia of past injustices involving the Aboriginal nation and the need for reconciliation. Peter Gifford left the band before the album&#x27;s release due to extensive touring schedules, and was replaced on bass guitar by Bones Hillman, formerly of The Swingers. The track &quot;Gunbarrel Highway&quot; was not included on the United States version of the album, reportedly, because the line &quot;shit falls like rain on a world that is brown&quot; was deemed too offensive for US audiences.

&quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the Australian albums charts for six weeks, No. 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1988, and No. 19 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; was their biggest international hit single, peaking at No. 6 in Australia, No. 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; peaked at No. 4 in Australia, and charted on the Hot 100 and in the UK. &quot;Put Down that Weapon&quot; also charted in Australia, while &quot;Dreamworld&quot; charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks and at No. 16 on its Modern Rock Tracks.

At the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) 1988 Awards ceremony, Midnight Oil won &quot;Best Cover Art&quot; for &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot;. The album cover was designed by photographer Ken Duncan (b.1954, Mildura, VIC) and visual artist Wart (also known as Jen Waterhouse) (b.1958, Geelong, VIC). It also won &quot;Best Single&quot; and &quot;Best Song&quot; for &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot;. A fracas developed between Gary Morris, their manager who was accepting awards for Midnight Oil, and former &quot;Countdown&quot; compere Ian Meldrum who was presenting: Meldrum objected to Morris making political commentary from the podium.

There were concerns about &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; and Midnight Oil&#x27;s attempts to express indigenous issues to white urban audiences – namely, the question &quot;who holds the power to tell whose history?&quot; The lyrics of &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; tell the story of colonisation from an indigenous point of view, but some critics felt they reinforced the &quot;primitive&quot; stereotype. Use of the bullroarer was criticised as belonging to sacred rituals, and therefore not appropriate for rock songs. &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; had been written in response to a request by organisers of the 1985 ceremony to return control of Uluru to its indigenous caretakers; Midnight Oil originally resisted being added to a concert bill that they believed should contain indigenous groups, but the organisers insisted, arguing that the band would reach a wider audience within the predominantly Caucasian urban centres. Midnight Oil requested that all royalties from the song go to indigenous communities. In addition, two indigenous groups, Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, toured with them.

Following the 1988 American tour in support of &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; with Australian band Yothu Yindi, Midnight Oil launched the &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; album with various artists contributing, including Paul Kelly, Scrap Metal, Coloured Stone, Hunters &amp; Collectors, James Reyne, The Saints, Crowded House, and INXS. All sales proceeds were donated to the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations.

During 1989 to 1993 and 1998 to 2002, Peter Garrett, the band&#x27;s lead singer, was the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, whilst during 1993 to 1998 he was on the International Board of Greenpeace. In 1990 Midnight Oil played an impromptu lunchtime set in front of Exxon headquarters in New York with a banner reading, &quot;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick,&quot; protesting the Exxon Valdez oil spill the previous year.

&quot;Arctic World&quot; was written by Jim Moginie and Peter Garrett and runs for 4 minutes, 21 seconds. The song is about mining and oil drilling in Greenland and Alaska, and was meant to bring attention to the harmful effects these activities have on the environment.

==Reception==

According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, Midnight Oil &quot;reached the peak of its powers with the release of the groundbreaking &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot;... [it] is arguably one of the greatest Australian albums of all time. Powerful, dynamic and passionate songs like &#x27;Beds are Burning&#x27;, &#x27;Put Down that Weapon&#x27;, &#x27;Dreamworld&#x27;, &#x27;The Dead Heart&#x27; and &#x27;Sell My Soul&#x27; were statements of intent and a call to action backed by the strength of their convictions&quot;. Mark Deming of AllMusic called the record &quot;an artistic success and a triumph for leftist politics&quot; which &quot;makes clear that the bandmembers could apply their intelligence and passion to less aggressive material and still come up with forceful, compelling music&quot;.

<doc id="149502" wikidata="Q2698294" url="?curid=149502" title="Blue Sky Mining">
<text>Blue Sky Mining is the seventh studio album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil, released on 9 February 1990 under the Columbia Records label. It received high ratings from critics. In March of that year, the album peaked at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart for two weeks. A limited release of the record featured clear blue vinyl. This was the band&#x27;s first studio album with bassist and backing vocalist Bones Hillman, who would remain in the group until his death in 2020.

==Background==
&quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot;, produced by Warne Livesey, was released by CBS/Columbia on 9 February 1990. It peaked at number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums chart. It stayed at number one for two weeks in Australia and had Top 5 chart success in Sweden, Switzerland and Norway. It peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 28 on the UK charts. The album was &quot;more defiant and outspoken&quot; than their previous work; the single &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot; describes asbestos exposure in the Wittenoom mine tragedy. The lead single peaked at number eight on the ARIA singles charts, top 15 in Norway and Switzerland, number 47 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on both their Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and appeared on the UK charts. The second single, &quot;Forgotten Years&quot;, was more moderately successful, reaching number 26 on the ARIA singles chart, number 97 in the UK, number 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, and number one on the Modern Rock Tracks.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991, Midnight Oil won &#x27;Best Group&#x27; and an &#x27;Outstanding Achievement Award&#x27;, and were awarded &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27;, &#x27;Best Video&#x27; and &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; for &quot;Blue Sky Mining&quot;. Manager Gary Morris, accepting awards for Midnight Oil, was criticised for a speech lasting 20 minutes.

==Track listing==

** Some early Australian copies included the track &quot;You May Not Be Released&quot; - it was the B-side to a 12-inch issue of &quot;Forgotten Years,&quot; and it is believed that this only appeared on the first 1,000 LP copies. It also appeared on early cassette copies and CDs.

<doc id="149503" wikidata="Q7438903" url="?curid=149503" title="Scream in Blue">
<text>Scream in Blue is a live album by Midnight Oil that was released in May 1992 under the Columbia Records label. It contains songs carefully culled from 5 live concerts recorded over a 9-year period. The audiences sound quite large, but also included is material from a 1990 protest concert held on the street in front of Exxon headquarters in New York City. The album is mixed so as to sound like one continuous concert.

The album starts with a scathing, nearly atonal electric guitar solo and never lets up (until the final, more subdued studio bonus track &quot;Burnie&quot;), careening through a hooky hard-rock minefield of clever, socially conscious lyrics sung with passion over a rip-roaring but very tight band. The tracks were evidently recorded through the sound systems of the various concerts, then mixed to a clear and well-balanced sound in the style of audio verité. Also, at the end of &quot;Only the Strong&quot;, a short sound sample is inserted containing some chanting taken from &quot;The Drum Song&quot; with permission from Phil Fontaine.

==Reception==
Allmusic&#x27;s review by Roch Parisien is in praise of the album, saying that it perfectly captured the edge and power of Midnight Oil&#x27;s live performances, which consistently outshone the popular studio versions of the same material.

<doc id="149504" wikidata="Q1460738" url="?curid=149504" title="Spiral model">
<text>The spiral model is a risk-driven software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.

== History ==
This model was first described by Barry Boehm in his 1986 paper, &quot;A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement.&quot; In 1988 Boehm published a similar paper to a wider audience. These papers introduce a diagram that has been reproduced in many subsequent publications discussing the spiral model.

These early papers use the term &quot;process model&quot; to refer to the spiral model as well as to incremental, waterfall, prototyping, and other approaches. However, the spiral model&#x27;s characteristic risk-driven blending of other process models&#x27; features is already present: 

In later publications, Boehm describes the spiral model as a &quot;process model generator,&quot; where choices based on a project&#x27;s risks generate an appropriate process model for the project. Thus, the incremental, waterfall, prototyping, and other process models are special cases of the spiral model that fit the risk patterns of certain projects.

Boehm also identifies a number of misconceptions arising from oversimplifications in the original spiral model diagram. He says the most dangerous of these misconceptions are:
* that the spiral is simply a sequence of waterfall increments;
* that all project activities follow a single spiral sequence;
* that every activity in the diagram must be performed, and in the order shown.
While these misconceptions may fit the risk patterns of a few projects, they are not true for most projects.

In a National Research Council report this model was extended to include risks related to human users.

To better distinguish them from &quot;hazardous spiral look-alikes,&quot; Boehm lists six characteristics common to all authentic applications of the spiral model.

== The six invariants of spiral model==
Authentic applications of the spiral model are driven by cycles that always display six characteristics. Boehm illustrates each with an example of a &quot;dangerous spiral look-alike&quot; that violates the invariant.

===Define artifacts concurrently===
Sequentially defining the key artifacts for a project often increases the possibility of developing a system that meets stakeholder &quot;win conditions&quot; (objectives and constraints).

This invariant excludes “hazardous spiral look-alike” processes that use a sequence of incremental waterfall passes in settings where the underlying assumptions of the waterfall model do not apply. Boehm lists these assumptions as follows:
# The requirements are known in advance of implementation.
# The requirements have no unresolved, high-risk implications, such as risks due to cost, schedule, performance, safety, user interfaces, organizational impacts, etc.
# The nature of the requirements will not change very much during development or evolution.
# The requirements are compatible with all the key system stakeholders’ expectations, including users, customer, developers, maintainers, and investors.
# The right architecture for implementing the requirements is well understood.
# There is enough calendar time to proceed sequentially.
In situations where these assumptions do apply, it is a project risk not to specify the requirements and proceed sequentially. The waterfall model thus becomes a risk-driven special case of the spiral model.

===Perform four basic activities in every cycle===
This invariant identifies the four activities that must occur in each cycle of the spiral model:
# Consider the win conditions of all success-critical stakeholders.
# Identify and evaluate alternative approaches for satisfying the win conditions.
# Identify and resolve risks that stem from the selected approach(es).
# Obtain approval from all success-critical stakeholders, plus commitment to pursue the next cycle.
Project cycles that omit or shortchange any of these activities risk wasting effort by pursuing options that are unacceptable to key stakeholders, or are too risky.

Some &quot;hazardous spiral look-alike&quot; processes violate this invariant by excluding key stakeholders from certain sequential phases or cycles. For example, system maintainers and administrators might not be invited to participate in definition and development of the system. As a result, the system is at risk of failing to satisfy their win conditions.

===Risk determines level of effort===
For any project activity (e.g., requirements analysis, design, prototyping, testing), the project team must decide how much effort is enough. In authentic spiral process cycles, these decisions are made by minimizing overall risk.

For example, investing additional time testing a software product often reduces the risk due to the marketplace rejecting a shoddy product. However, additional testing time might increase the risk due to a competitor&#x27;s early market entry. From a spiral model perspective, testing should be performed until the total risk is minimized, and no further. 

&quot;Hazardous spiral look-alikes&quot; that violate this invariant include evolutionary processes that ignore risk due to scalability issues, and incremental processes that invest heavily in a technical architecture that must be redesigned or replaced to accommodate future increments of the product.

===Risk determines degree of details===
For any project artifact (e.g., requirements specification, design document, test plan), the project team must decide how much detail is enough. In authentic spiral process cycles, these decisions are made by minimizing overall risk.

Considering requirements specification as an example, the project should precisely specify those features where risk is reduced through precise specification (e.g., interfaces between hardware and software, interfaces between prime and sub-contractors). Conversely, the project should not precisely specify those features where precise specification increases the risk (e.g., graphical screen layouts, the behavior of off-the-shelf components).

===Use anchor point milestones===
Boehm&#x27;s original description of the spiral model did not include any process milestones. In later refinements, he introduces three anchor point milestones that serve as progress indicators and points of commitment. These anchor point milestones can be characterized by key questions.
# Life Cycle Objectives. Is there a sufficient definition of a technical and management approach to satisfying everyone&#x27;s win conditions? If the stakeholders agree that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, then the project has cleared this LCO milestone. Otherwise, the project can be abandoned, or the stakeholders can commit to another cycle to try to get to &quot;Yes.&quot;
# Life Cycle Architecture. Is there a sufficient definition of the preferred approach to satisfying everyone&#x27;s win conditions, and are all significant risks eliminated or mitigated? If the stakeholders agree that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, then the project has cleared this LCA milestone. Otherwise, the project can be abandoned, or the stakeholders can commit to another cycle to try to get to &quot;Yes.&quot;
# Initial Operational Capability. Is there sufficient preparation of the software, site, users, operators, and maintainers to satisfy everyone&#x27;s win conditions by launching the system? If the stakeholders agree that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, then the project has cleared the IOC milestone and is launched. Otherwise, the project can be abandoned, or the stakeholders can commit to another cycle to try to get to &quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Hazardous spiral look-alikes&quot; that violate this invariant include evolutionary and incremental processes that commit significant resources to implementing a solution with a poorly defined architecture. 

The three anchor point milestones fit easily into the Rational Unified Process (RUP), with LCO marking the boundary between RUP&#x27;s Inception and Elaboration phases, LCA marking the boundary between Elaboration and Construction phases, and IOC marking the boundary between Construction and Transition phases.

===Focus on the system and its life cycle===
This invariant highlights the importance of the overall system and the long-term concerns spanning its entire life cycle. It excludes &quot;hazardous spiral look-alikes&quot; that focus too much on the initial development of software code. These processes can result from following published approaches to object-oriented or structured software analysis and design while neglecting other aspects of the project&#x27;s process needs.

<text>Earth and Sun and Moon is the eighth studio album by Australian rock group, Midnight Oil, that was released in April 1993 under the Columbia Records label. It peaked at No.2 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

==Background==
Midnight Oil&#x27;s &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; album, produced with Nick Launay, was released in April 1993 and peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart, top 20 in Sweden and Switzerland, top 50 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and top 30 in the UK albums chart. The single &quot;Truganini&quot; referenced multiple issues, including the &#x27;last&#x27; Tasmanian Aboriginal, the treatment of indigenous artist Albert Namatjira, the Australian flag debate, and republicanism. Liner notes for the single claimed &quot;Truganini was the sole surviving Tasmanian Aborigine, the last of her race, when she died in 1876.&quot;

The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, representing over 7000 contemporary Tasmanians, called for the single to be boycotted as it perpetuated a &#x27;white&#x27; myth about the extinction of Tasmanian Aborigines. Their Native Title claims hinged upon establishing links with ancestral lands. Gary Morris, their manager, responded with, &quot;My suggestion to these people is to stop shooting themselves in the foot and let a band like Midnight Oil voice its appeal to White Australia on behalf of Black Australia&quot;.

Critics contended that Morris disparaged Indigenous Australians&#x27; ability to represent themselves and overestimated Midnight Oil&#x27;s ambassadorial powers while diminishing their errors, while some indigenous activists saw benefit in Midnight Oil&#x27;s highlighting of the issues. &quot;Truganini&quot; released in March peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA singles charts, No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks and No. 4 on their Modern Rock Tracks charts, and top 30 for the UK charts.

==Reception==
Tom Demalon of AllMusic remarked, &quot;If &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; isn&#x27;t Midnight Oil&#x27;s best effort, it&#x27;s certainly close. The band still sticks to themes that are close to its heart -- the environment, native peoples, and other social causes -- but rarely has it managed to fashion an album full of songs that are as musically intoxicating.&quot;

Andrew McMillen of &quot;The Australian&quot; said, &quot;At a time when Nirvana et al turned toward angst and distortion, the Oils opted for a bounty of rich vocal harmonies and highly melodic rock songs, including two bass-led career highlights that bookend its eighth album.&quot;

<doc id="149506" wikidata="Q355300" url="?curid=149506" title="Richard Curtis">
<text>Richard Whalley Anthony Curtis (born 8 November 1956) is a British screenwriter. One of Britain&#x27;s most successful comedy writers, he is known primarily for romantic comedy films, among them &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994), &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001), &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; (2004), &quot;About Time&quot; (2013), and &quot;Yesterday&quot; (2019). He is also known for the drama &quot;War Horse&quot; (2011) and for having co-written the sitcoms &quot;Blackadder&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, and &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;. His early career saw him write material for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

In 2007, Curtis received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. He is the co-founder, with Sir Lenny Henry, of the British charity Comic Relief, which has raised over £1 billion. At the 2008 Britannia Awards, he received the BAFTA Humanitarian Award for co-creating Comic Relief and for his contributions to other charitable causes. In 2024, he received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Curtis was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest figures in British comedy in 2003. In 2008, he was ranked number 12 in a list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot; compiled by &quot;The Telegraph&quot;. In 2012, he was one of the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Curtis was born in Wellington, New Zealand. He is the son of Glyness S. and Anthony J. Curtis. His father was a Czechoslovak refugee who moved to Australia when aged 13 and became an executive at Unilever. Curtis and his family lived in several different countries during his childhood, including Sweden and the Philippines, before moving to the United Kingdom when he was 11.

Curtis attended Papplewick School in Ascot, Berkshire (as did his younger brother Jamie). For a short period in the 1970s, he lived in Warrington, Cheshire, where he attended Appleton Grammar School (now Bridgewater High School). He lived at Merricourt on Windmill Lane, Appleton, Warrington, during this time. His university friend Rowan Atkinson was an occasional visitor to the house.

He then won a scholarship to Harrow School, where he joined the editorial team of &quot;The Harrovian&quot;, the weekly school magazine, and this, he asserts, is &quot;where I learned all the skills that made me a sketch writer. I did reviews, comment pieces and funny articles where I&#x27;d try to conjure something out of nothing.&quot; While at Harrow, Curtis directed a school performance of Joe Orton&#x27;s play &quot;The Erpingham Camp&quot;; this controversial choice was given the &#x27;green light&#x27; by his classics master, James Morwood. Later, Curtis commented that Morwood&#x27;s support had helped him understand that it was all right &quot;to push boundaries and to be funny&quot;. Curtis did not approve of fagging at the school, and at 18, when he became head of his house, he banned it.

He achieved a first-class Bachelor of Arts in English Language and Literature at Christ Church, Oxford. At the University of Oxford, he met and began working with Rowan Atkinson, after they both joined the scriptwriting team of the Etceteras revue, part of the Experimental Theatre Club. He appeared in the company&#x27;s &quot;After Eights&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse in May 1976.

==Early writing career==
Collaborating with Rowan Atkinson in The Oxford Revue, he appeared alongside him at his breakthrough Edinburgh Fringe show. As a result, he was commissioned to co-write the BBC Radio 3 series &quot;The Atkinson People&quot; with Atkinson in 1978, which was broadcast in 1979. He then began to write comedy for film and TV. He was a regular writer on the BBC comedy series &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, where he wrote many of the show&#x27;s satirical sketches, often with Rowan Atkinson. Curtis co-wrote with Philip Pope for The Hee Bee Gee Bees&#x27; song &quot;Meaningless Songs (In Very High Voices)&quot;, released in 1980, to parody the style of a series of The Bee Gees&#x27; disco hits. In 1984 and 1985, Curtis wrote material for ITV&#x27;s satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

First with Atkinson and later with Ben Elton, Curtis then wrote the &quot;Blackadder&quot; series from 1983 to 1989, each season focusing on a different era in British history. Atkinson played the lead throughout, but Curtis was the only writer who participated in every episode of &quot;Blackadder&quot;. The pair continued their collaboration with the comedy series &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, which ran from 1990 to 1995.

Curtis had by then already begun writing feature films. His first was &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; (1989), a romantic comedy starring Jeff Goldblum, Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson and produced by Working Title films. The TV movie &quot;Bernard and the Genie&quot; followed in 1991.

In 1994, Curtis created and co-wrote &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; for comedian Dawn French, which was a great success. In an online poll conducted in 2004 Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom, it was voted the third-best sitcom in British history and &quot;Blackadder&quot; the second-best, making Curtis the only screenwriter to create two shows in the poll&#x27;s top 10 programmes.

==Film career==
Curtis achieved his breakthrough success with the romantic comedy &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral.&quot; The 1994 film, starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, was produced on a limited budget by the British production company Working Title Films. Curtis chose Mike Newell to direct the film after watching his TV film &quot;Ready When You Are, Mr. McGill&quot;. &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; proved to be the top-grossing British film in history at that time. It made an international star of Grant, and Curtis&#x27; Oscar nomination for the script catapulted him to prominence (though the Oscar went to Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;). The film was also nominated for Best Picture, but lost to &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.
Curtis&#x27; next film was also for Working Title, which has remained his artistic home ever since. 1997&#x27;s &quot;Bean&quot; brought Mr. Bean to the big screen and was a huge hit around the world. He continued his association with Working Title writing the 1999 romantic comedy &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, which broke the record set by &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; to become the top-grossing British film. The story of a lonely travel bookstore owner who falls in love with the world&#x27;s most famous movie star was directed by Roger Michell.

Curtis next co-wrote the screen adaptation of the international bestseller &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; for Working Title. Curtis knew the novel&#x27;s writer Helen Fielding. Indeed, he has credited her with saying that his original script for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; was too upbeat and needed the addition of the titular funeral.

Two years later, Curtis re-teamed with Working Title to write and direct &quot;Love Actually&quot;. Curtis has said in interviews that the sprawling, multi-character structure of &quot;Love Actually&quot; owes a debt to his favourite film, Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;. The film featured a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; of UK actors, including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Andrew Lincoln, Alan Rickman and Keira Knightley, in a loosely connected series of stories about people in and out of love in London in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Its regular festive screening has seen it labelled as being arguably a modern-day Christmas staple.

Curtis followed this in 2004 with work as co-writer on &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. Curtis then wrote the screenplay to &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot;, a television film directed by David Yates and produced by the BBC and HBO as part of the Make Poverty History campaign&#x27;s Live 8 efforts in 2005. The film stars Bill Nighy as a civil servant and Kelly Macdonald as a young woman he falls in love with at a fictional G8 summit in Iceland. Macdonald&#x27;s character pushes him to ask whether the developed countries of the world cannot do more to help the most impoverished. The film was timed to air just before the Gleneagles G8 summit in 2005. It received three Emmy Awards in 2006, including Outstanding Made for Television Movie, Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for Kelly Macdonald and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special trophy for Curtis himself. Curtis said of Yates&#x27; direction that he made &quot;a much more beautiful film, and a surprising film and a better film than I could possibly have made.&quot;
In May 2007, he received the BAFTA Fellowship at the British Academy Television Awards in recognition of his successful career in film and television and his charity efforts. Curtis next co-wrote with Anthony Minghella an adaptation of Alexander McCall Smith&#x27;s novel, &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot;, which Minghella shot in mid-2007 in Botswana. It premiered on the BBC on 23 March 2008, just days after Minghella&#x27;s death. The film did not run in the US until early 2009, when HBO aired it as the pilot of a resulting six-episode TV series with the same cast, on which Curtis served as executive producer.
His second film as writer/director, &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;, was released in 2009. The film was set in 1966 in the era of British pirate radio. It followed a group of DJs on a pirate radio station run from a boat in the North Sea. The film starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Rhys Ifans, Gemma Arterton and Kenneth Branagh. The film was a commercial and critical disappointment in the UK. Curtis re-edited the film for its US release where it was re-titled &quot;Pirate Radio&quot;, but also failed to find an audience. He followed that with &quot;War Horse&quot;, which he rewrote for director Steven Spielberg based on an earlier script by playwright Lee Hall. Curtis was recommended to Spielberg by DreamWorks Studio executive Stacey Snider, who had worked with Curtis during her time at Universal Studios. Curtis&#x27;s work on the World War I-set &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; meant he was already familiar with the period.

Curtis then wrote &quot;Mary and Martha&quot;, a BBC/HBO television film directed by Phillip Noyce. The film starred Hilary Swank and Brenda Blethyn as two women who bond after they both lose their sons to malaria. The film was broadcast in the UK on 1 March 2013. He next wrote and directed &quot;About Time&quot;, a romantic comedy/drama about time travel and family love. It starred Rachel McAdams, Domhnall Gleeson, Bill Nighy, Tom Hollander, Margot Robbie, Lydia Wilson and Vanessa Kirby. It was released in the UK on 4 September 2013. Soon after the film came out, Curtis delivered a screenwriting lecture as part of the BAFTA and BFI Screenwriters&#x27; Lecture Series. He followed that with &quot;Trash&quot;, which he adapted from the novel by Andy Mulligan for director Stephen Daldry. With three unknown Brazilian children in the lead roles, the film co-starred Wagner Moura, Rooney Mara and Martin Sheen. It was filmed in 2013 in Rio de Janeiro and released in Brazil on 9 October 2014 and in the UK on 30 January 2015.

He next wrote &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Esio Trot&quot;, a BBC television film adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s novel. Receiving acclaim, the film starred Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench, with James Corden as the narrator, was directed by Dearbhla Walsh and was broadcast on BBC on 1 January 2015. His next film, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, was adapted from an original screenplay by Jack Barth (who received only &quot;co-story&quot; credit, reportedly at Curtis&#x27;s insistence). The film, directed by Danny Boyle and starring Lily James and Himesh Patel, follows a young man who discovers that the entire world except for him has no memory of the Beatles, allowing him to become a global pop star by performing their songs as his own. While Barth&#x27;s original screenplay depicted an obscure musician unable to capitalize on his windfall, Curtis&#x27;s more conventional script featured an independent musician unable to control his own career once the music industry takes over. It began filming on 21 April 2018 and was released on 28 June 2019.

==Campaigning==
Curtis together with Lenny Henry are co-founders and co-creators of Comic Relief. Curtis is also a founder of Make Poverty History. He organised the Live 8 concerts with Bob Geldof to publicise poverty, particularly in Africa, and pressure G8 leaders to adopt his proposals for ending it. He has written of his work in &quot;The Observer&quot; in the Global development section in 2005.

Curtis helped spearhead the launch of the Robin Hood tax campaign in 2010. The campaign fights for a 0.05% tax levied on each bank trade ranging from shares to foreign exchange and derivatives that could generate $700bn worldwide and be spent on measures to combat domestic and international poverty as well as fight climate change.

In October 2010, a short film created by Curtis titled &quot;No Pressure&quot; was released by the 10:10 campaign in Britain to promote climate change politics. The film depicted a series of scenes in which people were asked if they were going to participate in the 10:10 campaign, told there was &quot;no pressure&quot; to do so, but if they did not, they were blown up at the press of a red button.
Reaction was mixed, but the video was swiftly removed from the organisation&#x27;s website.

In March 2011, Curtis apologised following a complaint by the British Stammering Association about 2011 Comic Relief&#x27;s opening skit, a parody by Lenny Henry of the 2010 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;.

He talked the producer of &quot;American Idol&quot; into doing a show wherein celebrities journeyed into Africa and experienced the level of poverty for themselves. It was called &quot;American Idol: Idol Gives Back&quot;. In 2014, Curtis publicly backed &quot;Hacked Off&quot; and its campaign in support of UK press self-regulation by &quot;safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.&quot;

In August 2014, Curtis was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In 2020, Curtis co-founded the climate finance campaign Make My Money Matter. According to Campaign Director David Hayman the campaign &quot;is all about helping people understand the impact of their money and how helping them think that if they are saving for retirement, what kind of retirement is their money saving for? What kind of world is it building?&quot;

In 2021, he joined the Rewriting Extinction campaign to fight the climate and biodiversity crisis through comics. He wrote a comic story in collaboration with War and Peas named &quot;Woke&quot;. It was printed in the book &quot;The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World&quot; which was released on 28 October 2021 by DK.

==Personal life==
Curtis lives in Notting Hill and has a country house in Walberswick, Suffolk with broadcaster Emma Freud whom he married in September 2023. They have four children, including writer and activist Scarlett. He had previously dated Anne Strutt, now Baroness Jenkin of Kennington, before her marriage to Sir Bernard Jenkin, a Member of Parliament (MP). Curtis has named characters in his writing Bernard (reputedly after Bernard Jenkin). It is claimed he used the Jenkins&#x27; wedding as inspiration for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. He is irreligious.

<text>Breathe is the ninth studio album by Australian rock band, Midnight Oil, which was released on 15 October 1996 under the Columbia Records label. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart and appeared in the top 40 on the New Zealand and Swiss Albums Charts. The album was produced by Malcolm Burn and according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, it had a loose, raw style with almost a low-key sound.

==Background==
Australian rock band, Midnight Oil, released their ninth studio album, &quot;Breathe&quot;, on 15 October 1996, which appeared three-and-a-half years after their eighth album, &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot;. The line-up for the album was Peter Garrett on lead vocals, Bones Hillman on bass guitar and vocals, Rob Hirst on drums and vocals, Jim Moginie on guitars, keyboards, and vocals, and Martin Rotsey on guitars. The album was produced by Malcolm Burn and released for Sprint Music by Columbia Records.

==Reception==

&quot;Breathe&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart and appeared in the top 40 on the New Zealand and Swiss Albums Charts. In Australia it was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 copies by ARIA. AllMusic&#x27;s reviewer, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, described it as having &quot;a more direct sound while keeping the anthemic melodicism ... less ambitious than its predecessor, yet also more forceful&quot;. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, it had a loose, raw style with almost a low-key sound. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Tom Moon compared it to earlier albums which &quot;were filled with wide-screen screeds, the lectures on &quot;Breathe&quot; are offset by evocative mood pieces ... In fusing the hurtling momentum of punk with the righteousness of old-timey hymns, the Oils have arrived at a potent music that uplifts as it agitates&quot;.

<text>Redneck Wonderland is the tenth studio album by Midnight Oil that was released in July 1998 under the Columbia Records label, which peaked at No.7 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The title of the album was inspired by a wall graffiti, a picture of which can be seen in the promotional Oil Rag Vol. VI issued along with album release.
The album was certified Gold in Australia in 2014. The album&#x27;s eponymous song was ranked number 93 in Triple M&#x27;s &quot;Ozzest 100&quot;, the &#x27;most Australian&#x27; songs of all time. The album marked a shift to an electronic influenced hard rock style.

<doc id="149513" wikidata="Q827736" url="?curid=149513" title="Eliezer ben Nathan">
<text>Eliezer ben Nathan () of Mainz (1090–1170), or Ra&#x27;avan (), was a halakist and liturgical poet. As an early Rishon, he was a contemporary of the Rashbam and Rabbeinu Tam, and one of the earliest of the Tosafists. He was the son-in-law of Eliakim b. Joseph of Mainz, a fellow student of Rashi. Through his four daughters Eliezer became the ancestor of several learned families which exerted a great influence upon religious life in the subsequent centuries. One of his great-grandsons was Asher b. Jehiel (ROSH), father of R. Jacob, author of the &quot;Ṭurim&quot;.

In or around 1160, a synod was held in Troyes as part of the &quot;Takkanot Shum&quot;. This synod was led by Rabbeinu Tam, his brother, Rashbam, and Ra&#x27;avan. Over 250 rabbis from communities all over France attended as well. A number of communal decrees were enacted at the synod covering both Jewish-Gentile relations as well as matters relating internally to the Jewish community.

== &quot;Even haEzer&quot; ==
&quot;Even haEzer&quot; is a collection of responsa, found in two sections at the beginning and end of the work, and legal decisions, arranged in the middle as a commentary to the Babylonian Talmud. This book, which Eliezer compiled from smaller topical pamphlets, was also known as &quot;Tzaf&#x27;nat Paneah&quot; in the medieval period and continues to be called &quot;Sefer Ra&#x27;avan&quot;. Eliezer introduces the work as follows:I called this book &quot;Even haEzer&quot; (1Sam 7:12; lit. &quot;stone of the help&quot;) because my Rock helped me to uncover the purposes of our ancient practices, and the deep secrets of both our monetary and our ritual law, and the legal books of Moed, Nezikin, and Nashim, which future generations will need to understand.Eliezer proves himself conscientious and careful in his decisions, and in his reverence for tradition he is inclined to accept extremely rigid interpretations of the Law. He interprets the Biblical injunction &quot;Forsake not the teaching of thy mother,&quot; as meaning, &quot;What the older rabbis have prohibited we must not permit&quot; (No. 10). The chapters on civil law contain many an interesting document, and also a statement of commercial relations occasioned by various trials. They contain precise statements of the prices of goods and accurate information concerning commercial usages in the Rhineland and in distant Slavic countries; e.g., concerning the golden trade routes in Strasburg and Speyer (fol. 145b); the coinage of the time; and the export trade with Galicia and southern Russia (No. 5). Slavic customs and character are also discussed in connection with ritual matters. Among the decisions are some containing interpretations of Biblical and Talmudic sayings; one of them (No. 119) even presenting a connected commentary on Proverbs 30:1-6, in which Saadia Gaon&#x27;s view is cited—namely, that Isthiel and Ucal were the names of two men who addressed philosophical questions to Agur ben Jakeh.

The work mentions the year 1152, and must therefore have been completed after that date. The year 1247, which occurs in the Prague edition, was the insertion of a later copyist. In the subsequent centuries Eliezer came to be regarded as a great authority, but his work was little known. Not until its importance had been specially urged by the most influential rabbis of Poland—Mordecai Jafe, Samuel Eliezer Edels (Maharsha), Solomon Ephraim Luntschitz, among others, in a formal appeal issued from Posen in 1609—was its publication undertaken. The book survives completely in only one manuscript (MS HAB Guelf. 5.7).

== As liturgical poet ==
Eliezer wrote numerous yoẓerot, seliḥot, and other piyyuṭim; very few of them, however, have been incorporated in the German and Polish liturgy. The &quot;Akapperah Pene Melek&quot; in the seliḥot to the musaf of the Day of Atonement is an example. His poetical productions are valuable only as an index to his devout nature and to his estimate of the importance of the liturgy. They are distinguished for neither originality, elevation of thought, nor elegance of diction. With their allusions to haggadic interpretations, their employment of payyeṭan phraseology, acrostics, rimes, and similar mechanical devices, they differ little from many other liturgical productions. Some of these poems he seems to have written on special occasions. Thus, one piyyuṭ composed for a circumcision occurring on the Sabbath bears at the close the cipher &quot;ABN,&quot; and the words &quot;Long live my child Eliakim.&quot; Altogether twenty-five piyyuṭim of his are known. One of his seliḥot depicts the persecutions of the First Crusade (1096); another, those of 1146.

== As commentator ==
To Eliezer is attributed the commentary on the Maḥzor published in Ostroh in 1830. Some of Eliezer&#x27;s expositions are mentioned in a commentary on the festal prayers called &quot;Ḳorban Aharon.&quot; Mention is also made of a commentary on Abot, from which Jehiel Morawtschik, in his &quot;Minḥah Ḥadashah,&quot; written in 1576 after a manuscript of the year 1145, makes quotations.

== As chronicler: persecution of 1096 ==
Eliezer is also supposed to be the author of a history of the terrible events of 1096, the year of the Rhineland massacres, part of the People&#x27;s Crusade. It expressed great antipathy towards the Christian crusaders, and wrestled with the matter of why God would allow so many Jews to be massacred. The persecutions of the Jewish communities in the towns along the Rhine, the horrible butcheries that were perpetrated, are faithfully depicted here in chronological order.

In this work various acrostic verses contain the name &quot;Eliezer b. Nathan.&quot; In deference to a passage in Joseph ha-Kohen&#x27;s &quot;Emek haBacha,&quot; p. 31, which makes a certain Eleazar ha-Levi the author, some writers (as Landshuth and H. Grätz) have denied Eliezer&#x27;s authorship of this chronicle. This view, however, was refuted around 1900. The chronicle was first edited by Adolph Jellinek; and was republished as &quot;Hebräische Berichte über die Judenverfolgungen Während der Kreuzzüge,&quot; by A. Neubauer and Stern, together with a German translation.

<doc id="149522" wikidata="Q1398356" url="?curid=149522" title="John Leland (antiquary)">
<text>John Leland or Leyland (13 September,  – 18 April 1552) was an English poet and antiquary.

Leland has been described as &quot;the father of English local history and bibliography&quot;. His &quot;Itinerary&quot; provided a unique source of observations and raw materials for many subsequent antiquaries, and introduced the county as the basic unit for studying the local history of England, an idea that has been influential ever since.

==Early life and education==
Most evidence for Leland&#x27;s life and career comes from his own writings, especially his poetry. He was born in London on 13 September, most probably in about 1503, and had an older brother, also named John. Having lost both his parents at an early age, he and his brother were raised by Thomas Myles. Leland was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, under its first headmaster, William Lily. It was here that he already met some of his future benefactors, notably William Paget.

Leland was subsequently sent to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1522 (BA). While studying there, he was for a short time imprisoned, having accused a certain knight of collaborating with Richard de la Pole, the Yorkist claimant to the throne (d. 1525). He proceeded to Lambeth, London, serving Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, as tutor to his son Thomas. When the duke died in 1524, the king sent Leland to Oxford, where as Anthony Wood later claimed from tradition, he became a fellow of All Souls College. He would later deplore the state of education at Oxford, which he felt was too conservative in its approach to classical studies.

Between 1526 and 1528, Leland proceeded to Paris, studying along with many fellow expatriates, both English and German. His original plan to study in Italy, too, never succeeded. Leland honed his skills at composing Latin poetry and sought the acquaintance of humanist scholars whom he much admired, such as Guillaume Budé and Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples. A scholar of particular importance for Leland was François Dubois (Silvius), professor at the Collège de Tournai, who had a profound effect on his poetic as well as antiquarian interests. While in France, Leland kept in touch with his friends and sponsors in England, probably including Thomas Wolsey (d. 1530), Cardinal and Lord Chancellor, who made him rector at Laverstoke, Hampshire.

==Royal appointment==
By 1529, Leland had returned to England. When Wolsey fell from the king&#x27;s favour in that year, Leland appears to have sought the patronage of Thomas Cromwell, a relationship which would help explain his rising fortunes over the next few years. He was appointed one of the chaplains to King Henry VIII, who gave him the rectory of Peuplingues (Pepeling), in the marshes of Calais (though he may never have visited the place). In 1533, Leland received papal dispensation for four benefices, on condition that he became subdeacon within two years and priest within seven. He was appointed prebendary of Wilton Abbey in Wiltshire in 1535 and received two adjacent benefices.

Leland and Nicholas Udall composed verses to be read or recited at the pageant of Anne Boleyn&#x27;s arrival in London in 1533, which was staged for the occasion of her coronation. Their common patron was probably Thomas, Duke of Norfolk and Cornwall. The poets worked together again during 1533 and 1534, when Leland contributed verses for Udall&#x27;s &quot;Floures for Latine Spekynge&quot;.

==Library tours, 1533–36==
In 1533, the king appears to have entrusted Leland with a document, &quot;a moste gratius commission&quot; (or &quot;principis diploma&quot; as he called it in Latin), which authorized him to examine and use the libraries of all religious houses in England. Leland spent the next few years travelling from house to house, for the most part shortly before they were dissolved, compiling numerous lists of significant or unusual books in their libraries. About 1535, he met the ex-Carmelite churchman and fellow antiquary John Bale, who much admired his work and offered his assistance.

In 1536, not long after the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 commanding the dissolution of lesser monasteries was passed, Leland lamented the spoliation of monastic libraries and addressed Thomas Cromwell in a letter seeking aid for the rescue of books. He complained that

In the 1530s and 1540s, the royal library was reorganised to accommodate hundreds of books that were previously kept in monastic collections. Leland himself describes how Henry&#x27;s palaces at Greenwich, Hampton Court and Westminster were adapted for the purpose. Leland&#x27;s part in this is uncertain.

In humanist fashion, Leland styled himself &quot;antiquarius&quot;, a title which was at one time interpreted as referring to a formal appointment as &quot;king&#x27;s antiquary&quot;: however, it is now understood to have been merely Leland&#x27;s own preferred way of describing himself. There is no evidence that he personally oversaw the relocation of the books to their new home or received a librarian&#x27;s wages. What he did do was to compile his lists of important volumes, and to take measures to encourage their preservation.

==Itineraries, c. 1538–43==
Even after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Leland did not abandon his hunt for books. For instance, he obtained official permission to avail himself of the library belonging to the defunct monastery of Bury St Edmunds. The descriptions of Britain which he encountered in the manuscripts, however, and his personal experiences of travel, also sparked off fresh interests. By about 1538, Leland had turned his attention to English and Welsh topography and antiquities, embarking on a series of journeys which lasted six years. Probably over the summer of 1538 (though there may also have been earlier and/or later trips), he made an extended excursion through Wales. He subsequently made a number of journeys in England: the exact sequence and their dates are again uncertain, but there seem to have been five major English itineraries, taken over the summers of the years 1539 to 1543. His one firmly dated itinerary is that of 1542, which took him to the West Country. By that date he had been on a tour to the north-west, which went via the Welsh marches to Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumberland; while other itineraries took him to the west Midlands, the north-east (reaching Yorkshire and County Durham), and the Bristol region. He probably explored the south-east in shorter excursions. He is not known to have toured East Anglia, for which only a few fragmentary notes survive.

Leland kept notebooks on his travels, in which he entered and assessed information from personal observation, and from books, charters and oral sources. It is this material which we now know as his &#x27;Itinerary&#x27;.

In the 1906–10 edition, the &quot;Itinerary&quot; runs to five printed volumes. It comprises rough notes and very early drafts, the raw materials for a more digested description of England and Wales – Leland would not have envisaged publishing it in anything like its present form. The county on which he appears to have made greatest progress in organising his material was Kent. &quot;Let this be the firste chapitre of the booke&quot;, he wrote; &quot;The King hymself was borne yn Kent. Kent is the key of al Englande.&quot; John Bale later listed an &quot;Itinerarium Cantiae&quot; (Itinerary of Kent) among Leland&#x27;s writings.

Although Leland&#x27;s Itinerary notes remained unpublished until the eighteenth century, they provided a significant quarry of data and descriptions for William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; (first edition, 1586), and many other antiquarian works.

==The &quot;New Year&#x27;s Gift&quot;, 1544==

In the mid-1540s, Leland wrote a letter to Henry VIII in which he outlined his achievements so far, and his future plans. It was subsequently published by John Bale in 1549 (with Bale&#x27;s own additional commentary) under the title . The letter has traditionally (following Bale) been regarded as a &quot;New Year&#x27;s gift&quot; to the King for January 1546, but James Carley has shown that it must have been composed in late 1543 or early 1544 (so that if it was presented at the new year, which is not certain, it would have been in 1544).

In the letter, Leland reported on his endeavours to preserve books, and the extent and thoroughness of his travels through England and Wales: 
He also described what use he intended to make of the information he had accumulated. He noted four projects:
:*&quot;De uiris illustribus&quot;, a biographical encyclopedia of British writers in four books, arranged chronologically.
:*A detailed map of the realm engraved on a silver table, to be presented to the King (inspired by a set of table-maps once possessed by the Emperor Charlemagne), accompanied by a written description, the &quot;Liber de topographia Britanniae&quot;, and a key to identifying the British place-names given in ancient texts.
:*A history of England and Wales, entitled &quot;De Antiquitate Britannica&quot;, or &quot;Civilis Historia&quot;. This work was to be divided into &quot;so many bookes as there be shires yn England, and sheres and greate dominions yn Wales&quot;, i.e. about fifty: a further six books would deal with Britain&#x27;s offshore islands.
:*&quot;De nobilitate Britannica&quot;, a catalogue of royalty, nobility, and &quot;capitaines and rulers&quot;, divided chronologically into three books.

Of these projects, &quot;De uiris illustribus&quot; was already largely complete (it was written in two phases, in –36 and –46), but the others would never come to fruition. Polydore Vergil appears to have suggested that Leland had been unrealistically over-ambitious: he was &quot;a vaynegloryouse persone, whyche woulde promyse more, than ever he was able or intended to perfourme&quot;.

==Leland and archaeology==
Leland was concerned to record evidence for the history of England and Wales as it was visible in the landscape, and he therefore took pains to note all kinds of archaeological remains, including megaliths, hillforts, and Roman and medieval ruins. He came across several Roman inscriptions, though he was unable to read most of them, complaining of one that it was made up of &quot;letters for whole words, and 2. or 3. letters conveid in one&quot;. He often reported finds of coins, writing of Richborough, Kent, for example, that more Roman money had been discovered there &quot;then in any place els of England&quot;. He investigated and recorded building materials in some detail.

He was sometimes able to make astute and informed deductions from what he saw. At Lincoln, for example, he identified three phases of urban development, beginning with a British settlement at the top of the hill (close to which &quot;much Romaine mony is found&quot;), the Saxon and medieval town further south, and a more recent riverside development at Wigford. He was able to judge that the existing fabric of Ripon Minster &quot;indubitately was made sins the Conquest&quot;. He correctly distinguished what he called &quot;Briton brykes&quot; (actually Roman bricks) at several geographically dispersed sites, including Verulamium, Richborough, Lympne, Dover Castle, Canterbury, and Bewcastle.

He was normally content to record surface remains and recovered artefacts, but on one occasion he adopted a more interventionist approach. At the hillfort at Burrough Hill, Leicestershire, he pulled some stones from the gateway to establish whether it had been walled or not: they were mortared with lime, which persuaded him that it had been. The account included in Leland&#x27;s &quot;Itinerary&quot; may be regarded as the earliest archaeological field report.

==Leland and King Arthur==
Leland was a staunch patriot, and believed firmly in the historical veracity of King Arthur. He therefore took offence when the Italian scholar Polydore Vergil cast doubts on certain elements in the Arthurian legend in his &quot;Anglica Historia&quot; (published in 1534). Leland&#x27;s first response was an unpublished tract, written perhaps in 1536, the &quot;Codrus sive Laus et Defensio Gallofridi Arturii contra Polydorum Vergilium&quot;. (&quot;Codrus&quot;, a pseudonym for Vergil, was a type-name drawn from Juvenal for a wretched and dreary hack-poet.) He followed this with a longer published work, the &quot;Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britannia&quot; (1544). In both texts, Leland drew on a wide range of literary, etymological, archaeological and oral sources to defend the historicity of Arthur. Although his central belief was flawed, his work preserved much evidence for the Arthurian tradition that might otherwise have been lost.

Leland&#x27;s material provides invaluable evidence for reconstructing the lost &quot;tomb monument&quot; of Arthur (thought to be a fabrication of the twelfth century) at Glastonbury Abbey. He was probably also responsible for making a drawing of the lead cross that identified the grave as Arthur&#x27;s, afterwards published as a woodcut in the 1607 edition of Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;.

On his itinerary of 1542, Leland was the first to record the tradition (possibly influenced by the proximity of the villages of Queen Camel and West Camel) identifying the hillfort of Cadbury Castle in Somerset as Arthur&#x27;s Camelot:
==Final years and death==
In 1542, Henry presented Leland with the valuable rectory of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire. The year following he preferred him to a canonry of King&#x27;s College, now Christ Church, Oxford, and about the same time, collated him to a prebend in the church of Sarum. He was an absentee pluralist, with the income and leisure to pursue his interests. He retired with his collections to his house in the parish of St Michael-le-Querne, adjoining Cheapside, London, where he intended to work on his various projects. However, in February 1547 near the time of Henry&#x27;s death, &quot;he fell besides his wits&quot;. Leland was certified insane in March 1550 and died, still mentally deranged, on 18 April 1552, aged about 48.

Leland was buried in the church of St Michael-le-Querne near his home. However the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and not rebuilt, and so Leland&#x27;s tomb has been lost.

==Collections and notebooks==
Following Leland&#x27;s death or (more probably) his descent into madness, King Edward VI arranged for Leland&#x27;s library, including many medieval manuscripts, to be placed in the custody of Sir John Cheke. John Bale consulted some of them at this time. Cheke fell from favour on the accession of Queen Mary, and departed for mainland Europe in 1554: from that point onwards, and continuing after Cheke&#x27;s death in 1557, the library was dispersed. Books were acquired by collectors including Sir William Cecil, William, Lord Paget, John Dee and Archbishop Matthew Parker.

Leland&#x27;s own manuscript notebooks were inherited by Cheke&#x27;s son, Henry, and in 1576 they were borrowed and transcribed by John Stow, allowing their contents to begin to circulate in antiquarian circles. Antiquaries who gained access to them through Stow included William Camden, William Harrison, Robert Glover and Francis Thynne. The original notebooks passed from Henry Cheke to Humphrey Purefoy, and so (following his death in 1598) to Humphrey&#x27;s son Thomas, who divided many of them between his two cousins John Hales and the antiquary, William Burton. Burton subsequently managed to recover several of the items given to Hales, and in 1632 and 1642–3 donated most of the collection—comprising the &quot;Collectanea&quot;, &quot;De scriptoribus&quot; and several of the &quot;Itinerary&quot; notebooks—to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, where the volumes remain.

==The Leland Trail==
The Leland Trail is a footpath, which follows the footsteps of John Leland as he traversed South Somerset between 1535 and 1543 in the course of his investigation of the region&#x27;s antiquities. The Leland Trail begins at King Alfred&#x27;s Tower on the Wiltshire/Somerset border and finishes at Ham Hill Country Park.

===Antiquarian prose writings===
Leland&#x27;s prose writings, published and unpublished, include:
*&quot;Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britanniae&quot; (1544). Leland&#x27;s prose treatise on the historicity of King Arthur. Also published in English translation by Richard Robinson as &quot;A learned and true assertion of the original, life, actes, and death of the most noble, valiant, and renoumed Prince Arthure, King of great Brittaine&quot; (1582).
*&quot;Antiphilarchia&quot; (completed in 1541, unpublished). A religious dialogue, written in response to Albert Pighius&#x27; &quot;Hierarchiæ ecclesiasticæ assertio&quot; (Cologne, 1538).

The manuscript is Bodleian Library MS Top. gen. c.4. It was published as &quot;Commentarii de scriptoribus Britannicis&quot; by Anthony Hall in 1709; and more authoritatively (and under its original title) by James Carley in 2010.
*&quot;Antiquitates Britanniae&quot;. A compendium of extracts from classical and medieval texts relating to Britain. Now British Library Cotton MS Julius C.vi.
*The &quot;Collectanea&quot; (now Bodleian Library, MSS Top. gen. c.1–3; British Library Add. MS 38132). Leland&#x27;s many notes and transcripts from his visits to monastic libraries, including most of his book-lists, compiled 1533–36. The three principal volumes were donated to the Bodleian by William Burton. First published in six volumes by Thomas Hearne in 1715, with revised editions appearing in 1770 and 1774. The third volume includes a copy of Ælfric&#x27;s &quot;Glossary&quot;. Leland reports that at Malmesbury, he found a copy of a now lost work which he ascribed to William of Malmesbury, verses in 15 books on the four Evangelists.
*&quot;Itinerary&quot; notebooks (now Bodleian Library, MSS Top. gen. e.8–15; other fragments in British Library, or surviving only as later transcripts). Leland&#x27;s topographical notes, compiled –43. Of the Bodleian material, the first seven volumes were donated to the library by Burton, and the eighth and final one (a compilation of fragments) by Charles King . First published by Thomas Hearne in 1710–12 (second edition 1744–45); and more authoritatively by Lucy Toulmin Smith in 1906–10.

Leland&#x27;s writings are an invaluable primary source, not only for the local history and the geography of England, but also for literary history, archaeology, social history, and economic history.

This edition, based on Toulmin Smith&#x27;s, rearranges Leland&#x27;s topographical descriptions of England (with Wales added in the second edition) in county chapters, and renders them in modern English. It is less authoritative for scholarly purposes, but considerably more accessible and easier to navigate. It also corrects a small number of errors by Toulmin Smith.

<doc id="149524" wikidata="Q625090" url="?curid=149524" title="Louie Louie">
<text>&quot;Louie Louie&quot; is a rhythm and blues song written and composed by American musician Richard Berry in 1955, recorded in 1956, and released in 1957. It is best known for the 1963 hit version by the Kingsmen and has become a standard in pop and rock. The song is based on the tune &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot; popularized by bandleader René Touzet and is an example of Afro-Cuban influence on American popular music.

&quot;Louie Louie&quot; tells, in simple verse–chorus form, the first-person story of a &quot;lovesick sailor&#x27;s lament to a bartender about wanting to get back home to his girl&quot;.

==Historical significance==
The &quot;extraordinary roller-coaster tale of obscurity, scandal, success and immortality&quot; and &quot;remarkable historical impact&quot; of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; have been recognized by organizations and publications worldwide. A partial list (see Recognition and rankings table below) includes the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, National Public Radio, VH1, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Recording Industry Association of America. Other major examples of the song&#x27;s legacy include the celebration of International Louie Louie Day every year on April 11; the annual Louie Louie Parade in Philadelphia from 1985 to 1989; the LouieFest in Tacoma from 2003 to 2012; the ongoing annual Louie Louie Street Party in Peoria; and the unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to make it the state song of Washington.

Dave Marsh in his book &quot;Louie Louie: The History and Mythology of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Song&quot; wrote, &quot;It is the best of songs, it is the worst of songs&quot;, and also labeled it &quot;cosmically crude&quot;. Rock critic Greil Marcus called it &quot;a law of nature&quot; and &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Jon Pareles, writing in a 1997 obituary for Richard Berry, termed it &quot;a cornerstone of rock&quot;. Music historian Peter Blecha noted, &quot;Far from shuffling off to a quiet retirement, evidence indicates that &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; may actually prove to be immortal.&quot; Although the song &quot;surely resists learned exegesis&quot;, other writers described it as &quot;musically simple, lyrically simple, and joyously infectious&quot;, &quot;deliciously moronic&quot;, &quot;a completely unforgettable earworm&quot;, &quot;the essence of rock&#x27;s primal energy&quot;, and &quot;the immortal international hit ... that defines rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;

Others noted that it &quot;served as a bridge to the R&amp;B of the past and the rap scene of the future&quot;, that &quot;it came to symbolize the garage rock genre, where the typical performance was often aggressive and usually amateurish&quot;, and that &quot;all you need to make a great rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record are the chords to &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; and a bad attitude.&quot;

Music historian and filmmaker Eric Predoehl of &quot;The Louie Report&quot; described the song as,

&quot;Purity. It&#x27;s just a very pure, honest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll song. It&#x27;s a song of romantic ideals hidden amongst a three-chord melody. It&#x27;s an idealistic song. It&#x27;s a misunderstood song. It&#x27;s a confusing and disorienting song. It&#x27;s like a heartbeat.&quot;

Humorist Dave Barry (with perhaps some exaggeration) called it &quot;one of the greatest songs in the history of the world&quot;. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; summarized, &quot;It might be the best-known rock song of all time. It might be the most important rock song of all time.&quot;

The Kingsmen&#x27;s recording was the subject of an FBI investigation about the supposed, but nonexistent, obscenity of the lyrics that ended without prosecution. The nearly unintelligible (and innocuous) lyrics were widely misinterpreted, and the song was banned by radio stations. Marsh wrote that the lyrics controversy &quot;reflected the country&#x27;s infantile sexuality&quot; and &quot;ensured the song&#x27;s eternal perpetuation&quot;, while another writer termed it &quot;the ultimate expression of youthful rebellion&quot;. Jacob McMurray in &quot;Taking Punk To The Masses&quot; noted, &quot;All of this only fueled the popularity of the song ... imprinting this grunge ur-message onto successive generations of youth, ... all of whom amplified and rebroadcast its powerful sonic meme ...&quot;

==Original version by Richard Berry and the Pharaohs==
Richard Berry was inspired to write the song in 1955 after listening to an R&amp;B interpretation of &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot; performed by the Latin group Ricky Rillera and the Rhythm Rockers. The tune was written originally as &quot;Amarren Al Loco&quot; (&quot;Tie Up The Madman&quot; or &quot;Tie Up That Lunatic&quot;) by Cuban bandleader Rosendo Ruiz Jr. (also known as Rosendo Ruiz Quevedo), but became best known in the &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot; arrangement by René Touzet which included &quot;three great chords, solid and true&quot; and a ten-note &quot;1-2-3 1–2 1-2-3 1–2&quot; tumbao or rhythmic pattern. The &quot;unforgettable hook&quot; of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was lifted directly from Touzet&#x27;s composition.

 In Berry&#x27;s mind, the words to &quot;Louie Louie&quot; &quot;just kind of fell out of the sky&quot;, superimposing themselves over the repeating bassline as he scribbled backstage on a strip of toilet paper. Lyrically, the first person perspective of the song was influenced by &quot;One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)&quot;, which is sung from the perspective of a customer talking to a bartender (&quot;Louie&quot; was the name of Berry&#x27;s bartender). He additionally cited Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Havana Moon&quot; and his own exposure to Latin American music for the song&#x27;s speech pattern and references to Jamaica.

Los Angeles-based Flip Records recorded Berry&#x27;s composition with his vocal group the Pharaohs in April 1956. The Pharaohs were Godoy Colbert (first tenor), Stanley Henderson (second tenor, subbing for Robert Harris), and Noel Collins (baritone). Gloria Jones of the Dreamers provided additional backup vocals. Session musicians included Plas Johnson on tenor sax, Jewel Grant on baritone sax, Ernie Freeman on piano, Irving Ashby on guitar, Red Callender on bass, Ray Martinez on drums, and John Anderson on trumpet.

Flip released the record in April 1957 with &quot;Louie Louie&quot; as the B-side of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;, but prior to the song&#x27;s release, Berry sold his portion of the publishing and songwriting rights for &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and four other songs for $750 to Max Feirtag, the head of Flip Records, to raise cash for his upcoming wedding. Both 7-inch 45 RPM and 10-inch 78 RPM versions were pressed. (An early 45 RPM label misprint exists, reported by Steve Propes, with the title rendered as &quot;Louie Lovie&quot;.)

A Cash Box review rated the A-side as a B+, but the B-side only rated a B with the comment, &quot;Richard Berry chants a middle beat with a steady, syncopated rhythm that captures an excitement.&quot; Local A-side airplay was modest, but then KGFJ deejay Hunter Hancock flipped the record and put the B-side in heavy rotation, resulting in a regional hit, particularly in San Francisco. When Berry toured the Pacific Northwest, local R&amp;B bands began to play the song, increasing its popularity. The song was re-released by Flip in 1961 as an A-side single and again in 1964 on a four-song EP, but never appeared on any of the national charts. Sales estimates ranged from 40,000 to 130,000 copies.

Other versions appeared on &quot;Casino Club Presents Richard Berry&quot; (1966), &quot;Great Rhythm and Blues Oldies Volume 12&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Best of Louie, Louie&quot; (1983). Although similar to the original, the version on Rhino&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The Best of Louie, Louie&quot; compilation is actually a note-for-note re-recording (with backup vocals by doo wop revival group Big Daddy) created because licensing could not be obtained for Berry&#x27;s 1957 version. The original version was included on a 1986 Swedish compilation, but not until the Ace Records &quot;Love That Louie&quot; release in 2002 did it see wide distribution.

In the mid-1980s, Berry was living on welfare. Drinks company California Cooler wanted to use &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in a commercial, but discovered it needed Berry&#x27;s consent because despite having sold the publishing rights, he still owned the radio and television performance rights. The company asked the Artists Rights Society to locate him which led to Berry&#x27;s taking legal action to regain his rights to the song. The settlement made Berry a millionaire.

While the title of the song is often rendered with a comma (&quot;Louie, Louie&quot;), in 1988, Berry told &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine that the correct title of the song was &quot;Louie Louie&quot; with no comma.

==Cover versions==

&quot;Louie Louie&quot; is the world&#x27;s most recorded rock song, with published estimates ranging from over 1,600 to more than 2,000 &quot;with ever more still being released and performed&quot;. It has been released or performed by a wide range of artists from reggae to hard rock, from jazz to psychedelic, from hip hop to easy listening. Peter Doggett labeled it &quot;almost impossible to play badly&quot; and Greil Marcus asked, &quot;Has there ever been a bad version of &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;?&quot; Paul Revere summarized, &quot;Three chords and the most mundane beat possible. Any idiot could learn it, and they all did.&quot;

The Kingsmen version in particular has been cited as the &quot;rosetta stone&quot; of garage rock, the defining &quot;ur-text&quot; of punk rock, and &quot;the original grunge classic&quot;. &quot;The influential rock critics Dave Marsh and Greil Marcus believe that virtually all punk rock can be traced back to a single proto-punk song, &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;.&quot;

Pronunciation has varied widely from Berry&#x27;s original &quot;Lou-ee Lou-ee&quot; to &quot;Lou-ee Lou-eye&quot; (Kingsmen, 1963), &quot;Lou-ee Lou-eye-ay&quot; (Angels, 1964), &quot;Lou-eye Lou-way&quot; (Sonics, 1966; Iggy Pop, 1972), &quot;Lou-ee-a Lou-way&quot; (Kinks, 1964; Motörhead, 1978), &quot;Lou-way Lou-way&quot; (Clarke/Duke Project, 1981), and others.

===1950s===
Richard Berry was on the underbill for a concert in the Seattle–Tacoma area in September 1957 and his record appeared on local radio station charts in November 1957 after &quot;African American DJs Bob Summerrise and Eager Beaver started playing it on their radio shows”. Local R&amp;B musicians Ron Holden and Dave Lewis popularized &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, rearranging Berry&#x27;s version and performing it at live shows and &quot;battle of the bands&quot; events.

Holden recorded an unreleased version, backed by the Thunderbirds, for the Nite Owl label in 1959. As a leader of the &quot;dirty but cool&quot; Seattle R&amp;B sound, he would often substitute mumbled, &quot;somewhat pornographic&quot; lyrics in &quot;a live tour de force [that] often lasted ten minutes or longer, devastating local audiences.&quot; Lewis, &quot;the singularly most significant figure on the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s nascent rhythm &amp; blues scene in the 1950s and 1960s&quot;, released a three chord clone, &quot;David&#x27;s Mood - Part 2&quot;, that was a regional hit in 1963.

The Wailers, Little Bill and the Bluenotes, the Frantics, Tiny Tony and the Statics, Merrilee and the Turnabouts, and other local groups soon added the song to their set lists.

===1960s===
====Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts and the Wailers (1961)====

Robin Roberts developed an interest in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and rhythm and blues records as a high school student in Tacoma, Washington. Among the songs he began performing as an occasional guest singer with a local band, the Bluenotes, in 1958 were &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, which he had &quot;rescued from oblivion&quot; after hearing Berry&#x27;s obscure original single, and Bobby Day&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot;, which gave him his stage name.

In 1959, Roberts left the Bluenotes and began singing with another local band, the Wailers, famed for their &quot;hard-nosed R&amp;B/rock fusion&quot;. Known for his dynamic onstage performances, Roberts added &quot;Louie Louie&quot; to the band&#x27;s set and, in 1960 recorded the track with the Wailers as his backing band. The arrangement, devised by Roberts with the band, was &quot;the first-ever garage version of &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;&quot; and included &quot;one of the true great moments of rock&quot;, his ad-libbed &quot;Let&#x27;s give it to &#x27;em, RIGHT NOW!!&quot; before the guitar solo.

Released as a single on the band&#x27;s own label, Etiquette, in early 1961, it became a huge hit locally, charting at No. 1 on Seattle&#x27;s KJR and establishing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; as &quot;&quot;the&quot; signature riff of Northwest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. It also picked up play across the border in Vancouver, British Columbia, appearing in the top 40 of the CFUN chart. The popularity of the Roberts release effectively buried another &quot;reasonably close to the Richard Berry/Ron Holden arrangement&quot; version put out at about the same time by Little Bill Englehardt (Topaz T-1305).

The record was then reissued and promoted by Liberty Records in Los Angeles, but it failed to chart nationally. The track was included on the 1963 album &quot;The Wailers &amp; Co&quot;, the 1964 compilation album &quot;Tall Cool One&quot;, the 1998 reissue of the 1962 album &quot;The Fabulous Wailers Live at the Castle&quot;, and multiple later compilations.

Roberts was killed in an automobile accident in 1967, but his &quot;legacy would reverberate down through the ages&quot;. Dave Marsh dedicated his 1993 book, &quot;For Richard Berry, who gave birth to this unruly child, and Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts, who first raised it to glory.&quot;

====The Kingsmen (1963)====

On 6 April 1963, the Kingsmen, a rock and roll group from Portland, Oregon, chose &quot;Louie Louie&quot; for their second recording. They recorded the song at Northwestern Inc. Motion Pictures &amp; Recording Studios at 411 SW 13th Avenue in Portland. The one hour session, originally intended to produce an audition tape for a summer cruise ship gig, cost either $36, $50, or somewhere in between, and the band split the cost.

The session was produced by Ken Chase, a local disc jockey on the AM rock station KISN who also owned The Chase, the teen nightclub where the Kingsmen were the house band. The engineer for the session was the studio owner, Robert Lindahl. The Kingsmen&#x27;s lead vocalist, Jack Ely, based his version on the recording by Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts with the Fabulous Wailers, but unintentionally reintroduced Berry&#x27;s original stop-time rhythm as he showed the other members how to play it with a 1–2–3, 1–2, 1–2–3 beat instead of the 1–2–3–4, 1–2, 1–2–3–4 beat on the Wailers record. The night before their recording session, the band played a 90-minute version of the song during a gig at a local teen club. The Kingsmen&#x27;s studio version was recorded in one partial and one full take. They also recorded &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot; and what became the B-side of the release, an original &quot;surf instrumental&quot; by Ely and keyboardist Don Gallucci called &quot;Haunted Castle&quot;.

The Kingsmen&#x27;s version with its &quot;ragged&quot;, &quot;sloppy&quot;, &quot;chaotic&quot;, &quot;shambolic, lumbering style&quot;, complete with &quot;manic lead guitar solo, insane cymbal crashes, generally slurred and unintelligible lyrics&quot;, transformed the earlier Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts version on which it was based into a &quot;bumbling, bear-in-a-china-shop&quot;, &quot;gloriously incoherent&quot;, &quot;raw and raucous&quot; &quot;stomping garage-rocker&quot; &quot;so wrong it&#x27;s right&quot;. Ely had to stand on tiptoe to sing into a boom mike, and his braces further impeded his &quot;sinew-stretching&quot;, &quot;giraffe-neck gabble&quot; singing. The result was a &quot;raw and unsanitized, unmanaged and unscrubbed&quot; effort that the group hated but manager Ken Chase loved. Jerry Dennon&#x27;s local Jerden label was contracted to press 1,000 vinyl 45s.

The guitar break is triggered by a shout, &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s give it to &#x27;em right now!&quot;, both lifted from the Roberts version. Critic Dave Marsh suggests it is this moment that gives the recording greatness: &quot;[Ely] went for it so avidly you&#x27;d have thought he&#x27;d spotted the jugular of a lifelong enemy, so crudely that, at that instant, Ely sounds like Donald Duck on helium. And it&#x27;s that faintly ridiculous air that makes the Kingsmen&#x27;s record the classic that it is ...&quot; Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, whose &quot;passion for music was ignited by the Kingsmen&#x27;s &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;&quot;, termed it a &quot;totem of magic&quot;, and recalled that &quot;the lead singer&#x27;s [Ely] voice had the air of a boy smoking a cigarette with one hand while banging a tambourine in the other, an insolent distance to his delivery, a vision of being at once boss and bored.&quot;

Marsh ranked the song as No. 11 out of the 1001 greatest singles ever made, describing it as &quot;the most profound and sublime expression of rock and roll&#x27;s ability to create something from nothing&quot;. The Independent in Britain noted that it reinforced &quot;a growing suspicion that enthusiasm was more important to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll than technical competence or literal meaning.&quot;

Music producer and historian Alec Palao wrote,

&quot;This is truly the quintessential garage band moment, an audio-vérité snapshot that communicates directly what red-blooded grass roots American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is all about ... the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; spills forth with a rush of teenage hormones: raw, untutored, yet seemingly ready to take on the world.&quot;

Albin J. Zak in &quot;The Poetics of Rock&quot; commented,

&quot;What makes the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; a good record? Neither lyrics nor melodic design, harmonic motion, rhythmic groove, or instrumental arrangement — all of which can be represented in some fashion apart from the record (though the lyrics would be at best an approximation) — hold the key to the answer. The record&#x27;s power is in its sound, which represents multiple elements, processes, and voices — song, arrangement, sounds, techniques of sound recording and processing, musical performances, and all the particular ephemeral nuances that attend the moment of inscription. What is, from a certain perspective, mind-numbingly simple is in fact a complex network of phenomenal elements that we perceive as a whole.&quot;

A significant error on the Kingsmen version occurred just after the lead guitar break. As the group was going by the Wailers version, which had a restatement of the riff twice over before the lead vocalist came back in, it would be expected that Ely would do the same. Ely, however, missed his mark, coming in too soon before the second restatement of the riff. He realized his mistake and stopped the verse short, but the band did not realize that he had done so. As a quick fix, drummer Lynn Easton covered the pause with a drum fill. The error &quot;imbued the Kingsmen recording with a touching humility and humanity&quot; and is now so well known that multiple versions by other groups duplicate it.

First released in May 1963, the single was initially issued by the small Jerden label, before being picked up by the larger Wand Records in October 1963. Wand president Florence Greenberg said, &quot;... it was forced down my throat by friends. I was ashamed to put it out.&quot; Herb Alpert and A&amp;M Records passed on the distribution opportunity, deeming it &quot;too long&quot; and &quot;out of tune&quot;.

Sales of the Kingsmen record were initially so low (reportedly 600) that the group considered disbanding. Things changed when Boston&#x27;s biggest DJ, Arnie Ginsburg, was given the record by a pitchman. Amused by its slapdash sound, he played it on his program as &quot;The Worst Record of the Week&quot;. Despite the slam, listener response was swift and positive.

By the end of October, it was listed in &quot;Billboard&quot; as a regional breakout and a &quot;bubbling under&quot; entry for the national chart. Meanwhile, the Raiders version, with far stronger promotion, was becoming a hit in California and was also listed as &quot;bubbling under&quot; one week after the Kingsmen debuted on the chart. For a few weeks, the two singles appeared destined to battle each other, but demand for the Kingsmen single, backed by national promotion from Wand, acquired momentum and by the end of 1963, Columbia Records had stopped promoting the Raiders version.

It entered the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for December 7, and peaked at No. 2 the following week, a spot which it held for six non-consecutive weeks; it would remain in the top 10 throughout December 1963 and January 1964 before dropping off in early February. In total, the Kingsmen&#x27;s version spent 16 weeks on the Hot 100, selling a million copies by April 1964. The Singing Nun&#x27;s &quot;Dominique&quot; and Bobby Vinton&#x27;s &quot;There! I&#x27;ve Said It Again&quot; prevented the single from reaching No. 1 (although Marsh asserts that it &quot;far outsold&quot; the other records, but was denied &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; top spot due to lack of &quot;proper decorum&quot;.) &quot;Louie Louie&quot; did reach No. 1 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Music Vendor/Record World&quot; pop charts, as well as No. 1 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; R&amp;B chart. In Canada it was No. 1 for three weeks beginning December 30, 1963. It was the last No. 1 on &quot;Cash Box&quot; before Beatlemania hit the United States with &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. The Kingsmen version quickly became a standard at teen parties in the U.S. during the 1960s and, reaching No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart, was the preferred tune for a popular British dance called &quot;The Shake&quot;. The first album, &quot;The Kingsmen in Person&quot;, peaked at No. 20 in 1964 and remained on the charts for over two years (131 weeks total) until 1966.

Due to the lyrics controversy and supported by the band&#x27;s heavy touring schedule, the single continued to sell throughout 1965 and, after being reissued in 1966 as &quot;Louie Louie 64-65-66&quot;, briefly reappeared on the charts, reaching No. 65 in &quot;Cash Box&quot;, No. 76 in &quot;Record World&quot;, No. 97 in &quot;Billboard&quot; and cracking the Top 40 in the Washington market. Total sales estimates for the single range from 10 million to over 12 million with cover versions accounting for another 300 million.

Another factor in the success of the record may have been the rumour that the vocals were intentionally slurred by the Kingsmen to cover up lyrics that were allegedly laced with profanity, graphically depicting sex between the sailor and his lady. Crumpled pieces of paper professing to be &quot;the real lyrics&quot; to &quot;Louie Louie&quot; circulated among teens. The song was banned on many radio stations and in many places in the United States, including Indiana, where a ban was requested by Governor Matthew Welsh. These actions were taken despite the fact that practically no one could distinguish the actual lyrics. Denials of chicanery by Kingsmen and Ely did not stop the controversy. The FBI started a 31-month investigation into the matter and concluded they were &quot;unable to interpret any of the wording in the record.&quot; However, drummer Lynn Easton later admitted that he yelled &quot;Fuck&quot; after fumbling a drum fill at 0:54 on the record.

By the time the Kingsmen version had achieved national popularity, the band had split. Two rival editions—one featuring lead singer Jack Ely, the other with Lynn Easton who held the rights to the band&#x27;s name—were competing for live audiences across the country. A settlement was reached later in 1964 giving Easton the right to the Kingsmen name but requiring all future pressings of the original version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; to display &quot;Lead vocal by Jack Ely&quot; on the label. Ely released &quot;Love That Louie&quot; (as Jack E. Lee and the Squires) in 1964 and &quot;Louie Louie &#x27;66&quot; and &quot;Louie Go Home&quot; (as Jack Ely and the Courtmen) in 1966 without chart success. He re-recorded &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in 1976 and again in 1980, and these versions appear on multiple 60s hit compilations credited to &quot;Jack Ely (formerly of the Kingsmen)&quot; or &quot;re-recordings by the original artists&quot;.

Subsequent Kingsmen &quot;Louie Louie&quot; versions with either Lynn Easton or Dick Peterson as lead vocalist appeared on &quot;Live &amp; Unreleased&quot; (recorded 1963, released 1992), &quot;Live at the Castle&quot; (recorded 1964, released 2011), &quot;Shindig! Presents Frat Party&quot; (VHS, recorded 1965, released 1991), &quot;60s Dance Party&quot; (1982), &quot;California Cooler Presents Cooler Hits&quot; (recorded 1986, released 1987), &quot;The Louie Louie Collection&quot; (as the Mystery Band, 1994), &quot;Red, White &amp; Rock&quot; (2002), &quot;Garage Sale&quot; (recorded 2002, released 2003), and &quot;My Music: &#x27;60s Pop, Rock &amp; Soul&quot; (DVD, 2011). A solo version by Peterson was also included on the 1999 &quot;Circle of Friends, Volume 1&quot; CD.

On 9 November 1998, after a protracted lawsuit that lasted five years and cost $1.3 million, the Kingsmen were awarded ownership of all their recordings released on Wand Records from Gusto Records, including &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. They had not been paid royalties on the songs since the 1960s.

When Jack Ely died on April 28, 2015, his son reported that &quot;my father would say, &#x27;We were initially just going to record the song as an instrumental, and at the last minute I decided I&#x27;d sing it. When it came time to do that, however, Ely discovered the sound engineer had raised the studio&#x27;s only microphone several feet above his head. Then he placed Ely in the middle of his fellow musicians, all in an effort to create a better &quot;live feel&quot; for the recording. The result, Ely would say over the years, was that he had to stand on his toes, lean his head back and shout as loudly as he could just to be heard over the drums and guitars.

When Mike Mitchell died on April 16, 2021, he was the only remaining member of the Kingsmen&#x27;s original lineup who still performed with the band. His &quot;Louie Louie&quot; guitar break has been called &quot;iconic&quot;, &quot;blistering&quot;, and &quot;one of the most famous guitar solos of all time&quot;. &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine noted, &quot;Raw, lightning-fast, and loud, the solo&#x27;s unbridled energy helped make the song a No. 2 pop hit, but also helped set the template for garage-rock – and later hard-rock – guitar.&quot;

Citing it as “the only piece of pop music I can remember from my youth”, British writer Peter Ackroyd selected the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, along with works by Beethoven, Bach, and Prokofiev as music selections on the BBC Radio 4 show, &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Britain&#x27;s Independent in 2015 declared it the &quot;party anthem of the universe&quot;.

==== Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders (1963)====

Shortly after the Kingsmen, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders recorded a &quot;cleaner, more accomplished&quot; &quot;soulful version&quot; of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in the same Portland studio. Sources concur that the Kingsmen session was first, but differ on the Raiders recording date.

Personnel included Mark Lindsay (sax, vocals), Steve West (guitar), and Mike Smith (drums) with Paul Revere subbing on bass. The recording was paid for and produced by KISN radio personality Roger Hart, who soon became personal manager for the band. Released on Hart&#x27;s Sandē label and plugged on his radio show, their version was more successful locally. Columbia Records issued the single nationally in June 1963 and it went to No. 1 in the West and Hawaii, but only reached No. 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The quick success of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; faltered, however, due to lack of support from Columbia and its A&amp;R man Mitch Miller, a former bandleader (&quot;Sing Along With Mitch&quot;) with &quot;retrogressive taste&quot; who disliked the &quot;musical illiteracy&quot; of rock and roll.

The Raiders version opened with Lindsay&#x27;s saxophone intro followed by Smitty&#x27;s exhortation to &quot;Grab yo woman, it&#x27;s-a &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; time!&quot;. Another signature phrase was &quot;Stomp and shout and work it on out&quot;. Lyrically, only the first verse was used with Lindsay improvising the remaining vocals. The original version also contains a scarcely audible &quot;dirty lyric&quot; when Lindsay says, &quot;Do she fuck? That psyches me up!&quot; behind the guitar solo.

Robert Lindahl, president and chief engineer of NWI and sound engineer on both the Kingsmen and Raiders recordings, stated that the Raiders version was not known for &quot;garbled lyrics&quot; or an amateurish recording technique, but, as one author noted, their &quot;more competent but uptight take on the song&quot; was less exciting than the Kingsmen&#x27;s version.

Live versions were included on &quot;Here They Come!&quot; (1965), &quot;Paul Revere Rides Again!&quot; (1983), &quot;The Last Madman of Rock and Roll&quot; (1986, DVD), and &quot;Mojo Workout!&quot; (2000). Later releases featured different lead vocalists on &quot;Special Edition&quot; (1982, Michael Bradley), &quot;Generic Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (1993, Carlo Driggs), &quot;Flower Power&quot; (2011, Darren Dowler), and &quot;The Revolutionary Hits of Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders&quot; (2019, David Huizenga).

The Raiders also recorded Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot;, a &quot;&#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; rewrite&quot;, and &quot;Louie, Go Home&quot;, an answer song penned by Lindsay and Revere after Berry declined their request to write a &quot;Louie Louie&quot; follow-up, as well as &quot;Just Like Me&quot;, a &quot;first cousin to &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;&quot;.

====The Beach Boys (1964)====
Surf music icons the Beach Boys released their version on the 1964 album &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; with lead vocals shared by Carl Wilson and Mike Love. Their effort was unusual in that it was rendered &quot;in a version so faithful to Berry&#x27;s Angeleno-revered original&quot; instead of the more common garage rock style as they &quot;[paid] tribute to the two most important earlier recordings of &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; — the 1957 original by Richard Berry and the Pharaohs, and the infamously unintelligible 1963 cover by the Kingsmen&quot;. Other surf music versions included the Chan-Dells in 1963, the Pyramids and the Surfaris in 1964, the Trashmen, the Invictas, and Jan and Dean in 1965, the Challengers in 1966, the Ripp Tides in 1981, and the Shockwaves in 1988.

====Otis Redding (1964)====
Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;spunky ... free-associating&quot;, &quot;rich soul take&quot; version was released on his 1964 album &quot;Pain in My Heart&quot;. Dave Marsh called it &quot;the best of the era&quot; and noted that he &quot;rearranged it to suit his style&quot; by adding a full horn section and &quot;garble[d] the lyrics so completely that it seems likely he made up the verses on the spot&quot; as he &quot;sang a story that made sense in his life&quot; (including making Louie a female).

Other versions by R&amp;B artists included Bobby Jay and the Hawks in 1964, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, the Tams, and Nat &amp; John in 1968, Wilbert Harrison in 1969, the Topics in 1970, and Barry White in 1981.

====The Angels (1964)====
With a version on their 1964 album &quot;A Halo to You&quot;, the Angels were the first girl group to cover &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. Their &quot;unlikely stab at [the] frat rock staple&quot; was also one of the first to deliberately duplicate the Jack Ely early vocal re-entry mistake after the bridge. &quot;The Best of Louie Louie, Volume 2&quot; included their rendition.

A Minnesota girl group, the Shaggs, released a version as a 1965 single (Concert 1-78-65), and Honey Ltd. covered the song on a 1968 album and as a single (LHI 1216); however, the distinction of first girl group participation on a version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; would go to the Shalimars, an Olympia girl group who provided overdubbed backing vocals in 1960 for a recording by Little Bill (Englehardt) released as a single in 1961 (Topaz 1305).

Female solo artist versions in the 1960s included Italian singer Maddalena in 1967 as a single titled &quot;Lui Lui&quot;, Ike and Tina Turner in 1968 (released in 1988 on &quot;Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s Greatest Hits, Volume 2)&quot;, and Julie London on her 1969 album &quot;Yummy, Yummy, Yummy&quot;.

==== The Kinks (1964)====

The Kinks recorded &quot;Louie Louie&quot; on October 18, 1964. It was released in November 1964 in the UK on the &quot;Kinksize Session&quot; EP, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; EP chart. It was also released in 1965 on two US-only albums, &quot;Kinks-Size&quot; and &quot;Kinkdom&quot;, and on a French album, &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot;. Live 1960s versions were released on bootlegs &quot;The Kinks in Germany&quot; (1965), &quot;Kinky Paris&quot; (1965), &quot;Live in San Francisco&quot; (1969), &quot;Kriminal Kinks&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Kinks at the BBC&quot; (2012).

The Kinks version re-entered the charts in 2015, reaching No. 19 on the UK singles chart based on sales, downloads and streaming. The Kast Off Kinks continue to perform it live, occasionally joined by original Kinks members.

Sources vary on the impact of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; on the writing of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;. One writer called the two songs &quot;sparse representations of a &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; mentality&quot;, while another succinctly called the former &quot;a rewrite of the Kingsmen&#x27;s &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;&quot;. A 1965 letter to London&#x27;s Record Mirror opined, &quot;Besides completely copying the Kingsmen&#x27;s vocal and instrumental style, The Kinks rose to fame with two watery twists of this classic...&quot; An opposing opinion was voiced by a different author who noted that the &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; riff is &quot;unquestionably a guitar-based piece, [that] fundamentally differs from &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and other earlier riff pieces with which it sometimes is compared&quot;.

Dave Marsh asserted that the Kinks &quot;blatantly based their best early hits&quot; on the &quot;Louie Louie&quot; riff. Other sources stated that Davies wrote &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; while trying to work out the chords of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; at the suggestion of the group&#x27;s manager, Larry Page. According to biographer Thomas M. Kitts, Davies confirmed that Page suggested that &quot;he write a song like &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;&quot;, but denied any direct influence.

Biographer Johnny Rogan noted no &quot;Louie Louie&quot; influence, writing that Davies adapted an earlier piano riff to the jazz blues style of Mose Allison, and that he was further influenced by seeing Chuck Berry and Gerry Mulligan in &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;, a 1958 film about the Newport Jazz Festival. Rogan also cited brother Dave Davies&#x27; distorted power chords as &quot;the sonic contribution that transformed the composition&quot; into a hit song.

Whether directly or indirectly, the Kingsmen version influenced the musical style of the early Kinks. They were huge fans of the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and Dave Davies remembered the song inspiring Ray&#x27;s singing, saying in an interview:

&quot;We played that record over and over. And Ray copied a lot of his vocal style from that guy [Jack Ely]. I was always trying to get Ray to sing, because I thought he had a great voice, but he was very shy. Then we heard The Kingsmen and he had that lazy, throwaway, laid-back drawl in his voice, and it was magic.&quot;

Alec Palao in the &quot;Love That Louie&quot; CD liner notes highlighted Davies&#x27; &quot;supremely lecherous, almost drunken vocal&quot; and suggested that &quot;Davies drew from &#x27;Louie&#x27; the urchin persona that populated so much of the Kinks&#x27; early work&quot;.

====The Sandpipers (1966)====

After their No. 1 hit &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, the Sandpipers, with producer Tommy LiPuma and arranger Nick DeCaro, &quot;cleverly revived&quot; the same soft rock, smooth ballad, Spanish language approach with a &quot;quiet, yet majestic&quot;, &quot;sweet interpretation&quot; of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, reaching No. 30 and No. 35 on the Billboard and Cashbox charts, respectively (the highest charting U.S. version after the Kingsmen). The success of their &quot;smoky version&quot; heralded the entry of the ever adaptable &quot;Louie Louie&quot; into the MOR and easy listening categories and many followed: David McCallum and J.J. Jones (1967), Honey Ltd. (1968), Julie London (1969), Sounds Orchestral (1970), Line Renaud (1973), Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin (1991), and others released singles and albums featuring slower and mellower versions of what had previously been an up tempo pop and rock standard.

====Travis Wammack (1966)====
With the only instrumental version to make the charts, Travis Wammack reached No. 128 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 in April 1966. An early guitar innovator and &quot;precursor to guitar-hero shredding&quot;, his distinctive sound on &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was &quot;liberally laced with fuzztone&quot; created by playing through an overdriven drive-in movie speaker.

Released as a single (Atlantic 2322), the track was not included on Wammack&#x27;s first album in 1972 or any thereafter. It appeared on a 1967 French release (&quot;Formidable Rhythm And Blues (Vol. 3)&quot;), but not again until two Wammack compilations, &quot;That Scratchy Guitar From Memphis&quot; (1987) and &quot;Scr-Scr-Scratchy!&quot; (1989). It was also included on two later various artists compilations, &quot;Love That Louie: The Louie Louie Files&quot; (2002) and &quot;Boom Boom A Go-Go!&quot; (2014).

Other notable 1960s instrumental versions included the Ventures, Ian Whitcomb, and Sandy Nelson in 1965, Ace Cannon and Pete Fountain in 1966, Floyd Cramer 1967, and Willie Mitchell in 1969.

====The Sonics (1966)====
The Sonics released their &quot;blistering makeover ... definitive punk arrangement&quot; as a 1965 single (Etiquette ET-23) and on the 1966 album &quot;Boom&quot;. Later versions appeared on &quot;Sinderella&quot; (1980) and &quot;Live at Easy Street&quot; (2016).

Described as a major influence on punk and garage music worldwide, the group&#x27;s characteristic hard-edged, fuzz-drenched sound and &quot;abrasive, all-out approach&quot; &quot;took the Northwest garage sound to its most primitive extreme&quot; and made their &quot;Louie Louie&quot; version ahead of its time. They also made it more &quot;fierce and threatening&quot; by altering the traditional 1-4-5-4 chord pattern to the &quot;darker, more sinister&quot; 1-3b-4-3b.

====Mongo Santamaria (1966)====
Cuban percussionist and bandleader Mongo Santamaria&#x27;s version, a &quot;cousin of &#x27;Watermelon Man&#x27;&quot;, returned &quot;Louie Louie&quot; to its Afro-Cuban roots, echoing Rene Touzet&#x27;s &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot; with his conga- and trumpet-driven Latin jazz version. Originally released on the 1966 album &quot;Hey! Let&#x27;s Party&quot;, it was also included on the 1983 compilation &quot;The Best of Louie Louie, Volume 2&quot;. Other early Latin-flavored versions were released by Pedrito Ramirez con los Yogis (Angelo 518, 1965), Pete Terrace (&quot;El Nuevo Pete Terrace&quot;, 1966), Eddie Cano (&quot;Brought Back Live from P.J.&#x27;s&quot;, 1967), Mario Allison (&quot;De Fiesta&quot;, 1967), and Rey Davila (&quot;On His Own&quot;, 1971).

Latin American jazz/rock innovator Carlos Santana compared Tito Puente&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Oye Como Va&quot; to &quot;Louie Louie&quot; saying, &quot;... how close the feel was to &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; and some Latin jazz tunes&quot; and &quot;... this is a song like &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; or &#x27;Guantanamera&#x27;. This is a song that when you play it, people are going to get up and dance, and that&#x27;s it.&quot;

====Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention (1967)====
&quot;Louie Louie&quot; occurred repeatedly as an &quot;idée fixe&quot; in the musical lexicon of Frank Zappa in the 1960s with the Soul Giants and the Mothers of Invention. He categorized the riff as one of several &quot;Archetypal American Musical Icons ... [whose] presence in an arrangement puts a spin on any lyric in their vicinity&quot; and used it initially &quot;to make fun of the old-fashioned rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll they had transcended&quot;. Although he characterized the Kingsmen version as a &quot;mutilation&quot; and an &quot;&quot;Animal House&quot; joke&quot;, he had a higher opinion of Richard Berry, calling him &quot;one of the most important figures in the West Coast rhythm-and-blues scene of the Fifties&quot; and saying, &quot;No one may not underestimate the impact of &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;, the original Richard Berry version.&quot;

His original compositions &quot;Plastic People&quot; and &quot;Ruthie-Ruthie&quot; (from You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1) were set to the melody of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and included &quot;Music by Richard Berry&quot; credits. Zappa said that he fired guitarist Alice Stuart from the Mothers of Invention because she couldn&#x27;t play &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, although this comment was obviously intended as a joke.

At a 1967 concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Mothers of Invention keyboardist Don Preston climbed up to the venue&#x27;s famous pipe organ, usually used for classical works, and played the signature riff (included on the 1969 album &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;). Quick interpolations of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; also frequently turn up in other Zappa works.

===1970s===
====Iggy Pop (1972)====
Iggy Pop (then known as Jim Osterberg) began performing &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, &quot;a song nearly as old and unkillable as Iggy himself&quot;, &quot;with his own version of the dirty lyrics&quot; in 1965 as a member of the Iguanas. Later with the Stooges and as a solo performer, he recorded multiple versions of the song, &quot;turn[ing] the source material into something suitable for the modern age&quot;. As the &quot;godfather of punk&quot;, he inspired a host of punk rock successors, including many with their own versions as the song became a &quot;live staple for many punk-rock bands of the 1970s&quot;.

A 1964 instrumental demo cut with Osterberg/Pop on drums was released on &quot;Jumpin&#x27; with the Iguanas&quot; (1995) and a London rehearsal version from 1972 was released on &quot;Heavy Liquid&quot; (2005) and again on &quot;Born in a Trailer&quot; (2016). A 1973 live version was released on &quot;The Detroit Tapes&quot; (2009). &quot;Metallic KO&quot; (1976) featured a provocative version with impromptu obscene lyrics from the last performance of Iggy and the Stooges in 1974 at the Michigan Palace in Detroit where, according to Lester Bangs, &quot;you can actually hear hurled beer bottles breaking on guitar strings&quot;. (&quot;55 Minute Louie-Louie&quot;, released in 2017 by Shave on their &quot;High Alert&quot; digital album, commemorated the occasion.) &quot;Consequence&quot; called this version &quot;a rock standard blown up from the inside out&quot; and said, &quot;The band&#x27;s cover of &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; somehow both honors their rock ‘n’ roll forebears and spits on their legacy. In other words, it&#x27;s punk at its best.&quot;

Pop later wrote a new version with political and satirical verses instead of obscenities that was released on &quot;American Caesar&quot; in 1993. One lyric in particular captured Pop&#x27;s long term relationship with the song: &quot;I think about the meaning of my life again, and I have to sing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; again.&quot; &quot;Far Out Magazine&quot; called it &quot;the best version of the song out there&quot;. It was used during the opening credits of Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and as an ending song in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; in which Pop took part as himself. The video game &quot;Just Dance&quot; also featured this version performed by a dancing Iggy Pop avatar.

Multiple live versions were released on &quot;Nuggets&quot; (recorded 1980, released 1999), &quot;Where The Faces Shine - Volume 2&quot; (recorded 1982, released 2008), &quot;The Legendary Breaking Point Tour&quot; (recorded 1983, released 1993), &quot;Kiss My Blood&quot; (1991, VHS), &quot;Beside You&quot; (1993), and &quot;Roadkill Rising&quot; (1994).

====Toots and the Maytals (1972)====
&quot;Louie Louie&quot; journeyed to its lyrical Jamaican destination with a &quot;slow skanking&quot; reggae version &quot;as soulful as it gets&quot; by Toots and the Maytals. A shorter version was released as a 1972 single in Jamaica (Jaguar J.49) and the U.K. (Trojan TR-7865) with a longer version included on the 1973 &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; album, described by rock critic Lester Bangs writing in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; as &quot;Perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released&quot;.

A BBC reviewer said, &quot;The goofy garage anthem becomes both fiery sermon and dance-til-you-drop marathon. And, thanks to Toots’ soulman&#x27;s disregard for verbal meaning, the words are, if anything, even harder to discern than in the Kingsmen&#x27;s version.&quot; Rolling Stone wrote, &quot;And it passes the toughest test of any &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; remake — it rocks hard&quot; while &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot; cited its &quot;incomprehensible majesty&quot; and &quot;crazy vigour&quot; that made it &quot;the best version ever&quot;. Another author, writing about the song&#x27;s use in a scene in &quot;This Is England&quot; noted, &quot;A black Jamaican band&#x27;s cover of a black American song, made famous by a white American band, seems an appropriate signifier of the racial harmony that [director Shane] Meadows seeks to evoke ...&quot;

The group performed the &quot;infectiously danceable rocksteady rendering&quot; frequently in concert and a live version appeared on the 1998 various artists album &quot;Reggae Live Sessions Volume 2&quot;. Toots Hibbert also performed it solo and with other acts until his death in 2020, most notably the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Dave Matthews Band.

====&quot;Brother Louie&quot; (1973)====
Although musically not a true cover version, &quot;Brother Louie&quot;, Errol Brown and Tony Wilson&#x27;s song about an interracial romance, was &quot;strongly inspired by the Kingsmen&#x27;s classic&quot; and described by Dave Marsh as &quot;one of the truest heirs Richard Berry&#x27;s &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; ever had&quot; based on its theme of separated lovers and its minor key reprise of the chorus. The original release by Hot Chocolate reached No. 7 on the UK singles chart. A cover version by Stories was a No. 1 hit in the U.S. later the same year. In 1993, the Quireboys&#x27; version reached No. 31 in the UK.

====Patti Smith (1975)====
Multiple live versions by Patti Smith, the &quot;punk poet laureate&quot;, were released in the mid-1970s on bootleg albums &quot;Let&#x27;s Deodorize The Night&quot;, &quot;Teenage Perversity &amp; Ships In The Night&quot;, &quot;In Heat&quot;, and &quot;Bicentenary Blues&quot;, usually as a medley in which Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; would &quot;sacrilegiously segue&quot; into &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. A 1975 live version at The Bottom Line was described as &quot;uptight&quot; with her &quot;raw voice barking out the chorus&quot;. Her version has also been described as tapping &quot;directly into the primal, urchin-like spirit of rock&#x27;s renaissance&quot;.

====Jon the Postman (1977)====
Described as &quot;a committed and omnipresent figure on the punk and post-punk scene in Manchester&quot;, Jon the Postman became known for waiting until headline bands like the Buzzcocks, the Fall, and Warsaw (later Joy Division) had finished their sets (sometimes before they had finished) before mounting the stage in a drunken state, grabbing the microphone, and performing his own versions of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. The first occurrence was at a Buzzcocks concert at the Band on the Wall venue on May 2, 1977, which he described:

&quot;I think the Buzzcocks left the stage and the microphone was there and a little voice must have been calling, &#x27;This is your moment, Jon.&#x27; I&#x27;ve no idea to this day why I sang &#x27;Louie Louie,&#x27; the ultimate garage anthem from the 60s. And why I did it &quot;a cappella&quot; and changed all the lyrics apart from the actual chorus, I have no idea. I suppose it was my bid for immortality, one of those great bolts of inspiration.&quot;
&quot;For some reason it appeared to go down rather well. I suppose it was taking the punk ethos to the extreme – anyone can have a go. Before punk it was like you had to have a double degree in music. It was a liberation for someone like me who was totally unmusical but wanted to have a go.&quot;

A version of the song by The Fall with Jon on vocals appeared on the &quot;Live 1977&quot; album which was described by Stewart Home as taking &quot;the amateurism of the Kingsmen to its logical conclusion with grossly incompetent musicianship and a drummer who seems to be experiencing extreme difficulty simply keeping time&quot;. A version with his group Puerile was included on the 1978 album &quot;John the Postman&#x27;s Puerile&quot;.

====Motörhead (1978)====
Motörhead&#x27;s &quot;charming, laid-back rendition of an old rock chestnut&quot; originated as a &quot;cheap one-take demo&quot; produced by Alvin Lee. With support from manager Doug Smith, the track was rerecorded and shopped to Bronze Records. Founder Gerry Bron disliked the &quot;incendiary, almost sullen rendition&quot;, labeling it &quot;about the worst record I&#x27;d ever heard&quot;. Nevertheless, it was released as the group&#x27;s second single, &quot;purely as a favour&quot; to promoter Neil Warnock, to coincide with an upcoming tour.

A &quot;rough-edged cover of the garage rock warhorse&quot; with Clarke&#x27;s guitar emulating the opening electric piano riff, it was paired with &quot;Tear Ya Down&quot; on a 7&quot; vinyl single. Supported by a &quot;back-breaking&quot; touring schedule, the &quot;high-octane&quot; version reached No. 68 on the UK Singles Chart. The track also appeared on the CD re-issues of &quot;Overkill&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Best of Motörhead&quot; (2000).

Lead singer Lemmy Kilmister said,

&quot;I think we did a really good version of it – people tell me that it&#x27;s one of the few times it&#x27;s been recorded where the lyrics can be understood! Actually, I only got the first two verses and then the last verse was largely improvised.&quot;

On 25 October 1978, a pre-recording of the band playing the song was broadcast on the BBC show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and was subsequently released on the 2005 album &quot;BBC Live &amp; In-Session&quot;. Another live 1978 version was released on &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot; (1990) and a 1978 alternate studio track appeared on &quot;Over the Top: The Rarities&quot; (2000). The 2005 &quot;deluxe edition&quot; of &quot;Overkill&quot; included the original version, the BBC version, and two alternate versions.

====&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978)====

Bluto Blutarsky (John Belushi) performing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; forever cemented the song&#x27;s status as a &quot;frat rock&quot; classic and a staple of toga parties. Belushi may have insisted on singing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; because he associated it with losing his virginity, but, according to director John Landis, it was included in the screenplay by soundtrack producer Kenny Vance long before Belushi was involved with the project because &quot;... it would be the song the Deltas would sing&quot;.

In the film, the Deltas were clearly aping the Kingsmen version complete with slurred dirty lyrics, but the setting was 1962, a year before the Kingsmen recording. Although Richard Berry released his original version of the song in 1957, and the song had been popular with local bands in the Northwest following Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts&#x27; 1961 single, the mythical Faber College was based on Dartmouth College in the Northeast U.S., so the use of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was an anachronism.

The Kingsmen version was heard during the film along with a brief live rendition by Belushi with Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst, Bruce McGill, and James Widdoes. A separate version by Belushi played during the credits and was included on the soundtrack album. The Belushi version was also released as a single (MCA 3046) and reached No. 89, No. 91, and No. 91 on the Billboard, Cashbox, and Record World charts, respectively.

Another actor from the film, DeWayne Jessie as Otis Day of Otis Day and the Knights, included a version on the VHS release &quot;Otis My Man&quot; in 1987. The film&#x27;s soundtrack producer Kenny Vance (formerly of Jay and the Americans) also released a version with his group The Planotones on the 2007 album &quot;Dancin&#x27; And Romancin&quot;&#x27;.

====Bruce Springsteen (1978)====
Bruce Springsteen has had a long association with &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, playing it at multiple concerts and guest appearances, and commenting often on its significance.

From the 1979 &quot;No Nukes&quot; concert:&quot;Rock is primarily about longing. All the great rock songs are about longing. &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot; is about longing; &#x27;How does it feel to be without a home?&#x27; — &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;! You&#x27;re yearning for –&#x27;Where&#x27;s that big party that I know is out there, but I can&#x27;t find it&#x27;.&quot;

From the 2018 soundtrack album for &quot;Springsteen on Broadway&quot; (spoken intro to &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;):
&quot;There is no love without one plus one equaling three. It&#x27;s the essential equation of art. It&#x27;s the essential equation of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. It&#x27;s the reason the universe will never be fully comprehensible. It&#x27;s the reason &quot;Louie Louie&quot; will never be fully comprehensible. And it&#x27;s the reason true rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and true rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bands, will never die.&quot;

He has said that &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was &quot;the most misunderstood song since &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;&quot;, and one critic characterized &quot;The River&quot; as &quot;Less Kierkegaard, lots more Kingsmen&quot;.

The first known recorded performance was on September 9, 1978, at the University of Notre Dame on the Darkness Tour, followed by other tour performances in 1978, 1981, 2009, and 2014. He also played the song in guest appearances with other groups in 1982 (at the Stone Pony with Cats on a Hot Surface) and 1983 (at The Headliner in Neptune, NJ with Midnight Thunder). Song &quot;snippets&quot; are frequently played within other songs: &quot;High School Confidential&quot;, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, and &quot;Pay Me My Money Down&quot;.

Multiple concert bootleg albums included a live &quot;Louie Louie&quot; version: &quot;Reggae &#x27;N&#x27; Soul&quot; (1988), &quot;Notre Dame Game&quot; (1981), &quot;Rockin&#x27; Days&quot; (1983), &quot;Rock Through the Jungle&quot; (1983), &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Is Here to Stay&quot; (1990), &quot;Clubs&#x27; Stories&quot; (1994), &quot;Songs for an Electric Mule&quot; (1994), &quot;Lost &amp; Live&quot; (1995), &quot;The Boss Hits the Sixties&quot; (2009), &quot;Satisfaction&quot; (2014), &quot;Charlotte, NC 04/19/14&quot; (2014), &quot;Who´s Been Covered by the Boss&quot; (2014), &quot;Saginaw 1978&quot; (2015), and &quot;High Hopes Tour 2014&quot; (2018).

E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg played &quot;Louie Louie&quot; on his 2017 live &quot;Jukebox&quot; show, and guitarist Nils Lofgren credited some of his success to &quot;I just happened to play &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; a little different than the other guys.&quot; Steven Van Zandt remembered it as the record that changed his life, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s where it all started.&quot;

More recently, Springsteen included the Kingsmen&#x27;s version in a curated &quot;frat rock&quot; playlist on the 25th episode of his &quot;From My Home to Yours&quot; Sirius XM radio show in July 2021 and again as an intro on the 30th episode in October 2023. In a 2024 interview on The Howard Stern Show, he described &quot;Louie Louie&quot; as &quot;a great fucking song&quot;.

===1980s===
====Black Flag (1981)====

The Hermosa Beach, California, hardcore punk band Black Flag released a &quot;raw&quot;, &quot;rubbished&quot;, &quot;brilliant, demented&quot; version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; as a single in 1981 on Posh Boy Records. It was the band&#x27;s first release with Dez Cadena as singer, replacing Ron Reyes. Cadena would go on to sing on the &quot;Six Pack&quot; EP before switching to rhythm guitar and being replaced on vocals by Henry Rollins.

Bryan Carroll of AllMusic gave the single four out of five stars, saying, &quot;Of the more than 1,500 commitments of Richard Berry&#x27;s &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; to wax ... Black Flag&#x27;s volatile take on the song is incomparable. No strangers to controversy themselves, the band pummel the song with their trademark pre-Henry Rollins era guitar sludge, while singer Dez Cadena spits out his nihilistic rewording of the most misunderstood lyrics in rock history.&quot;
&quot;You know the pain that&#x27;s in my heart&lt;br&gt;It just shows I&#x27;m not very smart&lt;br&gt;Who needs love when you&#x27;ve got a gun?&lt;br&gt;Who needs love to have any fun?&quot;
The single also included an early version of &quot;Damaged I&quot;, which would be re-recorded with Rollins for the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Damaged&quot;, later that year. Demo versions of both tracks, recorded with Cadena, were included on the 1982 compilation album &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;.

The front cover art shows the main verse of the lyrics to &quot;Louie Louie&quot; over a photograph by Edward Colver featuring Black Flag&#x27;s third singer Dez Cadena. Both tracks from the single were included on the 1983 compilation album &quot;The First Four Years&quot;, and &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was also included on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Wasted...Again&quot;. A live version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, recorded by the band&#x27;s 1985 lineup, was released on &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the 10½?&quot;, with Rollins improvising his own lyrics.

Continued touring, line-up changes, and occasional reunions resulted in multiple recorded live versions with various lead singers Keith Morris, Ron Reyes, Dez Cadena, Henry Rollins, and Mike Vallely.

====Stanley Clarke and George Duke (1981)====
A duo of &quot;jazz rock fusioneers&quot;, bassist Stanley Clarke and keyboardist George Duke, included a &quot;killer version&quot; &quot;funk cover&quot; on &quot;The Clarke/Duke Project&quot;, a 1981 album of eight original compositions and one cover. The song&#x27;s combination of narration and singing within a storytelling structure elicited a variety of reactions ranging from &quot;appealing&quot; and &quot;imaginative adaptation&quot; to &quot;probably the funkiest version of &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; ever recorded&quot;. One Allmusic reviewer called it &quot;a truly bizarre rendition&quot; while another lamented that the Clarke/Duke version &quot;criminally, never made it onto any of the various artists collections that showcased the legendary Richard Berry tune&quot; (but it was included on &quot;The Best of Louie Louie, Volume 2&quot;).

A single was also released in Europe (cut to 3:38 from the album&#x27;s 5:05 length). The album was nominated for a 1982 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

====Barry White (1981)====
Disco king Barry White created Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;all-time favorite&quot; version as he &quot;reworked and revamped&quot; the original to create a &quot;Latin-tinged&quot; rendition that &quot;took the song from pure rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll to pure moan &#x27;n&#x27; groan&quot;. Not all reaction was positive, however, as CD Review dismissed it as &quot;blasphemy&quot; and &quot;disco-fied&quot;.

White commented,&quot;I&#x27;m gonna sing just like Richard Berry. I&#x27;m gonna do this song that this black guy wrote. Everybody thinks that these white guys recorded it, but a black guy did this.&quot;

Dave Marsh summarized Berry&#x27;s reaction,&quot;In White&#x27;s arrangement, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; emerges as an up-tempo Latin groove, driven by timbales and congas and punctuated by brilliant trumpet riffs, while White supplements the chorus with the plaintive interpolation &quot;Comin&#x27; home, Jamaaaica!&quot; Richard Berry loved it because White&#x27;s version finally brought to life his original vision of &quot;all the timbales and congas going, and me singing &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Barry White did it exactly the way I wanted to do it,&quot; Berry enthused, &quot;I loved it.&quot;&quot;

In the &quot;Beware!&quot; liner notes, White wrote,&quot;I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize and give an acknowledgement of credit. The song &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was originally written and created by a man who, I feel, was one of the true pioneers of my time. All my respect, highest admiration and love goes to Mr. Richard Berry.&quot;

The track was released on White&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Beware!&quot; album, and also as 12&quot; and a 7&quot; single (shortened from 7:14 to 3:35). White also performed it on &quot;Soul Train&quot; on September 19, 1981, and on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; on August 8, 1981.

====The Fat Boys (1988)====
The Fat Boys with producers Latin Rascals brought &quot;Louie Louie&quot; up to date in 1988 with a hip hop version which reached No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and No. 46 on the UK Top 100. Their rap, with rewritten lyrics, &quot;chronicled a pursuit of the song&#x27;s real words&quot;. Dave Marsh in 1993 called their version &quot;the last great &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; to date&quot;.

The Fat Boys version was released on the &quot;Coming Back Hard Again&quot; album on the Tin Pan Apple label, and also on a 12&quot; single (5:42 and 3:50 edits) and a 7&quot; single (3:50 edit). The 2009 compilation album &quot;Fat Boys On Rewind&quot; included it as well. Notable live performances in 1988 included Club MTV and the MTV Video Music Awards. The music video, directed by Scott Kalvert, was a parody of Animal House with food fights, dancing girls, and togas.

====Other 1980s versions====
*The Grateful Dead, multiple live versions in the 1980s with Brent Mydland on vocals.
*Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts, on the 1992 CD reissue of the 1981 album &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;; one of multiple versions that deliberately repeated the Jack Ely early vocal entry mistake. Joan Jett said of producer Neil Bogart&#x27;s insistence that she record &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, &quot;This was a song that I did not want to do ... All that stuff at the beginning of the song is me trying to ensure that the song would suck. Didn&#x27;t work. I thought it came out well.&quot;

===1990s===

====&quot;Coupe de Ville&quot; (1990)====
Written by Mike Binder and directed by Joe Roth, &quot;Coupe de Ville&quot; featured an extended scene discussing possible interpretations of the &quot;Louie Louie&quot; lyrics and a closing credit montage of multiple &quot;Louie Louie&quot; versions.

Hearing the Kingsmen version on a car radio sparks an extended debate among the three Libner brothers (Patrick Dempsey, Arye Gross, Daniel Stern) about the lyrics and whether it is a &quot;hump song&quot;, a &quot;dance song&quot;, or a &quot;sea chanty&quot; with the eldest and most worldly brother arguing for the last interpretation. As the Los Angeles Times noted, &quot;Joe Roth obviously knows the importance of the &quot;Louie Louie&quot; lyric controversy&quot;.

Multiple versions played during the closing credits: Richard Berry, the Rice University Marching Owl Band, the Sandpipers, Les Dantz and his Orchestra, the Kingsmen, and Young MC’s &quot;Louie Louie House Mix&quot; (a remix of the Kingsmen version with samples from Richard Berry and the Rice University MOB). The movie trailer also used the Richard Berry and Kingsmen versions.

The soundtrack album, released by Cypress Records on vinyl, CD and cassette, included the Kingsmen and Young MC versions. A 12&quot; EP (Cypress Records V-74500) was released with four tracks: &quot;Louie Rap&quot;, &quot;Louie Vocal Attack&quot;, &quot;Louie Louie House Mix&quot;, and &quot;Louie DePalma Mix&quot; (all &quot;featuring Maestro Fresh Wes&quot; and &quot;produced by Young MC&quot;).

A music video of &quot;Louie Louie House Mix&quot;, credited to &quot;Various Artists (featuring Young MC)&quot;, was concurrently released and included appearances by Robert Townsend (&quot;It’s a hump song!&quot;), Kareem Abdul Jabbar (&quot;It’s a dance song!&quot;), Martin Short, Young MC, and others.

The inclusion of the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; is a bit of an anachronism in that the film takes place on a trip from Detroit to Florida during the summer of 1963. The initial release of the Kingsmen version on the regional Jerden label was in May 1963, but no significant national radio airplay and chart activity (or lyrics controversy) occurred until October and its national chart debut was not until early November.

====The Three Amigos (1999)====

The first release by the Three Amigos (Dylan Amlot, Milroy Nadarajah, and Marc Williams) was their multi-version cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. The 12&quot; EP, titled &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, included &quot;Original Mix&quot;, &quot;Da Digglar Mix&quot;, &quot;Wiseguys Remix&quot;, and &quot;Touché&#x27;s Bonus Beats&quot;. The CD tracks were different: &quot;Louie Louie (Original Radio Mix)&quot;, &quot;We Rock&quot;, and &quot;Louie Louie Wiseguys Remix&quot;. Released in July 1999 as a CD single, &quot;Original Mix&quot; featured heavy sampling of the Kingsmen intro and chorus. It reached No. 15 on the UK Singles Chart (higher than the Kingsmen&#x27;s No. 26 in 1964), leading to a February 7, 1999 appearance on Top of the Pops.

====Other 1990s versions====

*Johnny Winter, on the 1990 album &quot;A Lone Star Kind of Day&quot;.
*Guru Josh, on his 1990 acid house album &quot;Infinity&quot; that reached No. 41 on the UK chart. But &quot;when critics spotted a cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; on his debut album, the game was definitely up&quot;.
*Ry Cooder, live in 1990 at a Village Music function with Richard Berry, Tim Drummond, Scott Mathews, Steve Douglas, and Johnnie Johnson.
*Eric Burdon, live in 1990 at a Ventura Beach concert; Burdon also included the Kingsmen&#x27;s version in his curated list of 13 tracks as host of Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;Guest D. J.&quot; program #105 on March 26, 1984.
*Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin, on their 1991 album &quot;Spin&quot; as a medley with &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot;.

*Warren Zevon, live with the Rock Bottom Remainders in Bangor, Maine in 1998. Horror author Stephen King sang lead, and music critic Joel Selvin performed an extended &quot;scream solo&quot;.

===2000s===

===&quot;Louie Louie&quot; compilations===
*In 1983 Rhino Records released &quot;The Best of Louie, Louie: The Greatest Renditions of Rock&#x27;s #1 All Time Song&quot; in conjunction with KFJC&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Louie Louie&quot; event. The album featured a re-recorded Richard Berry version, influential versions by Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts, the Sonics and the Kingsmen, Black Flag&#x27;s version, and several other versions, some bizarre. These included an &quot;outlandish&quot; performance by the Rice University Marching Owl Band, an a cappella &quot;Hallalouie Chorus&quot;, in which the song&#x27;s title was sung to the melody of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot;, and a David Bowie imitation by Les Dantz and his Orchestra. Reissued on CD in 1988 by Rhino. Re-released in 2023 in Japan by Oldays as &quot;The Best of Louie Louie &amp; More&quot; with 15 additional tracks.
*&quot;The Best of Louie Louie, Volume 2&quot; followed in 1989 with versions by Paul Revere and the Raiders, Mongo Santamaria, Pete Fountain, the Kinks, Ike and Tina Turner, the Shockwaves, and others.
*In 1994 Jerden Records released &quot;The Louie Louie Collection by the Best of the Northwest&quot;, a Pacific Northwest-oriented compilation featuring versions by the Kingsmen, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Don and the Goodtimes, Little Bill &amp; the Adventurers, the Feelies, Ian Whitcomb, the University of Washington Husky Marching Band, and others. (The UW Husky Marching Band has been playing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; for over 40 years.)
*In 1997 &quot;The First Louie Louie Spanish Compilation&quot; was released by Louie Records featuring 11 versions by the Flaming Sideburns, the Navahodads, Luxury Liner, and others.
*In 2002 Ace Records released &quot;Love That Louie: The Louie Louie Files&quot;, a comprehensive overview of the origins, impact and legacy of &quot;the cultural phenomenon known as &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;.&quot; Featuring detailed sleeve notes by Alec Palao, the CD contained 24 tracks divided into eight sections titled &quot;The Original Louie&quot;, &quot;Inspirational Louie&quot;, &quot;Northwest Louie&quot;, &quot;Louie As A Way Of Life&quot;, &quot;Transatlantic Louie&quot;, &quot;Louie: The Rewrite&quot;, &quot;Louie: The Sequel&quot; and &quot;Louie Goes Home&quot;. The first CD reissue of Richard Berry&#x27;s original version was included along with multiple historically important versions.
*A 2024 compilation, &quot;Hunger Is Violence&quot;, featured 14 &quot;diverse reinterpretations&quot; of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by some of Ireland&#x27;s &quot;most singular experimental and avant-garde talents&quot; with proceeds benefiting the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The liner notes by Kevin Barry spotlighted the &quot;single propulsive riff&quot; from &quot;the song that invented viral&quot;.

===Foreign language versions===
Shortly after the Kingsmen&#x27;s version charted in late 1963, the first international covers appeared. Since the original lyrics were notoriously difficult to discern, the translations were often inaccurate or adapted to a different storyline. Early foreign language versions included:
*Los Apson (Mexico), as &quot;Ya No Lo Hagas&quot;, on a 1963 single (Peerless 1263) and a 1964 album &quot;Atrás De La Raya&quot;
*Joske Harry&#x27;s and the King Creoles (Belgium), on a 1963 single (Arsa 107)
*Les Players (France), as &quot;Si C&#x27;Etait Elle&quot;, on a 1964 single (Polydor 1879) and a 1964 EP (Polydor 27 129)
*Los Supersónicos (El Salvador), on a 1965 single (DCA 1082) and eponymous album
*Pedrito Ramirez con Los Yogis (US), on a 1965 single (Angelo 518)
*I Trappers (Italy), as &quot;Lui Lui Non Ha&quot;, on a 1965 single (CGD 9606)

*Maddalena (Italy), as &quot;Lui Lui&quot; on a 1967 single (RCA Italiana 3413)
*Los Yetis (Colombia), on a 1968 album &quot;Olvidate&quot;

In 1966 the Sandpipers, a US group, released a slower tempo Spanish language version that reached No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was covered that same year in German by Die Rosy-Singers.

The 1983 compilation &quot;The Best of Louie, Louie&quot; featured a &quot;goofy&quot; Russian version by Red Square, and in 1997 an entire album of Spanish covers, &quot;The First Louie Louie Spanish Compilation&quot;, was released with versions by the Flaming Sideburns, the Navahodads, Los DelTonos, and eight others. Other Spanish versions were released by Los Hermanos Carrion (Mexico), as &quot;Alu, Aluai&quot; on a 1971 album &quot;Lagrimas de Cristal Que Manera de Perder&quot;, Los Elegantes (Spain), as &quot;Luisa Se Va&quot; on a 1985 album &quot;Paso A Paso&quot;, and Desperados (Spain), on a 1997 album &quot;Por Un Puñado De Temas&quot;.

In 1988, Michael Doucet released a &quot;great vocal treatment&quot; of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in Cajun French on the &quot;Michael Doucet and Cajun Brew&quot; album. &quot;CD Review&quot; characterized his version as &quot;oddly appropriate&quot;.

More recent non-English efforts included:

*Elektricni Orgazam (Serbia), as &quot;Lui Lui&quot;, on a 1986 album &quot;Distorzija&quot;
*Irha (Italy), as &quot;Lui Luisa&quot;, on a 1989 EP &quot;Beati I Primi&quot; (Attack Punk Records - APR 12)

*The Dizzy Brains (Madagascar), as &quot;Hiala Aho Zao&quot;, on a 2014 album &quot;Môla Kely&quot;
*Dynasis (Greece), as &quot;Loui Loui&quot; on a 2019 digital single

==Answer songs, sequels, and tributes==
&quot;Louie Louie&quot; has spawned a number of answer songs, sequels, and tributes from the 1960s to the present:

*&quot;Louie Go Home&quot;, 1964, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders (Columbia 4-43008); also recorded in 1964 by Davie Jones &amp; The King Bees (David Bowie) as &quot;Louie Louie Go Home&quot; and by The Who in 1965 as &quot;Lubie (Come Back Home)&quot;.
*&quot;Love That Louie&quot;, 1964, Jack E. Lee &amp; The Squires (RCA 54-8452); a &quot;brazen attempt to approximate the idiosyncrasies of its predecessor.&quot;
*&quot;Louie Come Home&quot;, 1965, The Epics (Zen 202)
*&quot;Louie Come Back&quot;, 1965, The Legends (&quot;Shout! Northwest Killers Volume 2&quot;, Norton NW 907)

Bimstein described the work as &quot;a lively fantasy based on the archetypical I-IV-V chord progression ... [that] sends a small fragment on a deconstructive mission through a contemporary classical landscape.&quot;
*&quot;The Ballad of the Kingsmen&quot;, 2004, Todd Snider (&quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot;, Oh Boy Records OBR-031); commentary on the tendency of the &quot;religious right and the government ... to blame rock music for the moral decline of our youth.&quot;

*&quot;I Wanna Louie Louie (All Night Long)&quot;, 2018, Charles Albright (&quot;Everything Went Charles Albright&quot;, Sacramento Records 028)

==Parodies and rewrites==
Due to the song&#x27;s distinctive rhythm and simple structure, it has been used often as a basis for parodies and rewrites. Examples include:

*&quot;Lilly Lilly&quot; by Slim Jim. Satirized the mumbled vocals of the Kingsmen version. Released on a 1965 single (Laurie 3226) produced and co-written by Ernie Maresca.
*&quot;Lewis Lewis&quot; by the Rain Kings. Self-released on a 1966 EP with lyrics rewritten by group members Doug Dossett and Steve Lowry.

*&quot;Jedi Jedi&quot;. Star Wars parody released online by Royish Good Looks in 2018.

==Lyrics controversy and investigations==
As &quot;Louie Louie&quot; began to climb the national charts in late 1963, Jack Ely&#x27;s &quot;slurry snarl&quot; and &quot;mush-mouthed&quot;, &quot;gloriously garbled&quot;, &quot;infamously incomprehensible&quot;, &quot;legendarily manic&quot;, &quot;punk squawk&quot; vocals gave rise to rumors about &quot;dirty lyrics&quot;. The Kingsmen initially ignored the rumors, but soon &quot;news networks were filing reports from New Orleans, Florida, Michigan, and elsewhere about an American public nearly hysterical over the possible dangers of this record&quot;. The song quickly became &quot;something of a Rorschach test for dirty minds&quot; who &quot;thought they could detect obscene suggestions in the lyric&quot;.

In January 1964, Indiana governor Matthew E. Welsh, acting on multiple complaint letters, determined the lyrics to be pornographic because his &quot;ears tingled&quot; when he listened to the record. He referred the matter to the FCC and also requested that the Indiana Broadcasters Association advise their member stations to pull the record from their playlists. An initial FCC investigation found the song &quot;unintelligible at any speed&quot;.
The National Association of Broadcasters also investigated and deemed it &quot;unintelligible to the average listener&quot;, but that &quot;[t]he phonetic qualities of this recording are such that a listener possessing the &#x27;phony&#x27; lyrics could imagine them to be genuine.&quot; Neither the FCC nor the NAB took any further action.

In response, Max Feirtag of publisher Limax Music offered $1,000 to &quot;anyone finding anything suggestive in the lyrics&quot;, and &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine published the actual lyrics as provided by Limax. Scepter/Wand Records commented, &quot;Not in anyone&#x27;s wildest imagination are the lyrics as presented on the Wand recording suggestive, let alone obscene.&quot; Producer Jerry Dennon thanked the governor, saying, &quot;We really owe Governor Welsh a lot. The record already was going great, but since he&#x27;s stepped in to give us a publicity boost, it&#x27;s hard to keep up with orders.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; noted, &quot;It also seems likely that some shrewd press agentry may also be playing an important role in this teapot tempest.&quot;

The following month an outraged parent wrote to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy alleging that the lyrics of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; were obscene, saying, &quot;The lyrics are so filthy that I can-not &quot;[sic]&quot; enclose them in this letter.&quot; The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the complaint, and looked into the various rumors of &quot;real lyrics&quot; that were circulating among teenagers. In June 1965, the FBI laboratory obtained a copy of the Kingsmen recording and, after 31 months of investigation, concluded that it could not be interpreted and therefore the Bureau could not find that the recording was obscene.

Over the course of the investigation, a &quot;folk legend of modern times that has yet to be bettered for sheer inanity&quot;, the FBI interviewed Richard Berry, members of the Kingsmen, members of Paul Revere and the Raiders, and record company executives. The one person they never interviewed was the man who actually sang the words in question, Jack Ely, whose name apparently never came up because he was no longer with the Kingsmen.

By contrast, in 1964 the Ohio State University student newspaper &quot;The Lantern&quot; initiated an investigation in response to a growing campus controversy. Working with local radio station WCOL, a letter was sent to Wand Records requesting a copy of the lyrics. The paper printed the lyrics in full, resolving the issue, and resulting in booking the Kingsmen for the fall homecoming entertainment.

In a 1964 interview, Lynn Easton of the Kingsmen said, &quot;We took the words from the original version and recorded them faithfully&quot;, and group member Barry Curtis later added, &quot;Richard Berry never wrote dirty lyrics ... you listen and you hear what you want to hear.&quot; Richard Berry told &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1988 that the Kingsmen had sung the song exactly as written and often deflected questions about the lyrics by saying, &quot;If I told you the words, you wouldn&#x27;t believe me anyway.&quot;

In a 1991 Dave Marsh interview, Governor Welsh &quot;emphatically denied being a censor&quot;, claiming he never banned the record and only suggested that it not be played. Marsh disagreed, saying, &quot;If a record isn&#x27;t played at the suggestion of the state&#x27;s chief executive, it has been banned.&quot;

A history of the song and its notoriety was published in 1993 by Dave Marsh, including an extensive recounting of the multiple lyrics investigations, but he was unable to obtain permission to publish the song&#x27;s actual lyrics because the then current owner, Windswept Pacific, wanted people to &quot;continue to fantasize what the words are&quot;. Marsh noted that the lyrics controversy &quot;reflected the country&#x27;s infantile sexuality&quot; and &quot;ensured the song&#x27;s eternal perpetuation&quot;; he also included multiple versions of the supposed &quot;dirty lyrics&quot;. Other authors noted that the song &quot;reap[ed] the benefits that accrue from being pursued by the guardians of public morals&quot; and &quot;[s]uch stupidity helped ensure &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27; a long and prosperous life.&quot;

The lyrics controversy resurfaced briefly in 2005 when the superintendent of the school system in Benton Harbor, Michigan, refused to let a marching band play the song in a local parade; she later relented.

==Cultural impact==

===Book===
Music critic Dave Marsh wrote a 245-page book about the song, &quot;Louie Louie: The History and Mythology of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Rock &#x27;n Roll Song, Including the Full Details of Its Torture and Persecution at the Hands of the Kingsmen, J.Edgar Hoover&#x27;s F.B.I, and a Cast of Millions&quot;.

=== The Who ===
The Who were impacted in their early recording career by the riff/rhythm of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, owing to the song&#x27;s influence on the Kinks, who were also produced by Shel Talmy. Talmy wanted the successful sounds of the Kinks&#x27; 1964 hits &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;, and &quot;Till the End of the Day&quot; to be copied by the Who. As a result, Pete Townshend penned &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, &quot;a desperate copy of The Kinks&quot;, released in March 1965. The Who also covered the 1964 Lindsay-Revere sequel &quot;Louie Go Home&quot; in 1965 as &quot;Lubie (Come Back Home)&quot;.

In 1979, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (Kingsmen version) was included on the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; soundtrack album, and in 1980 the group performed a brief version in concert at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. In his 1993 book, Dave Marsh compared Keith Moon&#x27;s drumming style to Lynn Easton of the Kingsmen.

=== &quot;Psyché Rock&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot; ===
In 1967 French composers Michel Colombier and Pierre Henry, collaborating as Les Yper-Sound, produced a synthesizer and musique concrète work based on the &quot;Louie Louie&quot; riff titled &quot;Psyché Rock&quot;. They subsequently worked with choreographer Maurice Béjart on a &quot;Psyché Rock&quot;-based score for the ballet &quot;Messe pour le temps présent&quot;. The full score with multiple mixes of &quot;Psyché Rock&quot; was released the same year on the album &quot;Métamorphose&quot;. The album was reissued in 1997 with additional remixes including one by Ken Abyss titled &quot;Psyché Rock (Metal Time Machine Mix)&quot; which, along with the original, &quot;... Christopher Tyng reworked into the theme song for the animated television comedy series &quot;Futurama&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;Louie Louie&quot; marathons ===
In the early 1980s, KPFK DJs Art Damage and Chuck Steak began hosting a weekly &quot;Battle of the Louie Louie&quot; contest featuring multiple renditions and listener voting. In 1981, KFJC DJ Jeff &quot;Stretch&quot; Riedle broadcast a full hour of various versions. Soon after, KALX in Berkeley responded and the two stations engaged in a &quot;Louie Louie&quot; marathon battle with each increasing the number of versions played. KFJC&#x27;s Maximum Louie Louie Marathon topped the competition in August 1983 with 823 versions played over 63 hours, plus in studio performances by Richard Berry and Jack Ely.

During a change in format from adult-contemporary to all-oldies in 1997, WXMP in Peoria became &quot;all Louie, all the time,&quot; playing nothing but covers of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; for six straight days. Other stations used the same idea to introduce format changes including WWSW (Pittsburgh), KROX (Dallas), WNOR (Norfolk), and WRQN (Toledo).

In 2011, KFJC celebrated International Louie Louie Day with a reprise of its 1983 event, featuring multiple &quot;Louie Louie&quot; versions, new music by Richard Berry and appearances by musicians, DJs, and celebrities with &quot;Louie Louie&quot; connections. In April 2015, Orme Radio broadcast the First Italian Louie Louie Marathon, playing 279 versions in 24 hours. In 2023, the city of Portland hosted a 24-hour live marathon to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Kingsmen version.

=== Use in movies ===
Various versions of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; have appeared in the films listed below.
The Kingsmen version was used in television commercials for &quot;Spaced Invaders&quot; (1990), but did not appear in the movie. The Kingsmen version also appeared on More American Graffiti (1975) and Good Morning Vietnam (1987) compilations, but was not used in either movie.

;Movie table notes
=== Use in video games ===
Early video games with chiptune versions of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; included &quot;California Games&quot; and &quot;Donkey Konga&quot;. Since its introduction in 1987, &quot;California Games&quot; has been ported to more than a dozen gaming platforms, resulting in multiple unique &quot;Louie Louie&quot; versions based on different or improved programmable sound generator (PSG) chips. &quot;Back 2 Back&quot;, composed by Hideki Naganuma for &quot;Sonic Rush&quot;, borrows the &quot;Louie Louie&quot; riff for its main section.

More recent rhythm action games featured individual artist versions including &quot;Rocksmith&quot; (Joan Jett), &quot;Just Dance&quot; (Iggy Pop), and &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot; (Motörhead).

===Use in ringtones and apps===

&quot;Louie Louie&quot; has long been a popular downloadable ringtone, starting with early MIDI versions, then audio track excerpts, and then full audio tracks. Tom Cruise in &quot;Knight and Day&quot; (2010) used the Kingsmen version as a ringtone/movement reminder.

In 2015 Microsoft Messenger introduced the Zya Ditty app which allowed users to create short text-to-autotune music videos using a library of pre-licensed songs including &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and others.

=== Use in audio sampling ===
The earliest known sampling of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (Kingsmen version) was &quot;Flying Saucer&quot; by Ed Solomon in 1964 (Diamond 160), one of many &quot;break-in&quot; records popular in the 1960s.

Beginning in 1988, multiple rap and hip hop artists used audio samples of the keyboard intro and chorus of the Kingsmen version.

*1988: Ultramagnetic MCs, &quot;Travelling at the Speed of Thought&quot; (12&quot; single, initial release only); described by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; columnist Simon Reynolds as &quot;a sublimely teasing edit ... [of] the sixties punk tearaway reincarnated in the eighties B-boy motormouth!&quot;
*1988: JVC Force, &quot;Doin&#x27; Damage&quot; (from album &quot;Doin&#x27; Damage&quot;)
*1988: Fat Boys, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (from album &quot;Coming Back Hard Again&quot;; also released as a single)
*1990: Young and Restless, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (from album &quot;Something To Get You Hyped&quot;)
*1990: Young MC and Maestro Fresh Wes, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (from &quot;Coupe de Ville&quot; soundtrack album; samples Richard Berry, Kingsmen and other versions)
*1999: The Three Amigos, &quot;Louie Louie (Original Mix)&quot; and &quot;Wiseguys Remix&quot; (12&quot; EP, UK release)
*1999: Mutha Funkin, &quot;Say It Again&quot; (12&quot; single, UK release)
*2004: T.O.K. feat. Shaggy, &quot;Déja Vu&quot; (from album &quot;Unknown Language&quot;)

===Marching and concert band arrangements===

In the 1980s, due to the widespread availability of sheet music arrangements, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; became a staple of concert, marching, and pep bands for middle schools, high schools, and colleges and universities in the U.S. The earliest known high school band albums with a song version were the Evanston Township High School&#x27;s &quot;Hi-Lights 1965&quot; and the Franklin High School Choir, Orchestra, and Stage Band&#x27;s &quot;1966 Bel Cantos Concert&quot;. The first college band album with a version was the USC Trojan Marching Band&#x27;s &quot;Let The Games Begin&quot; in 1984. Early orchestra and big band releases included Dick Crest (&quot;Would You Believe - The Dick Crest Orchestra&quot;) and Neil Chotem (&quot;Neil Chotem and his Orchestra&quot;), both in 1968.

Although not commercially released, an example of the song&#x27;s influence was the 2000 performance by the Dover High School Band joined on saxophone by Bill Clinton (who played in a jazz trio named the Kingsmen at Hot Springs High School, and at whose 1964 graduation dance the actual Kingsmen performed).

===Washington State song===
In 1985, Ross Shafer, host and a writer-performer of the late-night comedy series &quot;Almost Live!&quot; on the Seattle TV station KING, spearheaded an effort to have &quot;Louie Louie&quot; replace &quot;Washington, My Home&quot; by Helen Davis as Washington&#x27;s official state song. A &quot;groundswell of public support&quot; followed including support from the Kingsmen, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and the Wailers, an appearance by Shafer on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes&quot;, and a Dubious Achievement Award from Esquire.

Picking up on this initially prankish effort, Whatcom County Councilman Craig Cole introduced Resolution No. 85-12 in the state legislature, citing the need for a &quot;contemporary theme song that can be used to engender a sense of pride and community, and in the enhancement of tourism and economic development&quot;. His resolution also called for the creation of a new &quot;Louie Louie County&quot;. While the House did not pass it, the Senate&#x27;s Resolution 1985-37 declared April 12, 1985, &quot;Louie Louie Day&quot;. A crowd of 4,000, estimated by press reports, convened at the state capitol that day for speeches, singalongs, and performances by the Wailers, the Kingsmen, and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Two days later, a Seattle event commemorated the occasion with the premiere performance of a new, Washington-centric version of the song co-written by composer Berry. After a spirited debate, the legislature ultimately preserved &quot;Washington, My Home&quot; as the state song while also adopting Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Roll On, Columbia, Roll On&quot; as the official folk song. &quot;Louie Louie&quot; remains the &quot;unofficial state rock song&quot;.

Although the effort failed in the end, a cover of Berry&#x27;s rewritten version was released in 1986 by Jr. Cadillac and included on the 1994 compilation &quot;The Louie Louie Collection&quot;. The &quot;state rock song&quot; was played following &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch at all Seattle Mariners home games from 1990 up until the 2022 season.

===International Louie Louie Day===

April 11 (Richard Berry&#x27;s birthday) is celebrated as International Louie Louie Day and is listed by Chase&#x27;s Calendar of Events, the National Special Events Registry, and other sources.

Support for International Louie Louie Day and other &quot;Louie Louie&quot;–related observances is provided by the Louie Louie Advocacy and Music Appreciation Society (LLAMAS) and &quot;Louie Louie&quot; fans worldwide.

===LouieFest===
The City of Tacoma held a summer music and arts festival from 2003 to 2012 in July named LouieFest. The event began in 2003 as the &quot;1000 Guitars Festival&quot; and featured a group performance of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; open to anyone with a guitar. The event was renamed LouieFest in 2004. Members of the Wailers, Kingsmen, Raiders, Sonics and other groups with &quot;Louie Louie&quot; associations regularly made appearances. The grand finale each year was the &quot;Celebration of 1000 Guitars&quot; mass performance of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; on the main stage.

===Louie Louie parades===
The largest &quot;Louie Louie&quot; parade, organized by WMMR deejay John DeBella, was held in Philadelphia from 1985 to 1989 with proceeds going to leukemia victims. DeBella described it as &quot;a parade for no reason ... and the no reason would be &#x27;Louie Louie&#x27;.&quot; It regularly drew crowds in excess of 50,000, but was ultimately cancelled due to excessive rowdiness.

Peoria, Illinois claims the longest running &quot;Louie Louie&quot; event, holding an annual &quot;Louie Louie&quot; street party, parade, and festival every year since 1988.

===Louie Louie sculpture===
A sculpture titled &quot;Louie Louie, 2013&quot; by Las Vegas-based artist Tim Bavington was displayed on the lobby wall of the Edith Green - Wendell Wyatt Federal Building in Portland, Oregon from 2013 to 2024. The work is constructed of 80 colored glass and acrylic panels representing the waveforms of the song using Bavington&#x27;s concept of sculpting sound waves.
 In 2024, it was sold for $250,000 to a private party.

===The Louie Awards===
The &quot;Seattle Times&quot; bestows its Louie Awards upon &quot;those who - through conscious act, rotten luck or slip of the tongue - stretch the limits of imagination or tolerance or taste in the Great Northwest.&quot;
