<text>The becquerel (; symbol: Bq) is the unit of radioactivity in the International System of Units (SI). One becquerel is defined as an activity of one per second, on average, for aperiodic activity events referred to a radionuclide. For applications relating to human health this is a small quantity, and SI multiples of the unit are commonly used.

The becquerel is named after Henri Becquerel, who shared a Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Marie Curie in 1903 for their work in discovering radioactivity.

==Definition==
1 Bq = 1 s−1

A special name was introduced for the reciprocal second (s) to represent radioactivity to avoid potentially dangerous mistakes with prefixes. For example, 1 μs would mean 10 disintegrations per second: , whereas 1 μBq would mean 1 disintegration per 1 million seconds. Other names considered were hertz (Hz), a special name already in use for the reciprocal second (for &quot;periodic&quot; events of any kind), and fourier (Fr; after Joseph Fourier). The hertz is now only used for periodic phenomena. While 1 Hz replaces the deprecated term cycle per second, 1 Bq refers to one event per second on average for aperiodic radioactive decays.

The gray (Gy) and the becquerel (Bq) were introduced in 1975. Between 1953 and 1975, absorbed dose was often measured with the rad. Decay activity was given with the curie before 1946 and often with the rutherford between 1946 and 1975.

== Unit capitalization and prefixes ==
As with every International System of Units (SI) unit named after a person, the first letter of its symbol is uppercase (Bq). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lowercase letter (becquerel)—except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case.

Like any SI unit, Bq can be prefixed; commonly used multiples are kBq (kilobecquerel, ), MBq (megabecquerel, , equivalent to 1 rutherford), GBq (gigabecquerel, ), TBq (terabecquerel, ), and PBq (petabecquerel, ). Large prefixes are common for practical uses of the unit.

== Examples ==
For practical applications, 1 Bq is a small unit. For example, there is roughly 0.017 g of potassium-40 in a typical human body, producing about 4,400 decays per second (Bq).

The activity of radioactive americium in a home smoke detector is about 37 kBq (1 μCi).

The global inventory of carbon-14 is estimated to be (8.5 EBq, 8.5 exabecquerel).

These examples are useful for comparing the amount of activity of these radioactive materials, but should not be confused with the amount of exposure to ionizing radiation that these materials represent. The level of exposure and thus the absorbed dose received are what should be considered when assessing the effects of ionizing radiation on humans.

== Relation to the curie ==
The becquerel succeeded the curie (Ci), an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226. The curie is defined as , or 37 GBq.

Conversion factors:
* 1 Ci = = 37 GBq
* 1 μCi = = 37 kBq
* 1 Bq = = 
* 1 MBq = 0.027 mCi

== Relation to other radiation-related quantities ==

The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units. &quot;W&quot; (formerly &#x27;Q&#x27; factor) is a factor that scales the biological effect for different types of radiation, relative to x-rays (e.g. 1 for beta radiation, 20 for alpha radiation, and a complicated function of energy for neutrons). In general, conversion between rates of emission, the density of radiation, the fraction absorbed, and the biological effects, requires knowledge of the geometry between source and target, the energy and the type of the radiation emitted, among other factors.

<doc id="155836" wikidata="Q123902" url="?curid=155836" title="Ruth Dreifuss">
<text>Ruth Dreifuss (born 9 January 1940) is a Swiss economist, unionist and politician who served as a member of the Federal Council (Switzerland) from 1993 to 2002. She served as Vice President of Switzerland in 1998 and as President of Switzerland in 1999 for the Social Democratic Party.

== Early life and education ==
Ruth Dreifuss was born 9 January 1940 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, the second of two children, to Sidney Dreifuss (1899-1956), a merchant, and Jeanne &quot;Johanna&quot; (née Bicard; 1905-1962), a secretary. Her elder brother, Jean-Jacques Dreifuss, is a professor emeritus at the University of Geneva. Her paternal family belongs to the oldest Jewish families of Switzerland settled in Endingen. Her maternal family originally hailed from Horbourg-Wihr in Alsace, they became citizens in Boppelsen in 1886. Officially, Dreifuss is non-denominational, however she considers herself as secular Jew.

In 1945, the family relocated to Geneva, where Dreifuss attended &quot;École de Sécheron&quot;, since 1947. After secondary school (Rue Neckar) she attended a commercial school completing a general business diploma. In 1958, she started to study social studies at &quot;Ecole des Études Sociales&quot; in Geneva, concurrently she attended several courses at the University of Geneva. In 1970, aged 30, she obtained a Master of Arts in Economics from this university.

== Career ==
After business education, Ruth worked as a secretary and social worker. Also, she was a journalist at &quot;Cooperation&quot; from 1961 to 1964. She joined the Socialist Party (SP) in 1964. Between 1972 and 1981, she was scientific expert at the Federal Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. Also, Dreifuss elected Secretary of the Swiss Trade Union, where she dealt with matters related to social insurance, labor law and women&#x27;s issues, until her election to the Swiss Federal Council in 1993.

Dreifuss was a social-democratic member of the City of Bern&#x27;s Legislative Assembly from 1989 to 1992. She missed out the election to the National Council of Switzerland in 1991.

She is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an International network of current and former female leaders whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

== Election to the Federal Council ==
After the resignation of René Felber from the Swiss Federal Council, a member of the Social Democratic Party was supposed to be elected, according to the unofficial &quot;magic formula&quot; used to determine the representation of the Swiss parties at the Federal Council. While Christiane Brunner was the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s official candidate for the election on 3 March 1993, the right-wing parties decided to back another member of the Social Democratic Party, Francis Matthey, a member of the national parliament and a Minister of the Canton of Neuchâtel at that time who declined election, as his party did not support it.

A new election was organized on 10 March 1993, and the Social Democratic Party presented both Ruth Dreifuss and Christiane Brunner as the two official candidates. It was the first time that two women were on the official &quot;ticket&quot; for election, and Ruth Dreifuss was elected on the 3rd round with 144 votes.

== Political actions undertaken ==
Ruth Dreifuss held the Federal Department of Home Affairs until her resignation on 31 December 2002. She was the first woman ever to be elected President of the Confederation from 1 January to 31 December 1999.

She won several referendums, including a revision of the Health Insurance Bill, the 10th revision of the social security system, a drug policy based on prevention, therapy, help and rehabilitation, and a new law regarding the film industry and its development. The 4-pillar policy was also aimed at reducing the spread of the AIDS epidemic, especially with a new policy regarding the supply of clean syringes.

She worked on a Maternity Insurance law, but since the majority of the Federal Council rejected the proposal, she had to ask the people to reject her own text, as she had to respect collegiality.

She is a member and former chair of the Global Commission on Drug Policy and a member of International Commission Against the Death Penalty.

<doc id="155837" wikidata="Q118199" url="?curid=155837" title="Flavio Cotti">
<text>Flavio Cotti (18 October 193916 December 2020) was a Swiss politician who served as member of the Federal Council from 1986 to 1999. He was a member of the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party from the canton of Ticino. In the 1990s, Cotti led the Swiss government&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to further Switzerland&#x27;s political integration into the European Union. He was President of the Confederation in 1991 and 1998 and headed the departments of Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs.

== Early life and political career ==
Cotti was born in Muralto. After studies of law in Fribourg, he practised law in Locarno and pursued a political career in his native Ticino.

In 1962, he headed the newly founded &quot;Partito popolare democratico ticinese&quot;. In 1981 he was elected president of the cantonal Christian Democratic Party, and served as president of the national party from 1981 to 1984.

Cotti was a member of the cantonal parliament from 1962 to 1975. He was elected to the cantonal government of Ticino in 1975. In 1983, he was elected to the national parliament&#x27;s lower house, the National Council.

== Federal Council ==
Cotti was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 10 December 1986, succeeding Alphons Egli, and resigned on 30 April 1999. During his time in office he headed the Federal Department of Home Affairs (1987–1993) and the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (1994–1999). He was President of the Confederation twice, first in 1991 and then again in 1998.

Cotti&#x27;s political philosophy was one of optimistic globalism, and he liked to be seen as a visionary and as an &quot;homme des lettres&quot;. A convinced Europhile, Cotti was instrumental in bringing about the Federal Council&#x27;s 1992 decision to seek Swiss membership of the European Union – a move that backfired a few months later when Swiss voters rejected membership in the European Economic Area, blocking further Swiss integration with the EU. In this and other areas, Cotti&#x27;s visions proved incompatible with Switzerland&#x27;s complicated and slow consensus politics, which earned him the nickname of &quot;minister of announcements&quot; (&quot;Ankündigungsminister&quot;).

As Switzerland&#x27;s foreign minister since 1994, Cotti helped salvage Switzerland&#x27;s relationship with the EU by negotiating and concluding a series of treaties that now govern Swiss–EU relations. He led Swiss negotiations to settle claims of Holocaust survivors against Switzerland and Swiss banks. He was a strong advocate of Switzerland&#x27;s accession to the United Nations, which voters only agreed to after his time in office in 2002. Cotti also prominently represented the country abroad, gaining international recognition as the first Swiss president of the OSCE.

== Post-ministerial life ==
After retiring from politics, Cotti served in leading advisory positions in major Swiss companies, including on the board of Credit Suisse.

Cotti died from COVID-19 on 16 December 2020, at the age of 81, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland.

<text>Arnold Koller (; born 29 August 1933) is a Swiss professor and politician. He served as a member of the Federal Council (Switzerland) from 1987 to 1999 for the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (CVP). Koller previously served as a member of the National Council from 1971 to 1986. He did also serve two terms of the as President of the Swiss Confederation in 1990 and 1997. He is primarily known for Lex Koller, a Swiss Federal Act on Acquisitions of Real Estate by Persons Abroad, which he initiated.

== Early life and education ==
Koller was born 29 August 1933 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, the oldest of five children, to Alois Arnold Koller and Genoveva (née Brülisauer). His father was an organist and elementary school teacher while his mother was a homemaker. He attended schools in Appenzell. Until 1957, Koller studied Economics in St. Gallen and then until 1959 Jurisprudence at the University of Fribourg and the University of California, Berkeley. He received a Licentiate degree in both majors. He received his PhD from the University of Fribourg 1966 respectively 1971.

<text>Kurt Furgler (24 June 1924 – 23 July 2008) was a Swiss politician and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1972–1986).

He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 8 December 1971 and handed over office on 31 December 1986. He was affiliated to the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland.

During his office time he held the following departments:
*Federal Department of Justice and Police (1972–1982)
*Federal Department of Economic Affairs (1983–1986)

He was President of the Confederation three times in 1977, 1981 and 1985.

Kurt Furgler was born and raised in St. Gallen, Switzerland. He studied Jurisprudence in Fribourg, Zürich, and Geneva, and was an avid handball player during his youth. In 1948, he obtained his license to practice law in St. Gallen. As a conservative centrist in the Federal Council of Switzerland, he advocated equal rights for women, and initiated economic reforms and modernized immigration and Swiss family law.

During his presidency, he argued for the European integration of Switzerland, and in 1982, signed the Luxembourg Declaration, which called for a closer cooperation between the European Union and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Dr. Furgler demanded a strong central government but failed to establish a Swiss federal police due to strong opposition from the left and confederated forces of the right.

In September 1982, he was the head of the special task force for the hostage situation in the Polish embassy in Bern. Controversially, he approved the clandestine copying of Polish diplomatic documents.

In November 1985, he asserted his significant representative role in international relations when he welcomed the American president Ronald Reagan and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev at the Geneva Summit.

Kurt Furgler resigned unexpectedly in 1986, but continued to serve in a number of committees, including the Club of Rome, InterAction Council, and the International Olympic Committee.

<text>John de Gray or de Grey (died 18 October 1214) was an English prelate who served as Bishop of Norwich, and was elected but unconfirmed Archbishop of Canterbury. He was employed in the service of Prince John even before John became king, for which he was rewarded with a number of ecclesiastical offices, culminating in his &quot;pro forma&quot; election to Norwich in 1200. De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the episcopate, lending the King money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf. In 1205 King John attempted to further reward de Gray with a translation to the archbishopric of Canterbury, but a disputed election process led to de Gray&#x27;s selection being quashed by Pope Innocent III in 1206.

Innocent consecrated Stephen Langton as archbishop against John&#x27;s wishes, triggering a long dispute between the papacy and the King. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray was one of only two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose a royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native Irish in that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent&#x27;s dispute over the bishop&#x27;s abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed Bishop of Durham, but he died on his way back to England.

De Gray built a palace in his diocese and several castles in Ireland. Although he was reviled by one contemporary writer as an &quot;evil counsellor&quot; to the King, modern historians have been more forgiving; one praised his intelligence and others stated that de Gray was one of the few men King John trusted throughout his life. De Gray&#x27;s nephew, Walter de Gray, secured the office of Lord Chancellor with his uncle&#x27;s help in 1205.

==Early life==

Some describe de Gray as a native of Norfolk; he was likely descended from the Norman knight Anchetil de Greye. De Gray was the uncle of Walter de Gray, later Archbishop of York. The elder de Gray was instrumental in securing the selection of his nephew as Lord Chancellor, as he was a surety for Walter&#x27;s payment of a fine of 5000 marks to acquire the position.

By 1196, de Gray was in the service of King Richard I&#x27;s brother John, and was keeper of John&#x27;s seal by 1198. John ascended the throne of England in 1199, with de Gray becoming Archdeacon of Cleveland in March 1200, and Archdeacon of Gloucester before April that year. He also served as John&#x27;s secretary, and frequently as a deputy for the Lord Chancellor, Hubert Walter. Shortly after John became king, de Gray began travelling between England and the continent on royal business, and for the first two years of John&#x27;s reign was active in the royal chancery, sealing royal charters.

De Gray was elected Bishop of Norwich on about 7 September 1200, although the election was purely &quot;pro forma&quot;, as acknowledged by a contemporary writer Roger of Howden, who stated that the new bishop &quot;succeeded to the bishopric of Norwich by the gift of King John&quot;. De Gray was consecrated on 24 September. His consecration took place together with that of the new Bishop of Hereford Giles de Braose at Westminster, at the conclusion of a provincial church council held by Archbishop Walter, which de Gray had been attending. Walter performed the ceremony in a chapel of Westminster Abbey.

==Bishop of Norwich==

While bishop, de Gray often lent the king money, and on one occasion held the royal regalia as security for the repayment of a loan; he also served as a royal justice. In 1203 de Gray accompanied Archbishop Hubert Walter and several papal legates on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to King Philip II of France. Philip had demanded that John&#x27;s niece Eleanor of Brittany or his nephew Arthur of Brittany be surrendered to him together with all of John&#x27;s lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared to concede. Philip invaded Normandy after the bishops returned to England.

In 1203 some of de Gray&#x27;s knights were part of the garrison at the castle of Vaudreuil in Normandy, serving under the command of Robert FitzWalter. Although they had provisions and John was moving in support of the troops, in the summer of 1203 the garrison surrendered to Philip, shortly after a siege had begun. When John abandoned Normandy in late 1203, effectively relinquishing control of the duchy to Philip, de Gray was one of his companions on the journey to the port of Barfleur, and went on to England with the king.

==Archbishop-elect==

John&#x27;s attempt to impose de Gray&#x27;s election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king&#x27;s long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter&#x27;s death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.

While the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, Reginald, as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop. Some stories have Reginald&#x27;s election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the papal curia. Another source, Gervase of Canterbury, has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray&#x27;s election. A further story, from Roger of Wendover, states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter – the younger ones – participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.

De Gray was postulated or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which presented Innocent with two candidates for the office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent&#x27;s reason for invalidating de Gray&#x27;s candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent&#x27;s approval. John did not accept Langton&#x27;s candidacy, however, and Innocent&#x27;s consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an interdict on England in 1208, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John&#x27;s imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only living English bishops not in exile. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John&#x27;s deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.

==In Ireland==

By 1209 de Gray was in Ireland serving as the king&#x27;s governor, an office sometimes referred to as justiciar for Ireland. One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray&#x27;s ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy. De Gray&#x27;s chief policy in Ireland was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the River Shannon and in Fermanagh. He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in Ireland. De Gray&#x27;s term of office in Ireland coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.

During John&#x27;s persecution of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose to him as a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal&#x27;s refusal does not seem to have embittered de Gray, however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.

John led an expedition to Ireland in 1210 in an effort to bring the Anglo-Norman barons under control. He opened talks with the native Irish kings, and some accounts state that his negotiations were so successful that the native Irish submitted to him. In contrast, the historian Seán Duffy has argued that the native Irish nobility were just as resistant to John as the Anglo-Norman barons. After John&#x27;s return to England he ordered de Gray to build three new castles in Connacht, one of them at Athlone. Associated with the castle building were two military invasions of Connacht by the royal government – one from Meath and Leinster and the other from Munster. De Gray left Ireland in 1211 to lead a military campaign against the Welsh, leaving his deputy Richard de Tuit in charge of the country.

De Gray also faced resistance from the northern Irish. In 1212 he led a campaign against Áed Méith, in the promotion of which he constructed castles at Cáel Uisce, Belleek, and Clones, bases for raids against the Ua Néill territory in the north. A naval campaign was also launched but to no avail. De Gray suffered a defeat at the hands of Cormac O&#x27;Melaghlin in 1212 at Fircal, Offaly, and left Ireland the following year. He continued to hold the office of governor for a time, but by July 1213 he had been replaced by Henry de Loundres, the Archbishop of Dublin. One of de Gray&#x27;s final acts as justiciar was to take a force of Irish knights to England to help repel a threatened invasion by the French king Philip II.

==Episcopal affairs and later career==

As bishop, de Gray settled a long-running dispute between the monks of his cathedral chapter and his predecessors as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in contravention of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop&#x27;s Lynn (now King&#x27;s Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.

De Gray&#x27;s ability to raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500 knights during a period when Philip II was threatening to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton&#x27;s election to Canterbury, and part of the settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray was not included in the general pardon and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.

As well as encouraging his nephew&#x27;s career, de Gray took into his household two of Hubert Walter&#x27;s household clerks: David, and Robert of Ruddeby. Another clerk employed by de Gray, Robert de Bingham, was in the bishop&#x27;s household during the papal interdict on England; he went on to become a tutor in theology at Oxford, and Bishop of Salisbury in 1228.

De Gray remained close to John for most of the bishop&#x27;s life, and one of the King&#x27;s chief fundraisers. Sidney Painter, a historian and biographer of John, said of de Gray that he was &quot;probably the only man whom John trusted absolutely and without reservation for the whole period of their association&quot;. The medievalist Ralph Turner called de Gray &quot;one of John&#x27;s greatest favourites&quot;, and another of John&#x27;s biographers, , described de Gray as &quot;one of the best brains of the royal administration&quot;. Matthew Paris, a medieval writer, called him an &quot;evil counsellor&quot;, and blamed many of the difficulties of John&#x27;s later reign on de Gray&#x27;s failed election to Canterbury.

<text>The English Chamber Orchestra (ECO) is a British chamber orchestra based in London. The full orchestra regularly plays concerts at Cadogan Hall, and their ensemble performs at Wigmore Hall. With a limited performance size, the orchestra specializes in 18th-century music and was created to perform Baroque Music. The orchestra regularly tours in the UK and internationally, and holds the distinction of having the most extensive discography of any chamber orchestra and being the most well-traveled orchestra in the world; no other orchestra has played concerts (as of 2013, according to its own publicity) in as many countries as the English Chamber Orchestra.

==History==

The English Chamber Orchestra has its origins in the Goldsbrough Orchestra, founded in 1948 by Lawrence Leonard and Arnold Goldsbrough. The name was considered to prevent success outside of the UK and in 1960 it was changed to the English Chamber Orchestra, when Quintin Ballardie (a principal violinist with the original orchestra) invited Dr. Ursula Jones-Strebi to found and co-manage the new orchestra, where they also expanded its repertoire beyond the Baroque period for the first time. Its repertoire remained limited by the group&#x27;s size, which has stayed fairly consistently at around the size of an orchestra of Mozart&#x27;s time.

Shortly afterwards, it became closely associated with the Aldeburgh Festival, playing in the premieres of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1960), &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; (1970), &quot;Curlew River&quot; and several other of his works. The occasions on which Britten conducted the orchestra included the opening concerts of the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Snape Maltings in 1967. He also made a number of records with the group.

The orchestra did not at this time have a principal conductor, but worked closely with a succession of guest conductors including Raymond Leppard, Colin Davis and Daniel Barenboim. In 1985 Jeffrey Tate was appointed the ensemble&#x27;s first principal conductor. In 2000, Ralf Gothóni was appointed second principal conductor.

In June 2009, the English Chamber Orchestra named Paul Watkins its new music director, effective with the 2009–2010 season, for an initial contract of three years. The orchestra has also worked regularly with guest conductors Paul Goodwin, Lawrence Power and James Sherlock. In 2023, the orchestra appointed Roberto Forés Veses as Principal Guest Conductor. Having led the orchestra for over 30 years, Stephanie Gonley was recognised as Leader and Principal of the English Chamber Orchestra in 2023. 

==Tours and performances==

The orchestra has performed with and toured the UK and abroad with artists such as Kathleen Battle, Benjamin Britten, Daniel Barenboim, Dame Janet Baker, Colin Davis, Placido Domingo, Jacqueline du Pre, Sumi Jo, Kiri te Kanawa, Yehudi Menuhin, Luciano Pavarotti, Murray Perahia, Itzhak Perlman, Andre Previn, Karl Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich, Georg Solti, Joan Sutherland, Mitsuko Uchida, Maxim Vengerov and Pinchas Zukerman.
Recent tours have included Bermuda, USA, Mexico, Finland, France, Turkey, Switzerland, Italy and Germany.

HRH the former Prince of Wales has been the Patron of the ECO since 1977 and the orchestra has performed at royal weddings, birthday celebrations and other events including the first concert ever to be broadcast from Buckingham Palace. 

In 2023 members of the orchestra were selected to play at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

<text>John Kemp ( 1380 – 22 March 1454, surname also spelled Kempe) was a medieval English cardinal, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor of England.

==Biography==

Kemp was the son of Thomas Kempe, a gentleman of Olantigh, in the parish of Wye near Ashford, Kent, and Beatrix Lewkenor, daughter of Sir Thomas Lewkenor. He was born about 1380 and educated at Merton College, Oxford.

Kemp practised as an ecclesiastical lawyer, was an assessor at the trial of John Oldcastle, and in 1415 was made dean of the Court of Arches but did not do a good job as dean. He then passed into the royal service, and being employed in the administration of Normandy was eventually made chancellor of the duchy. He was briefly archdeacon of Durham. In 1418 he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal which he retained until 1421. Early in 1419 he was elected Bishop of Rochester, and was consecrated at Rouen on 3 December. In February 1421 he was translated to Chichester,and in November following to London.

During the minority of Henry VI Kemp had a prominent position in the English council as a supporter of Henry Beaufort, whom he succeeded as chancellor in March 1426. In this same year on 20 July he was promoted to the Archbishop of York. Kemp held office as chancellor for six years, consistently supporting Henry Beaufort against Humphrey of Gloucester. His resignation on 28 February 1432 was a concession to Gloucester. He still enjoyed Beaufort&#x27;s favour, and retaining his place in the council was employed on important missions, especially at the congress of Arras in 1435, and the conference at Calais in 1438.

In December 1439 Kemp was created a cardinal priest, and during the next few years took less share in politics. He supported William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk over the king&#x27;s marriage with Margaret of Anjou; but afterwards there arose some difference between them, due in part to a dispute about the nomination of the cardinal&#x27;s nephew, Thomas Kempe, to the bishopric of London. At the time of Suffolk&#x27;s fall in January 1450 Kemp once more became chancellor. His appointment may have been because he was not committed entirely to either party. In spite of his age and infirmity he showed some vigour in dealing with Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion, and by his official experience and skill did what he could for four years to sustain the king&#x27;s authority.

Kemp was rewarded by his translation to Canterbury in July 1452, when Pope Nicholas V added as a special honour the title of cardinal-bishop of Santa Rufina. As Richard of York gained influence, Kemp became unpopular; men called him &quot;the cursed cardinal,&quot; and his fall seemed imminent when he died suddenly on 22 March 1454. He was buried at Canterbury, in the choir.

Kemp was a politician first, and hardly at all a bishop; and he was accused with some justice of neglecting his dioceses, especially at York. Still he was a capable official, and a faithful servant to Henry VI, who called him &quot;one of the wisest lords of the land&quot;. He founded Wye College near his birthplace, which became part of the University of London before closing in 2009.

<text>Nello Celio (12 February 1914 – 29 December 1995) was a Swiss politician from the Canton of Ticino. He was a member of the Free Democratic Party. He was a member of the Federal Council from 1966 to 1973 and served as the President of the Swiss Confederation in 1972.

==Biography== 
Celio was born in Quinto, Ticino, Switzerland in 1914. He studied law at the University of Basel and the University of Bern. In 1944, he was appointed as a public prosecutor in the Sopraceneri area of Ticino. He became active in politics as the president of the Ticino FDP and entered elective office in 1946 as a member of the Council of State of Ticino. He served in that body until 1959.

In 1960, he became the party president of the FDP. He stood for the 1963 Swiss federal election for the National Council and was elected. After the Mirage Affair scandal, which resulted in the departure of Paul Chaudet from the Federal Council, Celio was elected to succeed him. He initially headed up the Military Department, which was vacant after Chaudet&#x27;s departure. No other Federal Councilor at the time was willing to take over the ministry.
In 1968, he took over the Department of Finance.

In 1971, he was the Vice President of Switzerland and in 1972, he served a single term as President of the Swiss Confederation. In 1973, he resigned from office.

Celio died on 29 December 1995 from pneumonia at the age of 81.

<text>Philipp Etter (21 December 1891, in Menzingen – 23 December 1977) was a Swiss politician. He was the son of Joseph Anton, cooper master, and the Jakobea Stocker.
During his office time he held the Department of Home Affairs and was President of the Confederation four times between 1939 and 1953. He was chosen for the Conservative People&#x27;s Party in the Zug cantonal parliament.
By 1922 he had moved into the Executive Council, where he took over the education and Military Department. Between 1927 and 1928 he was Zugerland Ammann. In 1930 he was elected to the Senate. He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 28 March 1934 and handed over office on 31 December 1959. He was affiliated with the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland. After the surprise resignation of Freiburg Federal Jean-Marie Musy the Federal Assembly elected the first 43 years of Zug conservatives on 28 March 1934 in the Bundesrat. Etter took over the Department of the Interior, which in its 25-year term - experienced an increasing importance - particularly through the development of the welfare state. 

In the prewar years Etter was instrumental in the development of the so-called &quot;spiritual national defense&quot;. During World War II, he took a decidedly conservative, adaptable friendly policy toward Nazi Germany and a particularly considerate attitude towards Italy. In the phase of economic and social reconstruction after 1945 he was able to introduce new approaches. His political work was characterized by its central Swiss homeland and his Catholic-conservative world view which, among other things, was permeated by anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic stereotypes. Etter, who represented the idea of a Christian, corporatist authoritarian state, was one of the most important and most prominent political figures of Switzerland in the 20th century.

One of the most shameful aspects of Swiss behaviour during the war was their treatment of Jews seeking refuge from Nazi persecution. The Swiss policy towards Jewish refugees was tightened after a decree from Etter in August 1942:
“…that in future more foreign civilian refugees will have to be sent back even if they might suffer serious disadvantages (such as danger to life and limb) as a result” 
Etter was also a member of the Assembly of the ICRC. Two months later he attended a meeting of the Assembly to discuss whether they should launch a public appeal to all the belligerents reminding them of humanitarian principles. The draft proposal covered four subjects – the bombing of civilians, the effect of economic blockade, the fate of civilians who were deported, and treatment of prisoners of war . This was the only meeting he attended. Max Huber was not present, due to ill-health, but Carl Jacob Burckhardt was, as was Marguerite Cramer. The meeting was composed of four women and nineteen men. 
Marguerite Cramer was convinced that the Committee had a moral duty to speak out. Burckhardt argued that work behind the scenes would be more effective. Philippe Etter argued against a public appeal. Eventually, they deferred to his authority and agreed unanimously not to make the appeal. In the words of David Forsythe:
“The ICRC therefore caved in to Swiss national interests as defined in Berne, sacrificing the independence and humanitarian values of the organisation”

<text>The lux (symbol: lx) is the unit of illuminance, or luminous flux per unit area, in the International System of Units (SI). It is equal to one lumen per square metre. In photometry, this is used as a measure of the irradiance, as perceived by the spectrally unequally responding human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the radiometric unit watt per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function, a model of human visual brightness perception, standardized by the CIE and ISO. In English, &quot;lux&quot; is used as both the singular and plural form.
The word is derived from the Latin word for &quot;light&quot;, .

==Explanation==
===Illuminance===
Illuminance is a measure of how much luminous flux is spread over a given area. One can think of luminous flux (with the unit lumen) as a measure of the total &quot;amount&quot; of visible light present, and the illuminance as a measure of the intensity of illumination on a surface. A given amount of light will illuminate a surface more dimly if it is spread over a larger area, so illuminance is inversely proportional to area when the luminous flux is held constant. 

One lux is equal to one lumen per square metre:
:1 lx = 1 lm/m2 = 1 cd·sr/m2.

A flux of 1000 lumens, spread uniformly over an area of 1 square metre, lights up that square metre with an illuminance of 1000 lux. However, the same 1000 lumens spread out over 10 square metres produces a dimmer illuminance of only 100 lux.

Achieving an illuminance of 500 lx might be possible in a home kitchen with a single fluorescent light fixture with an output of . To light a factory floor with dozens of times the area of the kitchen would require dozens of such fixtures. Thus, lighting a larger area to the same illuminance (lux) requires a greater luminous flux (lumen).

As with other named SI units, SI prefixes can be used. For example, 1 kilolux (klx) is 1000 lx.

Here are some examples of the illuminance provided under various conditions:

The illuminance provided by a light source on a surface perpendicular to the direction to the source is a measure of the strength of that source as perceived from that location. For instance, a star of apparent magnitude 0 provides 2.08 microlux (μlx) at the Earth&#x27;s surface. A barely perceptible magnitude 6 star provides 8 nanolux (nlx). The unobscured Sun provides an illumination of up to 100 kilolux (klx) on the Earth&#x27;s surface, the exact value depending on time of year and atmospheric conditions. This direct normal illuminance is related to the solar illuminance constant &quot;E&quot;sc, equal to (see Sunlight and Solar constant).

The illuminance on a surface depends on how the surface is tilted with respect to the source. For example, a pocket flashlight aimed at a wall will produce a given level of illumination if aimed perpendicular to the wall, but if the flashlight is aimed at increasing angles to the perpendicular (maintaining the same distance), the illuminated spot becomes larger and so is less highly illuminated. When a surface is tilted at an angle to a source, the illumination provided on the surface is reduced because the tilted surface subtends a smaller solid angle from the source, and therefore it receives less light. For a point source, the illumination on the tilted surface is reduced by a factor equal to the cosine of the angle between a ray coming from the source and the normal to the surface. In practical lighting problems, given information on the way light is emitted from each source and the distance and geometry of the lighted area, a numerical calculation can be made of the illumination on a surface by adding the contributions of every point on every light source.

===Relationship between illuminance and irradiance===
Like all photometric units, the lux has a corresponding &quot;radiometric&quot; unit. The difference between any photometric unit and its corresponding radiometric unit is that radiometric units are based on physical power, with all wavelengths being weighted equally, while photometric units take into account the fact that the human eye&#x27;s image-forming visual system is more sensitive to some wavelengths than others, and accordingly every wavelength is given a different weight. The weighting factor is known as the luminosity function.

The lux is one lumen per square metre (lm/m2), and the corresponding radiometric unit, which measures irradiance, is the watt per square metre (W/m2). There is no single conversion factor between lux and W/m2; there is a different conversion factor for every wavelength, and it is not possible to make a conversion unless one knows the spectral composition of the light.

The peak of the luminosity function is at 555 nm (green); the eye&#x27;s image-forming visual system is more sensitive to light of this wavelength than any other. For monochromatic light &quot;of this wavelength&quot;, the amount of illuminance for a given amount of irradiance is maximum: 683.002 lx per 1 W/m2; the irradiance needed to make 1 lx at this wavelength is about 1.464 mW/m2. Other wavelengths of visible light produce fewer lux per watt-per-meter-squared. The luminosity function falls to zero for wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.

For a light source with mixed wavelengths, the number of lumens per watt can be calculated by means of the luminosity function. In order to appear reasonably &quot;white&quot;, a light source cannot consist solely of the green light to which the eye&#x27;s image-forming visual photoreceptors are most sensitive, but must include a generous mixture of red and blue wavelengths, to which they are much less sensitive.

This means that white (or whitish) light sources produce far fewer lumens per watt than the theoretical maximum of 683.002 lm/W. The ratio between the actual number of lumens per watt and the theoretical maximum is expressed as a percentage known as the luminous efficiency. For example, a typical incandescent light bulb has a luminous efficiency of only about 2%.

In reality, individual eyes vary slightly in their luminosity functions. However, photometric units are precisely defined and precisely measurable. They are based on an agreed-upon standard luminosity function based on measurements of the spectral characteristics of image-forming &quot;visual photoreception&quot; in many individual human eyes.

==Use in video-camera specifications==
Specifications for video cameras such as camcorders and surveillance cameras often include a minimal illuminance level in lux at which the camera will record a satisfactory image. A camera with good low-light capability will have a lower lux rating. Still cameras do not use such a specification, since longer exposure times can generally be used to make pictures at very low illuminance levels, as opposed to the case in video cameras, where a maximal exposure time is generally set by the frame rate.
==Non-SI units of illuminance==
The corresponding unit in English and American traditional units is the foot-candle. One foot candle is about 10.764 lx. Since one foot-candle is the illuminance cast on a surface by a one-candela source one foot away, a lux could be thought of as a &quot;metre-candle&quot;, although this term is discouraged because it does not conform to SI standards for unit names.

One phot (ph) equals 10 kilolux (10 klx).

One nox (nx) equals 1 millilux (1 mlx) at light color 2042 K or 2046 K (formerly 2360 K).

In astronomy, apparent magnitude is a measure of the illuminance of a star on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. A star with apparent magnitude 0 is 2.54 microlux outside the earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and 82% of that (2.08 microlux) under clear skies. A magnitude 6 star (just barely visible under good conditions) would be 8.3 nanolux. A standard candle (one candela) a kilometre away would provide an illuminance of 1 microlux—about the same as a magnitude 1 star.

==Legacy Unicode symbol==
Unicode includes a symbol for &quot;lx&quot;: . It is a legacy code to accommodate old code pages in some Asian languages. Use of this code is not recommended in new documents.

<text>Giuseppe Motta (29 December 1871 – 23 January 1940) was a Swiss politician. He was a member of the Swiss Federal Council (1911–1940) and President of the League of Nations (1924–1925). He was a Catholic-conservative foreign minister and a staunch opponent of communism and Stalinism.

==Biography==
He was born on 29 December 1871. He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 14 December 1911. Motta served 28 years in the Federal Council, the third longest tenure to date. He was affiliated with the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland.

While in office he headed the Department of Finance (1912–1919) and the Political Department (1920–1940). He was elected President of the Confederation five times, in 1915, 1920, 1927, 1932 and 1937.

In 1923 the ICRC admitted the first two non-Genevans to its Assembly - Max Huber from Zürich and Motta, who was also the first Catholic. He clearly did not see any conflict of interest in combining his work with the ICRC with his continuing political career. 

Motta was involved with the Federal Council Felix Calonder in Switzerland&#x27;s accession to the League of Nations on 16 May 1920. In 1924 he became President League of Nations Assembly. At his suggestion, Switzerland was one of the few states against accepting the Soviet Union into the League of Nations. He was one of the most outspoken advocates of admission of Germany. In the Interwar Period, he pleaded for a partial departure from Swiss neutrality principle, but spoke out from 1938 in the face of the looming Second World War again for its strict observance.

He died in office on 23 January 1940, at 68 years old.

==Commemoration==
Among others, &quot;via Giuseppe Motta&quot; in Lugano, Chiasso, Minusio, Mendrisio, and Massagno, &quot;Piazza Giuseppe Motta&quot; in Ascona and &quot;Avenue Giuseppe-Motta&quot; in Geneva are named for him.

His portrait was painted twice in the late 1930s by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury. The first, a large three-quarter portrait, dated 1938, hangs in the Archivio Cantonale in Bellinzona; the artist was sent a photograph by Motta at the end of 1937, and then the artist travelled to Berne in the summer of 1938 to work on the portrait from life. The second portrait, half-length seated at a desk and dated 1939, in the Haus Muller-Lombardi in Hospental, Switzerland as part of the Adolfo Muller-Ury Stiftung. This was exhibited at the artist&#x27;s last exhibition at French and Co, New York in the spring of 1947 and returned to Switzerland after his death in July that year.

Annually since 2004, the Geneva Institute for Democracy and Development presents the Giuseppe Motta Medal to people from any country or region of the world for exceptional achievement in the promotion of peace and democracy, human rights and sustainable development.

<doc id="155875" wikidata="Q4413684" url="?curid=155875" title="No-dig gardening">
<text>No-dig gardening is a non-cultivation method used by some organic gardeners. 

This technique recognizes that micro- and macro-biotic organisms constitute a &quot;food web&quot; community in the soil, necessary for the healthy cycling of nutrients and prevention of problematic organisms and diseases. The plants transfer a portion of the carbon energy they produce to the soil, and microbes that benefit from this energy in turn convert available organic substances in the soil to the mineral components the plants need to thrive.

== History ==
The origins of no-dig gardening are unclear, and may be based on pre-industrial or nineteenth-century farming techniques. Masanobu Fukuoka started his pioneering research work in this domain in 1938, and began publishing in the 1970s his Fukuokan philosophy of &quot;do-nothing farming&quot; or natural farming, which is now acknowledged by some as the tap root of the permaculture movement. 

Two pioneers of the method in the twentieth century included F. C. King, Head Gardener at Levens Hall, South Westmorland, in the Lake District of England, who wrote the book &quot;Is Digging Necessary?&quot; in 1946, and a gardener from Middlecliffe in the UK, A. Guest, who in 1948 published the book &quot;Gardening Without Digging&quot;. The work of these gardeners was supported by the Good Gardeners Association in the UK. No-dig gardening was also promoted by Australian Esther Deans in the 1970s, and American gardener Ruth Stout advocated a &quot;permanent&quot; garden mulching technique in &quot;Gardening Without Work&quot; and no-dig methods in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Purpose==
Historically, the reasons for tilling the soil are to remove weeds, loosen and aerate the soil, and incorporate organic matter such as compost or manure into lower soil layers. In areas with thin soil and high erosion, there is a strong case against digging, which argues that in the long term it can be detrimental to the food web in the fragile topsoil. 

While digging is an effective way of removing perennial weed roots, it also often causes seeds that can remain dormant for many decades to come to the surface and germinate. The act of aerating the soil also increases the rate of decomposition and reduces soil organic matter. Digging can also damage soil structure, causing compaction, and unbalance symbiotic and mutualist interactions among soil life. Digging tends to displace nutrients, shifting surface organic material deeper, where there is less oxygen to support the decomposition of plant-available nutrients, which then need to be otherwise replenished. Digging is practised traditionally in regions with old, deep, rich soils such as Western Europe, where digging was followed by periodic resting of the soil, usually with an undisturbed cover crop.

==Methods==

No-dig methods allow nature to carry out cultivation operations. Organic matter such as well rotted manure, compost, leaf mold, spent mushroom compost, old straw, etc., is added directly to the soil surface as a mulch at least 5-15 centimeters (2–6 in) deep, which is then incorporated by the actions of worms, insects and microbes. Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil&#x27;s structure, their tunnels providing aeration and drainage, and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. This natural biosphere maintains healthy conditions in the upper soil horizons, where annual plant roots thrive. No-dig systems are said by practitioners such as Charles Dowding to be freer of pests and disease, possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the buildup of beneficial rather than harmful soil fungi. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth, allowing slower percolation and less leaching of nutrients.

Another no-dig method is sheet mulching wherein a garden area is covered with wetted paper or cardboard, compost and topped off with landscape mulch. This technique is also called lasagna gardening.

A no-dig system is considered easier than digging. It is a long term process, and is reliant upon having plentiful organic matter to provide mulch material. It is also helpful to remove any perennial weed roots from the area beforehand, although their hold can be weakened by applying a light-excluding surface layer such as large sheets of cardboard or several thicknesses of spread out newspaper before adding the compost mulch. The newspaper or cardboard should be thoroughly wet to help it lie flat and keep it from blowing away until the overlying material is added.

== Practice ==

=== Australia ===
Esther Deans wrote the books &quot;No-Dig Gardening&quot; and &quot;Leaves of Life&quot;. She actively travelled to teach about this gardening method, cooking and promoting raised gardens for those with special needs. She also taught about the necessity to maintain excellent water quality. Deans continued gardening until the age of 95. Around this time, Harper Collins publishers held a special honorary event for her in their Ryde offices, as Esther had become Australia&#x27;s most published author. As Deans grew older, she was assisted by Lucinda Bartram who helped her carry on the tradition of teaching no-dig gardening methods to others. Between the mid 1990s and 2009 Bartram, from Bondi and then Randwick, helped Deans reach the public and maintained the prolific &#x27;no-dig&#x27; flowerbeds kept by Deans around her nursing apartment in the northern Sydney suburb of Waitara. The women shared many years co-teaching &#x27;no-dig&#x27; gardening techniques to school children and freely sharing their knowledge together at garden fairs until 2009.

Esther Deans inspired many famous gardeners, including Bill Mollison of the permaculture movement, although she said &quot;it is not quite how I would do it&quot;, implying she did not allow nature to take over, but retained formality with strict garden edges and more annuals.

Gardens fashioned on Esther Deans&#x27; no dig gardening principles include Randwick Community Organic Garden (RCOG), Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

=== UK ===
Since 1982 Charles Dowding has been practising no dig in his market gardens, on areas ranging from a quarter to seven acres. He has written eleven books on gardening organically and without digging, and gives regular talks and courses on the subject. His methods centre on using compost as a mulch, rather than unrotted organic matter which tends to accumulate slugs in the damp, British climate. He encourages gardeners to be adaptable in their approach, according to local soil, conditions and crops grown. His own speciality is salad leaves for sale to local outlets and the plants grow well in undisturbed soil.

<text>Hans Schaffner (16 December 1908, in Interlaken – 26 November 2004 in Bern) was a Swiss politician and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1961–1970).

He grew up as the son of Robert Schaffner, head judge in Interlaken, and Margaretha (born Abplanalp), a teacher. After his legal studies at the University of Bern he was made a court scribe at the supreme court of the Canton of Bern in 1934, and three years later, he married his wife Ruth Rudolf, a lawyer herself.

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 15 June 1961 and handed over office on 31 January 1970. He is affiliated to the Free Democratic Party. After receiving a degree in law, he entered the federal civil service as the head of the Division in charge of wartime economy (1941). In 1954, he became Director of the Trade Division of the Economic Affairs Department. With the president of the Board of Trade Reginald Maudling, he was during a meeting of non EEC countries in the Alabama Room in Geneva, one of the initiators of the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA) in December 1958.

During his time in office he headed up the Department of Economic Affairs and was President of the Confederation in 1966. During that year, Switzerland became a member of GATT. He prepared measures in favour of agriculture, a new law about labour relations and measures against inflation. After retirement, he held positions in several Boards of directors (Sandoz, Rieter, Câbleries de Cossonay). He fought for liberal and free-trade values.

<text>Charles James Blomfield (29 May 1786 – 5 August 1857) was a British divine and classicist, and a Church of England bishop for 32 years.

==Early life and education==
Charles James Blomfield was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the eldest son (and one of ten children) of Charles Blomfield (1763–1831), a schoolmaster (as was Charles James&#x27;s grandfather, James Blomfield), JP and chief alderman of Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Hester (1765–1844), daughter of Edward Pawsey, a Bury grocer. He was therefore unusual in becoming a Bishop of London not from an ecclesiastical, aristocratic or landowning background. His brother was Edward Valentine Blomfield, a classical scholar.

He was educated at the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds, declining a scholarship to Eton College after a brief stay there.

Blomfield matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1804. At Cambridge, he was tutored by John Hudson, mathematician and clergyman. Blomfield won the Browne medals for Latin and Greek odes, and the Craven scholarship. He graduated B.A. (3rd wrangler and 1st Chancellor&#x27;s medal in classics) in 1808, M.A. in 1811, B.D. in 1818, D.D. (&quot;per lit. reg.&quot;) in 1820.

==Career==
Blomfield was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College in 1809. The first-fruits of his scholarship was an edition of the &quot;Prometheus&quot; of Aeschylus in 1810; this was followed by editions of the &quot;Septem contra Thebas&quot;, &quot;Persae&quot;, &quot;Choephori&quot;, and &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, of Callimachus, and of the fragments of Sappho, Sophron and Alcaeus.

Blomfield, however, soon ceased to devote himself entirely to scholarship. Ordained deacon in March 1810 and priest in June 1810, he held a curacy at Chesterford, then the following livings:
*Rector of Quarrington, Lincolnshire (1810–20)
*Rector of Dunton, Buckinghamshire (1811–17)
*Rector of Tuddenham, Suffolk (1817–20)
*Vicar and Rector of Little Chesterford, Essex (1817–24)
*Rector of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, London (1820–28)

Whilst at Dunton he educated George Spencer (later Ignatius Spencer), and they corresponded for several years after. In 1817 he was appointed private chaplain to William Howley, Bishop of London. In 1819 he was nominated to the rich living of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, and in 1822 he became Archdeacon of Colchester. Two years later he was raised to the bishopric as Bishop of Chester where he carried through many much-needed reforms.

In 1828, he was appointed a Privy Counsellor and translated becoming Bishop of London, a post which he held for twenty-eight years making him the third longest-serving post reformation incumbent. He was also the youngest known Bishop of London – his five youngest children were born in Fulham Palace – and his energy and zeal did much to extend the influence of the church. He was one of the best debaters in the House of Lords (members of the Upper House of the Canterbury Convocation confessed to trimming their quill pens before his arrival!), took a leading position in the action for church reform which culminated in the ecclesiastical commission, and did much for the extension of the colonial episcopate; and his genial and kindly nature made him an invaluable mediator in the controversies arising out of the tractarian movement. In 1840 he officiated at the marriage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Between 1833 and 1841 he consecrated four of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries of London. He also made a number of changes at Fulham Palace, including planting a great number of trees which remain today. 
==Later life==

In 1856 he was permitted to resign his bishopric due to ill health, retaining Fulham Palace as his residence, with a pension of £6,000 per annum.

Blomfield is buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church, Fulham, London and a memorial to him, by George Richmond, can be seen at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral along the south wall of the ambulatory. His grave has long-since had the surrounding railings removed. Blomfield Road in Maida Vale is named after him. 

==Published works==
His published works, exclusive of those above mentioned, consist of charges, sermons, lectures and pamphlets, and of a &quot;Manual of Private and Family Prayers&quot;. He was a frequent contributor to the quarterly reviews, chiefly on classical subjects.

==Personal life==
Blomfield married Anna Maria Heath on 6 November 1810 at Hemblington, Norfolk and they had six children: 
*Anna Maria Blomfield (1811–1812)
*Charles James Blomfield (1813–1813)
*Maria Blomfield (1814–1884)
*Charles William Blomfield (1815–1815)
*Edward Thomas Blomfield (1816–1822)
*Charles James Blomfield (1818–1818)
Anna Maria died on 16 February 1818 aged 33 at Hildersham, Cambridgeshire.

Blomfield then married Dorothy (née Cox, widow of Thomas Kent of Hildersham, Cambridgeshire) on 17 December 1819 at St George, Hanover Square, London, and they had eleven children: 
*Charles James Blomfield (1820–1822)
*Mary Frances Blomfield (1821–1869)
*Frederick George &quot;Fred&quot; Blomfield (1823–1879), rector
*Isabella &quot;Isy&quot; Blomfield (1824–1879), who married her cousin George John Blomfield, vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Dartford, and rector of Aldington, Kent
*Henry John Blomfield (1825–1900), Royal Navy
*Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Blomfield (1827–1860), drowned in the SS Northerner steamer disaster off the Californian coast
*Arthur William Blomfield (1829–1899), architect
*Lucy Elizabeth Blomfield (1830–1864), children&#x27;s author &quot;Aunt Lucy&quot;
*Charles James Blomfield (1831–1915), emigrated to Canada in 1858
*Alfred Blomfield (1833–1894), bishop of Colchester
*Dorothy Hester &quot;Dora&quot; Blomfield (1836–1886)

Dorothy also had one son from her first marriage, Thomas Fassett Kent (1817–1871), barrister (he was father of the poet Armine Thomas Kent).

The Blomfield household was larger than any other family of a Bishop of London, with eleven surviving children living in the palace. He had 49 grandchildren and another six step-grandchildren, including the army officer Major-General Charles James Blomfield (1855−1928), the architect Sir Reginald Blomfield (1856–1942), the poet and hymn writer Dorothy Gurney (née Blomfield) (1858–1932) and the palaeontologist, geologist and malacologist Francis Arthur Bather (1863–1934). A great grandchild was the civil servant Sir Thomas Wolseley Haig.

<text>Adolf Deucher (15 February 1831 in Wipkingen – 10 July 1912 in Bern) was a federal councillor of Switzerland, and a two-time member of the Swiss National Council. Pursuing centralist policies in a very federalist country, he was a main promoter of the 1868 revision of the Swiss constitution.

As a federal councillor, he improved conditions for workers (banning phosphorus in the match industry in 1898, revision of the factory law). He was also the guiding force behind the first national law on agriculture.

==Early career==
He studied medicine at Heidelberg, Zurich, Prague, and Vienna. In 1855 he became a member of the Grand Council of Thurgau, and in 1868 he served as a member of the council established to formulate a new democratic constitution for Thurgau. From 1869 to 1873 he was a member of the National Council of Switzerland, and, three years after his re-election to that body became its president (1882). 

==Later career==
He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 10 April 1883 and died in office on 10 July 1912, aged 81. He was affiliated with the Free Democratic Party. During his office time, he held the following departments:
*Department of Justice and Police (1883)
*Department of Posts and Railways (1884)
*Department of Home Affairs (1885)
*Political Department (1886)
*Department of Trade and Agriculture (1887)
*Department of Industry and Agriculture (1888–1895)
*Department of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (1896)
*Political Department (1897)
*Department of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (1898–1902)
*Political Department (1903)
*Department of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (1904–1908)
*Political Department (1909)
*Department of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (1910–1912)

He was President of the Confederation four times in 1886, 1897, 1903 and 1909.

<text>Sophron of Syracuse (, &quot;fl.&quot; 430 BC), Magna Graecia, was a writer of mimes (μῖμος, a kind of prose drama).

Sophron was the author of prose dialogues in the Doric dialect, containing both male and female characters, some serious, others humorous in style, and depicting scenes from the daily life of the Sicilian Greeks. Although in prose, they were regarded as poems; in any case they were not intended for stage representation. They were written in pithy and popular language, full of proverbs and colloquialisms.

==Influence==
Plato is said to have introduced Sophron&#x27;s works into Athens and to have made use of them in his dialogues; according to Diogenes Laërtius, they were Plato&#x27;s constant companions, and he even slept with them under his pillow; the &quot;Suda&quot; says of the mimes of Sophron, &quot;Plato the philosopher always read them, so as to be sent into an occasional doze.&quot; Some idea of their general character may be gathered from the 2nd and 15th idylls of Theocritus, which are said to have been imitated from the &quot;Akestriai&quot; and &quot;Isthmiazousai&quot; of his Syracusan predecessor. Their influence is also to be traced in the satires of Persius.

==Editions==
The fragments of Sophron are collected in:

<text>Powązki Cemetery (; ), also known as Stare Powązki (), is a historic necropolis located in Wola district, in the western part of Warsaw, Poland. It is the most famous cemetery in the city and one of the oldest, having been established in 1790. It is the burial place of many illustrious individuals from Polish history. Some are interred along the &quot;Avenue of the Distinguished&quot; – &quot;Aleja Zasłużonych&quot;, created in 1925. It is estimated that over one million people are buried at Powązki.

The cemetery is often confused with the newer Powązki Military Cemetery, which is located to the north-west of Powązki Cemetery.

==History==
Powązki Cemetery was established on 4 November 1790 on land donated by nobleman Melchior Szymanowski, and consecrated on 20 May 1792. Initially it covered an area of only about 2.5 ha. In the same year Saint Karol Boromeusz Church, designed by Dominik Merlini, was built on the northern edge of the cemetery. The catacombs were erected soon thereafter.

Several other cemeteries were founded in the area: the Jewish cemetery, and those of the Calvinist, Lutheran, Caucasian and Tatar communities. The Orthodox cemetery is also located in the vicinity.

As in many old European cemeteries, some of the tombstones in Powązki were created by renowned sculptors, both Polish and foreign. Some of the monuments are examples of the then prevailing styles in art and architecture.

On &quot;All Saints Day&quot; (1 November) and &quot;Zaduszki&quot; (2 November) in Warsaw, vigils are held not only in the Roman Catholic cemeteries, but in the Protestant, Muslim, Jewish and Orthodox cemeteries as well. At Powązki Cemetery, many graves are lit up by Votive candles.

<doc id="155884" wikidata="Q380083" url="?curid=155884" title="Jonas Furrer">
<text>Jonas Furrer (3 March 1805 – 25 July 1861) was a Swiss lawyer and politician who served as a member of the Federal Council, from 1848 to 1861, and as the first president of the Swiss Confederation from 1848 to 1849, and again in 1852, 1855 and 1858. He was one of the leading figures in the foundation of Switzerland as a federal state. He was a member of the Radical Party.

==Biography==
Furrer was born in Winterthur, in the canton of Zürich, on 3 March 1805, the son of Anna Magdalena Hanhart and Jonas Furrer, a locksmith. He received his early education in his hometown, and in 1824 went to study law at the University of Zürich. He soon continued his studies in Heidelberg, and between 1825 and 1826 studied at the University of Göttingen. After finishing his education, Furrer returned to Winterthur and established himself as a jurist.

Furrer was admitted to the bar in 1832, and that year he married Friederike Sulzer, daughter of Johann Heinrich Sulzer. In 1834, aged 29, he was elected to the Cantonal Council of Zürich. He served until 1839, and was again elected in 1842. At the Cantonal Council, he was the leader of the Liberal opposition to the Conservative government of Johann Kaspar Bluntschli. In 1845 he became president of the Council of State of Zürich.

In 1847, Furrer was appointed member of the commission tasked with reaching a peaceful settlement for the Sonderbund War. After the Federal victory and the end of the civil war, in 1848 he was elected by the canton of Zurich to the Council of States. For his significant contribution to the drafting of the 1848 constitution, which established Switzerland as a federal state, Furrer was elected President of the Swiss Confederation by the legislature, becoming the head of the newly created executive power of Switzerland, the seven-member Federal Council.

Furrer served as Federal Councilor from 1848 until his death in 1861. During his time in office, he headed a number of government departments, most notably the Federal Department of Justice and Police due to the reforms he implemented, and also distinguished himself as head of the Political Department for his diplomatic skill. He resolved the question regarding stateless persons, enacted a law in 1850 protecting religiously mixed couples, and founded government agencies responsible for settling conflicts of jurisdiction between the Confederation and the cantons.

<text>The State Emblem of India is the national emblem of the Republic of India and is used by the union government, many state governments, and other government agencies. The emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka, an ancient sculpture dating back to 280 BCE during the Maurya Empire. The statue is a three dimensional emblem showing four 
lions. It became the emblem of the Dominion of India in December 1947, and later the emblem of the Republic of India. The State Emblem of India is an official seal of the Government of India. It is used as the national emblem of India and appears on official documents, currency and passports.

The emblem was adopted by the Government of India on 26 January 1950, the day that India became a republic. It is based on the Lion Capital of Ashoka, a sculpture that was originally erected at the Sarnath, a place where Gautama Buddha first taught the Dharma, now in Uttar Pradesh, India. The emblem features four Asiatic lions standing back to back, symbolizing power, courage, confidence and faith. The lions are mounted on a circular abacus and the abacus is mounted on a lotus. The wheel of the law, Dharmachakra, is in the center of the abacus. The wheel has 24 spokes, which symbolize the progress and evolution of human civilization.

The motto, &quot;Satyamēva Jayatē&quot; () is inscribed below the abacus in Devanagari. The use of the emblem is governed by the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005 and the State Emblem of India (Regulation of Use) Rules, 2007.

The State Emblem of India is used by the Government of India and its agencies, as well as by all state governments and union territory administrations in India. It is also used by private citizens in India on letterheads, business cards and other personal uses, but with certain restrictions. The emblem is protected under the Indian Emblem Act and its use without proper authority is punishable under the law.

==History==
Following the end of British rule on 15 August 1947, the newly independent Dominion of India adopted an official state emblem on 30 December 1947. The emblem consisted of a representation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath enclosed within a rectangular frame. The task of beautifying the original manuscript of the Constitution of India was given to Nandalal Bose (then the Principal of Shanti Niketan or Kala Bhavan Shanti Niketan) by the Indian National Congress. Bose set out to complete this task with the help of his students, one of whom was Dinanath Bhargava, then 21 years old. Bose was keen to include the Lion Capital of Ashoka into the opening pages of the constitution. Wanting the lions to be depicted realistically, he chose Bhargava who studied the behaviour of the lions at the Kolkata Zoo.

On 26 January 1950, a representation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka placed above the motto, , was adopted as the State Emblem of India.&quot;

==Usage and description==

The emblem forms a part of the official letterhead of the Government of India and appears on all Indian currency as well. It also functions as the national emblem of India in many places and appears prominently on Indian passports. Usage of the emblem is regulated and restricted under State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005, under which no individual or private organisation is permitted to use the emblem for official correspondence. The Ashoka Chakra (Ashoka wheel) on its base features in the centre of the National Flag of India.

The actual Sarnath capital features four Asiatic lions standing back to back, symbolising power, courage, confidence and pride, mounted on a circular base. At the bottom is a horse and a bull, and at its centre is a Dharma chakra. The abacus is girded with a frieze of sculptures in high relief of The Lion of the North, The Horse of the West, The Bull of the South and The Elephant of the East, separated by intervening wheels, over a lotus in full bloom, exemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration. Carved from a single block of sandstone, the polished capital is crowned by the Wheel of Dharma.

In the emblem finally adopted, only three lions are visible, the fourth being hidden from view. The wheel appears in relief in the centre of the abacus, with a bull on the right and a galloping horse on the left, and outlines of Dharma Chakras on the extreme right and left. A horse and a bull are represented right below the abacus. The bull represents hard work and steadfastness, while the horse represents loyalty, speed, and energy. The bell-shaped lotus beneath the abacus has been omitted.

Forming an integral part of the emblem is the motto inscribed below the abacus in Devanagari script: &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; (; lit. &quot;Truth alone triumphs&quot;). This is a quote from the &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot;, the concluding part of the sacred Hindu Vedas.

== Emblems of national bodies ==
== Use on buildings ==
== Emblems of states and union territories ==

Most of the states and union territories of India have adopted their own state emblem, seal or coat of arms which are used as an official governmental symbol, while six states and five union territories use the National Emblem of India with a text legend as their official governmental seal.

Some of the autonomous district councils established by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India have also adopted an official emblem.

<text>Dramaturgy is the study of dramatic composition and the representation of the main elements of drama on the stage.

The term first appears in the eponymous work &quot;Hamburg Dramaturgy&quot; (1767–69) by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world&#x27;s first dramaturge at the Hamburg National Theatre of Abel Seyler. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual. Some dramatists combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a dramaturge, to adapt a work for the stage.

Dramaturgy may also be broadly defined as &quot;adapting a story to actable form.&quot; Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and structure. Often the dramaturge&#x27;s strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current Zeitgeist through cross-cultural signs, theater- and film-historical references to genre, ideology, questions of gender and racial representation, etc., in the dramatization.

== Definition and history ==
Dramaturgy as a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline was invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as a &quot;dramaturge&quot;. He was the first to occupy this role in European theater and described his task as that of a &quot;dramatic judge&quot; (&quot;dramatischer Richter&quot;), one who must assess the most compelling and appropriate means of staging a particular theatrical work. From 1767 to 1770, Lessing published a series of critical commentaries, &quot;Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie)&quot;. These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the current state of German theater, making Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.

Following Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&quot; and &quot;Laokoon&quot; and Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Aesthetics&quot; (1835–38), many subsequent authors, including Friedrich Hölderlin, Johann von Goethe, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, reflected on the stage language of plays as a distinctive art form.

German playwright Gustav Freytag attempted to synthesize the components of modern dramaturgy in his 1863 book &quot;The Technique of the Drama&quot;, published in English in 1894. Known for its outline of the principles of dramatic structure, including the arc of dramatic tension and resolution referred to as Freytag&#x27;s Pyramid, &quot;The Technique of the Drama&quot; is often considered the blueprint for the first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. &quot;The Technique of Play Writing&quot; (1915) by Charlton Andrews, refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.

A foundational work in the Western theatrical tradition is &quot;Poetics&quot; by Aristotle (written c. 335 BCE), which analyzes the genre of tragedy. Aristotle considers &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (c. 429 BCE) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among character, action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and considers the role of audience response as an aspect of theatrical form. His &quot;rules&quot; are referred to today as &quot;Aristotelian drama&quot;. In &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle discusses many key concepts of Greek drama, including the moment of tragic recognition (anagnorisis) and the purgation of audience feelings of pity and fear (catharsis).

Perhaps the most significant successor to Aristotelian dramaturgy is the Epic theatre developed by the twentieth century German playwright Bertolt Brecht. Many of the innovations associated with Brecht as a theorist and writer for the stage, including the concept of the &quot;estrangement effect&quot; (or Verfremdungseffekt) and the acting technique known as gestus, were intended as deliberate revisions of the values upheld by Aristotle.

&quot;Poetics&quot; is the earliest surviving Western work of dramatic theory. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the Sanskrit work &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; (&quot;The Art of Theatre&quot;), written around 500 BCE to 500 CE, which describes the elements, forms, and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian drama.

==Practice==

Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is tasked to obtain expertise on: the physical, social, political, and economic environment in which the action takes place; the psychological underpinnings of the characters; the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing (structure, rhythm, flow, and even individual word choices).

Institutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including: casting of the play; offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress; and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy. Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play&#x27;s history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.

In the early 21st century, the field of dramaturgy has been enriched by the emergence of drametrics, a quantitative approach introduced by dramaturg and theatre scholar, Magda Romanska in 2014. Drametrics, or computational dramaturgy, applies mathematical and computational methods to analyze dramatic texts, combining traditional dramaturgical analysis with digital humanities techniques. This methodology allows dramaturgs to discover structural patterns, character relationships, and dramatic rhythms through computational tools like configuration matrices and network analysis. While traditional dramaturgy relies on close reading and interpretation, drametrics complements this approach by revealing patterns and structures that might not be apparent through conventional analysis, particularly when examining large bodies of dramatic work or comparing multiple texts systematically.

==Copyright==
Since dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.

In 1996, there was debate on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, as in the case involving the estate of Jonathan Larson, author of the musical &quot;Rent&quot; and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of &quot;Rent&quot; and grant her 16 per cent of the author&#x27;s share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a Broadway hit, the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15 per cent of the royalties of &quot;Angels in America&quot; go to playwright Tony Kushner&#x27;s dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court&#x27;s ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of &quot;Rent&quot; and that she was not entitled to royalties. The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.

<text>Gennadius II of Constantinople (Greek: Γεννάδιος; lay name: Γεώργιος Κουρτέσιος Σχολάριος, &quot;Georgios Kourtesios&quot;; – ) was a Byzantine Greek philosopher and theologian, and Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1454 to 1465. He was a strong advocate for the use of Aristotelian philosophy in the Orthodox Church.

Gennadius II was, together with his mentor, Mark of Ephesus, involved in the Council of Florence which aimed to end the schism between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Gennadius II had studied and written extensively on Catholic theology. After the failure of the union of Florence and the Fall of Constantinople, Gennadius II became the first Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople under Ottoman rule. Just before the fall of Constantinople, and after Cardinal Isidore of Kiev had celebrated a Latin Mass in Hagia Sophia to celebrate the ratification of the Council of Florence, its citizens consulted Gennadius II. Gibbon has him say: &quot;O miserable Romans, why will ye abandon the truth? and why, instead of confiding in God, will ye put your trust in the Italians? In losing your faith you will lose your city. Have mercy on me, O Lord! I protest in thy presence that I am innocent of the crime. O miserable Romans, consider, pause, and repent. At the same moment that you renounce the religion of your fathers, by embracing impiety, you submit to a foreign servitude&quot;.

A polemicist, Gennadius II left in writing several treatises on the differences between Catholic and Orthodox theology, the Filioque, a defence of Aristotelianism and excerpts from an exposition (entitled &quot;Confession&quot;) of the Eastern Orthodox faith addressed to Mehmed II.

== Biography ==
He was born &quot;Georgios Kourtesios&quot; in Constantinople and he belonged to an ethnic Greek family originally from the island of Chios; the name &quot;Scholarios&quot; (which was also a title) is thought to derive from a family member&#x27;s position in the Byzantine Navy or the imperial palace. His abecedary was Mark of Ephesus (d. 1444). Following his tutelage under the famous John Chortasmenos (&quot;didaskalos&quot; of the Patriarchal School), Manuel-Mark might have then recommended him to study under his own previous master, Gemistos Plethon (d. 1452–1454), 1428. However, his studies under Plethon are a matter of speculation and, at any rate, would have been more likely attendance at Plethon&#x27;s lectures at Mystras. Gennadius had been a teacher of philosophy before entering the service of the emperor John VIII Palaiologos as a theological advisor. In fact, in 1437 – in anticipation of the Council of Florence – the emperor formally studied Neilos Kabasilas&#x27;s works along with Mark of Ephesus and Gennadius II. Curiously, the trio also formally studied the works of Duns Scotus (d. 1308) because of his rejection of the Filioque in Thomistic metaphysics, as well as Scotus&#x27; doctrine of a &quot;formal distinction&quot; between the persons and essence of God, as well as God&#x27;s attributes (or &quot;energies&quot;). It was for this reason that Gennadius II wrote an academic refutation of the first eighteen of Mark of Ephesus&#x27; &quot;Syllogistic Chapters against the Latins&quot;. From this, the Catholic Encyclopedia speculates that Gennadius II was likely writing an academic exercise to inform his former master that Thomas Aquinas&#x27; opinions did not constitute a universally Latin approach to questions on the Trinity.

=== Council of Florence ===
Gennadius became historically important when, as judge in the civil courts under John VIII Palaiologos (1425–1448), he accompanied his emperor to the Council of Florence, held in 1438–1439 in Ferrara and Florence. The object of this endeavor was bringing a union between the Greek and Latin Churches, which he supported at that time. He made four speeches at the council – all exceedingly conciliatory.

At the same council appeared the celebrated Platonist, Gemistos Plethon, the most powerful opponent of the then dominant Aristotelianism, and consequently an antagonist of Gennadius. In church matters, as in philosophy, the two were opposed – Plethon advocated a partial return to Greek paganism in the form of a syncretic union between Christianity and Zoroastrianism; while Gennadius, more cautious, pressed the necessity for ecclesiastical union with Rome on doctrinal grounds, and was instrumental in drawing up a form which from its vagueness and ambiguity might be accepted by both parties. Gennadius was at a serious disadvantage because, being a layman, he could not directly take part in the discussions of the council.

=== Return to Constantinople ===
Despite his initial advocacy of the union (and berating many of the Orthodox bishops for their lack of theological learnedness), Gennadius soured on union during the council and left it early in June 1440. At the behest of his mentor Mark of Ephesus, who converted him completely to anti-Latin Orthodoxy, until his death, Gennadius was known (with Mark of Ephesus) as the most uncompromising enemy of the union. It was at just about this time (1444) that he began to draw attention to the putative heterodoxy of Aquinas&#x27; &quot;distinction of reason&quot; between the attributes (viz., energies) and essence of God. First, as contained in Martin Jugie&#x27;s edition of his &quot;opera omnia&quot;, Gennadius interrupts chapters 94–96 of his discourse &quot;On Being and Essence&quot; of Thomas Aquinas and replaces the Thomistic explanation with that of Scotism in order to agree better with Gregory Palamas. However, he initially mitigates total condemnation of Aquinas, noting that later Scholastics (like Hervaeus Natalis) interpret Aquinas in a more Orthodox light. This point marks Gennadius&#x27; increasing theological distance from Aquinas, where he begins to be more theologically condemnatory of him in later works (e.g., his treatises on the Holy Spirit and his Preface to the Greek &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;). However, this distance can be overstated. Marcus Plested observes that Gennadius&#x27; &quot;love and esteem for Thomas was to continue undimmed throughout his career although he would often accentuate the note of caution in later works&quot;. Despite his cautions, Gennadius writes of Thomas &quot;We love this divinely-inspired and wise man&quot;. He wrote many works to defend his new convictions, which differ so much from the earlier conciliatory ones that Leo Allatius thought there must be two people of the same name; to whom Edward Gibbon: &quot;Eusèbe Renaudot has restored the identity of his person, and the duplicity of his character&quot;.

After the death of John VIII in 1448, Gennadius entered the Pantokrator monastery in Constantinople under Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos (1448–1453) and took, according to the invariable custom, a new name: Gennadius. Before the fall of the city he was already well known as a bitter opponent of the union. He and Mark of Ephesus were the leaders of the anti-Latin party. In 1444, Mark of Ephesus on his deathbed praised Gennadius&#x27;s irreconcilable attitude towards the Latins and the union. It was to Gennadius that the angry people went after seeing the Uniate services in the great church of Hagia Sophia. It is said that he hid himself, but left a notice on the door of his cell: &quot;O unhappy Romans, why have you forsaken the truth? Why do you not trust in God, instead of in the Italians? In losing your faith you will lose your city&quot;.

=== Ottoman period ===


After the fall of Constantinople, Gennadius was taken prisoner by the Turks. In administering his new conquest, 21-year-old conquering Sultan Mehmed II wished to assure the loyalty of the Greek population and above all avoid them appealing to the Roman Catholics for liberation, potentially sparking a new round of Crusades. Mehmed II therefore sought the most anti-Catholic cleric he could find as a figure of unity for the Greeks under Turkish rule – and Gennadius as leading anti-Union figure was a natural choice. On 1 June 1453, just three days after the fall of the city, the new Patriarch&#x27;s procession passed through the streets where Mehmed II received Gennadius II graciously and himself invested him with the signs of his office – the crosier (&quot;dikanikion&quot;) and mantle. This ceremonial investiture would be repeated by all sultans and patriarchs thereafter.

Before the conquest of Constantinople, the rivalry between the Eastern and Western Churches had significantly weakened the power of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, leading to internal divisions among its clergy. This tumultuous period resulted in the inability to appoint a new patriarch following the resignation of Athanasius II of Constantinople. After the city&#x27;s conquest, Mehmed II ordered the selection and traditional consecration of a new patriarch according to the wishes of the Greeks, appointing Gennadius as the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Constantinople.

Mehmed II conferred upon the new Patriarch the title of &quot;millet&quot; Başkanı&#x27; (Head of the Nation), thereby authorising him to oversee all matters concerning his co-religionists. In a gesture reminiscent of the practices of Byzantine emperors, Mehmed II personally presented the Patriarch with the crosier and crown, symbols of his ecclesiastical authority. This act of investiture, accompanied by Janissary guards, safely paraded the new Patriarch through the city, introducing him to the populace and marking a seamless continuation of the ceremonial traditions of the Byzantine Empire into the Ottoman era.

The city&#x27;s famous patriarchal basilica, the Hagia Sophia, had already been converted into a mosque by the conquerors, so Gennadius II established his seat at the Church of the Holy Apostles. Three years later the edifice, which was in a dilapidated state (in 1461 it was demolished by the Ottomans to make way for the Fatih Mosque), was abandoned by the Patriarch, who moved again to the Church of the Pammakaristos.

The Ottomans divided their Empire into &quot;millets&quot; or subject nations, of which the Greeks were the largest, known as the Rum Millet. The Patriarch was appointed the official head or &quot;Ethnarch&quot; of the Greek millet, which was used as the Ottomans as a source for imperial administrators. Gennadius II became a political authority as well as a religious one, as were all his successors under the Ottomans.

As was normal when a monk or lay scholar was appointed patriarch, Gennadius was consecutively ordained, first as a deacon, then as a priest, then finally as a bishop before being appointed patriarch.

=== Patriarch ===
In the spring of 1454 he was consecrated by the metropolitan of Heraclea Perinthus, but, since both the Church of Hagia Sophia and the palace of the patriarch were now in the hands of the Ottomans, he took up his residence successively in two monasteries of the city. While holding the episcopal office Gennadius II drew up, apparently for the use of Mehmed, a confession or exposition of the Christian faith, which was translated into Turkish by Ahmed, Qadi of Berrhoea (and first printed in Greek and Latin by A. Brassicanus at Vienna in 1530).

Gennadius II was unhappy as patriarch, and tried to abdicate his position at least twice; in 1456 he resigned. The full reason for this step commonly attributed to his disappointment at the sultan&#x27;s treatment of Christians, though Mehmed II seems to have kept the fairly tolerant conditions he had allowed to them; various writers hint at other motives. Eventually, he found the tensions between the Greeks and the Ottomans overwhelming.

He was later called two times to guide the Christian community as Patriarch during the turbulent period that followed the patriarchate of Isidore II of Constantinople. There is no consensus among scholars about the exact dates of his last two patriarchates: according to Kiminas (2009), he reigned again from April 1463 to June 1463 and from autumn 1464 to autumn 1465. Blanchet objects to the existence itself of these two additional terms.

Gennadius II then, like so many of his successors, ended his days as an ex-patriarch and a monk. He lived in the monastery of John the Baptist near Serrae in Macedonia, where he wrote books until he died in about 1472.

Gennadius II fills an important place in Byzantine history. He was the last of the old school of polemical writers and one of the greatest. Unlike most of his fellows he had an intimate acquaintance with Latin theological literature, especially with St. Thomas Aquinas and other Scholastics. He was as skillful an opponent of Catholic theology as Mark of Ephesus, and a more learned one. However, his opposition to Aquinas can be overstated. Marcus Plested observes that Gennadius II&#x27;s &quot;love and esteem for Thomas was to continued undimmed throughout his career although he would often accentuate the note of caution in later works&quot;. Despite his cautions Gennadius writes of Thomas &quot;We love this divinely-inspired and wise man&quot;.

His writings show him to be a student not only of Western philosophy but of controversy with Jews and Muslims, of the great Hesychast question (he attacked Barlaam of Seminara and defended the monks; naturally, the Barlaamites were &quot;latinophrones&quot;), in short, of all the questions that were important in his time. He has another kind of importance as the first Patriarch of Constantinople under the Ottomans. From this point of view, he stands at the head of a new period in the history of his Church; the principles that regulated the condition of Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire are the result of Mehmed II&#x27;s arrangement with him.

== Writings ==
About 100 to 120 of his alleged writings exist, some of which have never been published, and some of which are of doubtful authenticity. As far as is known, his writings may be classified into philosophical (interpretations of Aristotle, Porphyry and others), translations of Peter of Spain and Thomas Aquinas, defenses of Aristotelianism against the recrudescence of Neoplatonism and theological and ecclesiastical (partly concerning the union and partly defending Christianity against Muslims, Jews, and pagans), in addition to numerous homilies, hymns, and letters.

Gennadius II was a prolific writer during all the periods of his life. The complete works of Gennadius II were published in eight volumes by Jugie, Petit &amp; Siderides, 1928–1936. (Note: this edition supersedes the references made below.)

=== First Period (pro-Union) ===
The chief works of this time are the &quot;speeches&quot; made at the Council of Florence, also a number of letters addressed to various friends, bishops, and statesmen, mostly unedited. An &quot;Apology for five chapters of the Council of Florence&quot; is doubtful. A &quot;History of the Council of Florence&quot; under his name (in manuscript only) is really identical with that of Syropulos.

=== Second Period (anti-Union) ===
A great number of polemical works against Latins were written in this time. Two books about the &quot;Procession of the Holy Ghost&quot;; another one &quot;against the insertion of the &quot;Filioque&quot; in the Creed&quot;; two books and a letter about &quot;Purgatory&quot;; various sermons and speeches; a &quot;Panegyric of Mark of Ephesus&quot; (in 1447), etc. Some translations of works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and polemical treatises against his theology by Gennadius II are still unedited, as is also his work against the Barlaamites. However, his hostility toward Aquinas can be overstated. Marcus Plested observes that Gennadius II&#x27;s &quot;love and esteem for Thomas was to continue undimmed throughout his career although he would often accentuate the note of caution in later works&quot;. Despite his cautions, Gennadius writes of Thomas &quot;We love this divinely-inspired and wise man&quot;.

There are also various philosophical treatises of which the chief is a &quot;Defence of Aristotle&quot; (&quot;antilepseis hyper Aristotelous&quot;) against the Neoplatonist, Gemistos Plethon.

His most important work is easily his &quot;Confession&quot; (&quot;Ekthesis tes pisteos ton orthodoxon christianon&quot;, generally known as &quot;Homologia tou Gennadiou&quot;) addressed to Mehmed II. It contains twenty articles, of which however only the first twelve are authentic. It was written in Greek; Achmed, Qadi of Berrhoea, translated it into Turkish. This is the first (in date) of the Orthodox Symbolic books. It was published first (in Greek and Latin) by Brassicanus (Vienna, 1530), and again by Chytræus (Frankfurt, 1582). Martin Crusius printed it in Greek, Latin, and Turkish (in Greek and Latin script) in his &quot;Turco-Græcia&quot; (Basle, 1584 reprinted in &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, CLX 333, sqq.). Rimmel reprinted it (Greek and Latin) (in his &quot;Monumenta fidei Eccl. Orient.&quot;, (Jena, 1850), I, 1–10.); and Michalcescu in Greek only. There exists an arrangement of this Confession in the form of a dialogue in which Mehmed asks questions (&quot;What is God?&quot; – &quot;Why is he called &quot;theos&quot;?&quot; – &quot;And how many Gods are there?&quot; and so on) and Gennadius II gives suitable answers. This is called variously Gennadius II&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; (&quot;dialexis&quot;, διάλεξις), or &quot;Confessio prior&quot;, or &quot;De Via salutis humanæ&quot; (&quot;Peri tes hodou tes soterias anthropon&quot;). Rimmel prints it first, in Latin only, and thinks it was the source of the Confession. It is more probably a later compilation made from the Confession by someone else. It should be noticed that Gennadius II&#x27;s (quasi-Platonic) philosophy is in evidence in his Confession (God cannot be interpreted, &quot;theos&quot; from &quot;theein&quot;, etc.; cf. Rimmel). Either for the same reason or to spare Muslim susceptibility he avoids the word &quot;Prosopa&quot; in explaining the Trinity, speaking of the three Persons as &quot;idiomata&quot; &quot;which we call Hypostases&quot;.

=== Third Period (post-resignation) ===
During the third period, from his resignation to his death (1459–1468), he continued writing theological and polemical works. An encyclical letter to all Christians &quot;In defence of his resignation&quot; is unedited, as are also a &quot;Dialogue with two Turks about the divinity of Christ&quot;, and a work about the &quot;Adoration of God&quot;, Jahn (&quot;Anecdota græca&quot;) has published a &quot;Dialogue between a Christian and a Jew&quot; and a collection of &quot;Prophecies about Christ&quot; gathered from the Old Testament. A treatise, &quot;About our God, one in three, against Atheists and Polytheists&quot;, is chiefly directed against the theory that the world may have been formed by chance. Five books, &quot;About the Foreknowledge and Providence of God&quot; and a &quot;Treatise on the manhood of Christ&quot;, are also in &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, CLX. Lastly, there are many homilies by Gennadius II, most of which exist only in manuscript at Mount Athos.

<text>Paul Chaudet (17 November 1904, in Rivaz – 7 August 1977) was a Swiss politician.

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 16 December 1954 and handed over office on 31 December 1966. He resigned on 28 November 1966 due to the Mirage-affair. He was affiliated with the Radical Party. During his time in office, he held the Military Department.

He was President of the Confederation twice in 1959 and 1962.

Owing to incompetent military advisors concerning the purchase of 100 Mirage fighter jets with a budget which increased by 66%, he was forced to resign in 1966 by his own Radical Party. 

With Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, he was one of the last Swiss Radicals. He remained, throughout his life, one of the rare right-wing Swiss politicians who was able to identify with both wine-growers and farmers.

The Radical Party has now fused with the right-wing Liberals.

<doc id="155895" wikidata="Q220313" url="?curid=155895" title="Gemistos Plethon">
<text>Georgios Gemistos Plethon (; /1360 – 1452/1454), commonly known as Gemistos Plethon, was a Greek scholar and one of the most renowned philosophers of the Late Byzantine era. He was a chief pioneer of the revival of Greek scholarship in Western Europe. As revealed in his last literary work, the &quot;Nomoi&quot; or &quot;Book of Laws&quot;, which he circulated only among close friends, he rejected Christianity in favour of a return to the worship of the classical Hellenic gods, mixed with ancient wisdom based on Zoroaster and the Magi.

In 1438–1439 he reintroduced Plato&#x27;s ideas to Western Europe during the Council of Florence, in a failed attempt to reconcile the East–West schism. Plethon also formulated his political vision in several speeches throughout his life. The boast in one of the speeches that &quot;We are Hellenes by race and culture&quot; and his proposal of a reborn Byzantine Empire following a utopian Hellenic system of government centered in Mystras, have generated discussion about Byzantine and modern Greek identity. In this regard, Plethon has been labelled both &quot;the last Hellene&quot; and &quot;the first modern Greek&quot;.

== Biography ==

===Early life and career===
Georgios Gemistos Plethon was born in Constantinople in 1355/1360. Raised in a family of well-educated Orthodox Christians, he studied in Constantinople and Adrianople, before returning to Constantinople and establishing himself as a teacher of philosophy. Adrianople, the Ottoman capital following its capture by the Ottoman Sultan Murad I in 1365, was a centre of learning modelled by Murad on the caliphates of Cairo and Baghdad. Plethon admired Plato (Greek: &quot;Plátōn&quot;) so much that late in life he took the similar-meaning name &quot;Plethon&quot;. Some time before 1410, Emperor Manuel II Paleologos sent him to Mystra in the Despotate of Morea in the southern Peloponnese, which remained his home for the rest of his life. In Constantinople, he had been a senator, and he continued to fulfil various public functions, such as being a judge, and was regularly consulted by rulers of Morea. Despite suspicions of heresy from the Church, he was held in high Imperial favour.

In Mystra he taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, and compiled digests of many classical writers. His pupils included Bessarion and George Scholarius (later to become Patriarch of Constantinople and Plethon&#x27;s enemy). He was made chief magistrate by Theodore II. He produced his major writings during his time in Italy and after his return.

===Council of Florence===
In 1428 Plethon was consulted by Emperor John VIII on the issue of unifying the Greek and Latin churches, and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power. Byzantine scholars had been in contact with their counterparts in Western Europe since the time of the Latin Empire, and especially since the Byzantine Empire had begun to ask for Western European help against the Ottomans in the 14th century. Western Europe had some access to ancient Greek philosophy through the Catholic Church and the Muslims, but the Byzantines had many documents and interpretations that the Westerners had never seen before. Byzantine scholarship became more fully available to the West after 1438, when Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos attended the Council of Ferrara, later known as the Council of Florence, to discuss a union of the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches. Despite not being a theologian, Plethon was chosen to accompany John VIII on the basis of his renowned wisdom and morality. Other delegates included Plethon&#x27;s former students Bessarion, Mark Eugenikos and Gennadius Scholarius.

===Plethon and the Renaissance===
At the invitation of some Florentine humanists he set up a temporary school to lecture on the difference between Plato and Aristotle. Few of Plato&#x27;s writings were studied in the Latin West at that time, and he essentially reintroduced much of Plato to the Western world, shaking the domination which Aristotle had come to exercise over Western European thought in the high and later Middle Ages.

Marsilio Ficino&#x27;s introduction to the translation of Plotinus has traditionally been interpreted to the effect that Cosimo de&#x27; Medici attended Pletho&#x27;s lectures and was inspired to found the &quot;Accademia Platonica&quot; in Florence, where Italian students of Plethon continued to teach after the conclusion of the council. However, according to James Hankins, Ficino was misunderstood. In fact, communication between Plethon and Cosimo de&#x27; Medici - for whose meeting there is no independent evidence - would have been severely constrained by the language barrier. Furthermore, Ficino&#x27;s &quot;Platonic Academy&quot; was more of an &quot;informal gymnasium&quot; that did not have a particularly Platonic orientation. Nevertheless, Plethon came to be considered one of the most important influences on the Italian Renaissance. Marsilio Ficino, the Florentine humanist and the first director of the Accademia Platonica, paid Plethon the ultimate honour, calling him &#x27;the second Plato&#x27;, while Cardinal Bessarion speculated as to whether Plato&#x27;s soul occupied his body. Plethon may also have been the source for Ficino&#x27;s Orphic system of natural magic.

While still in Florence, Pletho wrote a volume titled &quot;Wherein Aristotle disagrees with Plato&quot;, commonly called &quot;De Differentiis&quot;, to correct the misunderstandings he had encountered. He claimed he had written it &quot;without serious intent&quot; while incapacitated through illness, &quot;to comfort myself and to please those who are dedicated to Plato&quot;. George Scholarius responded with a &quot;Defence of Aristotle&quot;, which elicited Plethon&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Reply&quot;. Expatriate Byzantine scholars and later Italian humanists continued the argument.

Plethon died in Mistra in 1452, or in 1454, according to J. Monfasani (the difference between the two dates being significant as to whether or not Plethon still lived to know of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453). In 1466, some of his Italian disciples, headed by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, stole his remains from Mistra and interred them in the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, &quot;so that the great Teacher may be among free men&quot;.

==Writings==
===Reform of the Peloponnese===
Believing that the Peloponnesians were direct descendants of the ancient Hellenes, Plethon rejected Justinian&#x27;s idea of a universal Empire in favour of recreating the Hellenistic civilization, the zenith of Greek influence. In his 1415 and 1418 pamphlets he urged Manuel II and his son Theodore Palaiologos to turn the peninsula into a cultural island with a new constitution of strongly centralised monarchy advised by a small body of middle-class educated men. The army must be composed only of professional native Greek soldiers, who would be supported by the taxpayers, or &quot;Helots&quot; who would be exempt from military service. Land was to be publicly owned, and a third of all produce given to the state fund; incentives would be given for cultivating virgin land. Trade would be regulated and the use of coinage limited, barter instead being encouraged; locally available products would be supported over imports. Mutilation as a punishment would be abolished, and chain gangs introduced. Homosexuals and sexual deviants would be burnt at the stake. The social and political ideas in these pamphlets were largely derived from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Plethon touched little on religion, although he expressed disdain for monks, who &quot;render no service to the common good&quot;. He vaguely prescribed three religious principles: belief in a supreme being; that this being has concern for mankind; and that it is uninfluenced by gifts or flattery. Manuel and Theodore did not act on any of these reforms.

===&quot;De Differentiis&quot;===
In &quot;De Differentiis&quot; Plethon compares Aristotle&#x27;s and Plato&#x27;s conceptions of God, arguing that Plato credits God with more exalted powers as &quot;creator of every kind of intelligible and separate substance, and hence of our entire universe&quot;, while Aristotle has God as only the motive force of the universe; Plato&#x27;s God is also the end and final cause of existence, while Aristotle&#x27;s God is only the end of movement and change. Plethon derides Aristotle for discussing unimportant matters such as shellfish and embryos while failing to credit God with creating the universe, for believing the heavens are composed of a fifth element, and for his view that contemplation was the greatest pleasure; the latter aligned him with Epicurus, Plethon argued, and he attributed this same pleasure-seeking to monks, whom he accused of laziness. Later, in response to Gennadius&#x27; &quot;Defence of Aristotle&quot;, Plethon argued in his &quot;Reply&quot; that Plato&#x27;s God was more consistent with Christian doctrine than Aristotle&#x27;s, and this, according to Darien DeBolt, was probably in part an attempt to escape suspicion of heterodoxy.

===&quot;Nomoi&quot;===
After his death, Plethon&#x27;s &quot;Nómōn syngraphḗ&quot; (Νόμων συγγραφή) or &quot;Nómoi&quot; (Νόμοι, &quot;Book of Laws&quot;) was discovered. It came into the possession of Princess Theodora, wife of Demetrios Palaiologos, despot of Morea. Theodora sent the manuscript to Scholarius, now Gennadius II, Patriarch of Constantinople, asking for his advice on what to do with it; he returned it, advising her to destroy it. Morea was under invasion from Sultan Mehmet II, and Theodora escaped with Demetrios to Constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to Gennadius, reluctant to destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar&#x27;s work herself. Gennadius burned it in 1460; however, in a letter to the Exarch Joseph (which still survives) he details the book, providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents. It seemed to represent a merging of Stoic philosophy and Zoroastrian mysticism, and discussed astrology, daemons and the migration of the soul. He recommended religious rites and hymns to petition the classical gods, such as Zeus, whom he saw as universal principles and planetary powers. Man, as relative of the gods, should strive towards good. Plethon believed the universe has no beginning or end in time, and being created perfect, nothing may be added to it. He rejected the concept of a brief reign of evil followed by perpetual happiness, and held that the human soul is reincarnated, directed by the gods into successive bodies to fulfill divine order. This same divine order, he believed, governed the organisation of bees, the foresight of ants and the dexterity of spiders, as well as the growth of plants, magnetic attraction, and the amalgamation of mercury and gold.

Plethon drew up plans in his &quot;Nómoi&quot; to radically change the structure and philosophy of the Byzantine Empire in line with his interpretation of Platonism. The new state religion was to be founded on a hierarchical pantheon of pagan gods, based largely upon the ideas of humanism prevalent at the time, incorporating themes such as rationalism and logic. As an ad hoc measure he also supported the reconciliation of the two churches in order to secure Western Europe&#x27;s support against the Ottomans. He also proposed more practical, immediate measures, such as rebuilding the Hexamilion, the ancient defensive wall across the Isthmus of Corinth, which had been breached by the Ottomans in 1423.

The political and social elements of his theories covered the creation of communities, government (he promoted benevolent monarchy as the most stable form), land ownership (land should be shared, rather than individually owned), social organisation, families, and divisions of sex and class. He believed that labourers should keep a third of their produce, and that soldiers should be professional. He held that love should be private not because it is shameful, but because it is sacred.

===&quot;Summary&quot;===
Plethon&#x27;s own summary of the &quot;Nómoi&quot; also survived, among manuscripts held by his former student Bessarion. This summary, titled &quot;Summary of the Doctrines of Zoroaster and Plato&quot;, affirms the existence of a pantheon of gods, with Zeus as supreme sovereign, containing within himself all being in an undivided state; his eldest child, motherless, is Poseidon, who created the heavens and rules all below, ordaining order in the universe. Zeus&#x27; other children include an array of &quot;supercelestial&quot; gods, the Olympians and Tartareans, all motherless. Of these Hera is third in command after Poseidon, creatress and ruler of indestructible matter, and the mother by Zeus of the heavenly gods, demi-gods and spirits. The Olympians rule immortal life in the heavens, the Tartareans mortal life below, their leader Kronos ruling over mortality altogether. The eldest of the heavenly gods is Helios, master of the heavens here and source of all mortal life on earth. The gods are responsible for much good and no evil, and guide all life towards divine order. Plethon describes the creation of the universe as being perfect and outside of time, so that the universe remains eternal, without beginning or end. The soul of man, like the gods is immortal and essentially good, and is reincarnated in successive mortal bodies for eternity at the direction of the gods.

===Other works===
* &quot;On Virtues&quot; ()

Many of Plethon&#x27;s other works still exist in manuscript form in various European libraries. Most of Plethon&#x27;s works can be found in J. P. Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot; collection; for a complete list see Fabricius, &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; (ed. Harles), xii.

==In modern literature==
Early in his writing career, E. M. Forster attempted a historical novel about Plethon and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, but was not satisfied with the result and never published it — though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison. Forster also wrote an essay about Plethon, to be found in his book &quot;Abinger Harvest&quot;.

Ezra Pound included Plethon in his poem &quot;The Cantos&quot;. References to Plethon and Sigismondo Malatesta can be found in Canto 8. Plethon is also mentioned in Cantos 23 and 26. Pound was fascinated by the effect that Plethon&#x27;s conversation may have had on Cosimo de Medici and his decision to acquire Greek manuscripts of Plato and Neoplatonic philosophers. By having manuscripts brought from Greece and becoming the patron of &quot;the young boy, Ficino,&quot; Cosimo facilitated the preservation and transmission of the Greek cultural patrimony into the modern world after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Plethon thus played a key but hidden role in the Italian Renaissance.

Plethon and his school are depicted in the 2008 novel &quot;The Perfect Remembrance of Death&quot; () by Serbian writer Radoslav Petković, whose main character survives the fall of Constantinople and remembers his early days in Mystra as Plethon&#x27;s pupil.

<text>Human ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. The philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in ecology, geography, sociology, psychology, anthropology, zoology, epidemiology, public health, and home economics, among others.

==Historical development==

The roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the Greeks and a lengthy list of developments in natural history science. Ecology also has notably developed in other cultures. Traditional knowledge, as it is called, includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge, intelligent relations, understanding, and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience. The term ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1866 and defined by direct reference to &quot;the economy of nature&quot;.

Like other contemporary researchers of his time, Haeckel adopted his terminology from Carl Linnaeus where human ecological connections were more evident. In his 1749 publication, &quot;Specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae&quot;, Linnaeus developed a science that included the &quot;economy and polis of nature&quot;. Polis stems from its Greek roots for a political community (originally based on the city-states), sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community. Linnaeus was also the first to write about the close affinity between humans and primates. Linnaeus presented early ideas found in modern aspects to human ecology, including the balance of nature while highlighting the importance of ecological functions (ecosystem services or natural capital in modern terms): &quot;In exchange for performing its function satisfactorily, nature provided a species with the necessaries of life&quot; The work of Linnaeus influenced Charles Darwin and other scientists of his time who used Linnaeus&#x27; terminology (i.e., the &quot;economy and polis of nature&quot;) with direct implications on matters of human affairs, ecology, and economics.

Ecology is not just biological, but a human science as well. An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was Herbert Spencer. Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.

The history of human ecology has strong roots in geography and sociology departments of the late 19th century. In this context a major historical development or landmark that stimulated research into the ecological relations between humans and their urban environments was founded in George Perkins Marsh&#x27;s book &quot;Man and Nature; or, physical geography as modified by human action&quot;, which was published in 1864. Marsh was interested in the active agency of human-nature interactions (an early precursor to urban ecology or human niche construction) in frequent reference to the &quot;economy of nature&quot;.

In 1894, an influential sociologist at the University of Chicago named Albion W. Small collaborated with sociologist George E. Vincent and published a &quot;&#x27;laboratory guide&#x27; to studying people in their &#x27;every-day occupations.&#x27;&quot; This was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study society in a way that a natural historian would study birds. Their publication &quot;explicitly included the relation of the social world to the material environment.&quot;

The first English-language use of the term &quot;ecology&quot; is credited to American chemist and founder of the field of home economics, Ellen Swallow Richards. Richards first introduced the term as &quot;oekology&quot; in 1892, and subsequently developed the term &quot;human ecology&quot;.

The term &quot;human ecology&quot; first appeared in Ellen Swallow Richards&#x27; 1907 &quot;Sanitation in Daily Life&quot;, where it was defined as &quot;the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men&quot;. Richard&#x27;s use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature. The term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book &quot;Introduction to the Science of Sociology&quot;, published by Robert E. Park and Ernest W. Burgess (also from the sociology department at the University of Chicago). Their student, Roderick D. McKenzie helped solidify human ecology as a sub-discipline within the Chicago school. These authors emphasized the difference between human ecology and ecology in general by highlighting cultural evolution in human societies.

Human ecology has a fragmented academic history with developments spread throughout a range of disciplines, including: home economics, geography, anthropology, sociology, zoology, and psychology. Some authors have argued that geography is human ecology. Much historical debate has hinged on the placement of humanity as part or as separate from nature. In light of the branching debate of what constitutes human ecology, recent interdisciplinary researchers have sought a unifying scientific field they have titled coupled human and natural systems that &quot;builds on but moves beyond previous work (e.g., human ecology, ecological anthropology, environmental geography).&quot; Other fields or branches related to the historical development of human ecology as a discipline include cultural ecology, urban ecology, environmental sociology, and anthropological ecology. Even though the term ‘human ecology&#x27; was popularized in the 1920s and 1930s, studies in this field had been conducted since the early nineteenth century in England and France.

In 1969, College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, was founded as a school of human ecology. Since its first enrolled class of 32 students, the college has grown into a small liberal arts institution with about 350 students and 35 full-time faculty. Every graduate receives a degree in human ecology, an interdisciplinary major which each student designs to fit their own interests and needs.

Biological ecologists have traditionally been reluctant to study human ecology, gravitating instead to the allure of wild nature. Human ecology has a history of focusing attention on humans&#x27; impact on the biotic world. Paul Sears was an early proponent of applying human ecology, addressing topics aimed at the population explosion of humanity, global resource limits, pollution, and published a comprehensive account on human ecology as a discipline in 1954. He saw the vast &quot;explosion&quot; of problems humans were creating for the environment and reminded us that &quot;what is important is the work to be done rather than the label.&quot; &quot;When we as a profession learn to diagnose the total landscape, not only as the basis of our culture, but as an expression of it, and to share our special knowledge as widely as we can, we need not fear that our work will be ignored or that our efforts will be unappreciated.&quot; Recently, the Ecological Society of America has added a Section on Human Ecology, indicating the increasing openness of biological ecologists to engage with human dominated systems and the acknowledgement that most contemporary ecosystems have been influenced by human action.

==Overview==
Human ecology has been defined as a type of analysis applied to the relations in human beings that was traditionally applied to plants and animals in ecology. Toward this aim, human ecologists (which can include sociologists) integrate diverse perspectives from a broad spectrum of disciplines covering &quot;wider points of view&quot;. In its 1972 premier edition, the editors of &quot;Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal&quot; gave an introductory statement on the scope of topics in human ecology. Their statement provides a broad overview on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic:

* Genetic, physiological, and social adaptation to the environment and to environmental change;
* The role of social, cultural, and psychological factors in the maintenance or disruption of ecosystems;
* Effects of population density on health, social organization, or environmental quality;
* New adaptive problems in urban environments;
* Interrelations of technological and environmental changes;
* The development of unifying principles in the study of biological and cultural adaptation;
* The genesis of maladaptions in human biological and cultural evolution;
* The relation of food quality and quantity to physical and intellectual performance and to demographic change;
* The application of computers, remote sensing devices, and other new tools and techniques

Forty years later in the same journal, Daniel G. Bates (2012) notes lines of continuity in the discipline and the way it has changed:

Today there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural ecology or even a specifically &quot;human ecology&quot; model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.

While theoretical discussions continue, research published in &quot;Human Ecology Review&quot; suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology. Some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether. Scholarship has increasingly tended away from Gerald L. Young&#x27;s idea of a &quot;unified theory&quot; of human ecological knowledge—that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline—and more toward the pluralism best espoused by Paul Shepard: that human ecology is healthiest when &quot;running out in all directions&quot;. But human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory, rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate, synthesize, and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature. This new human ecology emphasizes complexity over reductionism, focuses on changes over stable states, and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people.

==Application to epidemiology and public health==
The application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications, with Carl Linnaeus having played a seminal role. However, the term appears to have come into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century. This was strengthened in 1971 by the publication of &quot;Epidemiology as Medical Ecology&quot;, and again in 1987 by the publication of a textbook on &quot;Public Health and Human Ecology&quot;. An &quot;ecosystem health&quot; perspective has emerged as a thematic movement, integrating research and practice from such fields as environmental management, public health, biodiversity, and economic development. Drawing in turn from the application of concepts such as the social-ecological model of health, human ecology has converged with the mainstream of global public health literature.

==Connection to home economics==
In addition to its links to other disciplines, human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of Ellen Swallow Richards, among others. However, as early as the 1960s, a number of universities began to rename home economics departments, schools, and colleges as human ecology programs. In part, this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term home economics in a modernizing society, and reflects a recognition of human ecology as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become home economics. Current human ecology programs include the University of Wisconsin School of Human Ecology, the Cornell University College of Human Ecology, and the University of Alberta&#x27;s Department of Human Ecology, among others.

==Niche of the Anthropocene==

Changes to the Earth by human activities have been so great that a new geological epoch named the Anthropocene has been proposed. The human niche or ecological &quot;polis&quot; of human society, as it was known historically, has created entirely new arrangements of ecosystems as we convert matter into technology. Human ecology has created anthropogenic biomes (called anthromes). The habitats within these anthromes reach out through our road networks to create what has been called technoecosystems containing technosols. Technodiversity exists within these technoecosystems. In direct parallel to the concept of the ecosphere, human civilization has also created a technosphere. The way that the human species engineers or constructs technodiversity into the environment threads back into the processes of cultural and biological evolution, including the human economy.
==Ecosystem services==


The ecosystems of planet Earth are coupled to human environments. Ecosystems regulate the global geophysical cycles of energy, climate, soil nutrients, and water that in turn support and grow natural capital (including the environmental, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of life). Ultimately, every manufactured product in human environments comes from natural systems. Ecosystems are considered common-pool resources because ecosystems do not exclude beneficiaries and they can be depleted or degraded. For example, green space within communities provides sustainable health services that reduce mortality and regulate the spread of vector-borne disease. Research shows that people who are more engaged with and who have regular access to natural areas benefit from lower rates of diabetes, heart disease and psychological disorders. These ecological health services are regularly depleted through urban development projects that do not factor in the common-pool value of ecosystems.

The ecological commons delivers a diverse supply of community services that sustains the well-being of human society. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, an international UN initiative involving more than 1,360 experts worldwide, identifies four main ecosystem service types having 30 sub-categories stemming from natural capital. The ecological commons includes provisioning (e.g., food, raw materials, medicine, water supplies), regulating (e.g., climate, water, soil retention, flood retention), cultural (e.g., science and education, artistic, spiritual), and supporting (e.g., soil formation, nutrient cycling, water cycling) services.
==Sixth mass extinction==
Global assessments of biodiversity indicate that the current epoch, the Holocene (or Anthropocene) is a sixth mass extinction. Species loss is accelerating at 100–1000 times faster than average background rates in the fossil record. The field of conservation biology involves ecologists that are researching, confronting, and searching for solutions to sustain the planet&#x27;s ecosystems for future generations.

&quot;Human activities are associated directly or indirectly with nearly every aspect of the current extinction spasm.&quot;

Nature is a resilient system. Ecosystems regenerate, withstand, and are forever adapting to fluctuating environments. Ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time.

However, persistent, systematic, large and non-random disturbance caused by the niche-constructing behavior of human beings, including habitat conversion and land development, has pushed many of the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems to the extent of their resilience thresholds. Three planetary thresholds have already been crossed, including biodiversity loss, climate change, and nitrogen cycles. These biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and are naturally resilient, but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an Anthropocene epoch and the ecological state of the Earth is deteriorating rapidly, to the detriment of humanity. The world&#x27;s fisheries and oceans, for example, are facing dire challenges as the threat of global collapse appears imminent, with serious ramifications for the well-being of humanity.

While the Anthropocene is yet to be classified as an official epoch, current evidence suggest that &quot;an epoch-scale boundary has been crossed within the last two centuries.&quot; The ecology of the planet is further threatened by global warming, but investments in nature conservation can provide a regulatory feedback to store and regulate carbon and other greenhouse gases.

==Ecological footprint==


In 1992, William Rees developed the ecological footprint concept. The ecological footprint and its close analog the water footprint has become a popular way of accounting for the level of impact that human society is imparting on the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems. All indications are that the human enterprise is unsustainable as the footprint of society is placing too much stress on the ecology of the planet. The WWF 2008 living planet report and other researchers report that human civilization has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet. This means that the footprint of human consumption is extracting more natural resources than can be replenished by ecosystems around the world.

==Ecological economics==

Ecological economics is an economic science that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss. Natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities. Population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services. The prospect for recovery in the economic crisis of nature is grim. Populations, such as local ponds and patches of forest are being cleared away and lost at rates that exceed species extinctions. The mainstream growth-based economic system adopted by governments worldwide does not include a price or markets for natural capital. This type of economic system places further ecological debt onto future generations.

Human societies are increasingly being placed under stress as the ecological commons is diminished through an accounting system that has incorrectly assumed &quot;... that nature is a fixed, indestructible capital asset.&quot; The current wave of threats, including massive extinction rates and concurrent loss of natural capital to the detriment of human society, is happening rapidly. This is called a biodiversity crisis, because 50% of the worlds species are predicted to go extinct within the next 50 years. Conventional monetary analyses are unable to detect or deal with these sorts of ecological problems. Multiple global ecological economic initiatives are being promoted to solve this problem. For example, governments of the G8 met in 2007 and set forth The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative:

In a global study we will initiate the process of analyzing the global economic benefit of biological diversity, the costs of the loss of biodiversity and the failure to take protective measures versus the costs of effective conservation.

The work of Kenneth E. Boulding is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins. Boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics, most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system, and indicated that the &quot;household of man&quot; and the &quot;household of nature&quot; could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value.

==Interdisciplinary approaches==
Human ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind. People&#x27;s perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate, both in time and in space. This concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability: &quot;think global, act local.&quot; Moreover, people&#x27;s conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from &quot;community as place, community as way of life, or community of collective action.&quot;

In the last century, the world has faced several challenges, including environmental degradation, public health issues, and climate change. Addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary interventions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the intricate connections between human societies and the environment. In the early years, human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines: geography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research.

===In art===

While some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology, it was Sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art. Bill Carpenter (1986) calls human ecology the &quot;possibility of an aesthetic science&quot;, renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective. According to Carpenter, human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness.

===In education===

While the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing, there is no human ecology at the primary or secondary education levels, with one notable exception, Syosset High School, in Long Island, New York. Educational theorist Sir Kenneth Robinson has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic (i.e., educate their &quot;whole being&quot;) activities to implement a &quot;new conception of human ecology&quot;.

Furthermore the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine offers a Master’s of Philosophy in Human Ecology. This unique Master’s degree consists of two components; the first consists of nine courses and the second is a thesis. However, as of currently they are not accepting applications to this master’s program. 

==Bioregionalism and urban ecology==

In the late 1960s, ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields, namely architecture, landscape architecture, and planning. Ian McHarg called for a future when all planning would be &quot;human ecological planning&quot; by default, always bound up in humans&#x27; relationships with their environments. He emphasized local, place-based planning that takes into consideration all the &quot;layers&quot; of information from geology to botany to zoology to cultural history. Proponents of the new urbanism movement, like James Howard Kunstler and Andres Duany, have embraced the term human ecology as a way to describe the problem of—and prescribe the solutions for—the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society. Duany has called the human ecology movement to be &quot;the agenda for the years ahead.&quot; While McHargian planning is still widely respected, the landscape urbanism movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations. Among these theorists is Frederich Steiner, who published &quot;Human Ecology: Following Nature&#x27;s Lead&quot; in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape, culture, and planning. The work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology. While Steiner discusses specific ecological settings, such as cityscapes and waterscapes, and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions, he also takes a diverse approach to ecology—considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and political geography. Deiter Steiner&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary&quot; view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology. Part literature review, the book is divided into four sections: &quot;human ecology&quot;, &quot;the implicit and the explicit&quot;, &quot;structuration&quot;, and &quot;the regional dimension&quot;. Much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity, antidualism, and wholeness of perspective.

<text>Bessarion (; 2 January 1403 – 18 November 1472) was a Byzantine Greek Renaissance humanist, theologian, Catholic cardinal and one of the famed Greek scholars who contributed to the so-called great revival of letters in the 15th century. He was educated by Gemistus Pletho in Neoplatonic philosophy and later served as the titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He eventually was named a cardinal and was twice considered for the papacy.

His baptismal name was Basil (Greek: Βασίλειος, &quot;Basileios&quot; or &quot;Basilios&quot;). He took the name Bessarion upon entering the monastery. He has been mistakenly known also as Johannes Bessarion () due to an erroneous interpretation of Gregory III Mammas.

==Biography==
Bessarion was born in Trebizond, the Black Sea port in northeastern Anatolia that was the heart of Pontic Greek culture and civilization during the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. The year of his birth has been given as 1389, 1395 or 1403.

===Bessarion&#x27;s Neoplatonism===

Bessarion was educated in Constantinople, then went in 1423 to Mystras, Peloponnese to study Neoplatonism under Gemistus Pletho. Under Pletho, he &quot;went through the liberal arts curriculum…, with a special emphasis on mathematics…including the study of astronomy and geography&quot; that would have related &quot;philosophy to physics…cosmology and astrology&quot; and Pletho&#x27;s &quot;mathematics would include Pythagorean number-mysticism, Plato&#x27;s cosmological geometry and the Neoplatonic arithmetic which connected the material world with the world of Plato&#x27;s Forms. Possibly it also included astrology…&quot; Woodhouse also mentions that Bessarion &quot;had a mystical streak…[and] was proficient in Neoplatonic vocabulary…mathematics…and Platonic theology&quot;.

Bessarion&#x27;s Neoplatonism stayed with him his whole life, even as a cardinal. He was very familiar with Neoplatonist terminology and used it in his letter to Pletho&#x27;s two sons, Demitrios and Andronikos, on the death of his still-beloved teacher in 1452. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about his life was that a Neoplatonist could have played such a significant role in the Catholic Church for at least a brief time, though he was attacked for his views by more orthodox Catholic academics shortly after his death.

===Role in the Council of Ferrara===

On becoming a tonsured monk, he adopted the name of Bessarion of Egypt, whose story he has related. In 1436 became abbot of a monastery in Constantinople and in 1437, he was made metropolitan of Nicaea by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, whom he accompanied to Italy in order to bring about a reunion between the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches. The emperor hoped to use the possibility of re-uniting the churches to obtain help from Western Europe against the Ottoman Empire. Bessarion participated in the Byzantine delegation to the Council of Ferrara-Florence as the most eminent representative of unionists, although he originally belonged to the party of anti-unionists. On 6 July 1439, he read the declaration of the Greek Association of Churches in Florence cathedral, in the presence of Pope Eugene IV and the Emperor John VIII Palaeologus.

Some historians have impugned Bessarion&#x27;s sincerity in adhering to the union. However, Gill upholds Bessarion&#x27;s sincerity in being convinced to the truth of the Roman position in the matters discussed at the Council quoting from Bessarion&#x27;s own work &quot;Oratio Dogmatica&quot;:
===Cardinal and later life===

Upon his return to the East, he found himself bitterly resented for his attachment to the minority party that saw no difficulty in a reconciliation of the two churches. Pope Eugene IV invested him with the rank of cardinal at the consistory of 18 December 1439.
From that time, Bessarion resided permanently in Italy, doing much (by his patronage of learned men, by his collection of books and manuscripts, and by his own writings) to spread the New Learning. His palazzo in Rome was a virtual academy for the studies of new humanistic learning, a center for learned Greeks and Greek refugees, whom he supported by commissioning transcripts of Greek manuscripts and translations into Latin that made Greek scholarship available to Western Europeans. He supported Regiomontanus in this fashion and defended Nicholas of Cusa. He is known in history as the original patron of the Greek exiles (scholars and diplomats) including Theodore Gaza, George of Trebizond, John Argyropoulos, and Janus Lascaris.

He held in succession the archbishopric of Siponto and the suburbicarian sees of Sabina and Frascati. At the papal conclave of 1455 which elected the Aragonese candidate, Alfons de Borja, as Callixtus III, Cardinal Bessarion was an early candidate, favored on account of his disinterestness in the struggle between candidates pushed forward by the Roman factions of the Orsini and Colonna. He was opposed for his Greek background by the French Cardinal Alain de Coëtivy.
For five years (1450–1455), he was legate at Bologna, and he was engaged on embassies to many foreign princes, among others to Louis XI of France in 1471. Other missions were to Germany to encourage Western princes to help their fellow Christians in the East. For these efforts, his fellow humanist Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, then Pius II, gave him the purely ceremonial title of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople in 1463. As &quot;primus Cardinalium&quot; (from April 1463) – the title Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals was not yet in use – Cardinal Bessarion presided over the Papal conclave, 1464 and Papal conclave, 1471.

He died on 18 November 1472 at Ravenna. He is buried in the basilica of the Santi Apostoli, Rome.

==Works==
Bessarion was one of the most learned scholars of his time. Besides his translations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot; and Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, his most important work is a treatise directed against George of Trebizond, a vehement Aristotelian who had written a polemic against Plato, which was entitled &quot;In Calumniatorem Platonis&quot; (&quot;Against the Slanderer of Plato&quot;). Bessarion, though a Platonist, was not so thoroughgoing in his admiration as Gemistus Pletho, and he strove instead to reconcile the two philosophies. His work, by opening up the relations of Platonism to the main questions of religion, contributed greatly to the extension of speculative thought in the department of theology.

It was thanks to him that the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, an important compendium of Greek mythology, has survived to the present. His library, which contained a very extensive collection of Greek manuscripts, was presented by him in 1468 to the Senate of the Republic of Venice, and forms the nucleus of the famous library of St Mark&#x27;s, the &quot;Biblioteca Marciana&quot;. It comprised 482 Greek and 264 Latin manuscripts. Most of Bessarion&#x27;s works are in Migne, &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, volume 161.

<text>The Rue de Rivoli (; English: &quot;Rivoli Street&quot;) is a street in central Paris, France. It is a commercial street whose shops include leading fashionable brands. It bears the name of Napoleon&#x27;s early victory against the Austrian army, at the Battle of Rivoli, fought on 14–15 January 1797. Developed by Napoleon through the heart of the city, it includes on one side the north wing of the Louvre Palace and the Tuileries Gardens.

==History==
The Rue de Rivoli is an example of a transitional compromise between an environment of prestigious monuments and aristocratic squares, and the results of modern town-planning by municipal authorities.

The new street that Napoleon developed through the heart of Paris includes on one side the north wing of the Louvre Palace, (which Napoleon extended) and the Tuileries Gardens. Upon completion, it was the first time that a wide, well designed and aesthetically pleasing street bound the north wing of the Louvre Palace. Napoleon&#x27;s original section of the street opened up eastward from the Place de la Concorde. Builders on the north side of the Place Louis XV, (as it then was named) between the Rue de Mondovi and Rue Saint-Florentin, had been constrained by letters patent in 1757 and 1758 to follow a single façade plan. The result was a pleasing uniformity, and Napoleon&#x27;s planners extended a similar program, which resulted in the arcades and facades that extend for almost a mile along the street.

The restored Bourbon King Charles X continued the Rue de Rivoli eastwards from the Louvre, as did King Louis-Philippe. Finally, Emperor Napoleon III extended it into the 17th-century quarter of Le Marais (see: Right Bank). Beneath the Rue de Rivoli runs one of the main brick-vaulted, oval-sectioned sewers of Paris&#x27; much-imitated system, with its sidewalks for the sewer workers.

In 1852, opposite the wing of the Louvre, Baron Haussmann enlarged the Place du Palais-Royal that is centred on the Baroque Palais Royal, built for Cardinal Richelieu in 1624 and willed to the royal family, with its garden surrounded by fashionable commercial arcades. At the rear of the garden is the older branch of the Bibliothèque Nationale, in the Rue Richelieu.

North of the Rue de Rivoli, at the point where the &quot;Grands Boulevards&quot; crossed an enormous new square, the new opera house was built. The Opera Garnier is a monument to the construction of the Second Empire. Just behind the opera house can be found the largest department stores, such as the Galeries Lafayette and Printemps.

East along the Rue de Rivoli, at the Place des Pyramides, is the gilded statue of Joan of Arc, situated close to where she was wounded at the Saint-Honoré Gate in her unsuccessful attack on English-held Paris, on September 8, 1429. A little further along, towards the Place de la Concorde, the Rue de Castiglione leads to the Place Vendôme, with its Vendôme Column surmounted by the effigy of Napoleon Bonaparte. He began the building of the street in 1802; it was completed in 1865. A plaque at no. 144 commemorates the assassination there of the Huguenot leader Admiral Gaspard II de Coligny, in the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of 1572.

<doc id="155904" wikidata="Q815679" url="?curid=155904" title="Supercar">
<text>A supercar, also known as an exotic car, is a type of automobile generally described at its most basic as a street-legal sports car with race track-like power, speed, and handling, plus a certain subjective &quot;cachet&quot; linked to pedigree, exclusivity, or both. The term &#x27;supercar&#x27; is frequently used for the extreme fringe of powerful, low-bodied mid-engine luxury sportscars. A low-profile car may have limited ground clearance, but a handling-favorable center of gravity and a smaller frontal area than a front engined car. These characteristics can reduce supercars&#x27; aerodynamic drag, enabling higher top speeds. Since the 2000s, the term hypercar has come into use for the highest-performance supercars.

Supercars often serve as the flagship model within a vehicle manufacturer&#x27;s sports car range and typically feature various performance-related technology derived from motorsports. Some examples include the Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Aventador, and McLaren 720S. 

Automotive journalism typically reserves the predicate &#x27;hypercar&#x27; for low (two- to low 4-figure) production-number cars, built over and above the marque&#x27;s typical product line-up and carrying 21st century sales prices often exceeding a million euros, dollars, or pounds. Examples include the Porsche&#x27;s Carrera GT, Ford GTs, and the Ferrari F40/F50/Enzo lineage. Only a few car makers, like Bugatti and Koenigsegg, only make hypercars.

In the United States, the term &quot;supercars&quot; was used already during the 1960s for the highest-performance muscle cars. As of 2024, &quot;supercars&quot; is still used in Australia to refer to Australian muscle cars.

==History==
=== Europe ===
The Lamborghini Miura, introduced in 1966 by the Italian manufacturer, is often said to be the first supercar. By the 1970s and 1980s, the term was in regular use for such a car, if not precisely defined. One interpretation up until the 1990s was to use it for mid-engine two-seat cars with at least eight cylinders (but typically a V12 engine), a power output of at least and a top speed of at least . Other interpretations state that &quot;it must be very fast, with sporting handling to match&quot;, &quot;it should be sleek and eye-catching&quot; and its price should be &quot;one in a rarefied atmosphere of its own&quot;; exclusivity – in terms of limited production volumes, such as those of the most elite models made by Ferrari or Lamborghini – is also an essential characteristic for some using the term. Some European manufacturers, such as McLaren, Pagani, and Koenigsegg, specialize in only producing supercars.

=== United States ===

During the 1960s, the highest-performance versions of American muscle cars were referred to as supercars. The description was sometimes spelled with a capital S. Its use reflected the intense competition for primacy in that market segment between U.S. manufacturers, retroactively characterized as the &quot;horsepower wars&quot;. Already by 1965 the May issue of the American magazine &quot;Car Life&quot; included multiple references to supercars and &quot;the supercar club&quot;, and a 1968 issue of &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine describes a &quot;Supercar street racer gang&quot; market segment. The &quot;S/C&quot; in the model name of the AMC S/C Rambler produced in 1969 as a street-legal racer is an abbreviation for &quot;SuperCar&quot;.

Since the decline of the muscle car in the 1970s, the word supercar has been more broadly internationalized, coming to mean an &quot;exotic&quot; car that has high performance; interpretations of the term span from limited-production models produced by small manufacturers for performance enthusiasts to (less frequently) standard production cars modified for exceptional performance.

The 1990s and 2000s saw a rise in American supercars with similar characteristics to their European counterparts. Some American &quot;Big Three&quot; (i.e. General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford, the historic leaders of America&#x27;s Detroit-based auto-industry) sports cars which have been referred to as supercars include contemporary Chevrolet Corvettes, the Dodge Viper, and the Ford GT. Supercars made by smaller American manufacturers include the Saleen S7, SSC Ultimate Aero, SSC Tuatara, Hennessey Venom GT, and Hennessey Venom F5.

=== Japan ===
During the early 1990s, Japan began to gain global recognition for making high-performance sports cars; the automotive media described the lightweight, mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive, V6 Honda NSX produced from 1990 through 2005 as Japan&#x27;s &quot;first&quot;. Matching contemporary European supercars in performance and features, the NSX was more reliable and user-friendly.

In the 21st century, other Japanese makers produced their supercars. From 2010 until 2012, Lexus marketed the Lexus LFA, a two-seat front-engine coupe powered by a V10 engine producing . The 2009–present Nissan GT-R has been described as a modern supercar that delivers everyday practicality. It features a twin-turbo V6 producing between , with all-wheel-drive and dual-clutch transmission.

The second generation Honda NSX made from 2016 until 2022 used all-wheel drive, a hybrid powertrain (producing up to ), turbocharging, and a dual-clutch transmission.

==Hypercar==
Another term for high-performance sportscars is &quot;hypercar&quot;, which is sometimes used to describe the highest-performing supercars. An extension of &quot;supercar&quot;, it too lacks a set definition. One offered by the automotive magazine, &quot;The Drive&quot;, is &quot;a limited-production, top-of-the-line supercar&quot;; prices can reach or exceed US$1 million, and already had by 2017.

Some observers consider the tubular framed, first-ever production fuel-injection, world&#x27;s fastest street-legal, 1954 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL &quot;Gullwing&quot; as the first hypercar; others the revolutionary, first-ever mid-engined 1967 Lamborghini Miura; others yet the 1993 McLaren F1 or 2005 Bugatti Veyron.

With a shift towards electrification, many new hypercars use a hybrid drivetrain, a trend started in 2013 with the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and LaFerrari, then continued in 2016 with the Koenigsegg Regera, in 2017 with the Mercedes-AMG One, and the McLaren Speedtail.

Modern hypercars such as Pininfarina Battista, NIO EP9, Rimac Nevera, and Lotus Evija have also gone full-electric.

Hypercars have also been used as a base for the Le Mans Hypercar class after rule changes came into effect from 2021.

<text>Johann Karl Emmanuel Schenk (1 December 1823 – 18 July 1895) was a Swiss pastor, politician, and member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1863 until his death in 1895. Serving for , he was the longest-serving member in the Federal Council. Later in life he became one of the first leaders of the Swiss Red Cross.

== Life and work ==
Schenk was born in 1823 in Bern, Switzerland, as the son of Christian Schenk. At the age of eleven, he became an orphan and lived in Korntal (Germany). From 1839 to 1842 he attended school in Bern and then studied theology. He completed his studies at the age of 22. In 1845 he became vicar and later pastor at Schüpfen. In 1848, he married Elise Kähr. The couple had nine children, two of which died at young age.

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 12 December 1863 and died in office 31 years later, on 18 July 1895. He was affiliated with the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland.

During his time in office he held the following departments:
*Department of Home Affairs (1864)
*Political Department (Foreign ministry) as President of the Confederation (1865)
*Department of Home Affairs (1866 - 1870)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1871)
*Department of Home Affairs (1872)
*Department of Finance (1872)
*Department of Home Affairs (1873)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1874)
*Department of Railway and Trade (1875 - 1877)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1878)
*Department of Home Affairs (1879 - 1884)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1885)
*Department of Home Affairs (1886 - 1895)
He was President of the Confederation six times in 1865, 1871, 1874, 1878, 1885 and 1893.

Schenk also served as President of the Swiss Red Cross from 1873–1882.

=== Death and legacy ===
Schenk died 1895 in Bern, and was buried at Bremgartenfriedhof.

The local museum of Langnau im Emmental &quot;Chüechlihus&quot; includes a section on him. &quot;Schenkstrasse&quot; in Bern is named after him. Further, the house at Spitalgasse 4 in the city of Bern is named &quot;Karl-Schenk-Haus&quot; and its passage &quot;Karl-Schenk-Haus-Passage&quot; or &quot;Karl-Schenk-Passage&quot;.

<doc id="155909" wikidata="Q609765" url="?curid=155909" title="Supermarionation">
<text>Supermarionation (a portmanteau of the words &quot;super&quot;, &quot;marionette&quot; and &quot;animation&quot;) is a style of television and film production employed by British company AP Films (later Century 21 Productions) in its puppet TV series and feature films of the 1960s. These productions were created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed at APF&#x27;s studios on the Slough Trading Estate. The characters were played by electronic marionettes with a moveable lower lip, which opened and closed in time with pre-recorded dialogue by means of a solenoid in the puppet&#x27;s head or chest. The productions were mostly science fiction with the puppetry supervised by Christine Glanville, art direction by either Bob Bell or Keith Wilson, and music composed by Barry Gray. They also made extensive use of scale model special effects, directed by Derek Meddings.

The term &quot;Supermarionation&quot; was first used during the production of &quot;Supercar&quot;, whose final 13 episodes were the first to be credited as being &quot;filmed in Supermarionation&quot;. Some sources consider its precursor, &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, to be the first Supermarionation series because it saw the introduction of the electronic lip-syncing mechanism that featured in all of APF&#x27;s later puppet productions.

The term was coined by Gerry Anderson, who regarded it as APF&#x27;s trademark. In later life, he said that he invented the term to increase the &quot;respectability&quot; of puppetry, a medium he had not originally intended to work with. According to Sylvia, the productions were described as &quot;Supermarionation&quot; to distinguish them from traditional puppet theatre. Noting that a major disadvantage of APF&#x27;s marionettes was their inability to walk convincingly, commentators have argued that the term expressed Gerry&#x27;s preference for artistic realism and his wish to make the company&#x27;s puppet techniques more lifelike.

==Definition==
The term was coined in 1960 by Gerry Anderson. Sources describe Supermarionation as a style of puppetry, a production technique or process, or a promotional term. Emma Thom of the National Science and Media Museum defines it as APF&#x27;s use of electronics to synchronise puppets&#x27; lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue. According to Jeff Evans, it &quot;express[es] the elaborate style of puppetry&quot; used in APF&#x27;s productions. Anderson denied that the term referred to a process, stating that he coined it as a promotional tool to separate APF&#x27;s output from other children&#x27;s puppet series like &quot;Muffin the Mule&quot; and &quot;Flower Pot Men&quot;. This was motivated by his embarrassment in working with puppets as opposed to live actors, and his wish to dispel the notion that APF&#x27;s marionettes were &quot;the sort of puppets that were used in pre-school programmes&quot;. He also likened Supermarionation to a &quot;trademark&quot;. According to Sylvia Anderson, the term was used to &quot;distinguish the pure puppetry of the stage from our more sophisticated filmed-television version&quot;. Lou Ceffer of the website Spy Hollywood calls Supermarionation a &quot;marketing term&quot;.

A 1960s supplement of the British trade newspaper &quot;Television Mail&quot; described Supermarionation as a &quot;technical process&quot; whose main features, besides electronic puppet control, were use of 35 mm colour photography, -scale filming stages, back projection, live-action inserts and live action-style special effects, and video assist to guide the crew. According to Chris Bentley, the term encompasses &quot;all of the sophisticated puppetry techniques&quot; used by APF – the foremost being the automatic mouth movement – &quot;combined with the full range of film production facilities normally employed in live-action filming&quot; (such as front and back projection, location shooting and visual effects). Other commentators have cited the complexity and detail of the puppets, models and sets as aspects of Supermarionation. Marcus Hearn states that the term reflected Gerry Anderson&#x27;s desire to &quot;promote his company&#x27;s collective ingenuity as a proprietary process&quot; and &quot;[ally] his productions with Hollywood photographic techniques such as CinemaScope and VistaVision.&quot; He adds that it &quot;encompassed the full panoply of APF&#x27;s expertise – production values in model-making, photography, special effects, editing and orchestral music that had never been so consistently applied to any type of children&#x27;s programme, let alone those featuring puppets.&quot;

==History==
===Development and use in Anderson productions===
Gerry Anderson&#x27;s first experience with puppet filming was in 1956, when Pentagon Films – a group of five filmmakers including Anderson and his friend Arthur Provis – was contracted to make a series of Noddy-themed TV advertisements for Kellogg&#x27;s breakfast cereal. Around this time, Pentagon also produced a 15-minute puppet film called &quot;Here Comes Kandy&quot;. These early efforts were noticed by children&#x27;s author Roberta Leigh, who had written a collection of scripts titled &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; and was looking for a film company to turn them into a puppet TV series. By this time, Anderson and Provis had left Pentagon to form their own company, Anderson Provis Films (AP Films or APF). They accepted the commission, disappointed not to be working with live actors but realising that they needed Leigh&#x27;s investment to stay in business. Before starting production, Anderson and Provis hired three staff: continuity supervisor Sylvia Thamm (former secretary at Pentagon and Anderson&#x27;s future wife), art director Reg Hill and camera operator John Read. All three would later be made co-directors of the new company and play a significant role in the development of its productions.

The puppets of &quot;Twizzle&quot; had papier-mâché heads with painted eyes and mouths and were each controlled using a single carpet thread. Speech was indicated by nodding the heads. Somewhat embarrassed to be making a children&#x27;s puppet series, Anderson and Provis decided to produce &quot;Twizzle&quot; in the style of a feature film, incorporating dynamic shooting and lighting in the hope that the results would bring them bigger-budget commissions with live actors. To add to this more sophisticated look, the series often used three-dimensional sets instead of traditional flat backgrounds, while puppeteers Christine Glanville and her team operated the marionettes not from the studio floor, but from a bridge above it.

Following the completion of &quot;Twizzle&quot;, APF was unsuccessful in securing new clients, so accepted another puppet commission from Leigh: &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot;. This series used puppets with wooden bodies and heads of &quot;plastic wood&quot; (a mixture of cork dust, glue and methylated spirit). The heads incorporated moveable eyeballs and a hinged jaw that was opened and closed with a string. In practice, jaw movement was difficult to control due to the bobbing of the puppets&#x27; heads. By now all puppet sets were three-dimensional. They had also become more detailed, being made mostly of cardboard with fibreglass props.

After &quot;Torchy&quot;, APF severed ties with Leigh and produced its first independent series, &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, using funding from Granada. The puppets now had hollow fibreglass shells for heads and tungsten steel wires instead of strings. Meanwhile, the hinged jaw gave way to an electronic lip-sync mechanism. Designed by Hill and Read, this was powered by a solenoid, mounted in the head and fed electric current by two of the wires. Lip-syncing was a key step in the development of Supermarionation, and &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; is regarded by some sources as the first Supermarionation production. The mechanism made it easier for the puppeteers to operate the marionettes in time with their dialogue as it was no longer necessary to learn the characters&#x27; lines. According to Anderson, as exaggerated movements were no longer needed, the puppets were finally able to speak &quot;without their heads lolling about a like a broken toy.&quot; By now the puppeteers&#x27; movements were guided using a basic form of video assist: a TV camera mounted directly behind the film camera, which relayed footage to the various monitors around the studio.

The term &quot;Supermarionation&quot; was coined during the production of &quot;Supercar&quot;, APF&#x27;s first series to be made for Lew Grade&#x27;s distribution company ITC Entertainment. Its final 13 episodes were the first to be credited as being &quot;filmed in Supermarionation&quot;.

====&quot;Supercar&quot;  to &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;====
The puppets and puppet sets of Supermarionation were built in scale, the former being roughly tall. Each marionette was suspended and controlled with several fine tungsten steel wires that were between and of an inch () thick, replacing the carpet thread and twine strings that had been used prior to &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;. To make the wires non-reflective, initially they were painted black; however, this made them thicker and more noticeable, so manufacturers Ormiston Wire devised a method of chemically darkening them to keep them as thin as possible. During filming, the wires often needed to be further concealed using &quot;antiflare&quot; spray (grease mist) or various colours of paint to blend in with the sets and backgrounds. Balancing the weight was crucial: puppets that were too light would be difficult to control; too heavy and their wires would not bear the load. Inserts of real human hands, arms and legs were used to show complex actions that the puppets could not perform, such as operating machinery. In a 1965 interview, Reg Hill estimated that the Supermarionation productions contained &quot;three or four times&quot; as much cutting as live-action features because the puppets&#x27; lack of facial expression made it impossible to sustain the viewer&#x27;s interest &quot;for more than a few seconds&quot; per shot.

The puppets&#x27; distinguishing features were their hollow fibreglass heads and the solenoids that powered the automatic mouth movements. Character dialogue was recorded on two tapes. One of these would be played during filming, both to guide the puppeteers and provide a basis for the soundtrack; the other would be converted into a series of electrical signals. When activated by the signals, the solenoid in the head caused the puppet&#x27;s lower lip to open and close with each syllable.

The heads of regular characters were entirely fibreglass; proto-heads were sculpted in clay or Plasticine and then encased in rubber (or silicone rubber) to create moulds, to which fibreglass resin was applied to create the finished shells. Guest characters were played by puppets called &quot;revamps&quot;, whose faces were Plasticine sculpted on featureless fibreglass heads. This allowed the revamps to be re-modelled from one episode to the next and play a wider range of characters. Many regulars were modelled on contemporary Hollywood actors. The puppets&#x27; eyes were moved by radio control.

The placement of the solenoid dictated the puppets&#x27; body proportions. Head-mounted solenoids made the heads oversized compared to the rest of the body; the latter could not be scaled up to match as this would have made the puppets too bulky to operate effectively, and would have required all the set elements to be enlarged. According to commentator David Garland, the disproportion was influenced partly by &quot;aesthetic considerations ... the theory being that the head carried the puppet&#x27;s personality&quot;. It resulted in many puppets developing caricatured appearances, though Anderson stated that this was not intentional.

====&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;  onwards====
Between &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, the development of miniaturised electronic components prompted APF – now called Century 21 Productions – to create a new type of puppet. The option to downsize the components in the head was rejected in favour of moving the entire lip-sync mechanism to the chest, where it was connected to the mouth by a cable that ran through the neck. This made it possible to shrink the heads and make the puppets of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; and later series in natural proportions. Around this time, Century 21 also tried to make the puppets&#x27; faces more lifelike by crafting them in a new, flexible material, but the results proved unsatisfactory and the idea was abandoned. As the reduced head size made it harder to sculpt faces in Plasticine, guest characters were now played by a group of permanent, all-fibreglass puppets that were made to the same standards of workmanship as the regular characters. Likened to a &quot;repertory company&quot;, these puppets could be superficially altered from one appearance to the next – for example, by adding or removing facial hair.

In a 2002 interview, Anderson said that during the production of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; he was hoping to move into live-action television and that he endorsed the new puppets as a compromise for his inability to use live actors. In 2006, he recalled that Century 21 had been &quot;typecast&quot; for its puppetry: &quot;[S]o, knowing it was the only thing I could get finance for, I desperately wanted to make the thing look as close to live action as possible. And I think it was that that drove me on to bring in all the improvements and techniques.&quot; Thom believes that the re-design reflected Anderson&#x27;s desire for greater &quot;realism and spectacle&quot;.

Not all of Anderson&#x27;s colleagues welcomed the change. Puppet sculptor and operator John Blundall pejoratively referred to the new puppets as &quot;little humans&quot; that lacked the personality of their precursors, also stating that the increased emphasis on realism hampered the puppeteers&#x27; creativeness. Fellow sculptor Terry Curtis believed that the re-design took away the puppets&#x27; &quot;charm&quot;. According to director Desmond Saunders, APF was trying &quot;anything to get [the puppets] to look like ordinary human beings. But they are not ordinary human beings! ... I often wonder it if would have been better to make them &quot;more&quot; like puppets, not less like puppets.&quot; A drawback of the smaller heads was that they upset the weight distribution; this made the puppets harder to control, to a point where they would often have to be fixed to G-clamps to be kept steady. In addition, problems achieving realistic depth of field made it considerably harder to film close-up shots.

====Problem of puppet movement====
A major limitation of the marionettes was their inability to walk convincingly. This was due to their low weight and the fact that the legs of each puppet were controlled by only two strings, which made complex articulation impossible. According to Sylvia Anderson, the re-design exacerbated the puppets&#x27; core deficiencies: &quot;The more realistic our puppets became, the more problems we had with them ... It was just possible to get away with the awkward moments in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; because the proportions of the characters were still caricature. It was later when we had developed a more realistic approach ... that the still imperfect walk was [all] the more obvious.&quot; To limit the need for leg movement, many scenes featuring walks were filmed from the waist up, with motion implied by a puppeteer holding the legs out of shot and bobbing the marionette up and down while pushing it forward. Other scenes showed puppets standing, sitting or driving vehicles. Tex Tucker, the hero of &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, avoids walking by riding a horse called Rocky, while the characters of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; achieve the same through use of personal hovercraft. &quot;Supercar&quot; and &quot;Stingray&quot;″s focus on their eponymous car and submarine, as well as &quot;Stingray&quot;″s depiction of Commander Shore as a paralytic reliant on a futuristic &quot;hoverchair&quot;, are examples of other devices used to overcome the puppets&#x27; lack of mobility.

In a 1977 interview, Gerry Anderson said that the steps taken to make the puppets more lifelike were an attempt to &quot;make the [puppet] medium respectable&quot;. On the preparations for &quot;Supercar&quot;, APF&#x27;s first science-fiction production, he remembered &quot;[thinking] that if we set the story in the future, there would be moving walkways and the puppets would be riding around in the car for much of the time, so it would be much easier to make them convincing.&quot; According to interviewer Kevin O&#x27;Neill, this use of future settings for greater realism &quot;almost accidentally&quot; ensured that all of APF&#x27;s subsequent series would be science fiction. In 2006, Anderson stated that the transition to this genre &quot;wasn&#x27;t a conscious move at all&quot;, but rather a natural progression given the basic deficiencies of the puppets. Sylvia said that the reasons were budgetary, due to the fact that APF could not yet afford to work with live actors: &quot;... we were picking subjects that we could easily do in miniature scale.&quot;

David Garland calls character movement Anderson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and states that the puppets&#x27; limited mobility resulted in &quot;vehicle-heavy science fiction&quot; becoming his &quot;preferred genre&quot;. He considers the use of marionettes – the kind of puppet &quot;perhaps most unsuited&quot; to an action format – to be &quot;one of the most striking paradoxes&quot; of the Anderson productions. Carolyn Percy of the &quot;Wales Arts Review&quot; comments that the inclusion of &quot;futuristic vehicles&quot; like &quot;Supercar&quot; allowed APF to devise &quot;more exciting and imaginative scenarios&quot; and &quot;work around the limitations of the puppets ... to give their &#x27;acting&#x27; the integrity to match the material.&quot;

The final Supermarionation series, &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, used footage of live actors to such an extent that the result according to Stephen La Rivière was &quot;half-way between live action and Supermarionation&quot;. Its protagonist, Stanley Unwin, was modelled on the comedian of the same name, who both voiced the puppet character and served as its human body double in long shots and other scenes where the puppet was impractical to use. According to Anderson, this was another way of avoiding the problem of lack of mobility: &quot;I came up with the idea of getting Stanley Unwin to do all the walking shots, and driving shots in this Model Ford T [the character] had. If, for example, you had a sequence where Stanley Unwin would arrive at a building in his Model T, he would ... get out, walk down the path, and as soon as he opened the door, you&#x27;d cut to the reverse angle and that would be the &quot;puppet&quot; of Stanley Unwin ... I used Stanley Unwin, married to his own puppet, to enable him to do all the things that the puppet couldn&#x27;t do.&quot;

====Special effects====
Special effects were created with miniature models and sets in a range of scales. A wide variety of materials were used in their construction – for example, rock faces were made from painted blocks of polystyrene, while miniature vehicles incorporated recycled household objects and parts from toy model kits. The lighting used for effects shooting was five times as strong as that normally used on a live-action production. Effects were typically shot at high speed (72 to 120 frames per second) with the footage slowed down in post-production to give a sense of greater weight or steadiness, thus making the sequences look more realistic. High-speed filming was essential for shots on water in order to make the small ripples inside the filming tank look like ocean waves. As sets were built to scale, it was often hard to maintain a realistic sense of depth.

Underwater sequences were filmed not in water, but on dry sets with a thin aquarium between the set and the camera to distort the lighting. Bubble jets and small fish were added to the aquarium to create forced perspective. Beginning with &quot;Stingray&quot;, shots of aircraft in flight were filmed using a technique called the &quot;rolling sky&quot;, which was devised by effects director Derek Meddings to allow filming of dynamic shots in confined space. It involved painting the sky background on a canvas, which was then wrapped around a pair of electrically driven rollers, and creating an impression of movement by running the canvas around the rollers in a continuous loop as opposed to moving the miniature aircraft itself. &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; saw the introduction of the &quot;rolling road&quot;, an adaptation of the technique whereby foreground, middleground and background elements of road sequences were created as separate rolls of looped canvas and spun at varying speeds.

In the pursuit of realism, newly built models and sets were deliberately &quot;dirtied down&quot; with paint, oil, pencil lead and other substances to give them a used or weathered look. Jetex propellant pellets were fitted to the undersides of miniature ground vehicles to emit jets of gas resembling dust trails. Over time, the effects used for puppet gunfights became more elaborate: whereas gunshot effects in &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; were created by simply painting marks on the film negative (which showed up as white flashes on the finished print), for later series the puppets&#x27; miniature prop guns were fitted with small charges that were fired using a car battery.

====List of Anderson Supermarionation productions====
The Andersons&#x27; puppet work also included &quot;The Investigator&quot; (1973), a pilot for an unmade Supermarionation series. This featured both marionettes and live actors but did not include the term &quot;Supermarionation&quot; in the credits.

==Critical response==
Noting that Gerry Anderson would have preferred to make live-action productions instead of puppet series, Percy argues that his style of filming was developed to &quot;make the puppet film as &#x27;respectable&#x27; as possible&quot;. She also comments that APF&#x27;s filming techniques &quot;would not only result in a level of quality and sophistication not seen before in a family show, but also give birth to some of the most iconic series in the history of British children&#x27;s television.&quot;

Garland describes the underlying theme of Anderson&#x27;s work as a &quot;self-reflexive obsession with an aesthetic of realism (or more accurately a surface realism often associated with naturalism) borne of an unfulfilled desire to make live-action films for adults&quot;, further commenting that Anderson&#x27;s typecasting as a puppet TV creator &quot;led him on a lifelong quest to perfect a simulation of reality&quot;. He notes that Anderson&#x27;s involvement with puppets began at a time when Western puppet theatre &quot;had become increasingly marginalised to a niche, to an association with children&#x27;s entertainment&quot;, and that APF&#x27;s productions used an &quot;aesthetic of incremental realism&quot; to appeal to children and adults alike (a target audience that the Andersons referred to as &quot;kidult&quot;). Garland suggests that this drive towards increased realism echoed &quot;19th-century marionette theatre&#x27;s own attempts to distinguish itself from other forms of puppetry (especially glove puppets), which also involved a tethering to the newly-emergent realist aesthetic across the arts&quot;.

==Successor techniques==
In 1983, Gerry Anderson returned to puppetry with his independent science-fiction TV series &quot;Terrahawks&quot;. The characters of this series were made as rubber hand puppets, operated from the studio floor in a process called &quot;Supermacromation&quot;. This was similar to the techniques employed by American puppeteer Jim Henson.

In 2004, Anderson created a &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; remake titled &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;, which was produced using computer-generated imagery (CGI) and motion-capture techniques. Motion capture was used heavily for action sequences as it provided more convincing character movement. As a nod to Supermarionation, the series was credited as being &quot;created in Hypermarionation&quot;. According to Anderson, Hypermarionation was not simply animation, but a &quot;photo-real&quot; production method combining CGI, high-definition picture and surround sound. Garland suggests that through Hypermarionation, Anderson sought to achieve a &quot;hyperreal simulation of his live-action film utopia&quot;.

In 2014, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to fund a remake of the anime series &quot;Firestorm&quot;, to be produced using a technique called &quot;Ultramarionation&quot;.

==Revival==
In the 2010s, Stephen La Rivière and his production company Century 21 Films began a revival of Supermarionation. Their productions are listed below.

Century 21 Films also worked on &quot;Apollo&quot;, a 2019 episode of &quot;Endeavour&quot; that is set partly in a TV studio which is making a puppet series called &quot;Moon Rangers&quot;. The episode features story-within-a-story marionette sequences that were written and filmed as a tribute to Supermarionation.

==Non-Anderson productions using similar techniques==
The puppet series &quot;Space Patrol&quot;, created by Roberta Leigh and Arthur Provis and filmed by Leigh&#x27;s company National Interest Picture Productions, used marionettes similar to those of APF&#x27;s early series (including the use of automatic mouth movement). However, they were made in natural body proportions.

The Japanese series &quot;Aerial City 008&quot; (1969) and &quot;X-Bomber&quot; (1980) also featured Supermarionation-style puppets, with the latter of the two referring to its filming style as &#x27;Supermariorama&#x27; in reference to Supermarionation. In South Africa, similar techniques were used to make &quot;Interster&quot; (1982–86). The American puppet series &quot;Super Adventure Team&quot; (1998) was created in imitation of Supermarionation but with more adult themes and suggestive situations.

&quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, a 2004 puppet film by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, was inspired by &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and has been described as an imitation or spoof of Supermarionation productions. Stone and Parker dubbed their filming process &quot;Supercrappymation&quot; (or &quot;Supercrappynation&quot;) as the wires were deliberately left visible.

A &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode, &quot;200&quot; (2006), features a self-parody in which the characters are played by Supermarionation-style puppets.

<doc id="155910" wikidata="Q76727" url="?curid=155910" title="Ernst Jünger">
<text>Ernst Jünger (; 29 March 1895 – 17 February 1998) was a German author, highly decorated soldier, philosopher, and entomologist who became publicly known for his World War I memoir &quot;Storm of Steel&quot;.

The son of a successful businessman and chemist, Jünger rebelled against an affluent upbringing and sought adventure in the &quot;Wandervogel&quot; German youth movement, before running away to briefly serve in the French Foreign Legion, which was an illegal act in Germany. However, he escaped prosecution due to his father&#x27;s efforts and was able to enlist in the German Army on the outbreak of World War I in 1914. During an ill-fated offensive in 1918 Jünger was badly wounded and was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, a rare decoration for one of his rank. Since new awards of the military class ceased with the end of the Prussian monarchy in November 1918, Jünger, who died in 1998, was the last living recipient of the military class award.

He wrote against liberal values, democracy, and the Weimar Republic, but rejected the advances of the Nazis who were rising to power. During World War II Jünger served as an army captain in occupied Paris, but by 1943 he had turned decisively against Nazi totalitarianism, a change manifested in his work &quot;Der Friede&quot; (&quot;The Peace&quot;). Jünger was dismissed from the army in 1944 after he was indirectly implicated with fellow officers who had plotted to assassinate Hitler. A few months later, his son died in combat in Italy after having been sentenced to a penal battalion for political reasons.

After the war, Jünger was treated with some suspicion as a possible fellow traveller of the Nazis. By the later stages of the Cold War, his unorthodox writings about the impact of materialism in modern society were widely seen as conservative rather than radical nationalist, and his philosophical works came to be highly regarded in mainstream German circles. Jünger ended life as an honoured literary figure, although critics continued to charge him with the glorification of war as a transcendental experience in some of his early works. He was an ardent militarist and one of the most complex and contradictory figures in 20th-century German literature.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Ernst Jünger was born in Heidelberg as the eldest of six children of the chemical engineer and of Karoline Lampl (1873–1950). Two of his siblings died as infants. His father acquired some wealth in potash mining. He went to school in Hannover from 1901 to 1905, and during 1905 to 1907 to boarding schools in Hanover and Brunswick. He rejoined his family in 1907, in Rehburg, and went to school in Wunstorf with his siblings from 1907 to 1912. During this time, he developed his passion for adventure novels and for entomology.
He spent some time as an exchange student in Buironfosse, Saint-Quentin, France, in September 1909.
With his younger brother Friedrich Georg Jünger (1898–1977) he joined the &quot;Wandervogel&quot; movement in 1911. His first poem was published with the &quot;Gaublatt für Hannoverland&quot; in November 1911. By this time, Jünger had a reputation as a budding bohemian poet.

In 1913, Jünger was a student at the Hamelin gymnasium. In November, he travelled to Verdun and enlisted in the French Foreign Legion for a five-year term, but with the intention of getting to North Africa. Stationed in a training camp at Sidi Bel Abbès, Algeria, he deserted and travelled to Morocco, but was captured and returned to camp. Six weeks later, he was dismissed from the Legion due to the intervention of the German Foreign Office, and escaped prosecution. On the return journey he was told by his father that the cost of representations to the authorities had amounted to a vast sum. Jünger was sent to a boarding school in Hanover, where fellow pupils included future communist leader Werner Scholem (1895–1940).

===World War I===

On 1 August 1914, shortly after the start of World War I, Jünger enlisted as a &quot;one year volunteer&quot; and joined the 73rd Hannoverian Fusilier Regiment of the 19th Division, and, after training, was transported to the Champagne front in December. He was wounded for the first time in April 1915. While on convalescent leave he took up a position his father arranged for him to become an officer aspirant (&quot;Fahnenjunker&quot;). Jünger was commissioned a Leutnant (2nd Lieutenant) on 27 November 1915. As platoon leader, he gained a reputation for his combat exploits and initiative in offensive patrolling and reconnaissance.
During the Battle of the Somme near the obliterated remains of the village of Guillemont his platoon took up a front line position in a defile that had been shelled until it consisted of little more than a dip strewn with the rotting corpses of predecessors. He wrote:
The platoon was relieved but Jünger was wounded by shrapnel in the rest area of Combles and hospitalized; his platoon reoccupied the position on the eve of the Battle of Guillemont and was obliterated in a British offensive. He was wounded for the third time in November 1916, and awarded the Iron Cross First Class in January 1917.

In the spring of 1917, he was promoted to Hauptmann, commanding 7th company and stationed at Cambrai. Transferred to Langemarck in July, Jünger&#x27;s actions against the advancing British included forcing retreating soldiers to join his resistance line at gunpoint. He arranged the evacuation of his brother Friedrich Georg, who had been wounded. In the Battle of Cambrai (1917) Jünger sustained two wounds, by a bullet passing through his helmet at the back of the head, and another by a shell fragment on the forehead.

He was awarded the House Order of Hohenzollern. While advancing to take up positions just before Ludendorff&#x27;s Operation Michael on 19 March 1918, Jünger was forced to call a halt after the guides lost their way, and while bunched together half of his company were lost to a direct hit from artillery. Jünger himself survived, and led the survivors as part of a successful advance but was wounded twice towards the end of the action, being shot in the chest and less seriously across the head. After convalescing, he returned to his regiment in June, sharing a widespread feeling that the tide had now turned against Germany and victory was impossible.

On 25 August, he was wounded for the seventh and final time near Favreuil, being shot through the lung while leading his company in an advance that was quickly overwhelmed by a British counter-attack. Becoming aware the position where he was lying wounded was about to fall to advancing British forces, Jünger rose and as he did his lung drained of fluids through the wound in his chest, allowing him to recover enough to escape. He made his way to a machine-gun post that was holding out, where a doctor told him to lie down immediately. Carried to the rear in a tarpaulin, he and the bearers came under fire and the doctor was killed. A soldier who tried to carry Jünger on his shoulders was killed after only making it a few yards, but another soldier was able to do so.

Jünger received the Wound Badge 1st Class. While he was treated in a Hannover hospital, on 22 September he received notice of being awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; on the recommendation of division commander Johannes von Busse. &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, the highest military decoration of the German Empire, was awarded some 700 times during the war, but almost exclusively to high-ranking officers (and seventy times to combat pilots). Jünger was one of only eleven infantry company leaders who received the order.

Throughout the war, Jünger kept a diary, which became the basis of his 1920 &quot;Storm of Steel&quot;. He spent his free time reading the works of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Ariosto and Kubin, besides entomological journals he was sent from home. During 1917, he was collecting beetles in the trenches and while on patrol, 149 specimens between 2 January and 27 July, which he listed under the title of &quot;Fauna coleopterologica douchyensis&quot; (&quot;Coleopterological fauna of the Douchy region&quot;).

===Interwar period===
Jünger served as a lieutenant in the army of the Weimar Republic until his demobilisation in 1923. He studied marine biology, zoology, botany, and philosophy, and became a well-known entomologist. In Germany, an important entomological prize is named after him: the &quot;Ernst-Jünger-Preis für Entomologie&quot;. His war experiences described in &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; (German title: &quot;In Stahlgewittern&quot;), which Jünger self-published in 1920, gradually made him famous. He married in 1925. They had two children, Ernst Jr. (1926–44) and Alexander (1934–93).

He criticized the fragile and unstable democracy of the Weimar Republic, stating that he &quot;hated democracy like the plague.&quot; More explicitly than in &quot;Storm of Steel&quot;, he portrayed war as a mystical experience that revealed the nature of existence. According to Jünger, the essence of the modern was found in total mobilisation for military effectiveness, which tested the capacity of the human senses. In 1932, he published &quot;The Worker&quot; (German title: &quot;Der Arbeiter&quot;), which called for the creation of an activist society run by warrior-worker-scholars. In the essay &quot;On Pain&quot;, written and published in 1934, Jünger rejects the liberal values of liberty, security, ease, and comfort, and seeks instead the measure of man in the capacity to withstand pain and sacrifice. Around this time his writing included the aphorism &quot;What doesn&#x27;t kill me makes me stronger; and what kills me makes me incredibly strong.&quot;

===Third Reich===
As a famous war hero and prominent nationalist critic of the Weimar Republic, the ascendant Nazi Party (NSDAP) courted Jünger as a natural ally, but Jünger rejected such advances. When Jünger moved to Berlin in 1927, he rejected an offer of a seat in the Reichstag for the NSDAP. In 1930, he openly denounced Hitler&#x27;s suppression of the Rural People&#x27;s Movement. 
In the 22 October 1932 edition of &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (the official Nazi newspaper), the article &quot;Das endlose dialektische Gespräch&quot; (&quot;the never-ending dialectical debate&quot;) attacked Jünger for his rejection of the &quot;blood and soil&quot; doctrine, accusing him of being an &quot;intellectualist&quot; and a liberal. Jünger again refused a seat offered to him in the Reichstag following the Nazi Party&#x27;s ascension to power in January 1933, and he refused the invitation to head the German Academy of Literature (&quot;Die deutsche Akademie der Dichtung&quot;).

On 14 June 1934, Jünger wrote a &quot;letter of rejection&quot; to the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, in which he requested that none of his writings be published in it. Jünger also refused to speak on Joseph Goebbels&#x27;s radio. He was one of the few &quot;nationalist&quot; authors whose names were never found on the frequent declarations of loyalty to Hitler. He and his brother Friedrich Georg quit the &quot;Traditionsverein der 73er&quot; (veteran&#x27;s organization of the Hanoverian regiment they had served during World War I) when its Jewish members were expelled.

When Jünger left Berlin in 1933, his house was searched several times by the Gestapo. &quot;On the Marble Cliffs&quot; (1939, German title: &quot;Auf den Marmorklippen&quot;), a short novel in the form of a parable, uses metaphor to describe Jünger&#x27;s negative perceptions of the situation in Hitler&#x27;s Germany.

He served in World War II as an army captain. On the Western Front in 1939, he rescued a wounded soldier and was again awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. Assigned to an administrative position as intelligence officer and mail censor in Paris, he socialized (often at the Georges V hotel or at Maxim&#x27;s) with prominent artists of the day such as Picasso and Jean Cocteau. He also went to the salons of Marie-Louise Bousquet and Florence Gould. There he met Jean Paulhan, Henry de Montherlant, Marcel Jouhandeau and Louis-Ferdinand Céline. Jünger also met the latter at the German Institute on 7 December 1941. He noted in his Parisian diary (&quot;&quot;) that Céline on that occasion &quot;spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldiers were not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews&quot;. He passed on information about upcoming transports &quot;at an acceptable level of risk&quot; which saved Jewish lives. His office was in the Hotel Majestic and he was billeted at the Hotel Raphael.

Jünger found his countrymen&#x27;s discriminatory treatment of French Jews unacceptable. In his Parisian diaries, the writer wrote on 7 June 1942 that he had encountered for the first time the yellow star carried by three little girls who were passing by in the Rue Royale, and that he considered that day as fundamental in his personal history, because he said he was ashamed at that moment of wearing a German officer&#x27;s uniform.

His early time in France is described in his aforementioned diary &quot;Strahlungen&quot; (Radiations), which includes (Gardens and Streets) and &quot;Das erste Pariser Tagebuch&quot; (The First Parisian Diary). He was also given the task of executing a German deserter who had beaten the women sheltering him and been turned in. Jünger considered avoiding the assignment but eventually attended to oversee the execution in, as he claimed in his journal, &quot;the spirit of higher curiosity&quot;.

Jünger appears on the fringes of the Stauffenberg bomb plot. He was clearly an inspiration to anti-Nazi conservatives in the German Army, and while in Paris he was close to the old, mostly Prussian, officers who carried out the assassination attempt against Hitler. On 6 June 1944 Jünger went to Rommel&#x27;s headquarters at La Roche-Guyon, arriving late at about 9 PM as the bridge at Mantes was down. Present were Rommel&#x27;s chief-of-staff Hans Speidel, General Wagener, Colonel Linstow, Embassy Counsellor , reporter Major and Speidel&#x27;s brother-in-law Max Horst (Rommel was in Germany). At 9.30 PM they went to Speidel&#x27;s quarters to discuss &quot;Der Friede&quot; (The Peace), Jünger&#x27;s 30-page peace proposal (written in 1943), to be given to the Allies after Hitler&#x27;s demise or removal from power; also proposed is a united Europe. He returned about midnight. The next day at the Paris HQ Jünger was stunned by the news of the Normandy landings.

Jünger was only peripherally involved in the events, however, and in the aftermath suffered only dismissal from the army in August 1944 rather than execution. He was saved by the chaos of the last months of the war, and by always being &quot;inordinately careful&quot;, burning writings on sensitive matters from 1933. One source (Friedrich Hielscher) claimed that Hitler said &quot;Nothing happens to Jünger&quot;.

His elder son Ernst Jr., then an eighteen-year-old naval (Kriegsmarine) cadet, was imprisoned that year for engaging in &quot;subversive discussions&quot; in his Wilhelmshaven Naval Academy (a capital offence). Transferred to Penal Unit 999 as &quot;Frontbewährung&quot;, i.e. probation trough frontline service, after his parents had spoken to the presiding judge Admiral Ernst Scheurlen, he was killed near Carrara in occupied Italy on 29 November 1944 (though Jünger was never sure whether he had been shot by the enemy or by the SS).

===Post-war period===
After the war, Jünger was initially under some suspicion for his nationalist past, and he was banned from publishing in Germany for four years by the British occupying forces because he refused to submit to the denazification procedures. His work &quot;The Peace&quot; (German title: &quot;Der Friede&quot;), written in 1943 and published abroad in 1948, marked the end of his involvement in politics. When German Communists threatened his safety in 1945, Bertolt Brecht instructed them to &quot;Leave Jünger alone.&quot; 
His public image rehabilitated by the 1950s, he went on to be regarded as a towering figure of West German literature.

West German publisher Klett put out a ten-volume collected works (&quot;Werke&quot;) in 1965, extended to 18 volumes 1978–1983.
This made Jünger one of just four German authors to see two subsequent editions of their collected works published during their lifetime, alongside Goethe, Klopstock and Wieland.

His diaries from 1939 to 1949 were published under the title &quot;Strahlungen&quot; (1948, &quot;Reflections&quot;). In the 1950s and 1960s, Jünger travelled extensively. His first wife, Gretha, died in 1960, and in 1962 he married . He continued writing prodigiously for his entire life, publishing more than 50 books.

Martin Heidegger was heavily influenced by Jünger&#x27;s &quot;The Worker&quot; although he did not regard Jünger as a philosopher. Heidegger&#x27;s interpretation of Jünger&#x27;s work is compiled in volume 90 of his complete edition, titled &quot;Zu Ernst Jünger&quot;.

Jünger was among the forerunners of magical realism. His vision in &quot;The Glass Bees&quot; (1957, German title: &quot;Gläserne Bienen&quot;), of a future in which an automated machine-driven world threatens individualism, could be seen as a story within the science fiction genre. A sensitive poet with training in botany and zoology, as well as a soldier, his works in general are infused with tremendous details of the natural world.

Throughout his life he had experimented with drugs such as ether, cocaine, and hashish; and later in life he used mescaline and LSD. These experiments were recorded comprehensively in &quot;Annäherungen&quot; (1970, &quot;Approaches&quot;). The novel &quot;Besuch auf Godenholm&quot; (1952, &quot;Visit to Godenholm&quot;) is clearly influenced by his early experiments with mescaline and LSD. 
He met with LSD discoverer Albert Hofmann and they took LSD together several times. Hofmann&#x27;s memoir &quot;LSD, My Problem Child&quot; describes some of these meetings.

===Later life===
One of the most important contributions of Jünger&#x27;s later literary production is the metahistoric figure of the &quot;Anarch&quot;, an ideal figure of a sovereign individual, conceived in his novel &quot;Eumeswil&quot; (1977), which evolved from his earlier conception of the &quot;Waldgänger&quot;, or &quot;Forest Fleer&quot;
by influence of Max Stirner&#x27;s conception of the Unique (&quot;der Einzige&quot;).

In 1981, Jünger was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.
Jünger was immensely popular in France, where at one time 48 of his translated books were in print. In 1984, he spoke at the Verdun memorial, alongside his admirers, French president François Mitterrand and the German chancellor, where he called the &quot;ideology of war&quot; in Germany before and after World War I &quot;a calamitous mistake&quot;. In France he remains a near idol of the identitarian and Europeanist far-right (in the works of philosopher Alain de Benoist).

Although he had been cleared of the accusation of Nazi collaboration since the 1950s, Jünger&#x27;s national conservatism and his ongoing role as conservative philosopher and icon made him a controversial figure, and Huyssen (1993) argued that nevertheless &quot;his conservative literature made Nazism highly attractive&quot;, and that &quot;the ontology of war depicted in &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; could be interpreted as a model for a new, hierarchically ordered society beyond democracy, beyond the security of bourgeois society and ennui&quot;. Walter Benjamin wrote &quot;Theories of German Fascism&quot; (1930) as a review of &quot;War and Warrior&quot;, a collection of essays edited by Jünger. 
Despite the ongoing political criticism of his work, Jünger said he never regretted anything he wrote, nor would he ever take it back.

His younger son Alexander, a physician, committed suicide in 1993. Jünger&#x27;s 100th birthday on 29 March 1995 was met with praise from many quarters, including the socialist French president François Mitterrand.

===Death===
Jünger came from a mixed Christian Protestant, agnostic family and did not profess any particular denominational belief, but shortly before he died he converted to Roman Catholicism. A year before his death, Jünger was received into the Catholic Church and began to receive the Sacraments. Jünger died on 17 February 1998 in Riedlingen, Upper Swabia, aged 102. He was the last living bearer of the military version of the order Pour le Mérite. Jünger&#x27;s last home in Wilflingen, Jünger-Haus Wilflingen, is now a museum.

==Photography==
Ernst Jünger&#x27;s photobooks are visual accompaniments to his writings on technology and modernity. The seven books of photography Jünger published between 1928 and 1934 are representative of the most militaristic and radically right wing period in his writing. Jünger&#x27;s first photobooks, &quot;Die Unvergessenen&quot; (The Unforgotten, 1929) and &quot;Der Kampf um das Reich&quot; (The Battle for the Reich, 1929) are collections of photographs of fallen World War I soldiers and the World War front, many that he took himself. He also contributed six essays on the relationship between war and photography in a photobook of war images called &quot;Das Antlitz des Weltkrieges: Fronterlebnisse deutscher Soldaten&quot; (The Face of the World War: Front Experiences of German Soldiers, 1930) and edited a volume of photographs dealing with the first world war, &quot;Hier spricht der Feind: Kriegserlebnisse unserer Gegner&quot; (The Voice of the Enemy: War Experiences of our Adversaries, 1931). Jünger also edited a collection of essays, &quot;Krieg und Krieger&quot; (War and Warriors, 1930, 1933) and wrote the foreword for a photo anthology of airplanes and flying called &quot;Luftfahrt ist Not!&quot; (Flying is imperative! [i.e., a necessity], 1928).

<doc id="155921" wikidata="Q1430511" url="?curid=155921" title="Time After Time (1979 film)">
<text>Time After Time is a 1979 American science fiction film written and directed by Nicholas Meyer and starring Malcolm McDowell, David Warner, and Mary Steenburgen. Filmed in Panavision, it was the directing debut of Meyer, whose screenplay is based on the premise from Karl Alexander&#x27;s novel &quot;Time After Time&quot; (which was unfinished at the time) and a story by Alexander and Steve Hayes. The film presents a story in which British author H. G. Wells uses his time machine to pursue Jack the Ripper into the 20th century.

==Plot==
In 1893 London, popular writer H. G. Wells displays a time machine to his skeptical dinner guests and explains how it works, including having a &quot;non-return key&quot; that keeps the machine at the traveler&#x27;s destination and a &quot;vaporizing equalizer&quot; that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms. Police constables suddenly arrive, searching for Jack the Ripper. A bag with blood-stained gloves belonging to Wells&#x27;s friend John Leslie Stevenson, a surgeon, leads them to conclude that Stevenson may be the killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone.

Stevenson escapes to the future, though without the &quot;non-return&quot; key, causing the machine to automatically reappear in 1893. Wells then pursues Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine is now on display at a museum in San Francisco. Wells finds the future deeply shocking, having expected an enlightened socialist utopia. Instead, he sees chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a history of global war, crime and bloodshed.

At a bank, Wells exchanges some British bank notes for present-day American currency. Hungry, he enters a McDonald&#x27;s and is alternately puzzled and pleased with modern dining options. Reasoning that Stevenson also needs to exchange British money, Wells visits various banks searching for him. At the Chartered Bank of London, he meets employee Amy Robbins, who directed Stevenson to the Hyatt Regency hotel. Smitten with Wells, she gives him her card, saying he should “give her a ring”.

Upon being confronted by Wells, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society pleasingly violent, stating: &quot;Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Today, I&#x27;m an amateur.&quot; Wells demands he return to 1893 to face justice, but Stevenson instead attempts to wrestle the non-return key from him. Their struggle is interrupted by a maid and Stevenson flees, getting hit by a car during the frantic chase. Wells follows him to the hospital emergency room and is told that Stevenson is dead but is not allowed to view the body.

Wells meets up with Amy again and she initiates a romance. Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money. Suspecting that Amy led Wells to him, he frightens her into giving Wells a message and later discovers where she lives. To convince a highly skeptical Amy that he is telling the truth, Wells takes her three days into the future. She is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the &quot;San Francisco Ripper&#x27;s&quot; fifth victim.

Wells persuades her that they must go back to prevent the fourth victim&#x27;s murder, then prevent Amy&#x27;s. Upon returning, they are delayed and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Wells is arrested due to his knowledge about the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless against Stevenson.

While Wells unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amy&#x27;s peril, she attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally investigate her apartment, they find a woman&#x27;s dismembered body. Believing him innocent, the police release a now-heartbroken Wells. Stevenson actually killed Amy&#x27;s co-worker, who was the dead body in Amy&#x27;s apartment. He contacts Wells to state that he has taken Amy hostage and demands the non-return key.

Stevenson flees with the key – and Amy as insurance – intending a permanent escape in the time machine. Wells erratically drives Amy&#x27;s car and follows them to the museum. While Wells bargains for Amy&#x27;s life, she escapes. As Stevenson starts up the time machine, Wells removes the &quot;vaporizing equalizer&quot;, causing Stevenson to vanish while the machine remains in the present. Stevenson has been sent traveling endlessly through time.

Wells proclaims he must return to his own time and destroy a machine that is too dangerous for primitive mankind. Amy pleads with him to take her along, saying she has no remaining ties in the 20th century. The film finishes with the caption: &quot;H.G. Wells married Amy Catherine Robbins, who died in 1927. As a writer, he anticipated socialism, global war, space travel and women&#x27;s liberation. He died in 1946.&quot;

==Cast==
* Malcolm McDowell as Herbert George Wells
* David Warner as John Leslie Stevenson/Jack the Ripper
* Mary Steenburgen as Amy Robbins
* Charles Cioffi as Police Lt. Mitchell
* Kent Williams as assistant
* Patti D&#x27;Arbanville as Shirley
* Joseph Maher as Adams

==Production==
According to Meyer from the commentary track for the DVD and Blu-ray release of the film, the author of the novel presented Meyer with 55 pages of his unpublished novel and asked Meyer to critique his work. Meyer liked the premise and immediately optioned the story so he could write a screenplay based on the material and develop the story his own way.

McDowell was attracted to the material because he was looking for something different from the sex and violence in &quot;Caligula&quot;, in which he played the title character.

While preparing to portray Wells, McDowell obtained a copy of a 78 rpm recording of Wells speaking. McDowell was &quot;absolutely horrified&quot; to hear that Wells spoke in a high-pitched, squeaky voice with a pronounced Southeast London accent, which McDowell felt would have resulted in unintentional humor if he tried to mimic it for the film. McDowell abandoned any attempt to recreate Wells&#x27;s authentic speaking style and preferred a more &quot;dignified&quot; style.

According to David Warner, the studio wanted Mick Jagger for the role of John Leslie Stevenson but director Nicholas Meyer and producer Herb Jaffe fought for Warner to get the role.

It was one of the last films scored by veteran composer Miklós Rózsa, who received the 1979 Saturn Award for Best Music.

&quot;Time After Time&quot; was filmed throughout San Francisco, including Cow Hollow, North Beach, the Hyatt Regency hotel, Westin Bonaventure Hotel, California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park, the Marina District, Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, the Richmond District, the Golden Gate Bridge, Grace Cathedral on Nob Hill, the Embarcadero Center, Chinatown, the Marina Green, the Palace of Fine Arts, Potrero Hill, John McLaren Park, and the Civic Center.

==Release==
The film premiered with a gala presentation at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 1979.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Time After Time&quot; received a positive response from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 32 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;With the three principal actors clearly having fun with their roles, &quot;Time After Time&quot; becomes an amusing, light-hearted fantasy lark.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;a delightful, entertaining trifle of a film that shows both the possibilities and limitations of taking liberties with literature and history. Nicholas Meyer has deftly juxtaposed Victorian England and contemporary America in a clever story, irresistible due to the competence of its cast&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; similarly lauded, &quot;&quot;Time After Time&quot; is every bit as magical as the trick around which it revolves&quot;. She continued:

The interior scenes set in London borrow heavily from the 1960 film &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, which was based on the 1895 H.G. Wells novella of the same name. Commentators also noticed parallels between &quot;Time After Time&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; in which Mary Steenburgen appeared. She said:

Actually, I&#x27;ve played the same scene in that film (&quot;Time After Time&quot;) and in (&quot;BTTF&quot;) &quot;Part III&quot;... I&#x27;ve had a man from a different time period tell me that he&#x27;s in love with me, but he has to go back to his own time. My response in both cases is, of course, disbelief, and I order them out of my life. Afterwards, I find out I was wrong and that, in fact, the man is indeed from another time, and I go after him (them) to profess my love. It&#x27;s a pretty strange feeling to find yourself doing the same scene, so many years apart, for the second time in your career.

The casting of Steenburgen for &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; appears to be deliberately intended to mirror the earlier role. In &quot;Time After Time&quot;, the woman lives in the 20th century and the time traveler is from the 19th. In &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, the woman inhabits the 19th century and the time traveler is from the 20th. In both films, the woman eventually goes back with the time traveler to live in his own time period.

Some similar time travel incongruities as well as the modern San Francisco urban setting also appeared in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, for which Nicholas Meyer shared writing credit. The details of time travelers from distant eras obtaining and exchanging present day American currency were similar in both films. In &quot;Star Trek IV&quot;, a featured female character, Dr. Gillian Taylor, ends up joining her paramour, Captain James T. Kirk, living in the future, similar to the conclusion of &quot;Time After Time&quot;.

===Accolades===
Nicholas Meyer won the Saturn Award for Best Writing, Mary Steenburgen won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, and Miklós Rózsa won the Saturn Award for Best Music. Saturn Award nominations went to Meyer for Best Director, Malcolm McDowell for Best Actor, David Warner for Supporting Actor, and Sal Anthony and Yvonne Kubis for Best Costumes, and the film was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film.

Nicholas Meyer won the Antenne II Award and the Grand Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival and he was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

<text>The Jerky Boys were an American comedy act from Queens, New York City, New York, whose routine consisted of prank telephone calls and other related skits. The duo was founded in 1989 by childhood friends Johnny Brennan and Kamal Ahmed. After Ahmed left the act in 2000, the Jerky Boys continued on as a solo act featuring only Brennan, before going on a 19-year hiatus after the 2001 release of the franchise&#x27;s penultimate album, &quot;The Jerky Tapes&quot;. Brennan released a follow-up album of new material in November 2020.

The phone calls were made by calling unsuspecting recipients, or in response to classified advertisements placed in local New York–based newspapers. Each call was made in character, usually with over-the-top voices influenced by the duo&#x27;s family members. Many compilations of the group&#x27;s work have been released onto albums. According to the act&#x27;s current record label, Laugh.com, the Jerky Boys have sold over 8,000,000 albums since their 1993 debut.

Brennan began making and recording prank telephone calls in the 1970s, and teamed up with Ahmed, in the late 1980s/early 1990s in their Queens neighborhood. The duo made a number of bootleg tapes of their recorded phone calls that eventually were obtained by New York–based radio personality Howard Stern, who played the duo&#x27;s tracks on the air.

The English rock band Radiohead named their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993), after a Jerky Boys sketch in which the caller poses as the victim&#x27;s mother and says: &quot;Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida.&quot; A sample of the sketch appears in the song &quot;How Do You&quot;. The Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, said: &quot;The notion of phoning up people cold is so nineties. It&#x27;s just the ultimate sacrilege – turn up in someone&#x27;s life and they can&#x27;t do anything about it.&quot;

The Jerky Boys gained notoriety from their exposure on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, and released their first album, &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot;, in 1993. The album topped the Billboard Heatseekers chart and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The duo released the platinum &quot;The Jerky Boys 2&quot; in 1994, followed by &quot;The Jerky Boys 3&quot; in 1996, &quot;The Jerky Boys 4&quot; in 1997, &quot;Stop Staring at Me!&quot; in 1999, and &quot;The Jerky Tapes&quot; in 2001.

In 1995, the duo starred in Touchstone Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot;. The movie was filmed in 1993–94, and it was almost universally panned by critics. Kamal became an independent filmmaker in 1997.

===Solo act===
In 2000, tension between the two developed. The duo appeared in the Psychopathic Records film &quot;Big Money Hustlas&quot;, but because Brennan and Ahmed were unable to get along with each other, they did not share any scenes in the film; Brennan played a supporting role as the police chief, and Ahmed appeared in a cameo as Frank Kissel, an audience member at the strip club. By the end of the year, Ahmed passed a note down to the manager, who passed it to Brennan: Ahmed had decided to quit the group.

Ahmed released a solo album, &quot;Once a Jerk, Always a Jerk&quot;, in 2000.

On March 20, 2007, Brennan, who is now the only constant member of the group, kept the Jerky Boys name and released a solo album, &quot;Sol&#x27;s Rusty Trombone&quot;, a collection of mostly ring tones and skits. On March 5, 2010, Brennan, in conjunction with Inner Four, released two apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch platform: The Jerky Boys Prank Caller, and The Jerky Boys Pinball. In late 2011, Brennan started a weekly podcast titled &quot;The Jerky Boys Show with Johnny Brennan&quot; in which he discussed the history of the calls, how the characters came about, and other hijinks. The podcast also gave the opportunity to fans to speak to Brennan directly. The podcast ran for 17 episodes and then abruptly ended in November 2012. Brennan announced a subscription for new calls being regularly released each month but this never occurred.

He recorded new prank calls for a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; retrospective in 2014.

==Regular characters==
*Frank Rizzo – an extremely abrasive, foul-mouthed blue-collar Italian-American New Yorker with bizarre complaints and requests (voiced by Johnny Brennan). Frank curses repeatedly at a potential employer during an inquiry about a job, and accuses the Mickey Mouse character at Disney World of being sexually inappropriate with his children.
*Sol Rosenberg – a frail, insecure, New York Jew who suffers from various, and often comical problems and ailments. Somewhat childish in his demeanor, Sol seeks treatment for problems ranging from genital warts to a fear of his own shadow (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Tarbash, the Egyptian Magician – a Middle Eastern man with a repertoire of dangerous stage tricks who mutilates himself or is attacked by various wild animals used in his act. His last appearance in the Jerky Boys albums was in &quot;The Jerky Tapes&quot; (voiced by Kamal).
*Ali Kamal – a Middle Eastern cab driver victimized by a sadistic dentist. Assaulted and possibly molested, Ali seeks the aid of a lawyer specializing in &quot;dental malpractice.&quot; On another occasion, Kamal seeks the assistance of an attorney after being brutally beaten by a tenant for delivering pizza to an incorrect address (voiced by Kamal).
*Jack Tor s – a flamboyantly homosexual man who frequently takes part in bizarre sexual activities and is looking for assistance or supplies related to this. Also a musician, catwalk model, casting director and a dancer (voiced by Johnny Brennan). In a running gag, when asked to spell his surname, the character would reply: &quot;T-o-r... ... ... s&quot;.
*Frank Kissel – an aged World War II veteran and ex-singer who uses a wheelchair. The character normally refers to himself only as Kissel. He sometimes complains about or is heard arguing with his wife. Kamal, who voices the character, appeared in full old-man makeup as Kissel in the Insane Clown Posse movie &quot;Big Money Hustlas&quot;.
*Jocko Johnson – voice and behavior similar to Frank Rizzo; wanted his wife&#x27;s house demolished while she was out of town, as punishment for her infidelity. (&quot;The Home Wrecker&quot; track from &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot; album) (voiced by Kamal).
*Curly G., Cradle Rock – a throwback rap artist trying to catch a break; appeared on one track to date (&quot;Bamm!&quot; from &quot;The Jerky Boys 3&quot; album) (voiced by Kamal Ahmed).

Other minor characters include:
*Big Ole Badass Bob The Cattle Rustler – an American Westerner/Texan who drives a semi-truck; has appeared on &quot;Lawnmower Sale&quot; and &quot;Bad Ass Massage&quot;, both from &quot;The Jerky Boys 3&quot; album, &quot;Flower Lady #4&quot; from &quot;The Jerky Tapes&quot; album, and is a featured character on &quot;Sol&#x27;s Rusty Trombone&quot; (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Sammy Cox – older man with a pronounced lisp; appeared on one track to date (&quot;Herman&quot; from &quot;The Jerky Boys 4&quot; album) (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Mike Derucki – an out-of-work painter (voiced by Brennan). Has appeared on several tracks including &quot;Hello Ray&quot; and &quot;Dead Pet Removal&quot;.
*Harry Getzov – A name from the &quot;Flower Lady&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Matinee&quot; tracks from &quot;The Jerky Tapes&quot; album. The character is perennially away from the telephone, and unable to be reached by the unsuspecting caller who is pranked by either Jack Tors (Brennan), Tarbash (Kamal), or Big Ole Badass Bob The Cattle Rustler (Johnny Brennan). In the Jerky Boys CDs, Getzov is credited as the Jerky Boys manager.
*Jake – handles in-coming calls for Mr. Silverman, the phony sports agent (&quot;Silverman baby&quot; track from (The Jerky Tapes) and &quot;Big Hock&quot; track from the &quot;Stop Staring at Me!&quot; album) (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Jake – a truck driver with a penchant for speed and stunts from the track &quot;Hot Rod Mover&quot; (from &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot; album) (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Anthony Kissel – Frank Kissel&#x27;s son; appeared on two tracks to date (&quot;Uncle Freddie&quot; from &quot;The Jerky Boys&#x27;&quot; album, and &quot;Laundromat&quot; from &quot;The Jerky Boys 4&quot; album). Anthony is also mentioned in &quot;Husband Beating&quot; (from &quot;The Jerky Boys 2&quot; album), where Kissel said &quot;I got a couple children, they&#x27;re a little older right now&quot;, but he did not mention his real name (voiced by Brennan).
*Martha Kissel – Frank Kissel&#x27;s wife; often appears with Kissel. Her voice can be heard in calls such as &quot;Uncle Freddie&quot;, &quot;Husband Beating&quot; and &quot;Kissel Sails&quot;. On &quot;Uncle Freddie&quot; (from &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot; album), Kissel reveals his wife&#x27;s name before he begins arguing with the person who answered the phone about whether Uncle Freddie had died (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Nikos – an immigrant Greek delicatessen owner; appeared on one track to date. Nikos often mumbles incoherently, interspersing a few real Greek words within all his gibberish (&quot;Bad Tomatoes&quot; from &quot;The Jerky Boys 3&quot; album) (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Pico – an abused Mexican immigrant; often hired as Kissel&#x27;s personal assistant, which invariably has disastrous consequences. When Kissel hires Pico to repair a broken television, the pair end up getting electrocuted. (voiced by Johnny Brennan)
*Paul Rizzo – a car salesman in upstate New York who uses violent techniques to close sales, including choking and threatening customers. Paul appears on only the &quot;Car Salesman&quot; track (from &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot; album), and is voiced by Johnny Brennan. The character&#x27;s demeanor and voice are identical to those of Frank Rizzo. The name &quot;Paul&quot; is a result of Brennan mistakenly answering his name as &quot;Paul&quot; instead of Frank when he was trying to remember that he was speaking to someone named Paul.
*Rosine – a flamboyant, flirtatious, Puerto Rican transvestite who plays the flute and aspires to learn sign language. Rosine has a variety of bizarre interests and enjoys slapping herself for sexual gratification. (voiced by Johnny Brennan)
*Silverman – a phony sports agent who convinces an unsuspecting young man that he can earn a job playing baseball for the New York Yankees. (&quot;Silverman Baby!!&quot; track from &quot;The Jerky Tapes&quot; album) (voiced by Johnny Brennan).
*Brett Weir – name of Johnny Brennan&#x27;s brother-in-law, mentioned in &quot;Super Across The Way&quot; (from &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot; album) and &quot;The Gay Model&quot;. A character with the same name, portrayed by actor James Lorinz, also appeared in 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited Paul Feig, Amy Schumer and Seth MacFarlane as examples of comedy influenced by the Jerky Boys.

*In &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;, near the end of the movie, after the Indian chief cuts the rope holding Parker as he is being hanged, Frenchy cries out, &quot;Hey! You can&#x27;t do that, jerky!&quot;, in reference to the Jerky Boys, because Trey Parker and the others loved the Jerky Boys (before they saw their movie).
*The Jerky Boys were sometimes referenced on &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as one of the only albums the character George Michael owns. On a couple of occasions he is seen placing prank calls in an attempt to imitate them.
*Brennan appears on &quot;Family Guy&quot; as recurring character Mort Goldman, using his Sol Rosenberg voice. Goldman also shares many characteristics with Rosenberg. 
*In 2008, comedian Peter Kay included a version of the Free Nelson Mandela song by the Jerky Boys in his parody show Peter Kay&#x27;s Britain&#x27;s Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice for Channel 4 in the UK. It was part of a medley and mixed the last two syllables of Mandela into the Rihanna hit Umbrella.
*The Jerky Boys are referenced in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Duel Citizenship&quot; and again in &quot;False Positive,&quot; when Lily mistakenly plays a track to her unborn child instead of classical music.
*The Jerky Boys are referenced in the &quot;Fresh off the Boat&quot; episode &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Separated&quot; when Nicole offers the CD&#x27;s that originally belonged to her ex-boyfriend.
*The title of English alternative rock band Radiohead&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, is a reference to a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says, &quot;Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!&quot; to his victim. This snippet is sampled by the band on the track &quot;How Do You?&quot;.
*The title of English shoegaze band Slowdive&#x27;s second album, &quot;Souvlaki&quot;, is a reference to a Jerky Boys skit in which the prank caller tells a Greek hotel manager &quot;My wife loves that Greek shit. She&#x27;ll suck your cock like souvlaki.&quot;
*The 1998 single &quot;Dog in the Piano&quot; by British electronic musician Indian Ropeman samples dialogue from the skit &quot;Piano Tuner&quot;.

<doc id="155929" wikidata="Q2265992" url="?curid=155929" title="Bradley Stoke">
<text>Bradley Stoke is a town and civil parish in South Gloucestershire, England, situated north-northeast of Bristol city centre. The town is the northernmost part of the Bristol built-up area.

Planned in the 1970s, building works began in 1987. Bradley Stoke was Europe&#x27;s largest new town built with private investment. It is named after two local streams, the Bradley Brook and Stoke Brook.

Bradley Stoke is part of the North Fringe of Bristol, an extensive area of housing and employment developed during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It is bordered by Patchway to the west and Stoke Gifford to the south, but unlike these neighbours, Bradley Stoke has fewer major employers and is primarily a residential suburb, being 40% detached housing. The M5 and M4 motorways form its northern and eastern boundaries, beyond which is the Avon Green Belt.

==History==
The area that is now Bradley Stoke was once farmland north of the village of Stoke Gifford near Bristol city. The land was divided amongst the civil parishes of Stoke Gifford, Almondsbury, Patchway and Winterbourne. The area consisted of a number of farms, Bailey&#x27;s Court and Watch Elm Farm in the south, Bowsland Farm and Manor Farm in the north and Webb&#x27;s Farm in the middle. Some of the lands were used as pasture. A number of woods also existed, Sherbourne&#x27;s Brake, Webb&#x27;s Wood and the large Savage&#x27;s Wood have all been preserved. Fiddlers Wood, the name of which lives on in Fiddlers Wood Lane was all but obliterated by the M4 motorway. Baileys Court Farmhouse is the only original building that still remains and was used as offices by the town&#x27;s developers before becoming the Bailey&#x27;s Court Inn. Watch Elm Farm was named after the Watch Elm, an elm of a legendary size that blew down in the mid 18th century. The Stoke Brook flows through the middle of Bradley Stoke.

During its development, the new settlement faced some problems in the wake of a national recession. At the time, Bradley Stoke was reputed to be one of Europe&#x27;s largest private housing developments and did struggle to develop at first to establish itself as an identifiable town unlike other earlier new towns which were supported by a New Town Development Corporation, as the settlement relied principally on private investment within a restricted statutory framework of the local authority Northavon District Council within the Avon County Council area. A combination of private housebuilders led the development and with only limited input from commercial businesses and the consequent recession resulted in the new town gaining a reputation for being a soulless housing estate with only limited facilities and no town centre, with the exception of a Tesco supermarket. High-interest rates during the early 1990s soon led to the collapse of the property market in the area with many new homes falling into negative equity. This led to the branding of the new town as &#x27;Sadly Broke&#x27; until property values and the development market began to recover. Since 1987, the residents of the area were demanding the establishment of a separate Town Council to coordinate the community&#x27;s civic life and in 1991 formation of the Town Council was in principle approved. On the 1st of April 1992, the newly elected Town Council took charge.

==Governance==
Bradley Stoke has a local town council, is part of the South Gloucestershire unitary authority, and is in the West of England Combined Authority (WECA) region.

On South Gloucestershire Council, the town is represented by seven Councillors elected from three electoral wards, namely Bradley Stoke North, Bradley Stoke South and Stoke Gifford (Stoke Brook).

Bradley Stoke is part of the Filton and Bradley Stoke parliamentary constituency.

Historically, the area was part of Gloucestershire County. From 1974 until 1996, Bradley Stoke was part of the Northavon district of Avon county.

===Town Council===
Bradley Stoke has a Town Council made up of 15 Councillors elected from five wards. The Town Council is chaired by the Town Mayor and assisted by a Deputy Mayor, with four standing committees for Finance, Planning and Environment, Leisure, Youth and Amenities, and Staffing.

==Facilities==
Many of the facilities in the town were to be funded by the housing developers from housing sales, via &#x27;Section 106&#x27; planning agreements. When house building and sales slowed for a time in the late 80s, there was a significant slowdown in facility completion. This included the late provision of the road joining the north and south sides of the town, and also the completion of the doctors&#x27; surgery.

The new town centre &#x27;Willow Brook&#x27; was named by an anonymous resident as part of a competition run by Bradley Stoke Town Council in partnership with Tesco. The centre is situated on the original Tesco supermarket site, and the redevelopment was approved by South Gloucestershire Council on 13 November 2006.

===Council===
The Bradley Stoke Town Council operates three activity centres located at The Bradley Stoke Jubilee Centre on Savages Wood Road, Baileys Court Activity Centre on Baileys Court Road and Brook Way Activity Centre on Brook Way. Each activity centre offers rooms and facilities to hire, and the provision of sports activities such as bowls, football pitches and hardball courts.

===Housing===
There are over 9000 residential homes in the Bradley Stoke area. 1,600 properties or nearly 18% of properties are registered for social housing.

=== Bradley Stoke North ===
To the north of the town (often referred to as Bradley Stoke North—because building in the town was originally in two locations, north and south, eventually working towards the centre: for many years the two sites were separated by an expanse of green fields) there are a number of other facilities on Pear Tree Road.

=== Bradley Stoke Leisure Centre and library ===
The Active leisure centre near the town centre provides access to a 25m swimming pool and a public library. Additional services at the leisure centre include a gym, beauty salon, Soho Coffee and a skate park. The leisure centre and library are host to many in house and local activity groups.

In 2018, as part of renovations reducing the size of the sports hall, a small climbing centre was installed.

The Soho coffee shop was established in June 2013 and was renovated in 2017.

=== Bradley Stoke South ===
The south of Bradley Stoke (referred to as Bradley Stoke South) has a number of facilities in Bailey&#x27;s Court.

===Employment===
Employment opportunities are found along Great Stoke Way to the south, Woodlands Business Park and Almondsbury Business Park to the north, and at the Aztec West development. The town is served by the nearby Bristol Parkway railway station in Stoke Gifford and is a short distance from the Ministry of Defence, the Aviva Centre and the Abbeywood Retail Park. Situated in the surrounding business parks are companies including RAC, Paragon, DHL, Greencore, Pukka Herbs, EE, GE Capital, HSS Hire, Zuken Technology Centre, and various hotels, production factories, courier services, warehouses and offices.

The further developments of the Willow Brook Centre and the addition of larger high street chains have increased the number of jobs available for local residents as well as boosted trade within Bradley Stoke. Businesses continue to be interested in the further development of the town centre, such as the planning application to build drive-through commercial units adjacent to Bradley Stoke Way.

Bradley Stoke attracts custom through passing trade from those exiting and joining the motorways and commuting, however since the expansion of the Willow Brook Centre both business owners and potential employees are attracted to the area. Despite the available employment opportunities, many residents commute from Bradley Stoke to central Bristol, The Mall in Cribbs Causeway or via the nearby motorway junction for work.

== Education ==

The town has seven primary schools:

* Saint Marys Catholic Primary School
* Bailey&#x27;s Court Primary School
* Wheatfield Primary School
* Meadowbrook Primary School
* Holy Trinity Primary School
* Bowsland Green Primary School
* Bradley Stoke Community Primary School

The town has a comprehensive secondary school, Bradley Stoke Community School, which opened in September 2005 with capacity for 1,120 students. A post-16 centre at the school was completed in Summer 2010, and a primary school extension was completed in 2015.

== Transport ==

Bradley Stoke is served by Bristol Parkway railway station to the south and Patchway railway station to the west, both operated by Great Western Railway.

Bus services are operated by First West of England and Stagecoach West offering transport links to Aztec West, Thornbury, Cribbs Causeway, Bristol Parkway railway Station, Bristol city centre and the University of the West of England, Bristol. A new MetroBus service was introduced by Bristol Community Transport under contract by FirstGroup.

Bradley Stoke borders the M5 to the north, the M4 to the east and the M32 to the south. Main transport routes are via Aztec West and via the Stoke Gifford bypass to the south.

==Community==
The Bradley Stoke Community Festival has been running since 2004 and is held over a weekend in June. The festival hosts a variety of activities and events primarily aimed at young children and families involving live music, performances, sports and games.

A Bradley Stoke Community Carnival event took place in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The carnival hosted stilt walkers, a brass band, performers dressed in costumes, competitions and prizes and live music.

Similarly to the Bradley Stoke Community Festival, Wheatfest is an annual event hosted by a local group Friends of Wheatfield Primary School. The event on the grounds of Wheatfield Primary School is primarily aimed at young children and families. The 2019 event raised over £6000.

The Willow Brook Centre provides a summer beach in the town centre. Primarily aimed at young children and families, the Centre features a 38-tonne sandpit, dozens of deck chairs, and suspended decorations.

The Town Council operates an annual fireworks display in early November to celebrate Guy Fawkes Night, in 2018 raising over £2000 in support of West of England MS Therapy Centre and the Stroke Association.

Since 2016, the Willow Brook Centre has hosted the annual Stars of the Stokes Awards to recognise the local heroes in our community featuring special guest celebrities. Awards are issued to a champion carer, a parent in a million, coach of the year, high achievement, a young person of the year and teacher of the year.

Each year the town is adorned with lights to celebrate Christmas. Along with an annual Christmas tree and decorations in the town centre, courtesy of the Willow Brook Centre, one property in Elm Close raises funds each year for St Peters Hospice by decorating their home in 30,000 lights. In 2018, over £3000 was raised.

===Remembrance Service and War Memorial===
A War Memorial was created in 2014 by the 1st Bradley Stoke Scout group and the Willow Brook Centre. It is located in the main town square and is a generic memorial dedicated to “all members of our Armed Forces (and civilians who support them) who have died or suffered due to conflict.” It is a simple grey granite pillar with a poppy design at the top and an inscription in the middle (as voted for by nearly 250 local residents) – &#x27;At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them&#x27;. There is a Scout Memorial badge (the scout arrowhead surrounded by olive branches and the inscription &#x27;Lest we forget&#x27;) at the base of the pillar. The memorial was designed and crafted by local Master Mason Alwyn Leek from Bristol and West Memorials. It was created because the town of Bradley Stoke is relatively new (major construction began only in the 1980s) and therefore had no traditional memorial. The aim was to create a focal point to hold Remembrance ceremonies for future generations with special involvement from the young people of the town. On 2 August 2014, this memorial was officially dedicated by Dame Janet Trotter, DBE, Lord Lieutenant for Gloucestershire. The dedication ceremony was also a commemoration of the Centenary of the First World War and it was attended by members of the 1st Bradley Stoke Scout Group, Royal British Legion, St John&#x27;s Ambulance Cadets, 1st Bradley Stoke Rainbows, 2nd Patchway Scout Group and Police Cadets. A parade marched from the Jubilee Centre to the town square at the Willow Brook Centre, led by the band of the City of Bristol Pipes and Drums. At the end of the ceremony, the young people present were invited to help light the 100 candles around the memorial to mark the Centenary. The central candle was the official Royal British Legion candle for their &#x27;Lights Out&#x27; campaign. The inaugural Bradley Stoke Remembrance Sunday Ceremony was held on the 9 November 2014, attended by many local uniformed youth groups and approximately 300 members of the public.

Since the creation of the war memorial, an annual Remembrance parade and ceremony is held at the Willowbrook Centre, attended by the Town Mayor, 1st Bradley Stoke Scouts, Trident Explorer Unit, 1st Little Stoke Scout Group, 1st Stokeway Rainbows, 1st Bradley Stoke Rainbows, Brownies and Guides, 2nd Bradley Stoke Brownies, 2nd Stoke Lodge Brownies, a representative from the town council, and the local church vicar.

==Woodland==
The Woodland area of Bradley Stoke is named Three Brooks Local Nature Reserve, an area of approximately that includes bluebell woods, rough grassland, brooks, ponds, and the man-made Three Brooks Lake. The lake, part of the Frome Valley Relief Sewer, is home to many common species of waterfowl including nesting swans. There are also a number of other walks and paths surrounded by small wooded areas connecting various parts of Bradley Stoke. Wild fruit can be found throughout the woodland, namely blackberries, apples, plums and cherries. A community orchard grows in the heart of the woodland.

The local Stokes Art Group (SAG) and the Three Brooks Nature Conservation Group (TBNCG) teamed up for an art project to personify the God of Three Brooks Nature Reserve. The God was named Trolletheus, named after two rusted supermarket trolleys dredged from the man-made lake.

Regular woodland walks and foraging groups are conducted in the local woodland hosted by the Three Brooks Conservation Group. In May 2019, the Three Brooks Nature Conservation Group were awarded a grant of £25,000 from Enovert Community Trust to improve accessibility to the woodland through renovations to walkways.

The club joined the Bristol and District Cricket Association (B&amp;D) in 1991, played its first game in 1992, won the Tony Hitch T/20 Trophy in 2019, and was promoted to the West of England Premier League in 2021.

<doc id="155935" wikidata="Q1138185" url="?curid=155935" title="L7 (band)">
<text>L7 is an American punk rock band founded in Los Angeles, California, first active from 1985 to 2001 and re-formed in 2014. Their longest standing lineup consists of Suzi Gardner (guitars, vocals), Donita Sparks (vocals, guitars), Jennifer Finch (bass, vocals), and Dee Plakas (drums, vocals). L7 has released seven studio albums and has toured widely in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, and South America. &quot;Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot; was heavily played on US alternative radio and entered the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart in 1992.

Due to their sound and image, L7 is often associated with the grunge movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and as an all-female band, L7 has, at times, been linked to riot grrrl; although they preceded and are outliers of both the grunge and riot grrrl movements. L7 has been supportive of political causes, and formed Rock for Choice in 1991. A documentary film about the band, &quot;L7: Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot;, premiered in 2016.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1985–1989)===
L7 was formed by Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner in 1985. Both artists were active in the Art punk community of Echo Park and had met in 1984 through mutual contacts at the cultural hub of the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;. Of their meeting and on hearing Gardner play a tape of her songs in progress, Sparks described it as &quot;one of the happiest days of my life&quot; with a clear synchronicity in the music they were each interested in creating. At the time, Gardner was also active as a poet. A year prior, Gardner had performed backing vocals on the college radio hit &quot;Slip It In&quot; by Black Flag. Gardner and Sparks began performing regularly in Los Angeles at punk and metal venues along with a revolving list of supporting musicians in the early years.

The punk rock duo brought Jennifer Finch on board as bass guitarist and Roy Koutsky on drums. Finch, with the strongest Californian roots of the four, connected the band with an even wider network, including Brett Gurewitz of Epitaph Records where the band recorded their first demo. Their eponymous debut album, described as &quot;intense, energetic&quot; and &quot;fast straightforward punk music&quot; was released by Epitaph Records in 1987. L7 reported challenges in the early years with finding a suitable, stable drummer. Shortly after the release of &quot;L7&quot;, Koutsky quit the band and was replaced by Anne Anderson. Anderson&#x27;s only studio appearance with L7 was on the SST Records compilation &quot;The Melting Pot&quot; in 1988 (via a cover of the Ohio Express track &quot;Yummy Yummy&quot;). Subsequently, Anderson left at the end of the touring cycle for the &quot;L7&quot; record, and Demetra &quot;Dee&quot; Plakas was recruited by the band in late 1989 which completed the band&#x27;s first stabilized lineup as an all-female band.

===Time with Sub Pop (1989–1991)===
The band released (“Shove”/“Packin’ a Rod”) in 1989 as the Sub Pop Single of the Month. L7 reportedly spent a short time in Seattle in the early 1990s. L7&#x27;s next album, &quot;Smell the Magic&quot;, was released in 1990 on Sub Pop and earned a four star review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; who stated &quot;With Donita Sparks&#x27; and Suzi Gardner&#x27;s twin lockstep guitars racing down the highway to hell, &quot;Smell the Magic&quot; was one of Sub Pop&#x27;s finest hours.&quot; L7 traveled to England and opened for Nirvana on several dates in 1990.

In August 1991, L7 performed at the International Pop Underground Convention (IPU) held in Olympia, Washington. The IPU was organized around a fiercely independent DIY ethic, with L7 the only band with major label representation, having recently signed with Slash Records (a subsidiary of London Records).

===Major label releases with Slash (1991–1997)===
Their 1992 third album, &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot;, produced by Butch Vig, was featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; May 1999 list of &#x27;Essential recordings of the 1990s&#x27;, and was their most critically and commercially successful release. When Donita Sparks reached out to Yoko Ono to request permission to sample her scream in the opening track &quot;Wargasm,&quot; Ono reportedly replied that she had her fingers crossed for the group as it was time for their music to get popular. Their 1992 single &quot;Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot; spent 13 weeks on the US Alternative Songs chart while peaking at the No. 8 position, and it had also peaked at No. 21 on the UK Singles Chart. The singles &quot;Everglade&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; also made appearances on the UK Singles chart. In their listing of the top 50 grunge songs, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine included &quot;Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot; as number 21. L7 went on a year long tour to promote &quot;Bricks Are Heavy.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; reported in 1992 that L7 had built a huge underground following all over the world due to repeatedly touring. The popularity of &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; was also boosted by frequent video play on MTV. By June 2000, &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; had sold 327,000 copies in the US.

In a July 1993 article for &quot;Spin&quot; which featured L7 on the magazine&#x27;s cover, Renée Crist described L7 as &quot;four of the funniest, meanest, strongest, coolest, most pissed-off women I know&quot; and as &quot;wild, rambunctious, spontaneous&quot; with a stage show that &quot;is a wash of buddy love, crowd working, and acrobatics&quot;.

L7&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Hungry for Stink&quot;, was released in July 1994. The album peaked at No. 117 on the Billboard 200 chart, their highest position to date. &quot;Andres&quot; was the lead single off the album, which peaked at No. 20 on the US Alternative Songs and No. 34 on the UK Singles charts. The band continued to be regarded as a strong live act and performed on the main stage of the Lollapalooza tour in 1994, which also included The Smashing Pumpkins, the Beastie Boys, George Clinton, Nick Cave, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Breeders. In January 1995, L7 played a set of benefit concerts for Voters for Choice at Constitution Hall along with Neil Young, Lisa Germano, and Pearl Jam. Finch created a &quot;slight fuss&quot; after reportedly playing the final song of one show after removing her shirt.

In 1995, L7 was one of four bands featured in the documentary film &quot;Not Bad For a Girl&quot;. The film, which focused on several all female bands, was awarded Best Documentary at the New York Underground Film Festival in 1996.

Finch left the band in 1996, during the recording of their fifth album,&quot;The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum&quot;. Sparks and Greta Brinkman played bass on the album, after which Gail Greenwood – formerly of the band Belly – became the band&#x27;s full-time bassist. L7 performed at the Bumbershoot festival in Seattle, Washington in 1997.

===Independent output and initial disbandment (1997–2001)===
In 1998, the pseudo-documentary film &quot;L7: The Beauty Process&quot; was released, directed by Krist Novoselic. The film contains actual concert footage of L7&#x27;s trials and travails of being a “punk-like band in a pop-like marketplace.”

L7&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Slap-Happy&quot;, was released on the band&#x27;s own label Wax Tadpole Records in 1999. To promote the record, on July 17, 1999, L7 had a plane fly over the crowd at the Lilith Fair at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, with a banner that read, &quot;Bored? Tired? Try L7.&quot; The following day, an airplane towed a banner over the crowd at the Warped Tour at the Stone Pony lot in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The banner read &quot;Warped needs more beaver...love, L7.&quot; Greenwood later left the band and was replaced by Janis Tanaka, formerly of the San Francisco band, Stone Fox.

Record sales continued to wane during the late 1990s, and the band grew increasingly low on funds. However, the band&#x27;s live performances consistently garnered praise, including a September 1999 review by rock critic Greg Kot in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that stated &quot;Gardner and Sparks favor low-end guitar chug, a sound that suggests the idling engine of a Harley-Davidson more than the high-end squeal of most lead guitarists. They intersect with bassist Janis Tanaka to create a thick, sludgy bottom that rumbles the floorboards and shoots right through the sternums of innocent passersby. Their secret weapon remains drummer Dee Plakas.&quot;

By 2001, L7 was no longer touring. The band listed the following statement on their website: &quot;L7 is on an indefinite hiatus. We know that&#x27;s vague, but that&#x27;s just the way it is. The future of the band is a bit up in the air at the moment.&quot; L7 appeared to be defunct for all practical purposes. From 2007 to 2012, Sparks pursued another project, along with Plakas on drums, in their band Donita Sparks and The Stellar Moments. Finch formed several projects including OtherStarPeople and her punk rock group The Shocker. Tanaka played bass for Pink and Greenwood played with Bif Naked and later, the reformed Belly.

In 2012, Sparks started a Facebook page for the band, posting videos and archival images of L7, where their fan base quickly began to regroup.

===Reunion (2014–present)===
On December 10, 2014, L7 announced, on their official Facebook page, that they were reuniting, featuring Donita Sparks, Suzi Gardner, Jennifer Finch and Demetra Plakas. As part of the reunion, the band revamped their website and included a mailing list for fans.

The reunited band kicked off a European tour at Rock am Ring in Germany on June 6, 2015 with shows in the Czech Republic, Austria, UK, France, and Spain. This was followed by North American dates in New York, Toronto, and at Riot Fest in both Denver and Chicago, and the Fun, Fun, Fun Festival in Austin, Texas. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; reviewed their Toronto show and stated that &quot;Their subversive sense of humour and brash confidence provides feminism with some much-needed comic relief and audacity, and on this night, as 50-somethings in a 30-year-old band, they looked, acted and sounded every bit as brazen as they did 25 years back.&quot;

On February 15, 2016, L7&#x27;s original drummer Koutsky passed away at the age of 53. Later in 2016, the documentary film &quot;L7: Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot;, directed by Sarah Price, premiered in Los Angeles. The film, largely funded through Kickstarter, features original footage and interviews with the band members and eyewitness accounts of their development from Lydia Lunch, Shirley Manson, Krist Novoselic and Butch Vig. The film was nominated for a VO5 NME Award for Best Music Film.

In 2016, L7 played a series of shows in the US, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. Chris Lane of &quot;Houston Press&quot; described the synergy of Sparks and Gardner&#x27;s guitar playing and the strength of the band&#x27;s live show stating &quot;Their percussive styles seemed to be locked together, producing a glorious, unified wall of sound. Bass player Jennifer Finch bounced about the stage while propelling each song forward, and drummer Dee Plakas proved that she should be a lot more famous as a rock drummer with every fill.&quot;

On January 13, 2017, L7 released &quot;Detroit (Live)&quot; on record label Easy Action. The live album was originally recorded at a concert in the Motor city on September 1, 1990, and coincided with the group&#x27;s initial release of &quot;Smell the Magic&quot; on Sub Pop records. Their performance at the established punk venue Clutch Cargo&#x27;s in Detroit expressed the raw, kinetic energy of the era. L7 released &quot;Fast and Frightening (&quot;a collections of rarities, covers, and live performances) as a double album in 2016 with music critic Robert Christgau granting it an A minus in a 2018 review.

On September 29, 2017, L7 released its first new song in 18 years, &quot;Dispatch from Mar-a-Lago&quot; on Don Giovanni Records. The title is a reference to the Mar-a-Lago resort owned by Donald J. Trump. A follow-up single, &quot;I Came Back to Bitch&quot;, was released in February 2018.

L7 continued to tour heavily in the US, Canada, and Europe in 2018. April 2018 saw the band announce their plans to record a seventh studio album via PledgeMusic, scheduled for release in 2019.
The band went on tour shortly afterward. Including dates with Le Butcherettes as openers.

L7 released the first single from their first album in 20 years, &quot;Burn Baby&quot;, on February 28, 2019. The full album, &quot;Scatter the Rats&quot;, was released on May 3, 2019, through Joan Jett&#x27;s record label Blackheart Records. The album received generally favorable reviews. &quot;Hyperallergic&quot; referred to the band&#x27;s legacy as &quot;feminist punks, metal snarlers, (and) grunge comedians&quot; and stated of their return album that Sparks and Gardner &quot;pound out one solid, catchy, immediately identifiable power riff after another, more punk-minimalist than in their molten grunge period&quot;.

In April 2022, L7 announced a tour commemorating the 30th anniversary release of their third album, &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot;. The band played the entire album, along with several other songs. The tour consisted of eighteen scheduled shows through the month of October. L7 also announced a deluxe reissue of &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot;. Remastered by Howie Weinberg, the limited-edition release comes pressed on gold and black vinyl via Licorice Pizza, and pre-orders begun on September 30.

==Politics and activism==
The band&#x27;s name, L7, derives from a slang term for square. Forming and gaining exposure a time when female musicians and bands were still routinely referred to with terms such as &quot;chicks&quot; and &quot;foxcore&quot;, they deliberately chose a name that didn&#x27;t draw attention to being an all-female band, to resist being typecast into roles the music industry typically expected of women. Sparks said, &quot;We get letters from young girls who say that we’re their inspiration for picking up an instrument, and that makes us really proud. &quot;We&quot; didn’t really have role models growing up.&quot;

In 1991, the band formed Rock for Choice, a pro-choice women&#x27;s rights group and concert series that raised funds to cover legal expenses due to the prolonged anti-abortion violence and women&#x27;s clinic bombings of the 1980s and 1990s. The concept for Rock for Choice, generated by L7 and Sue Cummings, senior editor at the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, was loosely modeled on Bob Geldof&#x27;s Live Aid. L7 performed along with Nirvana, Sister Double Happiness, and Hole at the inaugural event held at the Hollywood Palace on October 25, 1991. Thanks to a conversation between members of L7 and Dave Grohl at an afterparty following the first show, subsequent Rock for Choice posters were designed in a distinctive underground comix style by SoCal artist Jim Evans/TAZ collective.

Rock for Choice founders L7 and Cummings, along with punk rock promoter and Cochella co-founder Rick Van Santen of Goldenvoice, laid the framework for the inaugural concert. The group created kits with information to empower activists to stage a Rock for Choice benefit in their own towns. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that within two years of launching Rock for Choice, there had already been 37 such concerts nationwide.

L7 performed at the September 27, 1992, Rock for Choice benefit concert at the Hollywood Palladium along with Exene Cervenka, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Mudhoney. In October 1993, seven bands played a sold out Rock for Choice benefit including the beloved Los Angeles bands X and Firehose, and featuring the headliner Rage Against the Machine. L7 band members took to the stage, each in a guise of a beauty contestant wearing a sash listing a city where anti-abortion violence had erupted: Sparks as &quot;Ms Bakersfield, CA,&quot; Plakas as &quot;Ms. Lancaster, PA,&quot; Finch as &quot;Ms. Peoria, IL,&quot; and Gardner as “Ms. Newport Beach, CA.&quot;

Later Rock for Choice concerts included the Foo Fighters, Ween, Pearl Jam, and other prominent bands of the era. L7 returned their focus to their music, reducing their involvement with Rock for Choice, which continued on independently through 2001.

==Other appearances==
The band appeared in John Waters&#x27; 1994 film &quot;Serial Mom&quot; under the name &quot;Camel Lips&quot;.

Their songs have been featured on the soundtracks of numerous films, including &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, and &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot;. &quot;Shove&quot; appears on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and &quot;Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot; appears on the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. &quot;Andres&quot; is available as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band 4&quot;.

Finch and Plakas performed several times with Japanese artist hide in 1994.

L7 appeared on TV shows such as &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;, &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Nation&quot;. The band played at the Reading Festival in 1992 having been chosen for the concert by Nirvana band leader Kurt Cobain, Glastonbury Festival in 1994, Lollapalloza in 1994, Finsbury Park in 1997, and on the Warped Tour in 1995 and 1999. They toured with and opened for artists including Bad Religion in 1988, GWAR in 1989, Nirvana and Alice in Chains in 1990, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Rollins Band and Beastie Boys in 1992, Pearl Jam in 1994, Marilyn Manson and The Offspring in 1997, and Ministry in 1999.

The band, with Finch returning on bass, appeared in the 1999 cult video &quot;Decoupage: Return of the Goddess&quot;, performing the Sonny and Cher song &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; with actress Karen Black, and being interviewed individually by Decoupage hostess Summer Caprice.

The video for &quot;Pretend We&#x27;re Dead&quot; was featured on an episode of &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;. In a later episode, while discussing who would win in a battle between Tiffany, Wilson Phillips, and Debbie Gibson, the characters state their belief that &quot;one chick from L7 could kick all their asses combined&quot;.

Throughout the mid-2000s, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Shitlist&quot; was used as the entrance music of professional wrestler Jon Moxley, who would later become widely known under the name Dean Ambrose upon joining WWE in 2011. The song was also used in ECW by Brian Pillman (under his loose cannon gimmick) in 1996, until his departure the following year.

==Controversies==
During their performance at the 1992 Reading Festival, the band experienced &quot;technical difficulties with their audio equipment&quot; and were forced to stall their set. The rowdy crowd grew restless and began throwing mud onto the stage, repeatedly pelting the band. In protest, lead vocalist Donita Sparks removed her tampon on-stage and threw it into the crowd yelling &quot;Eat my used tampon, fuckers!&quot; Sparks has remained unapologetic about the incident, and the tampon has been referred to as one of the &quot;most unsanitary pieces of rock memorabilia in history.&quot;

Later in 1992, Sparks caused controversy in the United Kingdom when she dropped her jeans and underwear on live television, appearing nude from the waist down, during an L7 performance on the late night UK programme &quot;The Word&quot;. Of the incident, Sparks later commented that the Word show L7 appeared on had a number of chaotic aspects already underway including &quot;a men’s bum contest&quot; and a &quot;hidden camera in Oliver Reed’s dressing room, showing him intoxicated with his shirt off, which was really fucked up. So I added my contribution to this craziness.&quot;

In 2000, the band raffled a one-night stand with Demetra Plakas at a London gig. The winner got to spend the night on the tour bus. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Plakas and her bandmates decided &quot;We&#x27;re not being hypocritical about rock &amp; roll anymore. Rock &amp; roll is prostitution.&quot;

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
L7&#x27;s sound has been described as &quot;unique and unforgiving, mixing a punk rock attitude with heavy sludge metal.&quot; A 2019 article on L7 in &quot;Alternative Press&quot; stated that &quot;In the early-&#x27;90s underground, L7 were positively bulletproof and larger than life. Not as come-hither nymphs or saucy rock star minxes bestowed with privilege but as a hard-rocking unit&quot; that could not be messed with. The band have been categorised as alternative metal, alternative rock, grunge, punk metal and punk rock. On the metal side of the band&#x27;s sound, Donita Sparks acknowledged in July 2018 that L7 has metal influences but does not consider the group to be a &quot;metal band&quot;, instead stating &quot;at heart, we&#x27;re punk rockers&quot;.

Aesthetically, their style was subversive with a long-standing resistance to the expectation for girls to be eye-candy. L7 called themselves &quot;slob girls&quot; with ratty hair and clothes and bassist Jennifer Finch frequently performed barefoot onstage. Sparks summarized &quot;If we were gonna be looked at, we were gonna be thrashin.&quot;

A reviewer in 1995 stated that &quot;L7 plays slow-riffing hard rock, fast punk rock and bluesy, catchy midtempo songs: generic forms upgraded by smart lyrics and pure irreverence on stage.&quot;

Donita Sparks credits the punk rock bands the Ramones and the Sex Pistols as two of her earliest influences, stating of the former that, at age 15, &quot;I was so longing for teenage music, stuff that was fun and carefree and cool. And the Ramones were the whole package&quot;, having stated in 1997 that &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; (1977) was the record that changed her life. Sparks has also noted 1960s surf music, namely the Beach Boys, Dick Dale and the Ventures, as a key influence, describing it as her &quot;siren song&quot; to move to Los Angeles in the 1980s. The band also draw heavily from female-fronted 1970s and 1980s punk and new wave acts (see women in punk rock) including the B-52&#x27;s, Blondie and Frightwig. Suzi Gardner, more so than Sparks, was influenced by blues-based 1970s rock and early metal acts, such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Hawkwind and Led Zeppelin. Other influences on members of the band include ABBA, AC/DC, The Beatles, David Bowie, Patsy Cline, Elvis Costello, the Cramps, Arethra Franklin, the Gap Band, Kraftwerk, Motörhead, Ohio Players, Yoko Ono, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Lou Reed, the Rolling Stones, Roxy Music, and Sha Na Na.

The Prodigy covered the &quot;Hungry for Stink&quot; track &quot;Fuel My Fire&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Spin&quot; listed &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; as number 249 on their list of the top 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014). &quot;Decibel&quot; ranked the songs from L7&#x27;s &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; as part of their Hall of Fame Countdown in 2016. In 2016, &quot;Ugly Things&quot; ranked &quot;Smell the Magic&quot; at number 24 on a list of the top 40 punk albums of all-time. In 2017, &quot;Metal Injection&quot; ranked L7 at number 7 on their list of &quot;10 Heaviest Grunge Bands&quot;.

The band was listed by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2019 as one of &quot;Ten Bands No One Expected to be So Influential Today.&quot; The group was described as &quot;one of rock’s most volatile and respected acts. Predictable on paper, anything but on stage&quot;.

<text>In logic and mathematics, the converse of a categorical or implicational statement is the result of reversing its two constituent statements. For the implication &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot;, the converse is &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;P&quot;. For the categorical proposition &quot;All S are P&quot;, the converse is &quot;All P are S&quot;. Either way, the truth of the converse is generally independent from that of the original statement.

==Implicational converse==
Let &quot;S&quot; be a statement of the form &quot;P implies Q&quot; (&quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot;). Then the &quot;converse&quot; of &quot;S&quot; is the statement &quot;Q implies P&quot; (&quot;Q&quot; → &quot;P&quot;). In general, the truth of &quot;S&quot; says nothing about the truth of its converse, unless the antecedent &quot;P&quot; and the consequent &quot;Q&quot; are logically equivalent.

For example, consider the true statement &quot;If I am a human, then I am mortal.&quot; The converse of that statement is &quot;If I am mortal, then I am a human,&quot; which is not necessarily true.

However, the converse of a statement with mutually inclusive terms remains true, given the truth of the original proposition. This is equivalent to saying that the converse of a definition is true. Thus, the statement &quot;If I am a triangle, then I am a three-sided polygon&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;If I am a three-sided polygon, then I am a triangle,&quot; because the definition of &quot;triangle&quot; is &quot;three-sided polygon&quot;.

A truth table makes it clear that &quot;S&quot; and the converse of &quot;S&quot; are not logically equivalent, unless both terms imply each other:

Going from a statement to its converse is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. However, if the statement &quot;S&quot; and its converse are equivalent (i.e., &quot;P&quot; is true if and only if &quot;Q&quot; is also true), then affirming the consequent will be valid.

Converse implication is logically equivalent to the disjunction of formula_1 and formula_2

In natural language, this could be rendered &quot;not &quot;Q&quot; without &quot;P&quot;&quot;.

===Converse of a theorem===
In mathematics, the converse of a theorem of the form &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; will be &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;P&quot;. The converse may or may not be true, and even if true, the proof may be difficult. For example, the four-vertex theorem was proved in 1912, but its converse was proved only in 1997.

In practice, when determining the converse of a mathematical theorem, aspects of the antecedent may be taken as establishing context. That is, the converse of &quot;Given P, if Q then R&quot;&quot;&quot; will be &quot;Given P, if R then Q&quot;&quot;&quot;. For example, the Pythagorean theorem can be stated as:
&quot;Given&quot; a triangle with sides of length &quot;formula_3&quot;, &quot;formula_4&quot;, and &quot;formula_5&quot;, &quot;if&quot; the angle opposite the side of length &quot;formula_5&quot; is a right angle, &quot;then&quot; formula_7.
The converse, which also appears in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (Book I, Proposition 48), can be stated as:
&quot;Given&quot; a triangle with sides of length &quot;formula_3&quot;, &quot;formula_4&quot;, and &quot;formula_5&quot;, &quot;if&quot; formula_7, &quot;then&quot; the angle opposite the side of length &quot;formula_5&quot; is a right angle.
===Converse of a relation===

If formula_13 is a binary relation with formula_14 then the converse relation formula_15 is also called the &quot;transpose&quot;.

==Notation==
The converse of the implication &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; may be written &quot;Q&quot; → &quot;P&quot;, formula_16, but may also be notated formula_17, or &quot;B&quot;pq&quot;&quot; (in Bocheński notation).

==Categorical converse==
In traditional logic, the process of switching the subject term with the predicate term is called &quot;conversion&quot;. For example, going from &quot;No &quot;S&quot; are &quot;P&quot;&quot; to its converse &quot;No &quot;P&quot; are &quot;S&quot;&quot;. In the words of Asa Mahan: &quot;The original proposition is called the exposita; when converted, it is denominated the converse. Conversion is valid when, and only when, nothing is asserted in the converse which is not affirmed or implied in the exposita.&quot; The &quot;exposita&quot; is more usually called the &quot;convertend&quot;. In its simple form, conversion is valid only for E and I propositions:

The validity of simple conversion only for E and I propositions can be expressed by the restriction that &quot;No term must be distributed in the converse which is not distributed in the convertend.&quot; For E propositions, both subject and predicate are distributed, while for I propositions, neither is.

For A propositions, the subject is distributed while the predicate is not, and so the inference from an A statement to its converse is not valid. As an example, for the A proposition &quot;All cats are mammals&quot;, the converse &quot;All mammals are cats&quot; is obviously false. However, the weaker statement &quot;Some mammals are cats&quot; is true. Logicians define conversion &quot;per accidens&quot; to be the process of producing this weaker statement. Inference from a statement to its converse &quot;per accidens&quot; is generally valid. However, as with syllogisms, this switch from the universal to the particular causes problems with empty categories: &quot;All unicorns are mammals&quot; is often taken as true, while the converse &quot;per accidens&quot; &quot;Some mammals are unicorns&quot; is clearly false.

In first-order predicate calculus, &quot;All S are P&quot; can be represented as formula_18. It is therefore clear that the categorical converse is closely related to the implicational converse, and that &quot;S&quot; and &quot;P&quot; cannot be swapped in &quot;All S are P&quot;.

<text>In logic, an inverse is a type of conditional sentence which is an immediate inference made from another conditional sentence. More specifically, given a conditional sentence of the form formula_1, the inverse refers to the sentence formula_2. Since an inverse is the contrapositive of the converse, inverse and converse are logically equivalent to each other.

For example, substituting propositions in natural language for logical variables, the inverse of the following conditional proposition

:&quot;If it&#x27;s raining, then Sam will meet Jack at the movies.&quot;

would be

:&quot;If it&#x27;s not raining, then Sam will not meet Jack at the movies.&quot;

The inverse of the inverse, that is, the inverse of formula_3, is formula_4, and since the double negation of any statement is equivalent to the original statement in classical logic, the inverse of the inverse is logically equivalent to the original conditional formula_5. Thus it is permissible to say that formula_3 and formula_5 are inverses of each other. Likewise, formula_8 and formula_9 are inverses of each other.

The inverse and the converse of a conditional are logically equivalent to each other, just as the conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent to each other. But &quot;the inverse of a conditional cannot be inferred from the conditional itself&quot; (e.g., the conditional might be true while its inverse might be false). For example, the sentence

:&quot;If it&#x27;s not raining, Sam will not meet Jack at the movies&quot;

cannot be inferred from the sentence

:&quot;If it&#x27;s raining, Sam will meet Jack at the movies&quot;

because in the case where it&#x27;s not raining, additional conditions may still prompt Sam and Jack to meet at the movies, such as:

:&quot;If it&#x27;s not raining and Jack is craving popcorn, Sam will meet Jack at the movies.&quot;

In traditional logic, where there are four named types of categorical propositions, only forms A (i.e., &quot;All &quot;S&quot; are &quot;P&quot;&quot;) and E (&quot;All &quot;S&quot; are not &quot;P&quot;&quot;) have an inverse. To find the inverse of these categorical propositions, one must: replace the subject and the predicate of the inverted by their respective contradictories, and change the quantity from universal to particular. That is: 

*&quot;All &quot;S&quot; are &quot;P&quot;&quot; (&quot;A&quot; form) becomes &quot;Some non-&quot;S&quot; are non-&quot;P&quot;&quot;.
*&quot;All &quot;S&quot; are not &quot;P&quot;&quot; (&quot;E&quot; form) becomes &quot;Some non-&quot;S&quot; are not non-&quot;P&quot;.&quot;

<text>GroenLinks (, ; GL) is a green political party in the Netherlands.

It was formed on 1 March 1989 from the merger of four left-wing parties: the Communist Party of the Netherlands, the Pacifist Socialist Party, the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party, which shared left-wing and progressive ideals and had previously co-operated in the Rainbow coalition for the 1989 European Parliament election. After disappointing results in the 1989 and 1994 general elections, the nascent party fared particularly well in the 1998 and 2002 elections under the leadership of Paul Rosenmöller, who came to be seen as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition against the first Kok cabinet, a purple government. The party&#x27;s number of seats fell from 10 to 4 seats in the 2012 election, before increasing to 14 in 2017 and falling back to 8 in 2021.

After the 2021 general election, the party intensified cooperation with the Labour Party (PvdA) in an alliance called GroenLinks–PvdA. The two parties participated in the 2023 general election with a joint candidate list, and currently have a joint parliamentary group of 25 seats.

Despite the fact that the two are members of separate European political groups, Groenlinks as a member of Greens–European Free Alliance and PvdA as a member of the Party of European Socialists, the parties campaigned together as GroenLinks-PvdA for the 2024 European Parliament election. 

GroenLinks describes itself as &quot;green&quot;, &quot;social&quot; and &quot;tolerant&quot;. The party&#x27;s voters are concentrated in larger cities, particularly in college towns.

==History==

===Before 1989: predecessors===
GroenLinks was founded in 1989 as a merger of four parties that were to the left of the Labour Party (PvdA), a social-democratic party which has traditionally been the largest centre-left party in the Netherlands. The founding parties were the (formerly-communist) Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN), the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP), which originated in the peace movement, the green-influenced Political Party of Radicals (PPR), originally a progressive Christian party, and the progressive Christian Evangelical People&#x27;s Party. These four parties were frequently classified as &quot;small left&quot;; to indicate their marginal existence. In the 1972 general election, these parties won sixteen seats (out of 150); in the 1977 general election, they only won six. From that moment on, members and voters began to argue for close cooperation.

From the 1980s onwards, the four parties started to cooperate in municipal and provincial elections. As fewer seats are available in these representations, a higher percentage of votes is required to gain a seat. In the 1984 European election, the PPR, CPN and PSP formed the Green Progressive Accord that entered as one into the European elections. They gained one seat, which rotated between the PSP and PPR. Party-members of the four parties also encountered each other in grassroots extraparliamentary protest against nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. More than 80% of the members of the PSP, CPN and PPR attended at least one of the two mass protests against the placement of nuclear weapons, which took place in 1981 and 1983.

The Evangelical People&#x27;s Party was a relatively new party, founded in 1981, as a splinter group from the Christian Democratic Appeal, the largest party of the Dutch centre-right. During its period in parliament, 1982–1986, it had trouble positioning itself between the small left parties (PSP, PPR and CPN), the PvdA and the CDA.
The increasingly close cooperation between PPR, PSP, CPN and EVP, and the ideological change that accompanied it was not without internal dissent within the parties. The ideological change that CPN made from official communism to &#x27;reformism&#x27; led to a split in the CPN; and the subsequent founding of the League of Communists in the Netherlands in 1982. In 1983, a group of &quot;deep&quot; Greens split from the PPR to found The Greens. The CPN and the PPR wanted to form an electoral alliance with the PSP for the 1986 elections. This led to a crisis within the PSP, in which chair of the parliamentary party (&quot;Fractievoorzitter&quot;) Fred van der Spek, who opposed cooperation, was replaced by Andrée van Es, who favoured cooperation. Van der Spek left the PSP to found his own Party for Socialism and Disarmament. The 1986 PSP congress, however, rejected the electoral alliance.

In the 1986 general election, all four parties lost seats. The CPN and the EVP disappeared from parliament. The PPR was left with two and the PSP with one seat. While the parties were preparing to enter in the 1990 elections separately, the pressure to cooperate increased. In 1989, the PPR, CPN and PSP entered the 1989 European Parliament election with a single list, called the Rainbow. Joost Lagendijk and Leo Platvoet, both PSP party board members, initiated an internal referendum in which the members of the PSP declared to support leftwing cooperation (70% in favour; 64% of all members voting). Their initiative for left-wing cooperation was supported by an open letter from influential members of trade unions (such as Paul Rosenmöller and Karin Adelmund), of environmental movements (e.g., Jacqueline Cramer) and from arts (such as Rudi van Dantzig). This letter called for the formation of a single progressive party to the left of the Labour Party. Lagendijk and Platvoet had been taking part in informal meetings between prominent PSP, PPR and CPN-members, who favoured cooperation. Other participants were PPR chairman Bram van Ojik and former CPN leader Ina Brouwer. These talks were called &quot;F.C. Sittardia&quot; or Cliché bv.

In the spring of 1989, the PSP party board initiated formal talks between the CPN, the PSP and the PPR about a common list for the upcoming general elections. It soon became clear that the CPN wanted to maintain an independent communist identity and not merge into a new left-wing formation. This was reason for the PPR leaving the talks. Negotiations about cooperation were reopened after the fall of the second Lubbers cabinet and the announcement that elections would be held in the autumn of that year. This time the EVP was included in the discussion. The PPR was represented for a short while by an informal delegation led by former chair Wim de Boer, because the party board did not want to be seen re-entering the negotiations it had left only a short while earlier. In the summer of 1989, the party congresses of all four parties accepted to enter the elections with a shared programme and list of candidates. Additionally, the association GroenLinks (Dutch: &quot;Vereniging GroenLinks&quot;; VGL) was set up to allow sympathisers, not member of any of the four parties to join. Meanwhile, the European elections of 1989 were held, in which the same group of parties had entered as a single list under the name &quot;Rainbow&quot;. In practice, the merger of the parties had now happened and the party GroenLinks was officially founded on 24 November 1990.

===1989–1994: completion of the merge and first term in parliament===

In the 1989 elections, the PPR, PSP, CPN and EVP entered in the elections with one single list called Groen Links. In the Netherlands, parties usually participate in the elections with one list for the whole country. The candidates on top of the list get the priority for the distribution of seats won. The GroenLinks list of candidates was organised in such a way that all the parties were represented and new figures could enter. The PPR, which had been the largest party in 1986 got the top candidate (the lead candidate, Ria Beckers) and the number five; the PSP got the numbers two and six, the CPN the number three and the EVP number eleven. The first independent candidate was Paul Rosenmöller, trade unionist from Rotterdam, on the fourth place. In the elections, the party doubled its seats in comparison to 1986 (from three to six), but the expectations had been much higher. In the 1990 municipal elections, the party fared much better, strengthening the resolve to cooperate.

In the period 1989–1991, the merger developed further. A board was organised for the party-in-foundation and also a &#x27;GroenLinks Council&#x27;, which was supposed to control the board and the parliamentary party and stimulate the process of merger. In this council, all five groups – CPN, PPR, PSP, EVP and the Vereniging Groen Links – had seats on ratio of the number of their members. Originally, the three youth organisations, the CPN-linked General Dutch Youth League, the PSP-linked Pacifist Socialist Young Working Groups and the PPR-linked Political Party of Radical Youth refused to merge, but under pressure of the government (who controlled their subsidies) they did merge to form DWARS. In 1990, some opposition formed against the moderate, green course of GroenLinks. Several former PSP members united in the &quot;Left Forum&quot; in 1992 – they would leave the party to join former PSP-leader Van der Spek to found the PSP&#x27;92. Similarly, former members of the CPN joined the League of Communists in the Netherlands to found the New Communist Party in the same year. In 1991, the congresses of the four founding parties (PSP, PPR, CPN and EVP) decided to officially abolish their parties.

GroenLinks had considerable problems formulating its own ideology. In 1990, the attempt to write the first manifesto of principles failed because of the difference between socialists and communists on the one side and the more liberal former PPR members on the other side. The second manifesto of principles – which was not allowed to be called that – was adopted after a lengthy debate and many amendments in 1991.

Although the party was internally divided, the GroenLinks parliamentary party was the only party in the Dutch parliament which opposed the Gulf War. A debate within the party about the role military intervention led to a more-nuanced standpoint than the pacifism of some of its predecessors: GroenLinks would support peacekeeping missions as long as they were mandated by the United Nations.

In the fall of 1990, MEP Verbeek announced that he would not, as he had promised, leave the European Parliament after two-and-a-half years to make room for a new candidate. He would continue as an independent and remain in parliament until 1994. In the 1994 European elections, he would run unsuccessfully as top candidate of The Greens.

In 1992, party leader Ria Beckers left the House of Representatives because she wanted more private time. Peter Lankhorst replaced her as chair ad interim, but he announced that he would not take part in the internal elections.

===1994–2002: opposition during the purple cabinets===

Before the general election of 1994, GroenLinks organised an internal election on the party&#x27;s political leadership. Two duos entered: Ina Brouwer (former CPN) combined with Mohammed Rabbae (independent), while Paul Rosenmöller (independent) formed a combination with Leoni Sipkes (former PSP); there were also five individual candidates, including Wim de Boer (former chair of the PPR and member of the Senate), Herman Meijer (former CPN, future chair of the party) and Ineke van Gent (former PSP and future MP).

Some candidates ran in duos because they wanted to combine family life with politics. Brouwer, Rosenmöller and Sipkes already were MPs for GroenLinks, whilst Rabbae was new – he had been chair of the Dutch Centre for Foreigners. In the first round, the duos ended up ahead of the others, but neither had an absolute majority. A second round was needed, in which Brouwer and Rabbae won with 51%. Brouwer became the first candidate and Rabbae second, the second duo Rosenmöller and Sipkes occupied the following place followed by Marijke Vos, former chair of the party. The idea of a dual lead candidacy did not communicate well to the voters. GroenLinks lost one seat, leaving only five. Yet in the same election, the centre-left Labour Party also lost a lot of seats.

After the disappointing elections, Brouwer left parliament. She was replaced as party leader by Paul Rosenmöller and her seat was taken by Tara Singh Varma. The charismatic Rosenmöller became the &quot;unofficial leader&quot; of the opposition against the first Kok cabinet because the largest opposition party, the Christian Democratic Appeal, was unable to adapt well to its new role as opposition party. Rosenmöller set out a new strategy: GroenLinks should offer alternatives instead of only rejecting the proposals made by the government.

In the 1998 general election, GroenLinks more than doubled its seats to eleven. The charisma of &quot;unofficial leader&quot; Rosenmöller played an important role in this. Many new faces entered parliament, including Femke Halsema, a political talent who had left the Labour Party for GroenLinks in 1997.
The party began to speculate openly about joining government after the elections of 2002.

The 1999 Kosovo War divided the party internally. The parliamentary party in the House of Representatives supported the NATO intervention, while the Senate parliamentary party was against the intervention. Several former PSP members within the House of Representatives parliamentary party began to openly speak out their doubts about the intervention. A compromise was found: GroenLinks would support the intervention as long as it limited itself to military targets. Prominent members of the founding parties including Marcus Bakker and Joop Vogt left the party over this issue.

In February 2001, Roel van Duijn and a few former members of The Greens joined GroenLinks.

In 2001, the integrity of former MP Tara Singh Varma came into doubt: it was revealed that she had lied about her illness and that she had made promises to development organisations which she did not fulfill. In 2000, she had left parliament because as she claimed, she had only a few months to live before she would die of cancer. The TROS program &quot;Opgelicht&quot; (In English &quot;Framed&quot;) revealed that she had lied and that she did not have cancer. Later, she apologised on public television and claimed she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

In the same year, the parliamentary party supported the invasion of Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of September 11. This invasion led to great upheaval within the party. Several former PSP members within the House of Representatives parliamentary party began to openly speak out their doubts about the intervention. Under pressure of internal opposition, led by former PSP members and the party&#x27;s youth organisation DWARS, the parliamentary party changed its position: the attacks should be cancelled.

===2002–present===
The 2002 general election was characterised by changes in the political climate. The right-wing populist political commentator Pim Fortuyn entered into politics. He had an anti-establishment message, combined with a call for restrictions on immigration. Although his critique was oriented at the second Kok cabinet, Rosenmöller was one of the few politicians who could muster some resistance against his message. Days before the election, Fortuyn was assassinated. Ab Harrewijn, GroenLinks MP and candidate also died. Before and after the elections serious threats were made against Rosenmöller, his wife and his children. These events caused considerable stress for Rosenmöller. GroenLinks lost one seat in the election, although it had gained more votes than in the 1998 elections. Before the 2003 general election Rosenmöller left parliament, citing the ongoing threats against his life and those of his family as the main reason. He was replaced as chair of the parliamentary party and top candidate by Femke Halsema. She was unable to keep ten seats and lost two.

In 2003, GroenLinks almost unanimously turned against the Iraq War. It took part in the protests against the war, for instance by organising its party congress in Amsterdam at the day of the large demonstration, with an interval allowing its members to join the protest.

At the end of 2003, Halsema temporarily left parliament to give birth to her twins. During her absence Marijke Vos took her place as chair of the parliamentary party. When she returned to parliament, Halsema started a discussion about the principles of her party. She emphasised individual freedom, tolerance, self-realisation and emancipation. In one interview she called her party &quot;the last liberal party of the Netherlands&quot; This led to considerable attention of media and other observers, which speculated about an ideological change. In 2005 the party&#x27;s scientific bureau published the book &quot;Vrijheid als Ideaal&quot; (&quot;Freedom as Ideal&quot;) in which prominent opinion-makers explored the new political space and the position of the left within that space. During the congress of February 2007 the party board was ordered to organise a party-wide discussion about the party&#x27;s principles.

During the European Elections congress of 2004, the candidacy committee proposed that the chair of the GroenLinks delegation, Joost Lagendijk, should become the party&#x27;s lead candidate in those elections. A group of members, led by Senator Leo Platvoet submitted a motion &quot;We want to choose&quot;. They wanted a serious choice for such an important office. The party&#x27;s board announced a new electoral procedure. During the congress Kathalijne Buitenweg, an MEP and candidate, announced wish to be considered for the position of top candidate. She narrowly won the elections from Lagendijk. This came as a great surprise to all. Especially for Buitenweg who had not written an acceptance speech and read out Lagendijk&#x27;s.

In May 2005, MP Farah Karimi wrote a book in which discussed in detail how she had taken part in the Iranian Revolution, because this information was already known by the party board this did not lead to any upheaval. In November 2005, the party board asked Senator Sam Pormes to give up his seat. Continuing rumours about his involvement with guerrilla-training in Yemen in the 1970s and the 1977 train hijacking by Moluccan youth and allegations of welfare fraud were harmful for the party, or at least so the party board claimed.

When Pormes refused to step down, the party board threatened to expel him. Pormes fought this decision. The party council of March 2006 sided with Pormes. Party chair Herman Meijer felt forced to resign. He was succeeded by Henk Nijhof who was chosen by the party council in May 2006. In November 2006 Pormes left the Senate, he was replaced by Goos Minderman.

In the 2006 Dutch municipal election, the party stayed relatively stable, losing only a few seats. After the elections GroenLinks took part in 75 local executives, including Amsterdam where MP Marijke Vos became an alderwoman.

In preparation of the 2006 general election the party held a congress in October. It elected Halsema, again the only candidate, as the party&#x27;s top candidate. MEP Kathalijne Buitenweg and comedian Vincent Bijlo were last candidates. In the 2006 elections the party lost one seat.

In the subsequent cabinet formation, an initial exploratory round among the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Labour Party (PvdA) and Socialist Party (SP) failed, Halsema announced that GroenLinks would not be involved in further discussion at that point in time, as the party lost, was too small, and had less in common with CDA than the SP had. Following this decision an internal debate about the political course and the leadership of Halsema re-erupted. The debate does not just concern the series of lost elections and the decision not to participate in the formation talks, but also the elitist image of the party, the new liberal course, initiated by Halsema, and the lack of party democracy. Since the last weeks of January 2007 several prominent party members have voiced their doubts including former leader Ina Brouwer, Senator Leo Platvoet and MEP Joost Lagendijk. In reaction to this the party board has set up a commission led by former MP and chair of the PPR Bram van Ojik. They looked into the lost series of elections. In the summer of 2007 another committee was formed to organise a larger debate about the course of the party&#x27;s principles, organisation and strategy. Van Ojik also led this committee. The committee implemented a motion already adopted by the party&#x27;s congress in 2006 to re-evaluate the party&#x27;s principle in light of the party&#x27;s course started by Halsema in 2004. Over the course of 2007 and 2008 the committee organised an internal debate about the party&#x27;s principles, organisation and strategy. In November 2008 this led to the adoption of a new manifesto of principles.

In August 2008, GroenLinks parliamentarian Wijnand Duyvendak published a book in which he admitted to a burglary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in order to steal plans for nuclear power plants. This led to his resignation on 14 August, after media reported that the burglary also led to threats against civil servants. He was replaced by Jolande Sap.

In 2008, MEPs Joost Lagendijk and Kathalijne Buitenweg announced that they would not seek a new term in the European Parliament. The party had to elect a new lead candidate for the 2009 European elections. There were five candidates for this position: Amsterdam city councillor Judith Sargentini, former MEP Alexander de Roo, senator Tineke Strik, environmental researcher Bas Eickhout and Niels van den Berge assistant of MEP Buitenweg. In an internal referendum Sargentini was elected. The party congress put Eickhout on a second position on the list.

On 18 April 2010, the party congress composed the list of candidates for the 2010 general election. Two sitting MPs Ineke van Gent and Femke Halsema were granted dispensation to stand for a fourth term. Halsema was re-elected as party leader. Van Gent was put as fifth on the party list. All of the first five candidates were sitting MPs and four were women. Their other high newcomers were former Greenpeace director Liesbeth van Tongeren and chairman of CNV youth Jesse Klaver. The party won 10 seats in the election and participated in the formation talks of a Green/Purple government. Halsema resigned as party leader when these talks failed and was succeeded by Jolande Sap.

In the 2012 general election, GroenLinks lost six seats and was left with four out of 150 seats. Following the disappointing result, Sap was forced to resign as party leader and was succeeded by Bram van Ojik, who in turn handed his position to Jesse Klaver in 2015. Under Klaver&#x27;s leadership, GroenLinks gradually rose in polls before climbing to an all-time high of 14 seats in the 2017 general election. The party entered coalition talks with the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the Christian Democratic Appeal and Democrats 66, but the talks failed after Klaver demanded more refugees to be accepted.

GroenLinks lost the 2021 general election, and combined with the Labour Party during the subsequent government formation. There have been discussions about a merger with that party; they participated in the 2023 Dutch Senate election as one. GroenLinks and the Labour Party announced in 2023 that they would also participate as one, GroenLinks–PvdA, in the general elections of 2023, as members of both parties voted in favour of an alliance.

==Ideology and issues==

===Ideology===
The party combines green and left-wing ideals. The core ideals of GroenLinks are codified in the party&#x27;s programme of principles (called &quot;Partij voor de Toekomst&quot;, &quot;Party for the Future&quot;). The party places itself in the freedom-loving tradition of the left. Its principles include:
* The protection of the Earth, ecosystems and a respectful treatment of animals.
* A fair distribution of natural resources between all citizens of the world and all generations.
* A just distribution of income and fair chance for everyone to work, care, education and recreation.
* A pluralist society where everyone can participate in freedom. The party combines openness with a sense of community.
* Strengthening the international rule of law, in order to ensure peace and respect for human rights.

The party&#x27;s principles reflect the ideological convergence between the four founding parties which came from different ideological traditions: the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party, from a progressive Christian tradition; and the Pacifist Socialist Party and the Communist Party of the Netherlands from the socialist and communist traditions. Over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, the parties had come to embrace environmentalism and feminism; they all favoured democratisation of society and had opposed the creation of new nuclear plants and the placement of new nuclear weapons in the Netherlands.

Halsema, the former political leader of the party, has started a debate about the ideological course of GroenLinks. She emphasised the freedom-loving tradition of the left and chose freedom as a key value. Her course is called left-liberal by herself and observers, although Halsema herself claims that she does not want to force an ideological change.

Following Isaiah Berlin, Halsema distinguishes between positive and negative freedom. According to Halsema, negative freedom is the freedom of citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should protect the rights of citizens and not limit them. Positive freedom is the emancipation of citizens from poverty and discrimination. Halsema wants to apply this concept to welfare state and the environment where government should take more action. According to Halsema, GroenLinks is an undogmatic party.

===Proposals===
The election manifesto for the 2010 elections was adopted in April of that year. It was titled &quot;Klaar voor de Toekomst&quot; (&quot;Prepared for the Future&quot;). The manifesto emphasises international cooperation, welfare state reform, environmental policy and social tolerance.

GroenLinks considers itself a &quot;social reform party&quot;, which aims to reform the government finances and increase the position of &quot;outsiders&quot; on the labour market, such as migrant youth, single parents, workers with short term-contracts and people with disabilities. It disagrees with the parties on the right which, in the eyes of GroenLinks, were only oriented towards cutting costs and did not offer the worst-off a chance for work, emancipation and participation.
But, unlike the other opposition parties of the left, the party does not want to defend the current welfare state – which the party calls &quot;powerless&quot;, because it merely offers the worst-off a benefit rather than prospects for work. The party wants to reform the Dutch welfare state so it will benefit &quot;outsiders&quot; – those who have been excluded from the welfare state until now.

To increase employment, the GroenLinks proposes a participation contract, where unemployment recipients sign an agreement with their local council to become involved in volunteer work, schooling, or work experience projects – for which they get paid minimum wage.
The unemployment benefit should be increased and limited to one year. In this period, people would have to look for a job or education. If at the end of the year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment, one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.

International cooperation is an important theme for the party. This includes development cooperation with underdeveloped countries. GroenLinks wants to increase spending on development aid to 0.8% of the gross national product. It wants to open the European markets to goods from Third World countries, under conditions of fair trade. In order to ensure free and fair trade, it wants to increase and democratise international economic organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The party also favours greater international control over financial markets. GroenLinks favours European integration, but is critical about the current policies of the European Commission. It favoured the European Constitution, but after it was voted down in the 2005 referendum, GroenLinks advocated a new treaty which emphasised democracy and subsidiarity. The party is critical about the war on terror. It wants to strengthen the peacekeeping powers of the United Nations and reform the Dutch armed forces into a peace force, with the functions of NATO to be taken over by the European Union and the United Nations.

GroenLinks wants to solve environmental problems, especially climate change, by stimulating durable alternatives. The party wants to use taxes and emissions trading to stimulate alternative energy as an alternative to both fossil fuel and nuclear plants. It wants to close all nuclear plants in the Netherlands and impose a tax on the use of coal in energy production, in order to discourage the building of new coal-based power plants. Moreover, it wants to stimulate energy saving. It wants to invest in clean public transport, as an alternative to private transport. Investments in public transport can be financed by not expanding highways and imposing tolls on the use of roads (called &quot;rekeningrijden&quot;). The party wants to stimulate organic farming through taxes as an alternative to industrial agriculture. Moreover, GroenLinks wants to codify animal rights in the Constitution.

GroenLinks values individual freedom and the rule of law. The party wants to legalise soft drugs. It wants to protect civil rights on the Internet by extending constitutional protection for free communication to email and other modern technologies. It also favours a reform of copyright to allow non-commercial reproduction and the use of open-source software in the public sector. In the long term, it seeks to abolish the monarchy and create a republic. It also favours a reduction of the size of the government bureaucracy, for instance by decreasing the number of Dutch ministries and abolishing the Senate. Finally, GroenLinks favours liberal immigration and asylum policies. It wants to empower victims of human trafficking by giving them a residence permit and it wants to abolish the income requirements for marriage migration.

In the party&#x27;s 2021 election programme, it stated that it wants to introduce a basic income for all Dutch citizens within eight years.

==Electorate==
According to a survey done in 2006 more women vote for GroenLinks than men by a margin of 20%. The party also disproportionately appeals to gay voters. The party also polls well among migrant voters, especially those from Turkey and Morocco, where its support is twice as high as in the general population.

GroenLinks voters have an eccentric position in their preferences for particular policies. Between 1989 and 2003 they were the most leftwing voters in the Netherlands, often a little more to the left than voters of the SP. These voters are in favor of the redistribution of wealth, free choice for euthanasia, opening the borders for asylum seekers, the multicultural society and are firmly against building new nuclear plants.

GroenLinks has the second-largest proportion of vegan/vegetarian voters of any political party in the Netherlands, with 8.4% or 16.9% of GroenLinks voters in saying in 2 surveys in 2021 that they did not eat meat. The party with the highest proportion of vegan/vegetarian voters in both surveys was the Party for the Animals, for which the share laid at 17.3% or 27.9%.

==Style and campaign==
The logo of GroenLinks is the name of the party with the word &quot;Green&quot; written in red and the word &quot;Left&quot; written in green since 1994. Additional colours used in the logo are white, yellow and blue. An earlier logo, used between 1989 and 1994, and which can be seen on the poster above showed a variation of a peace sign projected on a green triangle on which &quot;PPR PSP CPN EVP&quot; was written and next to it GroenLinks in green and pink.

From 2007 onwards, GroenLinks has adopted the idea of a &quot;permanent campaign&quot;, which implies that campaign activities are held even when there is no immediate connection to an election. Permanent campaign activities are intended to create and maintain a base level of sympathy and knowledge about the party platform.

==Organisation==

===Name and logo===
The name &quot;GroenLinks&quot; (until 1992 &quot;Groen Links&quot; with a space between Groen and Links) is a compromise between the PPR and the CPN and the PSP. The PPR wanted the word &quot;Green&quot; in the name of the party, the PSP and the CPN the word &quot;Left&quot;. It also emphasises the core ideals of the party, environmental sustainability and social justice.

In 1984, the common list of the PPR, PSP and CPN for the 1984 European elections was called Green Progressive Accord – at that time the PPR did not want to accept the word &quot;left&quot; in the name of the political combination. The parties had entered in the 1989 European elections as the Rainbow (&quot;Regenboog&quot;), in reference to the Rainbow Group in the European Parliament between 1984 and 1989.

===Organisational structure===
The highest organ of GroenLinks is the party congress, which is open to all members. The congress elects the party-board, it decides on the order of the candidates for national and European elections and it has a final say over the party platform. The congress convenes at least once every year in spring or when needed.

The party board consists of fifteen members who are elected for a two-year term. The chairperson of this board is the only paid position on the board, the others are unpaid. The chairperson together with four other board members (the vice-chair, the treasurer, the secretary, the European secretary and the international secretary) handles the daily affairs and meet every two weeks while the other ten board members meet only once a month.

For the months that the congress does not convene, a party council takes over its role. It consists out of 80 representatives of all the 250 municipal branches. The party board and the nationally elected representatives of the party are responsible to the party council. It has the right to fill vacancies in the board, make changes to the party constitution and takes care of the party&#x27;s finances. Politicians are required to donate 10% of their gross income to the party, making GroenLinks one of the top recipients of donations among Dutch political parties.

There are several independent organisations which are linked to GroenLinks:
* DWARS, the independent youth organisation of GroenLinks
* De Linker Wang (&quot;The Left Cheek&quot;), platform for Religion and Politics, which is a progressive Christian platform, which was formed by former members of the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party.
* Scientific Bureau GroenLinks, the independent political think tank which publishes &quot;De Helling&quot; (Dutch for &quot;the Slope&quot;).
* PinkLeft, an LGBT organisation for GroenLinks members.

GroenLinks is also active on the European and the global stage. It is a founding member of the European Green Party and the Global Greens. Its MEPs sit in The Greens–European Free Alliance group. GroenLinks cooperates with seven other Dutch parties in the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, an institute which supports democratic development in developing countries.

===Relationships with other parties===
GroenLinks was founded as a mid-sized party to the left of the Labour Party (PvdA). In the 1994 elections, the Socialist Party (SP) also entered parliament. GroenLinks now takes a central position in the Dutch left between the socialist SP, which is more to the left, and the social-democratic PvdA, which is more to the centre. This position is exemplified by the call of Femke Halsema to form a left-wing coalition after the 2006 elections, knowing that such a coalition is only possible with GroenLinks. The electoral alliance between SP and GL in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 elections, and between GroenLinks and PvdA in the 2004 European elections are examples of this position. In the 2007 First Chamber election, it had an electoral alliance with the Party for the Animals. More and more, however, GroenLinks is seen as the most culturally progressive of the three parties. Since 2023 GroenLinks has significantly intensified cooperation with PvdA, generally entering elections with a shared electoral list, including in European Parliament elections after which elected politicians joined separate groups. Both parties are internally discussing a possible complete merger.

GroenLinks does not run an independent list for the water board elections. Instead, like D66 and Volt Netherlands, it recommends that its voters support Water Natuurlijk, an independent, green-oriented political party focused solely on water board elections.

<text>Rural sociology is a field of sociology traditionally associated with the study of social structure and conflict in rural areas. It is an active academic field in much of the world, originating in the United States in the 1910s with close ties to the national Department of Agriculture and land-grant university colleges of agriculture.

While the issue of natural resource access transcends traditional rural spatial boundaries, the sociology of food and agriculture is one focus of rural sociology, and much of the field is dedicated to the economics of farm production. Other areas of study include rural migration and other demographic patterns, environmental sociology, amenity-led development, public-lands policies, so-called &quot;boomtown&quot; development, social disruption, the sociology of natural resources (including forests, mining, fishing and other areas), rural cultures and identities, rural health-care, and educational policies. Many rural sociologists work in the areas of development studies, community studies, community development, and environmental studies. Much of the research involves developing countries or the Third World.

== History ==
===United States===
Rural sociology was a concept first brought by Americans in response to the large amounts of people living and working on the grounds of farms. Rural sociology was the first and for a time the largest branch of American sociology. Histories of the field were popular in the 1950s and 1960s.

===Europe===

History of European Rural Sociology

Though Europe included more agricultural land than the United States at the turn of the twentieth century, European rural sociology did not develop as an academic field until after World War II. This is partially explained by the highly philosophical nature of pre-war European sociology: the field’s focus on broad scale generalizations largely erased rural-urban difference. European sociology in the early 1900s was also almost entirely siloed within European academia, with little cross Atlantic pollination. Practical applications and research methods employed by Land Grant Colleges, the Country Life Commission, and early American rural sociologists like W.B. Du Bois were also well beyond the strictly academic sphere in which European sociologists resided. The concerns of rural people, farmers, and agriculture were simply outside the attention of most European sociologists at that time.

Post war, European academic institutions began to understand that “there was something useful in the activities of those queer people who called themselves rural sociologists.” Stronger relationships between American and European sociologists developed in the late 1940s, which was reflected in the Marshall Plan of 1948. The Plan formalized the United States as a source of information and economic guidance for postwar Europe and allocated the equivalent of 100B in 2023 dollars to help Europe rebuild, especially its food systems and machinery needed to expand agricultural production. With this aid came an infusion of empirical rural research designed to promote rural growth and agricultural success.

The United States’ influence was reflected in pedagogical changes to include rural sociological methods pioneered by American rural sociologists, particularly statistics. Education met increased government demand for sociological expertise brought by European reconstruction and a growing understanding of the importance of sociological understanding to policy making.

While the mid 20th century saw rural sociological research in most European nations driven by government need, rural sociology as an academic discipline was rare in general universities. This was due in part to the lack of university agricultural programs but also a general resistance to applied sciences. Where rural sociology classes did exist, an emerging divergence from the American model presented itself in European’s treatment of culture as an independent variable in rural sociological research. E.W. Hofstree, by all accounts the grandfather of European rural sociology, observed why cultural difference was of particular importance in Europe:

&quot;In Europe, not only between the different nations but also between an infinite number of regional and even local groups within every country, there are differences in culture, which influence the behaviour of those groups considerably... it will take a long time before Europe will show the same basic culture everywhere, and I must say that, from a personal point of view, I hope that it will take a very long time.&quot;

This departure from America’s more homogenous treatment of rural culture grounded the field in methods that require community-level planning before technical change or community development can occur. These differences somewhat receded the 1950s and 60s, when European rural sociology shifted away from sociocultural study and towards the facilitation of modern agricultural practices. This shift was driven by government interest in policy change as well as the perception that “backward [European] farmers [are] backward not only socially and culturally, but also economically and technically.”

After relatively united beginnings, European rural sociology faced internal disagreements about pedagogy, focus, and direction in the 1970s. Many felt the field had strayed too far from its sociocultural roots, become too empirical, and overly aligned with government. Critics were particularly concerned by the field’s seeming disregard for consideration of social interaction and culture, and encouraged a return to earlier modes of rural sociology that centered community structure. Ultimately, the field regained it balance between empiricism and sociocultural and institutional study in the 1980s. Considerations of European rural sociologists have since expanded to include food systems, rural-urban interface, urban poverty, and sustainable development.

Outside formal academic programs, rural sociology organizations and journals were founded in the 1950s, including Sociologia Ruralis—which still publishes today— and the European Society for Rural Sociology (ESRS). Founded in 1957 by E.W. Hofstee, the ESRS welcomes international membership, including professional rural sociologists as well as those interested in their work and holds regular congresses that promote cross boundary collaboration and the growth of rural sociology research. Its liberal internationalism and inclusivity makes it a unique interdisciplinary organization that stands somewhat apart from academia and splits its focus between theory and applied research. For example, in 2023, the ESRS’s congress included working groups on diverse topics, including rural migration, population change, place making, mental health, and the role of arts and culture in sustaining rural spaces.

Rural Spaces in Europe

The relevance of Rural Sociology to the European continent is undeniable. 44% of the EU’s total land is considered “rural,” with the Union’s newest countries including even higher percentages (upwards of 50%). More than half the population of several member states, including Slovenia, Romania, and Ireland, live in rural spaces.

While the definition of rurality in Europe has traditionally included all “non-urban” spaces academia’s definition of the term is in flux as more residents move to liminal spaces (sub-urban, peri-urban, ex-urban). Unlike the United States, European populations in urban areas are shrinking, with a noted uptick in migration back to rural and intermediary spaces over the last two decades, and especially since the end of COVID-19 lockdowns. These increasingly populated rural spaces are being met with greater economic development and tourism in the last two decades. As of 2020, 44% of Europe’s population was categorized as “intermediate”, and only 12% reside in urban space.

Despite these changes, focus on rural issues has been largely siloed within rural sociology programs. Between 2010 and 2019, the Council for European Studies hosted only one panel on Rural issues (Farm, Form, Family: Agriculture in Europe). There are signs this may be changing. Europe Now, a widely distributed mainstream academic journal, recently devoting an entire article to the intersection of European and rural studies, including articles challenging the continued applicability of the urban-rural dichotomy, land access, food, resource use disparity, and culture. This move towards interdisciplinarity reflects the human and topographical geography of Europe writ large, and foreshadows possible integration of rural sociology into mainstream academic discourse.

===Australia and New Zealand===
Rural sociology in Australia and New Zealand had a much slower start than its American and European counterparts. This is due to the lack of land grant universities which heavily invested in the discipline in the United States and a lack of interest in studying the “peasant problem” as was the case in Europe. The earliest cases of studying rural life in Australia were conducted by anthropologists and social psychologists in the 1950s, with sociologists taking on the subject beginning in the 1990s.

Attempts were made between 1935-1957 to bring an American style rural sociology to New Zealand. The New Zealand department of Agriculture, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, tasked Otago Universities economist W.T. Doig with surveying living standards in rural New Zealand in 1935. The creation and funding of such a report mirrors America&#x27;s Commission on Country Life. Additional Carnegie funds were granted to the Shelly Group who conducted the countries first major sociological community study and endorsed the creation of land grant institutions in New Zealand. Ultimately, these attempts to institutionalize rural sociology in New Zealand failed due to the departments lack of organization and failure to publish impactful survey results.

Early studies of rural sociology in the region focused on the influence of transnational agribusiness, technological changes effects on rural communities, the restructuring of rural environments, and social causes of environmental degradation. By the mid 2000&#x27;s researchers focus had shifted towards broader sociological questions and variables such as the construction and framing of gender among Australian and New Zealand farmers, governmental policies impacts on rural spaces and studies, and rural safety and crime. Scholars have additionally focused on rural residents, particularly farmers, opinions of environmentalism and environmental policies in recent years. Such a focus is particularly salient in New Zealand where livestock farming has historically been a major national source of income and environmental policies have become increasingly strict in recent years.

Though early scholars of rural sociology in Australasia tout it for its critical lens, publications in the 2010’s and 2020’s have accused the discipline of omitting the experiences of indigenous peoples, failing to account for class based differences, discounting the importance of race and ethnicity, and only recently incorporating in studies of women in rural places. Work on rural women in the region has often incorporated white feminism and used a colonial lens. As a response, scholars, particularly in New Zealand (Aotearoa), have begun to focus on the experiences of the Māori in rural areas, while likewise shifting from solving issues of farmers to rural residents. A few scholars in Australia have likewise begun to incorporate the experiences of Aboriginal peoples into their scholarship, some of whom are indigenous scholars themselves. In particular, Chelsea Joanne Ruth Watego, and Aileen Moreton-Robinson have risen to prominence in recent years, though the later two identify more as indigenous feminist scholars then rural sociology scholars.

Today many prominent scholars do not belong to a department of rural sociology, but rather related disciplines such as geography in the case of Ruth Liepins, Indigenous Studies in the case of Sandy O&#x27;Sullivan, or Arts, Education, and Law in the case of Barbara Pini. Today courses in the discipline can be studied at a small number of institutions: University of Western Sydney (Hawkesbury), Central Queensland University, Charles Sturt University, and the Department of Agriculture at the University of Queensland. Additionally, academics who publish in the discipline, such as Ann Pomeroy, Barbara Pini, Laura Rodriguez Castro, and Ruth Liepins, can be found at University of Otago, Griffith University, and Deakin University.

=== Latin America ===
The beginnings of rural sociology’s development in Latin America began in 1934 under the research of Commission of Cuban Affairs of the Foreign Policy Association member Carle C. Zimmerman. As a North American rural sociologist, he conducted a study in Cuba comparing the wealth and conditions of cane workers to that of colonizers. The results of this work ultimately resulting in a demand of rural life studies expanding to Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico largely for the sake of materials to fuel the quality of the United States’ performance in World War II.

In the midst of the war, other rural sociologists were exploring the rural life of other countries. Dr. Olen Leonard assisted in the establishment of Tingo Maria’s Agricultural Extension program, the study of which was published in 1943. While in Ecuador, Leonard attempted to establish a similar program in the Hacienda Pichalinqui region by identifying how locals gathered, the value and meaning of possessions, and the attitudes of those in the area. His work in Guatemala consisted of assisting public officials develop a long term plan for agricultural education; in Nicaragua he participated in the development of a general and agricultural population census. Glen Taggert (El Salvador), Dr. Carl Taylor (Argentina), and T. Lynn Smith (Colombia, El Salvador) all also took part in advancing Agricultural Extension programs in Latin America. Taylor’s work in particular inspired the Argentinian Institute of Agriculture to create the Institute of Rural life.

The Caracas Regional Seminar on Education in Latin America of 1948 established fundamental education as a system that would be “specifically attending to native groups in such a way as to promote their all-around development in accordance with their best cultural traditions, economic needs, and social idiosyncrasies”. This establishment catapulted a pilot project that would be explicitly tailored to the education of adults in rural communities. By the Fourth Inter-American Agricultural Conference in 1950 Montevideo, the United Nations departments of Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labour Organization were given the responsibility of becoming more involved in those activities that would benefit rural welfare. As a combined force, they were also tasked with requesting that studies be performed on conditions of social, economic, and spiritual nature as they pertain to the well-being of rural communities.

There are five ways in which Latin American rural communities are differentiated from North American rural communities in 1958:

# Village Community: Rural communities in Latin America are much more likely to be established around village communities. This type of community showed the highest prevalence in Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. This is due to these countries having stronger aboriginal elements where the villagers own the land.
# Church and State: At this point in time, Latin American countries were reported as having a government with stronger ties to religion, ideals and decision-making processes falling in line exactly with the church parish. In this same vein, municipalities are drawn almost exclusively to account for the social and economic factors of the region in an attempt to create a more natural social environment.
# Social Organization: The rural experience of Latin America is much more closely knit. Rather than being familiar or having some sort of affiliation with the entirety of the area in an “everyone knows everyone” manner, the social organization here reflects a more contained approach to relationships. Social circles extend strictly to those with which they have daily interactions, hardly straying outside. This approach means that if these few relationships do not produce a particular set of goods, then the group must go without.
# Trade and Commerce: Keeping in line with the established relationship between church and state, the portions of a rural area that would be considered the trade center in North America are referred to as “ceremonial” or “church” centers. Bartering was the dominating form of economics among Latin American countries.
# Stable Environment: Latin American rural communities did not face much in the way of threats against the sustainability of their lifestyles. Hardly any boundaries—administrative, legal, judicial, fiscal, or otherwise—obstructed the ability to maintain natural rural areas and the lives of the residents settled in them.

Mobilized peasants of the 1960s and 1970 attracted scholars to perform more in-depth studies on Latin American rural life. Conflict struck between the Marxist lean of social science and neoclassical domination of economics. Rural class structure, agrarian reform, and capitalist modes of production were all topics of discussion as the peasantry navigated their revolutionary status. The turn of the 21st century introduced the concept of “new rurality”. The shaping of Latin America’s rural economy had finally become entrenched in the newfound neoliberalism and globalization of the 1980s and 90s. Researchers claim that this has been expressed through embracing non-farm activities, feminization of rural work, growing rural-urban relations, and migration and remittances. Though some argue that no change has occurred because social ills (e.g., poverty, social injustice) prevail.

=== Asia ===
Early studies of rural sociology in Asia appear to first occur and be written about in the mid 19th and early 20th century, though the records of ancient thought on the matter of agriculturalists and peasants in rural spaces appear much earlier. India was a focus of many sociological studies in rural areas, with Henry S. Maine writing &quot;Ancient Law&quot; (1861), which studied some elements of Indian rural society. Similar texts from around that time were written by those with connections to the East India Company. Holt Mackenzie and Charles Metcalf both wrote about village communities and village life in India, and the East India Company published general reports on Indian territories like, for example, the Punjab territories from the mid 19th and early 20th century.

India, however, was not the only focus of early sociological literature on rural life in Asia. &quot;A Systematic Source Book in Rural Sociology&quot; by Pitirim A. Sorokin was published in 1930 and focused on European, Asiatic, and American literature and thought on rural sociology . Sorokin outlines ‘Ancient  Oriental Sources’ from Assyro-Babylonia, China, Egypt, India, Japan, Palestine, and Persia. He argues that caste is important for understanding agriculture in ancient India, and that the government and its structure can be used to explain the importance of agriculture and rural life in China.  Sorokin makes these conclusions by drawing on records from these countries, which indicate study and thought about the sociology of early agriculturalists and those in rural areas. The excerpts and records used “give the ancient evaluation of agriculture as being a means of group subsistence as compared with other occupations; they reflect the society’s view as to the relative rank of the cultivators in the social order; they depict ancient opinions concerning agriculture as an economic basis for the moral and social well-being of a society, as well as sever similar points. In addition, they depict in detail various laws concerning agriculture, much of the technique of ancient agriculture, the forms of ownership and possession of land, and, finally, the numerous rites and ceremonies connected with agriculture”.

It was not until later, often in the mid to late 20th century, that rural sociology as a systematic branch of academia and study appeared in Asia.

==== India ====
In India, the rise of rural sociology was, in part, due to the country’s gaining of their independence in 1947. The government needed rural sociology to aid in its understanding of “the problems of extreme poverty of the people, overpopulation and general under-development of the economy”. Studies focused on the changing nature of the role of towns, rural-urban actions since independence, rural change and what might be driving it, demographic research, rural development, and rural economies. In 1953, A. R. Desai published the first edition of &quot;Rural Sociology in India&quot;. The foreword of the book underlines the importance of understanding each aspect of society so that the Indian government could create “a uniform line of action for building a better social milieu”. Due to the popularity of Desai&#x27;s work and the expansion of the study of rural sociology in India, second and third editions of &quot;Rural Sociology in India&quot; were published in 1959 and 1961 to better represent new study foci and methodologies in this emerging field. Other popular researchers during the mid-20th century include S. C. Dube, M. N. Srinivas, and D. N. Majumdar. In India, rural sociological research and policies continued to be connected into the 21st century.

==== China ====
Before 1949, China’s rural sociological studies focused primarily on the rural class and power structures. Community studies by prominent sociologists like Fei Xiatong (Fei Hsiao-tung) were influenced by American rural sociology and were also popular in mid and early 20th century China. All sociology programs in China were terminated in 1952 by Mao Zedong. It was not until 1979, when the Chinese Sociological Association was reestablished, that sociological studies in China began again. Influences from American sociologists were welcomed during this time and continued to impact Chinese rural sociological studies into the 21st century. However, there have been pushes from contemporary Chinese rural sociologists like Yang Min and Xu Yong to reconsider this western lens.

==== Japan ====
Though rural sociology is thought to have an earlier origin in Japan than in the United States, it was not until the end of the 1930s that sociologists in the country were introduced to the methods and viewpoints of American rural sociologists. This introduction was primarily made by Eitarō Suzuki, who is considered one of the pioneers of Japanese rural and urban sociology. Other prominent Japanese rural sociological researchers of this time include Kitano Seiichi, Kizaemon Ariga, and Yozo Yamamoto. The rapid decrease in farming populations in Japan in 1955 shifted the focus of rural sociological studies in the mid 20th century to second jobs among farmers, farming cooperative associations, and the impact of community development policies on villages. Hiroyuki Torigoe of Kwansai Gakuin University was the leader of the Asian Rural Sociology working group, which was established in 1992 and later led to the development of the Asian Rural Sociological Society.

==Mission statements==
The mission statements of university departments of rural sociology have expanded to include more topics, such as sustainable development. For example, at the University of Missouri the mission is:

&quot;The Department of Rural Sociology at the University of Missouri employs the theoretical and methodological tools of rural sociology to address challenges of the 21st century – preserving our natural resources, providing safe and nutritious food for an expanding population, adapting to climate changes, and maintaining sustainable rural livelihoods.&quot;

The University of Wisconsin set up one of the first departments of rural sociology. It has now dropped the term &quot;rural&quot; and changed its name to the &quot;Department of Community and Environmental Sociology.&quot; Similarly, the Rural Sociology Program at the University of Kentucky has evolved into the. &quot;Department of Community and Leadership Development,&quot; while transferring the graduate program in rural sociology to the Sociology Department. Cornell University&#x27;s department of rural sociology has also changed its name to the department of Development Sociology.

== Associations ==
Scholarly associations in rural sociology include:
* The Rural Sociological Society (RSS), of the United States, was formed in 1937 after years of discussion as a spinoff of the American Sociological Society. It publishes the scholarly quarterly journal &quot;Rural Sociology.&quot; The full run of back issues is online from 1936 to 1989 through Cornell University Library&#x27;s program of putting online core historical resources in rural sociology.
* The European Society for Rural Sociology (ESRS) was founded in 1957. It says it is &quot;the leading European association for scientists involved in the study of agriculture and fisheries, food production and consumption, rural development and change, rurality and cultural heritage, equality and inequality in rural society, and nature and environmental care.&quot;
* The International Rural Sociology Association (IRSA) has as its mission, to &quot;foster the development of rural sociology; further the application of sociological inquiry to the improvement of the quality of rural life; and provide a mechanism whereby rural sociologists can generate dialogue and useful exchange.&quot; It published the &quot; International Journal of Sociology of Agriculture and Food.&quot;
* The International Association for Society and Natural Resources (IASNR) publishes the journal, &quot;Society &amp; Natural Resources.&quot;
* Asociación Latinoamericana de Sociologia Rural (ALASRU) as an organization founded in 1969, much of the rural sociology findings that come out of Latin America today is the work of the Asociación Latinoamericana de Sociologia Rural (Latin American Rural Sociological Association). With a combined effort of inter- and non-governmental organizations, the ALASRU aims to “promote rural development in the region; foster the dissemination and advancement of rural sociology; support the creation of national centres to carry out research in the field.”
* The Asian Rural Sociology Association (ASRA) was established in 1996. Their mission is to “cultivate the development of the science of rural sociology, to extend the possible application of results of scientific inquiry to the improvement of the quality of rural life, and to exchange and generate meaningful scientific founding for the rural development in Asia. As a non-profit organization, ARSA strives for scientific and educational purposes only”. ASRA hosted their first council meeting in Seoul, Korea in 1997 from March 7 through the 9th. It was at this council meeting that the ARSA ratified the constitution and made the decision to hold the First International Conference of ARSA in Thailand in January 1999. The overarching theme of this first conference was “Globalization and Rural Social Change”; 200 participants from 11 countries attended, and 33 papers were presented and subsequently published in the society’s first volume of the Journal of Asian Rural Sociology. The society has hosted six total conferences, with the last one in 2018 focusing on food systems. The journal has continued to publish twice a year in January and July.

<doc id="155961" wikidata="Q3737914" url="?curid=155961" title="Resource depletion">
<text>Resource depletion is the consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished. Natural resources are commonly divided between renewable resources and non-renewable resources. The use of either of these forms of resources beyond their rate of replacement is considered to be resource depletion. The value of a resource is a direct result of its availability in nature and the cost of extracting the resource. The more a resource is depleted the more the value of the resource increases. There are several types of resource depletion, including but not limited to: mining for fossil fuels and minerals, deforestation, pollution or contamination of resources, wetland and ecosystem degradation, soil erosion, overconsumption, aquifer depletion, and the excessive or unnecessary use of resources. Resource depletion is most commonly used in reference to farming, fishing, mining, water usage, and the consumption of fossil fuels. Depletion of wildlife populations is called &quot;defaunation&quot;.

Resource depletion also brings up topics regarding its history, specifically its roots in colonialism and the Industrial Revolution, depletion accounting, and the socioeconomic impacts of resource depletion, as well as the morality of resource consumption, how humanity will be impacted and what the future will look like if resource depletion continues at the current rate, Earth Overshoot Day, and when specific resources will be completely exhausted.

== History of resource depletion ==
The depletion of resources has been an issue since the beginning of the 19th century amidst the First Industrial Revolution. The extraction of both renewable and non-renewable resources increased drastically, much further than thought possible pre-industrialization, due to the technological advancements and economic development that lead to an increased demand for natural resources.

Although resource depletion has roots in both colonialism and the Industrial Revolution, it has only been of major concern since the 1970s. Before this, many people believed in the &quot;myth of inexhaustibility&quot;, which also has roots in colonialism. This can be explained as the belief that both renewable and non-renewable natural resources cannot be exhausted because there is seemingly an overabundance of these resources. This belief has caused people to not question resource depletion and ecosystem collapse when it occurred, and continues to prompt society to simply find these resources in areas which have not yet been depleted.

== Depletion accounting ==
In an effort to offset the depletion of resources, theorists have come up with the concept of depletion accounting. Related to green accounting, depletion accounting aims to account for nature&#x27;s value on an equal footing with the market economy. Resource depletion accounting uses data provided by countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them. Natural capital refers to natural resources such as mineral deposits or timber stocks. Depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion, the cost of resource extraction, and the demand for the resource. Resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries. This, in turn, leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries. Theorists argue that the implementation of resource depletion accounting is necessary in developing countries. Depletion accounting also seeks to measure the social value of natural resources and ecosystems. Measurement of social value is sought through ecosystem services, which are defined as the benefits of nature to households, communities and economies.

=== Importance ===
There are many different groups interested in depletion accounting. Environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time, hold governments accountable, or compare their environmental conditions to those of another country. Economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources, whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources.

=== Issues ===
Depletion accounting is complex to implement as nature is not as quantifiable as cars, houses, or bread. For depletion accounting to work, appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy. The main issues that arise when trying to do so are, determining a suitable unit of account, deciding how to deal with the &quot;collective&quot; nature of a complete ecosystem, delineating the borderline of the ecosystem, and defining the extent of possible duplication when the resource interacts in more than one ecosystem. Some economists want to include measurement of the benefits arising from public goods provided by nature, but currently there are no market indicators of value. Globally, environmental economics has not been able to provide a consensus of measurement units of nature&#x27;s services.

== Minerals depletion ==
Minerals are needed to provide food, clothing, and housing. A United States Geological Survey (USGS) study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel, non-food sector of the economy; an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone, sand, and gravel used in construction.

Large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the Industrial Revolution around 1760 in England and has grown rapidly ever since. Technological improvements have allowed humans to dig deeper and access lower grades and different types of ore over that time. Virtually all basic industrial metals (copper, iron, bauxite, etc.), as well as rare earth minerals, face production output limitations from time to time, because supply involves large up-front investments and is therefore slow to respond to rapid increases in demand.

Minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years:

* Oil conventional (2005)
* Oil all liquides (2017). Old expectation: Gasoline (2023)
* Copper (2017). Old expectation: Copper (2024). Data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) suggest that it is very unlikely that copper production will peak before 2040.
* Coal per KWh (2017). Old expectation per ton: (2060)
* Zinc. Developments in hydrometallurgy have transformed non-sulfide zinc deposits (largely ignored until now) into large low cost reserves.

Minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the present century:

* Aluminium (2057)
* Iron (2068)
Such projections may change, as new discoveries are made and typically misinterpret available data on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.
* Phosphor (2048). The last 80% of world reserves are only one mine.

== Overfishing ==

Overfishing refers to the overconsumption and/or depletion of fish populations which occurs when fish are caught at a rate that exceeds their ability to breed and replenish their population naturally. Regions particularly susceptible to overfishing include the Arctic, coastal east Africa, the Coral Triangle (located between the Pacific and Indian oceans), Central and Latin America, and the Caribbean. The depletion of fish stocks can lead to long-term negative consequences for marine ecosystems, economies, and food security. The depletion of resources hinders economic growth because growing economies leads to increased demand for natural, renewable resources like fish. Thus, when resources are depleted, it initiates a cycle of reduced resource availability, increased demand and higher prices due to scarcity, and lower economic growth. Overfishing can lead to habitat and biodiversity loss, through specifically habitat degradation, which has an immense impact on marine/aquatic ecosystems. Habitat loss refers to when a natural habitat cannot sustain/support the species that live in it, and biodiversity loss refers to when there is a decrease in the population of a species in a specific area and/or the extinction of a species. Habitat degradation is caused by the depletion of resources, in which human activities are the primary driving force. One major impact that the depletion of fish stocks causes is a dynamic change and erosion to marine food webs, which can ultimately lead to ecosystem collapse because of the imbalance created for other marine species. Overfishing also causes instability in marine ecosystems because these ecosystems are less biodiverse and more fragile. This occurs mainly because, due to overfishing, many fish species are unable to naturally sustain their populations in these damaged ecosystems.

Most common causes of overfishing:

* Increasing consumption: According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), aquatic foods like fish significantly contribute to food security and initiatives to end worldwide hunger. However, global consumption of aquatic foods has increased at twice the rate of population growth since the 1960s, significantly contributing to the depletion of fish stocks.
* Climate change: Due to climate change and the sudden increasing temperatures of our oceans, fish stocks and other marine life are being negatively impacted. These changes force fish stocks to change their migratory routes, and without a reduction in fishing, this leads to overfishing and depletion because the same amount of fish are being caught in areas that now have lower fish populations.
* Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing: Illegal fishing involves conducting fishing operations that break the laws and regulations at the regional and international levels around fishing, including fishing without a license or permit, fishing in protected areas, and/or catching protected species of fish. Unreported fishing involves conducting fishing operation which are not reported, or are misreported to authorities according to the International and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Unregulated fishing involves conducting fishing operations in areas which do not have conservation measures put in place, and cannot be effectively monitored because of the lack of regulations.
* Fisheries subsidies: A subsidy is financial assistance paid by the government to support a particular activity, industry, or group. Subsidies are often provided to reduce start up costs, stimulate production, or encourage consumption. In the case of fisheries subsidies, it enables fishing fleets to catch more fish by fishing further out in a body of water, and fish for longer periods of time.

== Wetlands ==
Wetlands are ecosystems that are often saturated by enough surface or groundwater to sustain vegetation that is usually adapted to saturated soil conditions, such as cattails, bulrushes, red maples, wild rice, blackberries, cranberries, and peat moss. Because some varieties of wetlands are rich in minerals and nutrients and provide many of the advantages of both land and water environments, they contain diverse species and provide a distinct basis for the food chain. Wetland habitats contribute to environmental health and biodiversity. Wetlands are a nonrenewable resource on a human timescale and in some environments cannot ever be renewed. Recent studies indicate that global loss of wetlands could be as high as 87% since 1700 AD, with 64% of wetland loss occurring since 1900. Some loss of wetlands resulted from natural causes such as erosion, sedimentation, subsidence, and a rise in the sea level.

Wetlands provide environmental services for:

# Food and habitat
# Improving water quality
# Commercial fishing
# Floodwater reduction
# Shoreline stabilization
# Recreation

=== Resources in wetlands ===

Some of the world&#x27;s most successful agricultural areas are wetlands that have been drained and converted to farmland for large-scale agriculture. Large-scale draining of wetlands also occurs for real estate development and urbanization. In contrast, in some cases wetlands are also flooded to be converted to recreational lakes or hydropower generation. In some countries ranchers have also moved their property onto wetlands for grazing due to the nutrient rich vegetation. Wetlands in Southern America also prove a fruitful resource for poachers, as animals with valuable hides such a jaguars, maned wolves, caimans, and snakes are drawn to wetlands. The effect of the removal of large predators is still unknown in South African wetlands.

Humans benefit from wetlands in indirect ways as well. Wetlands act as natural water filters, when runoff from either natural or man-made processes pass through, wetlands can have a neutralizing effect. If a wetland is in between an agricultural zone and a freshwater ecosystem, fertilizer runoff will be absorbed by the wetland and used to fuel the slow processes that occur happen, by the time the water reaches the freshwater ecosystem there will not be enough fertilizer to cause destructive algal blooms that poison freshwater ecosystems.
=== Non-natural causes of wetland degradation ===

*Hydrologic alteration
**drainage
**dredging
**stream channelization
**ditching
**levees
**deposition of fill material
**stream diversion
**groundwater drainage
**impoundment
*Urbanization and urban development
*Marinas/boats
*Industrialization and industrial development
*Agriculture
*Silviculture/Timber harvest
*Mining
*Atmospheric deposition

To preserve the resources extracted from wetlands, current strategies are to rank wetlands and prioritize the conservation of wetlands with more environmental services, create more efficient irrigation for wetlands being used for agriculture, and restricting access to wetlands by tourists.
== Groundwater ==

Water is an essential resource needed for survival. Water access has a profound influence on a society&#x27;s prosperity and success. Groundwater is water that is in saturated zones underground, the upper surface of the saturated zone is called the water table. Groundwater is held in the pores and fractures of underground materials like sand, gravel and other rock, these rock materials are called aquifers. Groundwater can either flow naturally out of rock materials or can be pumped out. Groundwater supplies wells and aquifers for private, agricultural, and public use and is used by more than a third of the world&#x27;s population every day for their drinking water. Globally there is 22.6 million cubic kilometers of groundwater available; of this, only 0.35 million of that is renewable.

=== Groundwater as a non-renewable resource ===
Groundwater is considered to be a non-renewable resource because less than six percent of the water around the world is replenished and renewed on a human timescale of 50 years. People are already using non-renewable water that is thousands of years old, in areas like Egypt they are using water that may have been renewed a million years ago which is not renewable on human timescales. Of the groundwater used for agriculture, 16–33% is non-renewable. It is estimated that since the 1960s groundwater extraction has more than doubled, which has increased groundwater depletion. Due to this increase in depletion, in some of the most depleted areas use of groundwater for irrigation has become impossible or cost prohibitive.

=== Environmental impacts ===
Overusing groundwater, old or young, can lower subsurface water levels and dry up streams, which could have a huge effect on ecosystems on the surface. When the most easily recoverable fresh groundwater is removed this leaves a residual with inferior water quality. This is in part from induced leakage from the land surface, confining layers or adjacent aquifers that contain saline or contaminated water. Worldwide the magnitude of groundwater depletion from storage may be so large as to constitute a measurable contributor to sea-level rise.

=== Mitigation ===
Currently, societies respond to water-resource depletion by shifting management objectives from location and developing new supplies to augmenting conserving and reallocation of existing supplies. There are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion, the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone, regardless of water quality considerations. A second perspective views depletion as a reduction in the usable volume of fresh groundwater in storage.

Augmenting supplies can mean improving water quality or increasing water quantity. Depletion due to quality considerations can be overcome by treatment, whereas large volume metric depletion can only be alleviated by decreasing discharge or increasing recharge. Artificial recharge of storm flow and treated municipal wastewater, has successfully reversed groundwater declines. In the future improved infiltration and recharge technologies will be more widely used to maximize the capture of runoff and treated wastewater.

== Resource depletion and the future ==

=== Earth Overshoot Day ===

Earth Overshoot Day (EOD) is the date when humanity&#x27;s demand for ecological resources exceeds Earth&#x27;s ability to regenerate these resources in a given year. EOD is calculated by the Global Footprint Network, and organization that develops annual impact reports, based on data bout resource use in the previous year. EOD is announced each year on June 5, which is World Environment Day, and continues to get earlier each year. For example, Earth Overshoot Day 2023 was August 2, compared to in 2010 where it fell on August 10 and in 2000 where it fell on September 17. The Global Footprint Network calculates Earth Overshoot Day by dividing world biocapacity by world ecological footprint and multiplying that by 365 days (366 days during a leap year). World biocapacity refers to the total amount of natural resources that Earth can regenerate in a year. World ecological footprint refers to the total amount of resource that society consumes in a year, including things like energy, food, water, agricultural land, forest land, etc. Earth Overshoot Day can be calculated for Earth as a whole, but also for each country individually. For example, in a middle income country like Morocco, their 2023 country specific overshoot day was December 22, compared to a high income country like the United States of America which consumes a lot more resources, their 2023 country specific overshoot day was March 14. The goal is to push Earth Overshoot Day back far enough to where humanity would be living within Earth&#x27;s ecological means and not surpassing what it can sustainably provide each year.

=== The World Counts ===
According to The World Counts, a source which collects data from a number of organizations, research institutes, and news services, and produces statistical countdown clocks that illustrate the negative trends related to the environment and other global challenges, humanity is in trouble if current consumption patterns continue. At society&#x27;s current consumption rate, approximately 1.8 Earths are needed in order to provide resources in a sustainable capacity, and there is just under 26 years until resources are depleted to a point where Earth&#x27;s capacity to support life may collapse. It is also estimated that approximately 29% of all species on Earth are currently at risk of extinction. As well, 25 billion tons of resources have been extracted this year alone, this includes but is not limited to natural resources like fish, wood, metals, minerals, water, and energy. The World Counts shows that there is 15 years until Earth is exhausted of freshwater, and 23 years until there are no more fish in the oceans. They also estimate that 15 billion trees are cut down every year, while only 2 billion trees are planted every year, and that there is only 75 years until rainforests are completely gone.

==Resource scarcity as a moral problem==
Researchers who produced an update of the Club of Rome&#x27;s &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; report find that many people deny the existence of the problem of scarcity, including many leading scientists and politicians. This may be due, for example, to an unwillingness to change one&#x27;s own consumption patterns or to share scarce natural resources more equally, or to a psychological defence mechanism.

The scarcity of resources raises a central moral problem concerning the distribution and allocation of natural resources. Competition means that the most advanced get the most resources, which often means the developed West. The problem here is that the West has developed partly through colonial slave labour and violence, and partly through protectionist policies, which together have left many other, non-Western countries underdeveloped. 

In the future, international cooperation in sharing scarce resources will become increasingly important. Where scarcity is concentrated on the non-renewable resources that play the most important role in meeting needs, the most essential element for the realisation of human rights is an adequate and equitable allocation of scarcity. Inequality, taken to its extreme, causes intense discontent, which can lead to social unrest and even armed conflict. Many experts believe that ensuring equitable development is the only sure way to a peaceful distribution of scarcity.

Another approach to resource depletion is a combined process of de-resourcification and resourcification. Where one strives to put an end to the social processes of turning unsustainable things into resources, for example, non-renewable natural resources, and the other strives to instead develop processes of turning sustainable things into resources, for example, renewable human resources.

<text>David Roy Eldridge (January 30, 1911 – February 26, 1989), nicknamed &quot;Little Jazz&quot;, was an American jazz trumpeter. His sophisticated use of harmony, including the use of tritone substitutions, his virtuosic solos exhibiting a departure from the dominant style of jazz trumpet innovator Louis Armstrong, and his strong impact on Dizzy Gillespie mark him as one of the most influential musicians of the swing era and a precursor of bebop.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Eldridge was born on the North Side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 30, 1911, to parents Alexander, a wagon teamster, and Blanche, a gifted pianist with a talent for reproducing music by ear, a trait that Eldridge claimed to have inherited from her. Eldridge began playing the piano at the age of five; he claimed to have been able to play coherent blues licks at even this young age. The young Eldridge looked up to his older brother, Joe Eldridge (born Joseph Eldridge, 1908, North Side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, died March 5, 1952), particularly because of Joe&#x27;s diverse musical talents on the violin, alto saxophone, and clarinet. Roy took up the drums at the age of six, taking lessons and playing locally. Joe recognized his brother&#x27;s natural talent on the bugle, which Roy played in a local church band, and tried to convince Roy to play the valved trumpet. When Roy began to play drums in his brother&#x27;s band, Joe soon convinced him to pick up the trumpet, but Roy made little effort to gain proficiency on the instrument at first. It was not until the death of their mother, when Roy was eleven, and his father&#x27;s subsequent remarriage that Roy began practicing more rigorously, locking himself in his room for hours, and particularly honing the instrument&#x27;s upper register. From an early age, Roy lacked proficiency at sight-reading, a gap in his musical education that would affect him for much of his early career, but he could replicate melodies by ear very effectively.

=== Career ===

==== Early career and traveling bands ====
Eldridge led and played in a number of bands during his early years, moving extensively throughout the American Midwest. He absorbed the influence of saxophonists Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins, setting himself the task of learning Hawkins&#x27;s 1926 solo on &quot;The Stampede&quot; (by Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Orchestra) in developing an equivalent trumpet style.

Eldridge left home after being expelled from high school in ninth grade, joining a traveling show at the age of sixteen; the show soon folded, however, and he was left in Youngstown, Ohio. He was then picked up by the &quot;Greater Sheesley Carnival,&quot; but returned to Pittsburgh after witnessing acts of racism in Cumberland, Maryland that significantly disturbed him. Eldridge soon found work leading a small band in the traveling &quot;Rock Dinah&quot; show, his performance therein leading swing-era bandleader Count Basie to recall young Roy Eldridge as &quot;the greatest trumpet I&#x27;d ever heard in my life.&quot; Eldridge continued playing with similar traveling groups until returning home to Pittsburgh at the age of 17.

At the age of 20, Eldridge led a band in Pittsburgh, billed as &quot;Roy Elliott and his Palais Royal Orchestra&quot;, the agent intentionally changing Eldridge&#x27;s name because &quot;he thought it more classy.&quot; Roy left this position to try out for the orchestra of Horace Henderson, younger brother of famed New York City bandleader Fletcher Henderson, and joined the ensemble, generally referred to as The Fletcher Henderson Stompers, Under the Direction of Horace Henderson. Eldridge then played with a number of other territory bands, staying for a short while in Detroit before joining Speed Webb&#x27;s band which, having garnered a degree of movie publicity, began a tour of the Midwest. Many of the members of Webb&#x27;s band, annoyed by the leader&#x27;s lack of dedication, left to form a practically identical group with Eldridge as bandleader. The ensemble was short-lived, and Eldridge soon moved to Milwaukee, where he took part in a celebrated cutting contest with trumpet player Cladys &quot;Jabbo&quot; Smith, with whom he later became good friends.

==== New York and Chicago ====
Eldridge moved to New York in November 1930, playing in various bands in the early 1930s, including a number of Harlem dance bands with Cecil Scott, Elmer Snowden, Charlie Johnson, and Teddy Hill. It was during this time that Eldridge received his nickname, &#x27;Little Jazz&#x27;, from Ellington saxophonist Otto Hardwick, who was amused by the incongruity between Eldridge&#x27;s raucous playing and his short stature. At this time, Eldridge was also making records and radio broadcasts under his own name. He laid down his first recorded solos with Teddy Hill in 1935, which gained almost immediate popularity. For a brief time, he also led his own band at the reputed Famous Door nightclub. Eldridge recorded a number of small group sides with singer Billie Holiday in July 1935, including &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&quot; and &quot;Miss Brown to You&quot;, employing a Dixieland-influenced improvisation style. In October 1935, Eldridge joined Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Orchestra, playing lead trumpet and occasionally singing. Until he left the group in early September 1936, Eldridge was Henderson&#x27;s featured soloist, his talent highlighted by such numbers as &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; and &quot;Blue Lou.&quot; His rhythmic power to swing a band was a dynamic trademark of the jazz of the time. It has been said that &quot;from the mid-Thirties onwards, he had superseded Louis Armstrong as the exemplar of modern &#x27;hot&#x27; trumpet playing&quot;.

In the fall of 1936, Eldridge moved to Chicago to form an octet with older brother Joe Eldridge playing saxophone and arranging. The ensemble boasted nightly broadcasts and made recordings that featured his extended solos, including &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; and &quot;Wabash Stomp.&quot; Eldridge, fed up with the racism he had encountered in the music industry, quit playing in 1938 to study radio engineering. He was back to playing in 1939, when he formed a ten-piece band that gained a residency at New York&#x27;s Arcadia Ballroom.

==== With Gene Krupa&#x27;s Orchestra ====
In April 1941, after receiving many offers from white swing bands, Eldridge joined Gene Krupa&#x27;s Orchestra, and was successfully featured with rookie singer Anita O&#x27;Day. In accepting this position, Eldridge became one of the first black musicians to become a permanent member of a white big band. Eldridge was critical in changing the course of Krupa&#x27;s big band from pop-oriented &quot;schmaltz&quot; to jazz. The group&#x27;s cover of Jimmy Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Green Eyes,&quot; previously an entirely orchestral work, was transformed into jazz via Eldridge&#x27;s playing; critic Dave Oliphant notes that Eldridge &quot;lift[ed]&quot; the tune &quot;to a higher level of intensity.&quot; Eldridge and O&#x27;Day were featured in a number of recordings, including the novelty hit &quot;Let Me Off Uptown&quot; and &quot;Knock Me a Kiss&quot;.

One of Eldridge&#x27;s best known recorded solos is on a rendition of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s tune, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, arranged by Benny Carter as something like a concerto for Eldridge. Jazz historian Gunther Schuller referred to Eldridge&#x27;s solo on &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot; as &quot;a strong and at times tremendously moving performance&quot;, although he disapproved of the &quot;opening and closing cadenzas, the latter unforgivably aping the corniest of operatic cadenza traditions.&quot; Critic and author Dave Oliphant describes Eldridge&#x27;s unique tone on &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot; as &quot;a raspy, buzzy tone, which enormously heightens his playing&#x27;s intensity, emotionally and dynamically&quot; and writes that it &quot;was also meant to hurt a little, to be disturbing, to express unfathomable stress.&quot;

After complaints from Eldridge that O&#x27;Day was upstaging him, the band broke up when Krupa was jailed for marijuana possession in July 1943.

==== Touring, freelancing, and small group work ====
After leaving Krupa&#x27;s band, Eldridge freelanced in New York during 1943 before joining Artie Shaw&#x27;s band in 1944. Owing to racial incidents that he faced while playing in Shaw&#x27;s band, he left in October 1945 to form a big band, but this eventually proved financially unsuccessful, and Eldridge returned to small group work.

In the postwar years, he became part of the group which toured under the Jazz at the Philharmonic banner. and became one of the stalwarts of the tours. The JATP&#x27;s organiser Norman Granz said that Roy Eldridge typified the spirit of jazz. &quot;Every time he&#x27;s on he does the best he can, no matter what the conditions are. And Roy is so intense about everything, so that it&#x27;s far more important to him to dare, to try to achieve a particular peak, even if he falls on his ass in the attempt, than it is to play safe. That&#x27;s what jazz is all about.&quot;

Eldridge moved to Paris, France, in 1950 while on tour with Benny Goodman, before returning to New York in 1951 to lead a band at the Birdland jazz club. He additionally performed from 1952 until the early 1960s in small groups with Coleman Hawkins, Ella Fitzgerald and Earl Hines among others, and also began to record for Granz at this time. By 1956, his recordings were showcased on national radio networks by Ben Selvin as part of the RCA Thesaurus transcriptions library. Eldridge also toured with Ella Fitzgerald from late 1963 until March 1965 and with Count Basie from July until September 1966 before returning to freelance playing and touring at festivals.

In 1960, Eldridge participated, alongside Abbey Lincoln, Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Kenny Dorham and others, in recordings by the Jazz Artists Guild, a short-lived grouping formed by Mingus and Max Roach as a reaction to the perceived commercialism of the Newport Festival. These resulted in the &quot;Newport Jazz Rebels&quot; LP.

==== Racial barriers ====
As the featured soloist in Artie Shaw and Gene Krupa&#x27;s bands, Eldridge was something of an exception, as black musicians in the 1930s were not allowed to appear in public with white bands. Artie Shaw commented on the difficulty Roy had in his band, noting that &quot;Droves of people would ask him for his autograph at the end of the night, but later, on the bus, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to get off and buy a hamburger with the guys in the band.&quot; Krupa, on at least one occasion, spent several hours in jail and paid fines for starting a fistfight with a restaurant manager who refused to let Eldridge eat with the rest of the band.

=== Late life ===
Eldridge became the leader of the house band at Jimmy Ryan&#x27;s jazz club on Manhattan&#x27;s West 54th Street for several years, beginning in 1969. Although Ryan&#x27;s was primarily a Dixieland venue, Eldridge tried to combine the traditional Dixieland style with his own more brash and speedy playing. Eldridge was incapacitated by a stroke in 1970, but continued to lead the group at Ryan&#x27;s soon after and performing occasionally as a singer, drummer and pianist. Writer Michael Zirpolo, seeing Eldridge at Ryan&#x27;s in the late 1970s, observed: &quot;I was amazed that he still could pop out those piercing high notes, but he did, with frequency...I worried about his health, because the veins at his temples would bulge alarmingly.&quot; As leader at Ryan&#x27;s, Eldridge was noted for his occasional hijinx, including impromptu &quot;amateur night&quot; sessions during which he&#x27;d invite inexperienced players on stage to lead his band, often for comedic effect and to give himself a break. In 1971, Eldridge was inducted into &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jazz Hall of Fame.

Eldridge has a Queens street sign at Liberty Avenue, part of the Jazz Greats along the Van Wyck Expressway, which commemorates Queens as the home of jazz in the 1940s and &#x27;50s. He had his home in Hollis, Queens. 
After suffering a heart attack in 1980, Eldridge gave up playing the trumpet. He did however occasionally play the piano and can be heard as late as 1986 in an edition of Marian McPartland&#x27;s &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; He died at the age of 78 at the Franklin General Hospital in Valley Stream, New York, three weeks after the death of his wife, Viola.

===Influences===
According to Roy, his first major influence on the trumpet was Rex Stewart, who played in a band with young Roy and his brother Joe in Pittsburgh. But unlike many trumpet players, the young Eldridge did not derive most of his inspiration from other trumpeters, but from saxophonists. Roy first developed his solo style by playing along to recordings of Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and later said that, after hearing these musicians: &quot;I resolved to play my trumpet like a sax.&quot; Following these musicians was evidently beneficial to Roy, who got one of his first jobs by auditioning with an imitation of Coleman Hawkins&#x27; solo on Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Stampede&quot; of 1926. Eldridge additionally purports to have studied the styles of white cornettist Loring &quot;Red&quot; Nichols and Theodore &quot;Cuban&quot; Bennett, whose style was also very much influenced by the saxophone. Eldridge, by his own report, was not significantly influenced by trumpeter Louis Armstrong during his early years, but did undertake a major study of Armstrong&#x27;s style in 1932.

==== Style ====
Eldridge was very versatile on his horn, not only quick and articulate with the low to middle registers, but the high registers as well; jazz critic Gary Giddins described Eldridge as having a &quot;flashy, passionate, many-noted style that rampaged freely through three octaves, rich with harmonic ideas impervious to the fastest tempos.&quot; Eldridge is frequently grouped among those jazz trumpeters of the 1930s and &#x27;40s, including Red Allen, Hot Lips Page, Shad Collins, and Rex Stewart who eschewed Louis Armstrong&#x27;s lyrical style for a rougher and more frantic style. Of these players, critic Gary Giddins names Eldridge &quot;the most emotionally compelling, versatile, rugged, and far-reaching.&quot; Eldridge was also lauded for the intensity of his playing; Ella Fitzgerald once said: &quot;He&#x27;s got more soul in one note that a lot of people could get into the whole song.&quot; The high register lines that Eldridge employed were one of many prominent features of his playing, and Eldridge expressed a penchant for the expressive ability of the instrument&#x27;s highest notes, frequently incorporating them into his solos. Eldridge was also known for his fast style of playing, often executing blasts of rapid double-time notes followed by a return to standard time. His rapid-fire style was noted by jazz trumpeter Bill Coleman when Roy was as young as seventeen; when asked by Coleman how he achieved his speed, Eldridge replied: &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve taken the tops off my valves and now they really fly.&quot; Eldridge attributes these virtuosic elements of his style to a rigorous practice regime, particularly as a teen: &quot;I used to spend eight, nine hours a day practicing every day.&quot; Critic J. Bradford Robinson sums up his style of playing as exhibiting &quot;a keen awareness of harmony, an unprecedented dexterity, particularly in the highest register, and a full, slightly overblown timbre, which crackled at moments of high tension.&quot; Giddins also notes that Eldridge &quot;never had a pure or golden tone; his sound was always underscored by a vocal rasp, an urgent, human roughness.&quot;

As for Eldridge&#x27;s singing style, jazz critic Whitney Balliett describes Eldridge as &quot;a fine, scampish jazz singer, with a light, hoarse voice and a highly rhythmic attack,&quot; comparing him to American jazz trumpeter and vocalist Hot Lips Page.

==== Musical impact ====
Eldridge&#x27;s fast playing and extensive development of the instrument&#x27;s upper register were heavy influences on Dizzy Gillespie, who, along with Charlie Parker, brought bebop into existence. Tracks such as &quot;Heckler&#x27;s Hop&quot;, from Eldridge&#x27;s small group recordings with alto saxophonist and clarinettist Scoops Carry, in which Eldridge&#x27;s use of the high register is particularly emphasized, were especially influential for Dizzy. Dizzy got the chance to engage in numerous jam sessions and &quot;trumpet battles&quot; with Eldridge at New York&#x27;s Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in the early 1940s. Referring to Eldridge, Dizzy went so far as to say: &quot;He was the Messiah of our generation.&quot; Eldridge first heard Dizzy on bandleader Lionel Hampton&#x27;s 1939 recording of &quot;Hot Mallets&quot;, and later recalled: &quot;I heard this trumpet solo and I thought it was me. Then I found out it was Dizzy.&quot; A careful listening to bebop standards, such as the song &quot;Bebop&quot;, reveals how much Eldridge influenced this genre of jazz. Eldridge also claimed that he was not impressed with Dizzy&#x27;s bop solo style, saying once to bebop trumpeter Howard McGhee after jamming with Dizzy at the Heat Wave club in Harlem: &quot;I don&#x27;t dig it...I &quot;really&quot; don&#x27;t understand him.&quot; Although frequently touted as the bridge between Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, Eldridge always insisted: &quot;I was never trying to be a bridge between Armstrong and something.&quot;

Other significant musicians influenced by Roy Eldridge include Shorty Sherock of the Bob Crosby Orchestra, and bebop pioneers Howard McGhee and Fats Navarro.

=== Personality ===
Eldridge was famously considered competitive by those who knew him with pianist Chuck Folds saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine anyone more competitive than he [Roy] was in the 1970s. I&#x27;ve never met anyone scrappier than Roy, ever, ever, ever.&quot; Eldridge fully admitted to his competitive spirit, saying &quot;I was just trying to outplay anybody, and to outplay them my way.&quot; Jazz trumpeter Jonah Jones reports that Eldridge&#x27;s willingness to &quot;go anywhere and play against anyone&quot; even led to a cutting contest with his own hero, Rex Stewart. Roy could also become antagonistic, particularly in the face of those he deemed racist. Many noted Roy&#x27;s constant restlessness with saxophonist Billie Bowen noting that Roy &quot;could never, even as a youngster, sit down for more than a few minutes, he was always restless.&quot; Eldridge is also said to have suffered from sporadic stage fright. He occasionally found himself in trouble with women which included an incident that involved his being forced to sell his trumpet temporarily in order to reclaim a portion of the money that had been stolen from him by a woman with whom he had drunkenly spent the night. Roy is also said to have developed a fiery temper later in life according to clarinettist Joe Muranyi. Muranyi worked with Eldridge at Ryan&#x27;s and has called Eldridge&#x27;s temper &quot;Mt. Vesuvius to the fifth power.&quot;

<text>Maxwell Lemuel Roach (January 10, 1924 – August 16, 2007) was an American jazz drummer and composer. A pioneer of bebop, he worked in many other styles of music, and is generally considered one of the most important drummers in history. He worked with many famous jazz musicians, including Clifford Brown, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Abbey Lincoln, Dinah Washington, Charles Mingus, Billy Eckstine, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, Eric Dolphy, and Booker Little. He also played with his daughter Maxine Roach, a Grammy nominated violist. He was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame in 1980 and the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1992.

In the mid-1950s, Roach co-led a pioneering quintet along with trumpeter Clifford Brown. In 1970, he founded the percussion ensemble M&#x27;Boom.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Max Roach was born to Alphonse and Cressie Roach in the Township of Newland, Pasquotank County, North Carolina, which borders the southern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp. The Township of Newland is sometimes mistaken for Newland Town in Avery County, North Carolina.

Roach&#x27;s family moved to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, when he was four years old. He grew up in a musical home with his gospel singer mother. He started to play bugle in parades at a young age. At the age of 10, he was already playing drums in some gospel bands.

In 1942, as an 18-year-old recently graduated from Boys High School in Brooklyn, he was called to fill in for Sonny Greer with the Duke Ellington Orchestra performing at the Paramount Theater in Manhattan. He started going to the jazz clubs on 52nd Street and at 78th Street &amp; Broadway for Georgie Jay&#x27;s Taproom, where he played with schoolmate Cecil Payne. His first professional recording took place in December 1943, backing Coleman Hawkins.

He was one of the first drummers, along with Kenny Clarke, to play in the bebop style. Roach performed in bands led by Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Coleman Hawkins, Bud Powell, and Miles Davis. He played on many of Parker&#x27;s most important records, including the Savoy Records November 1945 session, which marked a turning point in recorded jazz. His early brush work with Powell&#x27;s trio, especially at fast tempos, has been highly praised.

Roach nurtured an interest in and respect for Afro-Caribbean music and traveled to Haiti in the late 1940s to study with the traditional drummer Ti Roro.

===1950s===

Roach studied classical percussion at the Manhattan School of Music from 1950 to 1953, working toward a Bachelor of Music degree. The school awarded him an Honorary Doctorate in 1990.

In 1952, Roach co-founded Debut Records with bassist Charles Mingus, one of the first artist-owned labels. The label released a record of a May 15, 1953, concert billed as &quot;the greatest concert ever&quot;, which came to be known as &quot;Jazz at Massey Hall&quot;, featuring Parker, Gillespie, Powell, Mingus, and Roach. Also released on this label was the groundbreaking bass-and-drum free improvisation, &quot;Percussion Discussion&quot;.

In 1954, Roach and trumpeter Clifford Brown formed a quintet that also featured tenor saxophonist Harold Land, pianist Richie Powell (brother of Bud Powell), and bassist George Morrow. Land left the quintet the following year and was replaced by Sonny Rollins. The group was a prime example of the hard bop style also played by Art Blakey and Horace Silver. Later that year, he relocated to the Los Angeles area, where he replaced Shelly Manne in the popular Lighthouse All Stars.

Brown and Richie Powell were killed in a car accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in June 1956. The first album Roach recorded after their deaths was &quot;Max Roach + 4&quot;. After Brown and Powell&#x27;s deaths, Roach continued leading a similarly configured group, with Kenny Dorham (and later Booker Little) on trumpet, George Coleman on tenor, and pianist Ray Bryant. Roach expanded the standard form of hard bop using 3/4 waltz rhythms and modality in 1957 with his album &quot;Jazz in 3/4 Time&quot;. During this period, Roach recorded a series of other albums for EmArcy Records featuring the brothers Stanley and Tommy Turrentine.

In 1955, he played drums for vocalist Dinah Washington at several live appearances and recordings. He appeared with Washington at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958, which was filmed, and at the 1954 live studio audience recording of &quot;Dinah Jams&quot;, considered to be one of the best and most overlooked vocal jazz albums of its genre.

===1960s–1970s===
In 1960 he composed and recorded the album &quot;We Insist!&quot; (subtitled &quot;Max Roach&#x27;s Freedom Now Suite)&quot;, with vocals by his then-wife Abbey Lincoln and lyrics by Oscar Brown Jr., after being invited to contribute to commemorations of the hundredth anniversary of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation. In 1962, he recorded the album &quot;Money Jungle&quot;, a collaboration with Mingus and Duke Ellington. This is generally regarded as one of the finest trio albums ever recorded.

During the 1970s, Roach formed M&#x27;Boom, a percussion orchestra. Each member composed for the ensemble and performed on multiple percussion instruments. Personnel included Fred King, Joe Chambers, Warren Smith, Freddie Waits, Roy Brooks, Omar Clay, Ray Mantilla, Francisco Mora, and Eli Fountain.

Long involved in jazz education, in 1972 Roach was recruited to the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Amherst by Chancellor Randolph Bromery. He taught at the university until the mid-1990s.

===1980s–1990s===

In the early 1980s, Roach began presenting solo concerts, demonstrating that multiple percussion instruments performed by one player could fulfill the demands of solo performance and be entirely satisfying to an audience. He created memorable compositions in these solo concerts, and a solo record was released by the Japanese jazz label Baystate. One of his solo concerts is available on a video, which also includes footage of a recording date for &quot;Chattahoochee Red&quot;, featuring his working quartet, Odean Pope, Cecil Bridgewater, and Calvin Hill.

Roach also embarked on a series of duet recordings. Departing from the style he was best known for, most of the music on these recordings is free improvisation, created with Cecil Taylor, Anthony Braxton, Archie Shepp, and Abdullah Ibrahim. Roach created duets with other performers, including: a recorded duet with oration of the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech by Martin Luther King Jr.; a duet with video artist Kit Fitzgerald, who improvised video imagery while Roach created the music; a duet with his lifelong friend and associate Gillespie; and a duet concert recording with Mal Waldron.

During the 1980s Roach also wrote music for theater, including plays by Sam Shepard. He was composer and musical director for a festival of Shepard plays, called &quot;ShepardSets&quot;, at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in 1984. The festival included productions of &quot;Back Bog Beast Bait&quot;, &quot;Angel City&quot;, and &quot;Suicide in B Flat&quot;. In 1985, George Ferencz directed &quot;Max Roach Live at La MaMa: A Multimedia Collaboration&quot;.

Roach found new contexts for performance, creating unique musical ensembles. One of these groups was &quot;The Double Quartet&quot;, featuring his regular performing quartet with the same personnel as above, except Tyrone Brown replaced Hill. This quartet joined &quot;The Uptown String Quartet&quot;, led by his daughter Maxine Roach and featuring Diane Monroe, Lesa Terry, and Eileen Folson.

Another ensemble was the &quot;So What Brass Quintet&quot;, a group comprising five brass instrumentalists and Roach, with no chordal instrument and no bass player. Much of the performance consisted of drums and horn duets. The ensemble consisted of two trumpets, trombone, French horn, and tuba. Personnel included Cecil Bridgewater, Frank Gordon, Eddie Henderson, Rod McGaha, Steve Turre, Delfeayo Marsalis, Robert Stewart, Tony Underwood, Marshall Sealy, Mark Taylor, and Dennis Jeter.

Not content to expand on the music he was already known for, Roach spent the 1980s and 1990s finding new forms of musical expression and performance. He performed a concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He wrote for and performed with the Walter White gospel choir and the John Motley Singers. He also performed with dance companies, including the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Dianne McIntyre Dance Company, and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. He surprised his fans by performing in a hip hop concert featuring Fab Five Freddy and the New York Break Dancers. Roach expressed the insight that there was a strong kinship between the work of these young black artists and the art he had pursued all his life.

Though Roach played with many types of ensembles, he always continued to play jazz. He performed with the Beijing Trio, with pianist Jon Jang and erhu player Jeibing Chen. His final recording, &quot;Friendship&quot;, was with trumpeter Clark Terry. The two were longtime friends and collaborators in duet and quartet. Roach&#x27;s final performance was at the 50th anniversary celebration of the original Massey Hall concert, with Roach performing solo on the hi-hat.

In 1994, Roach appeared on Rush drummer Neil Peart&#x27;s &quot;Burning for Buddy,&quot; performing &quot;The Drum Also Waltzes&quot; Parts 1 and 2 on Volume 1 of the 2-volume tribute album during the 1994 All-Star recording sessions.

===Death===
 In the early 2000s, Roach became less active due to the onset of hydrocephalus-related complications.

Roach died of complications related to Alzheimer&#x27;s and dementia in Manhattan in the early morning of August 16, 2007. He was survived by five children: sons Daryl and Raoul, and daughters Maxine, Ayo, and Dara. More than 1,900 people attended his funeral at Riverside Church on August 24, 2007. He was interred at the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.

In a funeral tribute to Roach, then-Lieutenant Governor of New York David Paterson compared the musician&#x27;s courage to that of Paul Robeson, Harriet Tubman, and Malcolm X, saying that &quot;No one ever wrote a bad thing about Max Roach&#x27;s music or his aura until 1960, when he and Charlie Mingus protested the practices of the Newport Jazz Festival.&quot;

==Personal life==

His godson is artist, filmmaker and hip-hop pioneer, Fab Five Freddy.

From 1962 to 1970 Roach was married to singer Abbey Lincoln. His daughter Maxine, a violist, appeared on several of Lincoln&#x27;s albums. In February 1961, Roach and Lincoln, along with others, burst into a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to protest the murder of Patrice Lumumba, prime minister of the newly independent Congo.

Roach identified himself as a Muslim in an early 1970s interview with Art Taylor.

==Style==
Roach started as a traditional grip player but favored matched grip as his career progressed.

Roach&#x27;s most significant innovations came in the 1940s, when he and Kenny Clarke devised a new concept of musical time. By playing the beat-by-beat pulse of standard 4/4 time on the ride cymbal instead of on the thudding bass drum, Roach and Clarke developed a flexible, flowing rhythmic pattern that allowed soloists to play freely. This also created space for the drummer to insert dramatic accents on the snare drum, crash cymbal, and other components of the trap set.

By matching his rhythmic attack with a tune&#x27;s melody, Roach brought a newfound subtlety of expression to the drums. He often shifted the dynamic emphasis from one part of his drum kit to another within a single phrase, creating a sense of tonal color and rhythmic surprise. Roach said of the drummer&#x27;s unique positioning, &quot;In no other society do they have one person play with all four limbs.&quot;

While this is common today, when Clarke and Roach introduced the concept in the 1940s it was revolutionary. &quot;When Max Roach&#x27;s first records with Charlie Parker were released by Savoy in 1945&quot;, jazz historian Burt Korall wrote in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Jazz&quot;, &quot;drummers experienced awe and puzzlement and even fear.&quot; One of those drummers, Stan Levey, summed up Roach&#x27;s importance: &quot;I came to realize that, because of him, drumming no longer was just time, it was music.&quot;

In 1966, with his album &quot;Drums Unlimited&quot; (which includes several tracks that are entirely drum solos) he demonstrated that drums can be a solo instrument able to play theme, variations, and rhythmically cohesive phrases. Roach described his approach to music as &quot;the creation of organized sound.&quot; Roach&#x27;s style has been a big influence on several jazz and rock drummers, most notably Joe Morello, Tony Williams, Peter Erskine, Billy Cobham, Ginger Baker, and Mitch Mitchell. The track &quot;The Drum Also Waltzes&quot; was often quoted by John Bonham in his &quot;Moby Dick&quot; drum solo and revisited by other drummers, including Neil Peart and Steve Smith. Bill Bruford performed a cover of the track on the 1985 album &quot;Flags&quot;.

==Honors==
Roach was given a MacArthur Genius Grant in 1988 and cited as a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France in 1989. He was twice awarded the French Grand Prix du Disque, was elected to the International Percussive Art Society&#x27;s Hall of Fame and the DownBeat Hall of Fame, and was awarded Harvard Jazz Master. In 2008, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by the Recording Academy. He was celebrated by Aaron Davis Hall and was given eight honorary doctorate degrees, including degrees awarded by Wesleyan University, Medgar Evers College, CUNY, the University of Bologna, and Columbia University, in addition to his alma mater, the Manhattan School of Music.

In 1986, the London borough of Lambeth named a park in Brixton after Roach. Roach was able to officially open the park when he visited London in March of that year by invitation from the Greater London Council. During that trip, he performed at a concert at the Royal Albert Hall along with Ghanaian master drummer Ghanaba and others.

Roach spent his later years living at the Mill Basin Sunrise assisted living home in Brooklyn, and was honored with a proclamation honoring his musical achievements by Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz. Roach was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.

In 2023, Roach was the subject of a documentary feature film &quot;Max Roach: The Drum Also Waltzes&quot;, which premiered at South by Southwest and was nationally broadcast on the PBS series American Masters.

<text>Earl Rudolph &quot;Bud&quot; Powell (September 27, 1924 – July 31, 1966) was an American jazz pianist and composer. A pioneer in the development of bebop and its associated contributions to jazz theory, Powell&#x27;s application of complex phrasing to the piano influenced both his contemporaries and later pianists including Walter Davis Jr., Toshiko Akiyoshi, and Barry Harris.

Born in the midst of the Harlem Renaissance to a musical family, Powell, during the 1930s, developed an attacking, right-handed approach to the piano, which marked a break from the left-handed approach of stride and ragtime that had been prevalent. Upon joining trumpeter Cootie Williams&#x27;s band in 1943, he received attention from the broader musical community for his fluency and advanced technique. A severe beating by police in 1945 and years of electroconvulsive therapy treatments adversely impacted his mental health, but his recordings and live performances with Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, and Max Roach during the late 1940s and early 1950s were instrumental in shaping modern jazz piano technique.

Following a partial recovery in the mid to late 1950s, Powell&#x27;s relocation to Paris in 1959 contributed to the community of African-American expatriates fleeing racism and barriers to a higher standard of living. He returned to a regular recording schedule, toured across Northern and Central Europe, and made records, before becoming ill with tuberculosis in 1963.

Despite the friendship and protection of French jazz aficionado Francis Paudras, mental health crises and a troubled return to New York hastened his early death, aged 41, in 1966. The decades following his death saw his career and life story become the inspiration for films and written works, including Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;Round Midnight&quot;. Many Powell compositions, including &quot;Un Poco Loco&quot;, &quot;Bouncing with Bud&quot;, and &quot;Parisian Thoroughfare&quot; have become jazz standards.

== Early life ==
Powell was born in Harlem, New York, United States. His date of birth on his birth certificate was incorrectly listed as 1922, but he was born in 1924. Zachary, his grandfather, was a flamenco guitarist and Spanish-American War veteran. His father William was a stride pianist.

Powell began to take classical piano lessons at the age of five. His teacher, hired by his father, was a West Indian man named William Rawlins. As Powell was an altar boy at a Catholic church in Harlem, he also learned to play church organ. At 10 years of age, Powell showed interest in swing music, and he first appeared in public at a rent party, where he mimicked Fats Waller&#x27;s playing style. He enrolled in classical music competitions but was admired by jazz musicians and shifted toward jazz after leaving DeWitt Clinton High School.

The first jazz composition that he mastered was James P. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Carolina Shout&quot;, but at an early age Powell developed an interest in adapting Broadway songs to jazz improvisation. His father made private tape recordings of him from 1934 to 1939; for these he played classical music and jazz standards. According to Francis Paudras, a friend of Powell&#x27;s who heard the recordings, he had already developed his characteristic right-hand-focused approach to piano by that point.

Bud became a friend of fellow jazz pianist Elmo Hope during his childhood. Powell and Hope performed hymns and Bach compositions for Hope&#x27;s mother, who had a piano at her home, but also experimented with harmonic ideas such as flattened fifths. Powell&#x27;s younger brother by seven years, Richie Powell, learned to play piano as well. The nickname &quot;Bud,&quot; given to him by Richie, was a corruption of &quot;brother&quot;.

Older brother William played trumpet and violin and brought Bud, by now 15 years old, into his band. With this experience, Bud began a professional career; his first gig was as an accompanist for jazz singer Valaida Snow. Powell also appeared in performances at Coney Island and Canada Lee&#x27;s Chicken Coop and played with a group known as the Sunset Royals.

== Career ==

=== 1943–1945: Cootie Williams&#x27;s band ===
In his youth Powell listened to the adventurous performances at Clark Monroe&#x27;s Uptown House, a venue near his home. This was where Charlie Parker first appeared as a solo act when the saxophone player briefly stayed in New York between stints with swing bands. Thelonious Monk played at Uptown House. When Monk met Powell he introduced Powell to musicians who were starting to play bebop at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse. Monk was a resident pianist, and he presented Powell as his protégé. Their mutual affection grew, and Monk wrote &quot;In Walked Bud&quot; as a tribute to their time together in Harlem. Monk, Powell, and Hope held jam sessions together at Monk&#x27;s home in San Juan Hill, but as they only had one piano, they had to alternate playing.

Powell worked as a pianist for dance bands, his incubation culminating in becoming the pianist for the swing orchestra of trumpeter Cootie Williams. Powell was the pianist on a handful of Williams&#x27;s recording dates in 1944 and embarked on a tour of the South with his band. Among the tracks released was the first recording of Monk&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot;, a tune Powell requested that Williams&#x27; band play. Powell frequently clashed with Williams over what tunes the band would play, and by the mid-1940s the pianist had shifted toward the bebop scene on 52nd Street. By the end of his time with Williams, Powell was the musical director and arranger for the trumpeter&#x27;s band.

=== 1945–1948: Hospitalizations ===

After a performance with Williams&#x27;s band, Powell wandered near Broad Street Station and was apprehended, drunk, by the private railroad police. He was beaten up by them and incarcerated briefly by the city police, but as his headaches persisted, he moved to his family&#x27;s second home in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. He suffered constant pain from his head wounds and turned to alcohol to relieve the pain, as a result, developing an addiction that would haunt him for the rest of his life. After attempts by Powell&#x27;s mother and his girlfriend Frances Barnes to treat his severe headaches, he admitted himself to Bellevue Hospital.

Following medical evaluation at Bellevue, he was transferred to Creedmoor State Hospital and was institutionalized with alcoholics, drug addicts, and permanently institutionalized residents. Fellow pianist and composer Elmo Hope, who visited Powell regularly while he was hospitalized, became concerned by Creedmoor&#x27;s forced administration of tranquilizers and sleeping pills and their negative impact upon Powell&#x27;s health. Hope arranged for his medical care to be transferred to a jazz aficionado who let him play piano regularly and even perform a concert to show his lucidity. After the concert, he was released and resumed playing in Manhattan.

In 1945–1946 Powell recorded with Frank Socolow, Sarah Vaughan, Dexter Gordon, J. J. Johnson, Sonny Stitt, Fats Navarro, and Kenny Clarke. Powell became known for his sight-reading and his skill at fast tempos. In an incident in 1945, Monk falsely confessed to using drugs Powell had used in order to protect his friend from losing his cabaret card.

In January 1947, Powell recorded the first volume of his 10&quot; album &quot;Bud Powell Trio&quot; for Roost Records with Curley Russell and Max Roach; both musicians would play in his trio regularly during succeeding years. Charlie Parker chose Powell to be his pianist on a May 1947 quintet recording session with Miles Davis, Tommy Potter, and Max Roach; this was the only studio session intended for release in which Parker and Powell played together. The two did reunite, however, in late 1947 with fellow saxophone player Allen Eager at Milton Greene&#x27;s studio for an informal recorded jam session that was released under Eager&#x27;s name.

In November 1947, Powell had an altercation with a customer at a bar in Harlem. In the ensuing fight, Powell was hit over his eye with a bottle. He was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was found to be &quot;incoherent and rambunctious&quot;, and so was moved to Bellevue, which had a record of his previous confinement there and at a psychiatric hospital. He spent eleven months at Creedmore. Attempts to tell hospital staff he was a pianist who had &quot;made records&quot; led to his dismissal as a fantasist, and in psychiatric interviews, he expressed feelings of persecution founded in racism. He received electroconvulsive therapy while institutionalized, but was released after eleven months. Jackie McLean, a young alto saxophone player who admired the pianist&#x27;s ability and helped protect him, befriended Powell around 1947.

Powell may have been religious at this time; in a 1947 letter to fellow pianist and Catholic Mary Lou Williams, he lamented the challenges of his early life but felt that &quot;God had used a spy&quot; that &quot;lifted me out of the depth of shame.&quot; He became increasingly frustrated with life as a musician because he felt that he was being hired to play dinner music by white audiences that did not appreciate his talent. However, he remained known in musical circles as his mother had an apartment where she allowed musicians to stay. Hotels where Black musicians could stay were still in short supply, even in New York.

Powell&#x27;s only daughter, Celia, was born in 1948; Powell named one of his compositions after her. Following her father&#x27;s death in 1966 she worked as a movie consultant for &quot;Round Midnight&quot; and founded the Mythic Sound record label.

=== 1949–1951: &quot;Jazz Giant&quot; ===
After a brief hospitalization in early 1949, Powell made several recordings over the next two and a half years, most of them for Blue Note, Mercury, Norgran, and Clef. He also recorded that summer for two independent producers, a session that resulted in eight masters; Max Roach and Curly Russell were his accompanists. The recordings were released in 1950, when Roost Records bought the masters and released them on a series of 78 rpm records. Musicologist Guthrie Ramsey wrote of the session that &quot;Powell proves himself the equal of any of the other beboppers in technique, versatility, and feeling.&quot;The first Blue Note session in August 1949 included trumpeter Fats Navarro, saxophone player Sonny Rollins, bassist Tommy Potter and drummer Roy Haynes, and it introduced Powell&#x27;s compositions &quot;Bouncing with Bud&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Infidels&quot;. He went to the studio again, this time for Prestige, in December, with alto saxophone player Sonny Stitt to record four sides for a quartet album. Powell and Stitt did a concert together on Christmas Day at Carnegie Hall with Miles Davis on trumpet that was titled &quot;Symphony Sid&#x27;s Christmas Party&quot;. The event was announced and produced by Sid and Leonard Feather.

In January 1950, Powell was back in the studio with Stitt to record more of their joint album, but it was Powell&#x27;s trio recording the following month that contributed to his famous album &quot;Jazz Giant&quot; (1950). Part of the album had been recorded with bassist Ray Brown on a daytime release from hospital in 1949, while the 1950 session was recorded with Curley Russell. Roach was present on drums for both sessions. Tracks from the two sessions included his compositions &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; and &quot;Celia&quot;, an up-tempo version of the jazz standard &quot;Cherokee&quot;, &quot;Get Happy&quot;, and &quot;All God’s Chillun Got Rhythm&quot;. The first session was described by critic John White as &quot;feverish&quot; while the later session was &quot;restrained but moving&quot;.

Powell joined Charlie Parker and Fats Navarro at Birdland for &quot;One Night in Birdland&quot;, a live album performed shortly before Navarro&#x27;s death from tuberculosis in July 1950. The live engagement was noted for its &quot;brilliant...all-star lineup [that] clearly inspired&quot; the musicians in the quintet. A trio recording with Buddy Rich on drums and a big band session with Sarah Vaughan and Norman Leyden&#x27;s Orchestra concluded Powell&#x27;s recording schedule in 1950.

Powell was once again recorded at Birdland for the live album &quot;Summit Meeting at Birdland&quot; (1978) with Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet and Parker on saxophone. The half of the album featuring Powell was described by critic Scott Yanow as &quot;stirring&quot; and was noted for its renditions of &quot;Blue &#x27;n Boogie&quot; and &quot;Anthropology.&quot; A second Blue Note session attended by Powell in 1951 was a trio with Russell and Roach that included his originals &quot;Parisian Thoroughfare&quot; and &quot;Un Poco Loco&quot;. The latter was selected by literary critic Harold Bloom for his short list of the greatest works of twentieth-century American art.

=== 1951–1955: Marijuana bust and guardianship ===
After a bout of alcoholism and narcotic use in August 1951, he was arrested on what &quot;The Complete Bud Powell on Verve&quot; author Peter Pullman describes as false marijuana charges. While incarcerated he had an emotional outburst, leading to hospitalization at Pilgrim State Hospital. Powell was interrupted by another stay in a psychiatric facility from late 1951 to mid-1952 after being arrested for possession of heroin. He was transferred to Creedmoor Hospital in 1952 and was not permanently released until 1953. Although Powell&#x27;s only daughter with Frances Barnes, Celia, had been born around the time of his hospitalization, his alleged mental incompetency made him legally unable to recognize her as his daughter.

Creedmoor again administered electroconvulsive therapy on Powell, and his ability to practice piano was restricted by hospital staff. By the end of his hospitalization, he had become sterile and suffered from severe amnesia, and was unable to remember details of his life prior to hospitalization. The New York Supreme Court declared Powell mentally incompetent, making him entirely dependent upon guardians to manage his money and performance schedule.

In February 1953, Powell entered the guardianship and financial management of Oscar Goodstein, owner of the Birdland nightclub, but saw his health and piano playing affected by the antipsychotic medication Largactil, which he was prescribed as treatment for schizophrenia. A 1953 trio session for Blue Note with bassist George Duvivier and drummer Art Taylor included Powell&#x27;s composition &quot;Glass Enclosure&quot;, a composition that critics have suggested was related to his near-imprisonment in Goodstein&#x27;s apartment. Ira Gitler, however, attributes the &quot;desolation, melancholy, and anxiety&quot; of this composition to his time in asylums.

Powell played at Massey Hall in Toronto with The Quintet, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach, on May 15, 1953. The performance was recorded and released by Debut Records as the album &quot;Jazz at Massey Hall&quot; and was marketed as &quot;The Greatest Jazz Concert Ever&quot;. While the concert is best known for its first half performed by the full quintet, six of the tunes from the latter half of the performance were performed by the core trio of Powell, Mingus, and Roach and subsequently released on record.

Powell&#x27;s manager Goodstein arranged a regular gig at his Birdland club. However, Powell&#x27;s alcoholism was a constant problem, and he recruited several groupies from Utah to prevent him from buying alcohol or stealing drinks. The club tape-recorded sessions from February to September of that year, and they were produced by Michael Anderson and received a positive review from critic Thom Jurek. It was during his Birdland gig in 1953 that, according to Gitler, Powell began to show signs of mental illness; later accounts by Gitler and Seattle Ph.D. Fredric Harris indicate that the illness could have been epilepsy. Gitler also cites 1953 and 1954 as when Powell became less talkative, more withdrawn, and less technically able as a pianist. Powell was briefly married to Audrey Hill, but they separated and divorce proceedings were never finalized.

Powell and Charlie Parker developed a rivalry that resulted in feuding and bitterness on the bandstand, likely caused at least in part by the pianist&#x27;s worsening physical and mental health. One of his few New York engagements during this time, with Parker and Kenny Dorham in March 1955 shortly before the former&#x27;s death, ended early when Parker and Powell had an argument.

By mid-1954, Powell had resumed sessions for Norgran and Verve, recording alongside Duvivier, Taylor, Roach, Percy Heath, Lloyd Trotman, Art Blakey, Kenny Clarke, and Osie Johnson, in a series of albums produced for the two labels. Despite regular recording dates, the owners of Birdland maintained complete control over Powell&#x27;s schedule, and they even introduced him to his later girlfriend Altevia &quot;Buttercup&quot; Edwards. In early 1955, he led a series of recording dates on which he first played his composition &quot;Mediocre&quot;. The recording was notable because Powell chose to follow its first chorus with &quot;increasingly outré variations on the melody rather than soloing over the chords.&quot; The playing of these recording dates as a whole, however, was troubled, with a reviewer for &quot;DownBeat&quot; remarking, &quot;his playing mirrors many of the tensions and many of the fearful perspectives that are with him in his more difficult times.&quot; He had forgotten standards he had played fluently prior to his 1951 hospitalization and relied upon others to serve as musical directors. Additionally, Powell was still under a guardianship and therefore lacked control over the release of his recordings, leading many to be released where he was confused or unable to play.

Powell and his trio recorded an album, &quot;Piano Interpretations by Bud Powell&quot;, in April 1955 that included interpretations of jazz standards &quot;Crazy Rhythm&quot; and George Shearing&#x27;s &quot;Conception&quot; among a total of eight tunes produced by Norgran Records and re-released by Verve in 1957. The album led to a re-evaluation of Powell by &quot;DownBeat&quot;&#x27;s columnists, who remarked, &quot;Bud is in increasing control over himself... [and] may be beginning a second career. I know that everybody in jazz hopes so.&quot;

=== 1956–1958: Birdland All-Stars and return to Blue Note ===

Powell&#x27;s long-running gig at Storyville, a jazz club in Boston, ended in January 1956. On the last night of the gig he met Toshiko Akiyoshi, a pianist who had recently moved to the U.S. from Japan. She became a friend of his in his later years and contributed to the liner notes of &quot;The Complete Bud Powell on Verve&quot;. In March of the same year, &quot;Buttercup&quot; Edwards in a paternity suit accused Powell of being the father of her son. Powell was arrested but later released on the basis that he was not biologically capable of being a father. Around the same time as this incident, the New York Supreme Court rescinded its claim that Powell was mentally incompetent, again enabling him to tour. Jazz historian Pierre-Emmanuel Seguin suggested that the removal of guardianship was an intentional move by Goodstein to marry Powell to Edwards and continue to control his musical engagements by proxy.

Powell took part in the spring 1956 Birdland Tour organized by Morris Levy, for which he was joined by bassist Joe Benjamin and drummer Roy Haynes. Nat Hentoff, writing for &quot;DownBeat&quot;, noted that during the Tour, Powell&#x27;s style appeared to have become calmer and more lucid, contrasting with the turbulence of his playing in previous years. According to pianists Barry Harris and Michael Weiss and writer Peter Pullman, who analyzed all of Powell&#x27;s recordings on Verve, his playing improved dramatically between the January 1955 and September 1956 sessions he recorded for the label with his trio. In the 1956 &quot;DownBeat&quot; critics&#x27; poll of jazz pianists, Powell took a narrow second, slightly edged out by Art Tatum; but he placed higher than Erroll Garner, Earl Hines, John Lewis, and Count Basie.

In June 1956, Powell&#x27;s younger brother Richie and trumpeter Clifford Brown were killed in a car crash. Bud, saddened by the loss of his brother, fell from the public view of American jazz musicians and critics, particularly after his Verve contract ended in September. In November, he began a tour of Europe with the Birdland All-Stars in addition to Miles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet, and Lester Young starring throughout the performances. His performances in Paris, and particularly at the Salle Pleyel, were short due to his ill health, but they influenced pianists René Urtreger and Francis Paudras and contributed to the growing jazz scene in France. Hentoff remarked that, in his opinion, Powell&#x27;s constant touring was bad for his mental health, and that he needed psychotherapy while traveling due to the &quot;grueling&quot; nature of nightly performances. Attorney Cohen responded that Powell was the one who wanted to tour, and wrote that the pianist was recovering from his illness.

Powell continued to perform at Birdland throughout fall 1956 and recorded for RCA Victor in late 1956 and early 1957. He returned to his trio with Duvivier and Taylor but, according to later comments from Duvivier, refused to talk to his bandmates, who played entire sets entirely by ear. According to Guthrie Ramsey Jr., the reason for Powell&#x27;s uncommunicativeness was a need to focus more intently on his playing and to avoid losing his way throughout song forms.

In late 1957, Powell recorded volume 3 of his series &quot;The Amazing Bud Powell&quot; with Paul Chambers, Art Taylor, and trombonist Curtis Fuller for what jazz critic Scott Yanow described as an &quot;inspiring&quot; and &quot;strong set&quot;. Powell&#x27;s &quot;Vol. 3&quot; composition &quot;Bud on Bach&quot; included a medley of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&#x27;s &quot;Solfeggietto&quot; and a composition of his own. Further productive sessions with Blue Note yielded &quot;Time Waits&quot; and &quot;The Scene Changes&quot;, becoming volumes 4 and 5 of &quot;The Amazing Bud Powell&quot;, respectively. Volumes 4 and 5 were notable for introducing new compositions to the pianist&#x27;s repertoire including &quot;Time Waits&quot;, &quot;John&#x27;s Abbey&quot;, and &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

A November 1957 gig at a Paris nightclub with Pierre Michelot on bass and Kenny Clarke was well-received, but upon Powell&#x27;s return to New York, his nightclub ban due to the cabaret card system in the American city made finding work difficult. He experienced further hospital stays in the U.S. before being convinced by Edwards to move to France in the spring of 1959.

=== 1959–1964: Living in France ===
Powell moved to Paris in 1959 with Altevia &quot;Buttercup&quot; Edwards and her son, John. The couple and child moved into the Hotel La Louisiane, and she managed his finances and his medicine. The pianist received long-running club engagements upon arriving in Paris, and he began recording for Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française in several French cities with his trio. In December, Powell joined Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers for a recorded concert released as &quot;Paris Jam Session&quot; (1961) and contributed two of his compositions, &quot;Dance of the Infidels&quot; and &quot;Bouncing with Bud&quot;, to the performance. Critic Betsy Reed noted the pianist&#x27;s &quot;pungent bop solos&quot; and the concert&#x27;s atmosphere of &quot;heated live-show informality&quot;.In 1960, Powell was joined by Oscar Pettiford and Kenny Clarke on a German tour including the Essen Jazz Festival. The Essen concert, on which Coleman Hawkins was also featured on some tunes alongside the bebop pianist, was recorded live at the Grugahalle and released as &quot;The Essen Jazz Festival Concert&quot; (1988) on CD. The album received high marks from jazz critic Scott Yanow as a &quot;fine example&quot; of his piano playing. In July of that year, Powell joined Charles Mingus&#x27; band for a filmed concert at Antibes alongside Eric Dolphy and Booker Ervin. Pettiford&#x27;s death in 1960 was a major blow for Powell, and he played in a memorial concert for the young bass player.

In December 1961, Powell recorded two albums for Columbia Records while in France: and &quot;A Portrait of Thelonious&quot; (1965) and &quot;A Tribute to Cannonball&quot; (1979). The &quot;Tribute to Cannonball&quot; session, which was recorded first, featured Don Byas and Cannonball Adderley on tenor and alto saxophone respectively, while Pierre Michelot on bass and drummer Kenny Clarke were present on both sessions. Meanwhile, Powell formed the Three Bosses Trio with Clarke and Michelot for a regular gig at the Blue Note Club in Paris, and a compilation of recordings at the venue supplied the music for the album &quot;&#x27;Round About Midnight at the Blue Note&quot;. Powell&#x27;s performances at the club were mixed; Gitler claimed that he played his best music when other jazz musicians visited.

In early 1962, Powell began a tour of Central Europe. After playing concerts in Geneva and Lausanne, he performed a seven-week opening gig at Cafe Montmartre in Copenhagen with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen on bass. A recording session in Copenhagen in 1962 produced another album, &quot;Bouncing with Bud&quot;, and the track &quot;Hot House&quot; from this album was listed as one of the &quot;Five Essential Bud Powell Recordings&quot; by NPR contributors Peter Pullman and Simon Rentner. SteepleChase Records released a five-volume CD of the pianist&#x27;s trio from a two-night April engagement at the Golden Circle, a nightclub in Stockholm.

Following a summer touring Scandinavia, Powell returned to Paris in the fall of 1962 but was kept under the guardianship of Edwards. He was tracked down by biographer and pianist Francis Paudras, who believed that Powell had been abused by his common-law wife Edwards during the couple&#x27;s preceding years together. Paudras noted in his biography that she had kept control over his finances and clothes and given Powell tranquilizers to make him dependent. Edwards, for her part, claimed in a letter to then-boyfriend &quot;Kansas&quot; Fields that Powell was suicidal, writing, &quot;He told us before that he wanted to die, so there&#x27;s not much I can do.&quot;

While in Edwards&#x27;s guardianship, Powell&#x27;s health declined rapidly due to self-neglect and poor living conditions, and he was hospitalized at Laennec Hospital after escaping his guardianship. Powell was examined by a doctor; he claimed to be suffering from fatigue and revealed that he suffered from nightmares and heard voices. He was released under the care of Paudras, who incrementally took him off Largactil, an antipsychotic that may have contributed to his fatigue.

Powell made a series of record dates throughout spring and early summer 1963, including a Frank Sinatra-sponsored and Duke Ellington-produced trio recording with Gilbert Rovere and &quot;Kansas&quot; Fields in February and an album with tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon in May. The latter became the album &quot;Our Man in Paris&quot; (1963) and received the highest possible ratings from &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot;, &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, and &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;. In July Powell recorded with his Three Bosses Trio of Michelot and Clarke, plus Gillespie, on the album &quot;Dizzy Gillespie and the Double Six of Paris&quot; (1963), but he subsequently became ill with tuberculosis and was again hospitalized. After treatment, he was transferred to Bouffémont Sanitorium – later renamed the Jacques-Arnaud Medical Center – to recover, and he performed several recitals for the students and staff during his stay. A benefit concert was held to raise funds for his hospital stay; Johnny Griffin, Donald Byrd, Sonny Criss, and Jean-Luc Ponty performed. Jef Gilson played Powell&#x27;s most recent composition.

Powell completed further recording dates, including two with Paudras on makeshift brushes, during his last year in France; a further live engagement with Griffin in Jullouville was released on Mythic Sound as &quot;Holidays in Edenville&quot;. Accompanied by Paudras, Powell returned to New York on August 16 and met Goodstein at JFK Airport.

===1964–1966: Return to New York===
His engagement at Birdland with drummer Horace Arnold and bassist John Ore began on August 25 and included a repertoire of both jazz and classical music, particularly Bach. &quot;DownBeat&quot;&#x27;s Dan Morgenstern wrote an article on Powell following the engagement, noting, &quot;the Bud Powell of 1964 is still a creative jazzman and pianist of the first rank.&quot; Morgenstern praised the pianist&#x27;s loyalty to the bebop genre and the rapid recovery of his technique as the weeks of his long-running engagement passed. Powell recorded, albeit hesitantly, with Ore and drummer J. C. Moses in September 1964 for his album &quot;The Return of Bud Powell&quot; (1964), but disagreements between Powell and Moses plagued the recording session. After a severe illness prevented Powell from completing scheduled nights at Birdland, he was fired on October 11. Paudras and Barry Harris arranged for Powell to return to France to recover, but Powell – who feared the medical checkups that were scheduled prior to leaving – went missing by hitching rides, possibly in search of his old friend Elmo Hope, who took him to his home shortly after Powell went missing. Paudras returned to France on October 27 without Powell, who decided to stay in New York with Frances Barnes, his girlfriend from the late 1940s, and the couple&#x27;s daughter Celia.

Powell&#x27;s guardianship was transferred from Paudras to Bernard Stollman of ESP Records upon returning to New York, and with the exception of hospital visits, he remained at Barnes&#x27;s home until shortly before his death in 1966. His few public performances between the end of 1964 and his death were adversely affected by his alcoholism and ongoing lung problems.

Between Paudras&#x27;s departure and Powell&#x27;s final hospitalization in the summer of 1966, several recording sessions were made with Powell, but with the exception of the album &quot;Ups &#x27;n Downs&quot;, the recordings from these dates were not released. A Charlie Parker tribute concert at Carnegie Hall in March 1965 and a May performance at the New York Town Hall revealed his poor health and its effect on his ability to play. However, his Town Hall performance received positive feedback from attendee Dan Morgenstern, who noted, &quot;his final selection, &#x27;I Remember Clifford&#x27;, was extremely moving ... Powell hasn&#x27;t lost his marvelous touch and sound, and everything he played revealed a sense of balance and proportion.&quot; His last studio recordings, with Rashied Ali on drums, also went unreleased by the ESP label due to Powell being in &quot;terrible shape&quot;.

Several musicians visited Powell while he was ill, including Toshiko Akiyoshi and Art Taylor. Akiyoshi noted in a letter to Paudras that Powell played an opening night at Birdland in spring 1965, but also remarked that he was unwell. He was admitted to Kings County Hospital in early autumn 1965, where he played a small performance for producer Alan Bates and wrote four compositions, but after his release he became extremely ill.

He was hospitalized again in 1966 following weight loss, erratic behavior, and self-neglect. In a letter from Kings County Hospital, where staff attempted to give him further electroconvulsive treatments, he wrote days before his death: &quot;I&#x27;m a writer and composer, and these [electroconvulsive] treatments are destroying my brain.&quot; His final composition, written on his deathbed, was a poem called &quot;Eternity&quot;, foreshadowing his impending death.

On July 31, 1966, he died of tuberculosis, malnutrition, and alcoholism. He was given the last rites of the Catholic Church and was visited by his family and Jackie McLean on his deathbed. Several other musicians remained close to him until his death including Bob Bunyan, George Duvivier, Thelonious Monk, and Art Taylor.

His funeral was celebrated on August 8, 1966, with several bands playing through the streets of Harlem and arriving at Powell&#x27;s former church; performers included trombonist Benny Green, trumpeter Lee Morgan, saxophonist Jim Gilmore, pianist Barry Harris, bassist Don Moore, and drummer Billy Higgins. The funeral was televised. Powell was buried in an unmarked grave. In 2024 a campaign was launched to have his remains moved to a marked grave, with a headstone, at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

==Musical style==
Powell was one of the key contributors to the development of bebop. Patrick Burnette notes that Powell and Elmo Hope were &quot;credited with creating the modern piano style of single-note right hand runs and left-handed chordal punctuation.&quot; According to drummer Kenny Clarke, many of Monk&#x27;s compositions were written in collaboration with Powell, and even pianists who did not adopt the bebop style, such as Duke Ellington, visited his home in Willow Grove regularly to hear him play.

Powell was, in turn, influenced primarily by Thelonious Monk and Art Tatum. His virtuosity led many to call him the Charlie Parker of the piano, and Bill Cunliffe noted that he was &quot;the first pianist to take Charlie Parker&#x27;s language and adapt it&quot; to the instrument, although this assessment has been criticized. Critics agree, however, that he was one of the few musicians on any instrument who could match Parker&#x27;s musically complex approach to bop. His solos featured an attacking style similar to that of horn players, contained frequent arpeggios, and utilized much chromaticism. Don Heckman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted his ability to rove &quot;freely across harmonic borders&quot; with &quot;loping melodic lines&quot;. Other critics have taken a more complex approach, noting that Powell&#x27;s style shifted significantly during his career, possibly connected to traumatic events in his personal life. According to critic Harvey Pekar, the most significant shift occurred in 1954, when his playing became &quot;economical&quot; and &quot;fragmented&quot; due to the influence of Monk.

Despite Powell&#x27;s emphasis on right-hand soloing throughout his career, he was also able to play fluently with his left hand. After one of Art Tatum&#x27;s performances at Birdland in 1950, Powell told the pianist that he had made mistakes, to which Tatum responded that Powell was &quot;just a right-hand piano player.&quot; Powell was scheduled to play the following night, and he played one of the tunes entirely with his left hand in order to prove his technical ability. That said, his technical ability has been described by some as erratic. Christopher Finch, who heard him play with a young French bassist late 1962, noted that he struggled to play even basic melodies with which the bassist was unfamiliar, but when Powell asked the bassist to pick a tune he knew, his technique immediately recovered. According to Finch, Powell&#x27;s technical ability depended significantly upon the quality of the musicians with whom he was playing.

His comping often consisted of single bass notes outlining the root and fifth. He used voicings of the root and the tenth or the root with the minor seventh. In some voicings and melodic ideas, such as &quot;Un Poco Loco&quot;, he used bitonality and extremely extended chords such a raised fifteenth, while in solo breaks such as that of &quot;Celia&quot; he used 16th-note chord arpeggiations to transition from melody to improvisation.

Tom Piazza noted for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Powell played with &quot;a Romantic&#x27;s imagination [but] a classicist&#x27;s precision and [with] an awesome, sometimes frightening, intensity&quot; and was a &quot;lifelong Bach devotee&quot;. The titles of his compositions referenced the breadth of his knowledge of culture and music history including one song title in Latin, &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;. Powell wrote poems for each of his compositions, but most of his poetry was lost, and many of the poems were neither written on paper nor copyrighted.

== Legacy ==
In 1986, Paudras wrote a book about his friendship with Powell, translated into English in 1997 as &quot;Dance of the Infidels: A Portrait of Bud Powell&quot;. The book was the basis for &quot;Round Midnight&quot;, a film inspired by the lives of Powell and Lester Young, in which Dexter Gordon played the lead role of an expatriate jazzman in Paris.

Powell influenced a wide array of younger musicians, especially pianists. These included Horace Silver, Wynton Kelly, Alice ColtraneAndré Previn, McCoy Tyner, Cedar Walton, and Chick Corea. Corea debuted a song called &quot;Bud Powell&quot; on his live album with Gary Burton, &quot;In Concert, Zürich, October 28, 1979&quot;, and in 1997 dedicated an entire album, &quot;Remembering Bud Powell&quot; to him. Bill Evans, who described Powell as his single greatest influence, paid the pianist a tribute in 1979: &quot;If I had to choose one single musician for his artistic integrity, for the incomparable originality of his creation and the grandeur of his work, it would be Bud Powell. He was in a class by himself&quot;. Herbie Hancock said of Powell, in a &quot;DownBeat&quot; interview in 1966: &quot;He was the foundation out of which stemmed the whole edifice of modern jazz piano&quot;. Heckman wrote, &quot;his influence ultimately reached well beyond [bebop]&#x27;s relatively hermetic world&quot; and noted his influence upon Silver, Oscar Peterson, Evans, Keith Jarrett, Tyner and Corea. Pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi, upon arrival in the United States, remarked when an interviewer inquired as to her favorite pianists: &quot;Art Tatum and Bud Powell. &#x27;After I hear both, it is not necessary to hear others.&#x27;&quot;

Additionally, Powell influenced musicians associated with other instruments, and Miles Davis in his autobiography said of Powell: &quot;[He] was one of the few musicians I knew who could play, write, and read all kinds of music.&quot; &quot;Bud was a genius piano player – the best there was of all the bebop piano players.&quot; The drummer Art Taylor, who is listed among the personnel on about a dozen Powell recordings, elicited comments concerning Powell from numerous musicians in his 1993 book of interviews, &quot;Notes and Tones&quot;. In the book, Elvin Jones described Powell&#x27;s playing as &quot;revolutionary,&quot; but noted his delicate personality. Regarding his ill health, J. J. Johnson said after Powell&#x27;s death, &quot;many so-called jazz buffs and curiosity seekers knew Bud only as an oddball or weird character. Only his old friends and the seasoned jazz fans knew the real Bud, who was warm, witty, and one of the most intelligent persons I ever knew.&quot;

Powell was also praised by Art Blakey, Don Cherry, Kenny Clarke, Erroll Garner, Hampton Hawes, Freddie Hubbard, Carmen McRae, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Randy Weston, and Tony Williams.

<text>Cabell &quot;Cab&quot; Calloway III (December 25, 1907 – November 18, 1994) was an American jazz singer and bandleader. He was a regular performer at the Cotton Club in Harlem, where he became a popular vocalist of the swing era. His niche of mixing jazz and vaudeville won him acclaim during a career that spanned over 65 years.

Calloway was a master of energetic scat singing and led one of the most popular dance bands in the United States from the early 1930s to the late 1940s. His band included trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Jonah Jones, and Adolphus &quot;Doc&quot; Cheatham, saxophonists Ben Webster and Leon &quot;Chu&quot; Berry, guitarist Danny Barker, bassist Milt Hinton, and drummer Cozy Cole.

Calloway had several hit records in the 1930s and 1940s, becoming the first African-American musician to sell one million copies of a record. He became known as the &quot;Hi-de-ho&quot; man of jazz for his most famous song, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, originally recorded in 1931. He reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in five consecutive decades (1930s–1970s). Calloway also made several stage, film, and television appearances until his death in 1994 at the age of 86. He had roles in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1953), &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), and &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; (1967). His career enjoyed a marked resurgence from his appearance in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot;

Calloway was the first African-American to have a nationally syndicated radio program. In 1993, Calloway received the National Medal of Arts from the United States Congress. He posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. His song &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, and added to the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry in 2019. In 2022, the National Film Registry selected his home films for preservation as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant films&quot;. He was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame and the International Jazz Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Cabell Calloway III was born in Rochester, New York, on December 25, 1907, to an African American family. His father, Cabell Calloway Jr., graduated from Lincoln University of Pennsylvania in 1898. His mother, Martha Eulalia Reed, was a Morgan State College graduate, teacher, and church organist, and worked as a lawyer and in real estate. The family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1919. Soon after, his father died and his mother remarried to John Nelson Fortune.

Calloway grew up in the West Baltimore neighborhood of Druid Hill. He often skipped school to earn money by selling newspapers, shining shoes, and cooling down horses at the Pimlico racetrack where he developed an interest in racing and gambling on horses. After he was caught playing dice on the church steps, his mother sent him to Downingtown Industrial and Agricultural School in 1921, a reform school run by his mother&#x27;s uncle in Chester County, Pennsylvania.
Calloway resumed hustling when he returned to Baltimore and worked as a caterer while he improved his education in school. He began private vocal lessons in 1922, and studied music throughout his formal schooling. Despite his parents&#x27; and teachers&#x27; disapproval of jazz, he began performing in nightclubs in Baltimore. His mentors included drummer Chick Webb and pianist Johnny Jones. Calloway joined his high school basketball team, and in his senior year he started playing professional basketball with the Baltimore Athenians, a team in the Negro Professional Basketball League. He graduated from Frederick Douglass High School in 1925.

== Music career ==

=== 1927–1929: Early career ===
In 1927, Calloway joined his older sister, Blanche Calloway, on tour for the popular black musical revue &quot;Plantation Days&quot;. His sister became an accomplished bandleader before him, and he often credited her as his inspiration for entering show business. Calloway&#x27;s mother wanted him to be a lawyer like his father, so once the tour ended he enrolled at Crane College in Chicago, but he was more interested in singing and entertaining. While at Crane he refused the opportunity to play basketball for the Harlem Globetrotters to pursue a singing career.

Calloway spent most of his nights at ‘Black and tan clubs’ such as Chicago&#x27;s Dreamland Café, Sunset Cafe, and Club Berlin, performing as a singer, drummer, and master of ceremonies. At Sunset Cafe, he was an understudy for singer Adelaide Hall. There he met and performed with Louis Armstrong, who taught him to sing in the scat style. He left school to sing with the Alabamians band.

In 1929, Calloway relocated to New York with the band. They opened at the Savoy Ballroom on September 20, 1929. When the Alabamians broke up, Armstrong recommended Calloway as a replacement singer in the musical revue &quot;Connie&#x27;s Hot Chocolates&quot;. He established himself as a vocalist singing &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; by Fats Waller. While Calloway was performing in the revue, the Missourians asked him to front their band.

=== 1930–1955: Success ===
In 1930, the Missourians became known as Cab Calloway and His Orchestra. At the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York, the band was hired in 1931 to substitute for the Duke Ellington Orchestra while Ellington&#x27;s band was on tour. Their popularity led to a permanent position. The band also performed twice a week for radio broadcasts on NBC. Calloway appeared on radio programs with Walter Winchell and Bing Crosby and was the first African American to have a nationally syndicated radio show. During the depths of the Great Depression, Calloway was earning $50,000 a year at 23 years old.In 1931, Calloway recorded his most famous song, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;. It was the first single record by an African American to sell a million copies. Calloway performed the song and two others, &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot; and &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot;, in the Betty Boop cartoons &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; (1932), &quot;Snow-White&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot; (1933). Calloway performed voice-over for these cartoons, and through rotoscoping, his dance steps were the basis of the characters&#x27; movements.

As a result of the success of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, Calloway became identified with its chorus, gaining the nickname &quot;The Hi De Ho Man&quot;. He performed in the 1930s in a series of short films for Paramount. Calloway&#x27;s and Ellington&#x27;s groups were featured on film more than any other jazz orchestras of the era. In these films, Calloway can be seen performing a gliding backstep dance move, which some observers have described as the precursor to Michael Jackson&#x27;s moonwalk. Calloway said 50 years later, &quot;it was called The Buzz back then.&quot; The 1933 film &quot;International House&quot; featured Calloway performing his classic song, &quot;Reefer Man&quot;, a tune about a man who smokes marijuana. Fredi Washington was cast as Calloway&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Cab Calloway&#x27;s Hi-De-Ho&quot; (1934). Lena Horne made her film debut as a dancer in &quot;Cab Calloway&#x27;s Jitterbug Party&quot; (1935).

Calloway made his first Hollywood feature film appearance opposite Al Jolson in &quot;The Singing Kid&quot; (1936). He sang several duets with Jolson, and the film included Calloway&#x27;s band and 22 Cotton Club dancers from New York. According to film critic Arthur Knight, the creators of the film intended to &quot;erase and celebrate boundaries and differences, including most emphatically the color line...when Calloway begins singing in his characteristic style – in which the words are tools for exploring rhythm and stretching melody – it becomes clear that American culture is changing around Jolson and with (and through) Calloway&quot;.

In 1938, Calloway released &quot;Cab Calloway&#x27;s Cat-ologue: A &quot;Hepster&#x27;s&quot; Dictionary&quot;, the first dictionary published by an African American. It became the official jive language reference book of the New York Public Library. A revised version of the book was released with &quot;Professor Cab Calloway&#x27;s Swingformation Bureau&quot; in 1939. He released the last edition, &quot;The New Cab Calloway&#x27;s Hepsters Dictionary: Language of Jive,&quot; in 1944. On a BBC Radio documentary about the dictionary in 2014, Poet Lemn Sissay stated, &quot;Cab Calloway was taking ownership of language for a people who, just a few generations before, had their own languages taken away.&quot;

Calloway&#x27;s band in the 1930s and 1940s included many notable musicians, such as Ben Webster, Illinois Jacquet, Milt Hinton, Danny Barker, Doc Cheatham, Ed Swayze, Cozy Cole, Eddie Barefield, and Dizzy Gillespie. Calloway later recalled, &quot;What I expected from my musicians was what I was selling: the right notes with precision, because I would build a whole song around a scat or dance step.&quot; Calloway and his band formed baseball and basketball teams. They played each other while on the road, play against local semi-pro teams, and play charity games.

In 1941, Calloway fired Gillespie from his orchestra after an onstage fracas erupted when Calloway was hit with spitballs. He wrongly accused Gillespie, who stabbed Calloway in the leg with a small knife.

From 1941 to 1942, Calloway hosted a weekly radio quiz show called &quot;The Cab Calloway Quizzicale&quot;. Calling himself &quot;Doctor&quot; Calloway, it was a parody of &quot;The College of Musical Knowledge&quot;, a radio contest created by bandleader Kay Kyser. During the years of World War II, Calloway entertained troops in United States before they departed overseas. The Calloway Orchestra also recorded songs full of social commentary including &quot;Doing the Reactionary,&quot; &quot;The Führer&#x27;s Got the Jitters,&quot; &quot;The Great Lie,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ll Gather Lilacs,&quot; and &quot;My Lament for V Day.&quot;

In 1943, Calloway appeared in the film &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, one of the first mainstream Hollywood films with a black cast. The film featured other top performers of the time, including Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Lena Horne, the Nicholas Brothers, and Fats Waller. Calloway would host Horne&#x27;s character Selina Rogers as she performed the film&#x27;s title song as part of a big all-star revue for World War II soldiers.

Calloway wrote a humorous pseudo-gossip column called &quot;Coastin&#x27; with Cab&quot; for &quot;Song Hits&quot; magazine. It was a collection of celebrity snippets, such as the following in the May 1946 issue: &quot;Benny Goodman was dining at Ciro&#x27;s steak house in New York when a very homely girl entered. &#x27;If her face is her fortune,&#x27; Benny quipped, &#x27;she&#x27;d be tax-free.&#x27;&quot; In the late 1940s, however, Calloway&#x27;s bad financial decisions and his gambling caused his band to break up.

=== 1956–1960: Cotton Club Revue ===
Calloway and his daughter Lael recorded &quot;Little Child&quot;, an adaption of &quot;Little Boy and the Old Man&quot;. Released on ABC-Paramount, the single charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1956.

For the second season, Lee Sherman was the choreographer of The Cotton Club Revue of 1958, which starred Calloway. The revue featured tap dancing prodigies Maurice Hines and Gregory Hines.

In March 1958, Calloway released his album &quot;Cotton Club Revue of 1958&quot; on Gone Records. It was produced by George Goldner, conducted and arranged by Eddie Barefield. That year, Calloway appeared in the film &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, the life story of W.C. Handy, featuring Nat King Cole and Eartha Kitt.

The Cotton Club Revue of 1959 traveled to South America for engagements in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. They also stopped in Uruguay and Argentina before returning to North America which included a run on Broadway.

=== 1961–1993: Later years ===
Calloway remained a household name due to TV appearances and occasional concerts in the US and Europe. In 1961 and 1962, he toured with the Harlem Globetrotters, providing halftime entertainment during games.

Calloway was cast as &quot;Yeller&quot; in the film &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965) with Steve McQueen, Ann-Margret, and Edward G. Robinson. Calloway appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on March 19, 1967, with his daughter Chris Calloway. In 1967, he co-starred with Pearl Bailey as Horace Vandergelder in an all-black cast of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; on Broadway during its original run. Chris Calloway also joined the cast as Minnie Fay. The new cast revived the flagging business for the show and RCA Victor released a new cast recording, rare for the time. In 1973–74, Calloway was featured in an unsuccessful Broadway revival of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; with Hal Linden and Barbara McNair.

His autobiography, &quot;Of Minnie the Moocher and Me&quot; was published in 1976. It included his complete &quot;Hepster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as an appendix. In 1978, Calloway released a disco version of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; on RCA which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Calloway was introduced to a new generation when he appeared in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; performing &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;.

In 1985, Calloway and his Orchestra appeared at The Ritz London Hotel where he was filmed for a 60-minute BBC TV show called &quot;The Cotton Club Comes to the Ritz&quot;. Adelaide Hall, Doc Cheatham, Max Roach, and the Nicholas Brothers also appeared on the bill. A performance with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra directed by Erich Kunzel in August 1988 was recorded on video and features a classic presentation of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, 57 years after he first recorded it.

In January 1990, Calloway performed at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, with the Baltimore Symphony. That year he made a cameo in Janet Jackson&#x27;s music video &quot;Alright&quot;. He continued to perform at Jazz festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and Greenwood Jazz. In 1992, he embarked on a month-long tour of European jazz festivals. He was booked to headline &quot;The Jazz Connection: The Jewish and African-American Relationship,&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Avery Fisher Hall in 1993, but he pulled out due to a fall at home.

== Personal life ==
In January 1927, Calloway had a daughter named Camay with Zelma Proctor, a fellow student. His daughter was one of the first African-Americans to teach in a white school in Virginia. Calloway married his first wife Wenonah &quot;Betty&quot; Conacher in July 1928. They adopted a daughter named Constance and divorced in 1949. Calloway married Zulme &quot;Nuffie&quot; MacNeal on October 7, 1949. They lived in Long Beach on the South Shore of Long Island, New York, on the border with neighboring Lido Beach. In the 1950s, Calloway moved his family to Westchester County, New York, where he and Nuffie raised their daughters Chris Calloway (1945–2008), Cecilia &quot;Lael&quot; Eulalia Calloway, and Cabella Calloway (1952–2023).

Calloway was an Episcopalian.

=== Legal issues ===
In December 1945, Calloway and his friend Felix H. Payne Jr. were beaten by a police officer, William E. Todd, and arrested in Kansas City, Missouri after attempting to visit bandleader Lionel Hampton at the whites-only Pla-Mor Ballroom. They were taken to the hospital for injuries, then charged with intoxication and resisting arrest. When Hampton learned of the incident he refused to continue the concert. Todd said he was informed by the manager, who did not recognize Calloway, that they were attempting to enter. He claimed they refused to leave and struck him. Calloway and Payne denied his claims and maintained they had been sober; the charges were dismissed. In February 1946, six civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, demanded that Todd be fired, but he had already resigned after a pay cut.

In 1952, Calloway was arrested in Leesburg, Virginia on his way to the race track in Charles Town, West Virginia. He was charged with speeding and attempted bribery of a policeman.

== Death ==
On June 12, 1994, Calloway suffered a stroke at his home in Westchester County, New York. He died five months later from pneumonia on November 18, 1994, at the age of 86, at a nursing home in Hockessin, Delaware. He was survived by his wife, who died in 2008, five daughters, and seven grandsons. Calloway was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

== Legacy ==
Music critics have written of his influence on later generations of entertainers such as James Brown, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, as well as modern-day hip-hop performers. John Landis, who directed Calloway in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, stated, &quot;Cab Calloway is hip-hop.&quot; Journalist Timothy White noted in &quot;Billboard&quot; (August 14, 1993): &quot;No living pathfinder in American popular music or its jazz and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll capillaries is so frequently emulated yet so seldom acknowledged as Cabell &quot;Cab&quot; Calloway. He arguably did more things first and better than any other band leader of his generation.&quot;

In 1998, the Cab Calloway Orchestra directed by Calloway&#x27;s grandson Chris &quot;CB&quot; Calloway Brooks was formed. In 2009, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy released an album covering Calloway&#x27;s music titled &quot;How Big Can You Get?: The Music of Cab Calloway&quot;. In 2012, Calloway&#x27;s legacy was celebrated in an episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Masters&quot; titled &quot;Cab Calloway: Sketches&quot;.
In 2019, plans were announced to demolish Calloway&#x27;s boyhood home at 2216 Druid Hill Avenue in Baltimore, replacing the abandoned structure and the rest of that block with a park to be named &quot;Cab Calloway Legends Park&quot; in his honor. Family members and the National Trust for Historic Preservation advocated preservation of the house, however, as a significant artifact of African-American cultural heritage. Although the block is designated &quot;historically significant&quot; on the National Register of Historic Places, Baltimore City officials said at a hearing on July 9, 2019, that there is &quot;extensive structural damage&quot; to the Calloway house as well as adjacent ones. The Commission on Historical and Architectural Preservation&#x27;s executive director, however, said that properties in worse condition than the Calloway House have been restored with financial support from a city tax credit program. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan also urged that demolition of the Calloway House be forestalled for its potential preservation as a historic house museum akin to the Louis Armstrong House in New York. Design options for the planned Cab Calloway Square may include an archway from the facade &quot;(pictured)&quot; as part of the Square&#x27;s entrance, as proposed by architects working with Baltimore City and the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation, a Non-Profit community oriented group. Despite objections, the house was razed on September 5, 2020.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 1985, Town Supervisor Anthony F. Veteran issued a proclamation, declaring a &quot;Cab Calloway Day&quot; in Greenburgh, New York.

In 1990, Calloway was presented with the Beacons in Jazz Award from The New School in New York City. New York City Mayor David Dinkins proclaimed the day &quot;Cab Calloway Day&quot;.

In 1992, the Cab Calloway School of the Arts was founded in Wilmington, Delaware.

In 1994, Calloway&#x27;s daughter Camay Calloway Murphy founded the Cab Calloway Museum at Coppin State College in Baltimore, Maryland.

The New York Racing Association (NYRA) annually honors the jazz legend, a native of Rochester, New York, with a stakes races restricted to New York-bred three-year-olds, as part of their New York Stallion Series. First run in 2003, The Calloway has since undergone various distance and surface changes. The race is currently run at Saratoga Racecourse, Saratoga Springs, New York.
