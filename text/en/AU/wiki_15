<text>Garage rock (sometimes called garage punk or ″60s punk) is a raw and energetic style of rock music that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada, and has experienced a series of subsequent revivals. The style is characterized by basic chord structures played on electric guitars and other instruments, sometimes distorted through a fuzzbox, as well as often unsophisticated and occasionally aggressive lyrics and delivery. Its name derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional.

In the US and Canada, surf rock—and later the Beatles and other beat groups of the British Invasion—motivated thousands of young people to form bands between 1963 and 1968. Hundreds of grass-roots acts produced regional hits, some of which gained national popularity, usually played on AM radio stations. With the advent of psychedelia, numerous garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre&#x27;s primitive stylistic framework. After 1968, as more sophisticated forms of rock music came to dominate the marketplace, garage rock records largely disappeared from national and regional charts, and the movement faded. Other countries in the 1960s experienced similar rock movements that have sometimes been characterized as variants of garage rock.

During the 1960s, garage rock was not recognized as a distinct genre and had no specific name, but critical hindsight in the early 1970s—and especially the 1972 compilation album &quot;&quot;—did much to define and memorialize the style. Between 1971 and 1973, certain American rock critics began to retroactively identify the music as a genre and for several years used the term &quot;punk rock&quot; to describe it, making it the first form of music to bear the description, predating the more familiar use of the term appropriated by the later punk rock movement that its musical approach influenced. The term &quot;garage rock&quot; gained favor amongst commentators and devotees during the 1980s. The style has also been referred to as &quot;proto-punk&quot;, or, in certain instances, &quot;frat rock&quot;.

In the early to mid-1980s, several revival scenes emerged featuring acts that consciously attempted to replicate the look and sound of 1960s garage bands. Later in the decade, a louder, more contemporary garage subgenre developed that combined garage rock with modern punk rock and other influences, sometimes using the garage punk label originally and otherwise associated with 1960s garage bands. In the 2000s, a wave of garage-influenced acts associated with the post-punk revival emerged, and some achieved commercial success. Garage rock continues to appeal to musicians and audiences who prefer a &quot;back to basics&quot; or the &quot;DIY (Do-It-Yourself)&quot; musical approach ethic.
==Social milieu and stylistic features==
The term &quot;garage rock&quot;, often used in reference to 1960s acts, stems from the perception that many performers were young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage. While numerous bands were made up of middle-class teenagers from the suburbs, others were from rural or urban areas or were composed of professional musicians in their twenties.

Referring to the 1960s, Mike Markesich commented &quot;teenage rock &amp; roll groups (i.e. combos) proliferated Everywheresville USA&quot;. Though it is impossible to determine how many garage bands were active in the era, their numbers were extensive in what Markesich has characterized as a &quot;cyclonic whirlwind of musical activity like none other&quot;. According to Mark Nobles, it is estimated that between 1964 and 1968 over 180,000 bands formed in the United States, and several thousand US garage acts made records during the era.

Garage bands performed in a variety of venues. Local and regional groups typically played at parties, school dances, and teen clubs. For acts of legal age (and in some cases younger), bars, nightclubs, and college fraternity socials also provided regular engagements. Occasionally, groups had the opportunity to open at shows for famous touring acts. Some garage rock bands went on tour, particularly those better-known, but even more obscure groups sometimes received bookings or airplay beyond their immediate locales. Groups often competed in &quot;battles of the bands&quot;, which allowed musicians to gain exposure and a chance to win a prize, such as free equipment or recording time in a local studio. Contests were held, locally, regionally and nationally, and three of the most prestigious national events were held annually by the Tea Council of the US, the Music Circus, and the United States Junior Chamber.

Performances often sounded amateurish, naïve, or intentionally raw, with typical themes revolving around the traumas of high school life and songs about &quot;lying girls&quot; being particularly common. The lyrics and delivery were frequently more aggressive than that of the more established acts of the time, often with nasal, growled, or shouted vocals, sometimes punctuated by shrieks or screams at climactic moments of release. Instrumentation was frequently characterized by basic chord structures played on electric guitars or keyboards often distorted through a fuzzbox, teamed with bass and drums. Guitarists sometimes played using aggressive-sounding bar chords or power chords. Portable organs such as the Farfisa were used frequently and harmonicas and hand-held percussion such as tambourines were not uncommon. Occasionally, the tempo was sped up in passages sometimes referred to as &quot;raveups&quot;.

Garage rock acts were diverse in both musical ability and style, ranging from crude and amateurish to near-studio level musicianship. There were also regional variations in flourishing scenes, such as in California and Texas. The north-western states of Idaho, Washington and Oregon had a distinctly recognizable regional sound with bands such as the Sonics and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders.

==Recognition and classification==

In the 1960s, garage rock had no name and was not thought of as a genre distinct from other rock and roll of the era. Rock critic and future Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye remarked that the period &quot;dashed by so fast that nobody knew much of what to make of it while it was around&quot;. In the early 1970s, Kaye and other US rock critics, such as Dave Marsh, Lester Bangs, and Greg Shaw, began to retroactively draw attention to the music, speaking nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and subsequent artists then perceived to be their stylistic inheritors) for the first time as a genre.

&quot;Garage rock&quot; was not the initial name applied to the style. In the early 1970s such critics used the term &quot;punk rock&quot; to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. While the coinage of the term &quot;punk&quot; in relation to rock music is unknown, it was sometimes used then to describe primitive or rudimentary rock musicianship, but more specifically 1960s garage as a style. In the May 1971 issue of &quot;Creem&quot;, Dave Marsh described a performance by ? and the Mysterians as an &quot;exposition of punk rock&quot;. Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in June 1971 wrote &quot;...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds&#x27; sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever&quot;.

Much of the revival of interest in 1960s garage rock can be traced to the release of the 1972 album &quot;&quot; compiled by Lenny Kaye. In the liner notes, Kaye used &quot;punk rock&quot; as a collective term for 1960s garage bands and also &quot;garage-punk&quot; to describe a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight. In the January 1973 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of &quot;Nuggets&quot;, Greg Shaw commented: &quot;Punk rock is a fascinating genre ... Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the 1960s to the original rockabilly spirit of rock &amp; roll.&quot; In addition to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Creem&quot;, writings about the genre appeared in various independent &quot;fanzine&quot; publications during the period. In May 1973, Billy Altman launched the short-lived &quot;punk magazine&quot;, which pre-dated the more familiar 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts. Greg Shaw&#x27;s seasonal publication, &quot;Who Put the Bomp!&quot;, was influential amongst enthusiasts and collectors of the genre in the early 1970s.

Though the phrase &quot;punk rock&quot; was the favored generic term in the early 1970s, &quot;garage band&quot; was also mentioned in reference to groups. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in March 1971, John Mendelsohn made an oblique reference to &quot;every last punk teenage garage band having its Own Original Approach&quot;. The term &quot;punk rock&quot; was later appropriated by the more commonly-known punk rock movement that emerged in the mid-1970s and is now most commonly applied to groups associated with that movement or who followed in its wake. For the 1960s style, the term &quot;garage rock&quot; came into favor in the 1980s. According to Mike Markesich: &quot;Initially launched into the underground vernacular at the start of the &#x27;80s, the garage tag ... slowly sifted its way amid like-minded fans to finally be recognized as a worthy descriptive replacement&quot;. The term &quot;garage punk&quot; has also persisted, and style has been referred to as 60s punk&quot; and &quot;proto-punk&quot;. &quot;Frat rock&quot; has been used to refer to the R&amp;B- and surf rock- derived garage sounds of certain acts, such as the Kingsmen and others.

==1958–1964: Origins==
===Regional rock &amp; roll, instrumental, and surf===
In the late 1950s, the initial impact of rock and roll on mainstream American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence and sought to market more conventionally acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio audiences, of traditional black and white markets, with more white teenagers listening to and purchasing R&amp;B records.

Numerous young people were inspired by musicians such as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, and Eddie Cochran, whose recordings of relatively unsophisticated and hard-driving songs from a few years earlier proclaimed personal independence and freedom from parental controls and conservative norms. Ritchie Valens&#x27; 1958 hit &quot;La Bamba&quot; helped jump-start the Chicano rock scene in Southern California and provided a three-chord template for the songs of numerous 1960s garage bands. By the end of the 1950s regional scenes were abundant around the country and helped set the stage for garage rock the 1960s.
Guitarist Link Wray has been cited as an early influence on garage rock and is known for his innovative use of guitar techniques and effects such as power chords and distortion. He is best known for his 1958 instrumental &quot;Rumble&quot;, which featured the sound of distorted, &quot;clanging&quot; guitar chords, which anticipated much of what was to come. The combined influences of early-1960s instrumental rock and surf rock also played significant roles in shaping the sound garage rock. 
According to Lester Bangs, &quot;the origins of garage rock as a genre can be traced to California and the Pacific Northwest in the early Sixties&quot;. The Pacific Northwest, which encompasses Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, played a critical role in the inception of garage rock, hosting the first scene to produce a sizable number of acts, and pre-dated the British Invasion by several years. The signature garage sound that eventually emerged in the Pacific Northwest is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Northwest Sound&quot; and had its origins in the late 1950s, when a handful of R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll acts sprang up in various cities and towns in an area stretching from Puget Sound to Seattle and Tacoma, and beyond.

There and elsewhere, groups of teenagers were inspired directly by touring R&amp;B performers such as Johnny Otis and Richard Berry, and began to play cover versions of R&amp;B songs. During the late 1950s and early 1960s other instrumental groups playing in the region, such as the Ventures, formed in 1958 in Tacoma, Washington, who came to specialize in a surf rock sound, and the Frantics from Seattle. The Blue Notes from Tacoma, Washington, fronted by &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot; Roberts, were one of the city&#x27;s first teenage rock &amp; roll bands. The Wailers (often referred to as the Fabulous Wailers) had national chart hit in 1959, the instrumental &quot;Tall Cool One&quot;. After the demise of the Blue Notes, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot; did a brief stint with the Wailers, and with him on vocals in 1962, they recorded a version of Richard Berry&#x27;s 1957 song &quot;Louie Louie&quot;—their arrangement became the much-replicated blueprint for practically every band in the region, including Portland&#x27;s the Kingsmen who went on to achieve a major hit with it the following year.

Other regional scenes of teenage bands playing R&amp;B-oriented rock were well-established in the early 1960s, several years before the British Invasion, in places such as Texas and the Midwest. At the same time, in Southern California surf bands formed, playing raucous guitar- and saxophone-driven instrumentals. Writer Neil Campbell commented: &quot;There were literally thousands of rough-and-ready groups performing in local bars and dance halls throughout the US &quot;prior&quot; to the arrival of the Beatles ... [T]he indigenous popular music which functioned in this way ... was the proto-punk more commonly identified as &quot;garage rock&quot;&quot;.

===Frat rock and initial commercial success===
As a result of cross-pollination between surf rock, hot rod music, and other influences, a new style of rock sometimes referred to as &quot;frat rock&quot; emerged, which has been mentioned as an early subgenre of garage rock. The Kingsmen&#x27;s 1963 off-the-cuff version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; became the de facto &quot;big bang&quot; for three-chord rock, starting as a regional hit in Seattle, then rising to No. 1 on the national charts and eventually becoming a major success overseas. The group unwittingly became the target of an FBI investigation in response to complaints about the song&#x27;s alleged use of profanity in its nearly indecipherable lyrics.

Though often associated with Pacific Northwest acts such as the Kingsmen, frat rock also thrived elsewhere. In 1963, singles by several regional bands from other parts of the United States began appearing on the national charts, including &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; by the Trashmen from Minneapolis, which essentially fused together parts from two songs previously recorded by the Rivingtons, &quot;The Bird is the Word&quot; and &quot;Papa Oom Mow Mow&quot;. &quot;California Sun&quot; by the Rivieras, from South Bend, Indiana followed, becoming a hit in early 1964. Frat rock persisted into the mid-1960s with acts such as the Swingin&#x27; Medallions, who had a top twenty hit with &quot;Double Shot (Of My Baby&#x27;s Love)&quot; in 1966.

==1964–1968: Peak years==
===Impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion===
During the mid-1960s, garage rock entered its most active period, prompted by the influence of the Beatles and the British Invasion. On February 9, 1964, during their first visit to the United States, the Beatles made an historic appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; watched by a record-breaking viewing audience of a nation mourning the recent death of President John F. Kennedy. For many, particularly the young, the Beatles&#x27; visit re-ignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had momentarily faded in the wake of the assassination. Much of this new excitement was expressed in rock music, often to the chagrin of parents and elders.

In the wake of the Beatles&#x27; first visit, a subsequent string of successful British beat groups and acts achieved success in America between 1964 and 1966, often referred to in the US as &quot;the British Invasion&quot;. Such acts had a profound impact, leading many (often surf or hot rod groups) to respond by altering their style, and countless new bands to form, as teenagers around the country picked up guitars and started bands by the thousands. In many cases, garage bands were particularly influenced by the increasingly bold sound of a second wave of British groups with a harder, blues-based attack, such as the Kinks, the Who, the Animals, the Yardbirds, Small Faces, Pretty Things, Them, and the Rolling Stones often resulting in a raw and primitive sound. Numerous acts sometimes characterized as garage rock formed in countries outside North America, such as England&#x27;s the Troggs. Their 1966 worldwide hit &quot;Wild Thing&quot; became a staple in countless American garage bands&#x27; repertoires. By 1965, the influence of the British Invasion prompted folk musicians such as Bob Dylan and members of the Byrds to adopt the use of electric guitars and amplifiers, resulting in what became termed folk rock. The resulting success of Dylan, the Byrds, and other folk rock acts influenced the sound and approach of numerous garage bands.

===Height of success and airplay===
In the wake of the British Invasion, garage rock experienced a boom in popularity. With thousands of garage bands active in the US and Canada, hundreds produced regional hits during the period, often receiving airplay on local AM radio stations. Several acts gained wider exposure just long enough to have one or occasionally more national hits in an era rife with &quot;one-hit wonders&quot;. In 1965, the Beau Brummels broke into the national charts with &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot;, followed by &quot;Just a Little&quot;. According to Richie Unterberger, they were perhaps the first American group to pose a successful response to the British Invasion. That year, Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaohs&#x27; &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; went to No. 2, and they followed it up a year later with another No. 2 hit, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. Also in 1965, the Castaways almost reached &quot;Billboard&quot; top ten with &quot;Liar, Liar&quot;, which was later included on the 1972 &quot;Nuggets&quot; compilation. Featuring a lead vocal by Rick Derringer, &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; became a No. 1 hit for Indiana&#x27;s the McCoys, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in October 1965. They were immediately signed to Bang Records and followed up with another hit in 1966, a cover of &quot;Fever&quot;, originally recorded by Little Willie John.

It is generally agreed that the garage rock boom peaked around 1966. That April, the Outsiders from Cleveland hit No. 5 with &quot;Time Won&#x27;t Let Me&quot;, which was later covered by acts such as Iggy Pop. In July, the Standells from Los Angeles almost made it into the US top ten with &quot;Dirty Water&quot;, a song now often associated with Boston. &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; by the Count Five went to No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 and was later memorialized by Lester Bangs in his 1971 piece &quot;Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung&quot;.

&quot;96 Tears&quot; (1966) by Question Mark and the Mysterians, from Saginaw, Michigan, became a No. 1 hit in the US. The song&#x27;s organ riffs and theme of teenage heartbreak have been mentioned as a landmark recording of the garage rock era and recognized for influencing the works of acts as diverse as the B-52&#x27;s, the Cramps, and Bruce Springsteen. Two months later, the Music Machine reached the top 20 with fuzz guitar-driven &quot;Talk Talk&quot;, whose sound and image that helped pave the way for later acts such as the Ramones. The Syndicate of Sound&#x27;s &quot;Little Girl&quot;, which featured a cocksure half-spoken lead vocal set over chiming 12-string guitar chords, reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and was later covered by acts such as the Dead Boys, the Banned, and the Chesterfield Kings. In 1965, a Pittsburgh disc jockey discovered &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, a 1964 song by a since-defunct group, the Shondells; the song&#x27;s belated success revived the career of Tommy James, who assembled a new group under the name Tommy James and the Shondells and produced 12 more top-40 singles. In 1967, Strawberry Alarm Clock emerged from the garage outfit Thee Sixpence and had a No. 1 hit in 1967 with psychedelic &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;.

===Female garage bands===
Garage rock was not an exclusively male phenomenon—it fostered the emergence of all-female bands whose members played their own instruments. One of the first of such acts was New York&#x27;s Goldie and the Gingerbreads, who appeared at New York&#x27;s Peppermint Lounge in 1964 and accompanied the Rolling Stones on their American tour the following year. They had a hit in England with a version of &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear My Heartbeat&quot;. The Continental Co-ets from Fulda, Minnesota, were active from 1963 to 1967 and had a hit in Canada with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Love You No More&quot;. The Pleasure Seekers (later known as Cradle), from Detroit, featured Suzi Quatro and her sisters. Quatro went on to greater fame as a musical solo act and television actress in the 1970s. The Luv&#x27;d Ones, also from Michigan, signed with Chicago&#x27;s Dunwich Records and cut records with a sometimes somber sound, such as &quot;Up Down Sue&quot;.

San Francisco&#x27;s the Ace of Cups became a fixture in the Bay Area scene in the late 1960s. Other notable 1960s female groups were the Daughters of Eve from Chicago and She (previously known as the Hairem) from Sacramento, California. All-female bands were not exclusive to North America. The Liverbirds were a beat group from the Beatles&#x27; home city of Liverpool, England, but became best known in Germany, often performing in Hamburg&#x27;s Star-Club. All-female groups of the 1960s anticipated later acts associated with the 1970s punk movement, such as the Runaways and the Slits.

===Regional scenes in the United States and Canada===
====Pacific Northwest====

In 1964 and 1965, the impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion shifted the musical landscape, presenting not only a challenge, but also a new impetus, as previously established acts in the Pacific Northwest adapted to the new climate, often reaching greater levels of commercial and artistic success, while scores of new bands formed. After relocating to Portland, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders in 1963 became the first rock-and-roll act to be signed to Columbia Records, but did not achieve their commercial breakthrough until 1965 with the song &quot;Steppin Out&quot;, which was followed by string of chart-topping hits such as &quot;Just Like Me&quot; (originally recorded by the Wilde Knights) and &quot;Kicks&quot;.

The Sonics from Tacoma had a raunchy, hard-driving sound that influenced later acts such as Nirvana and the White Stripes. According to Peter Blecha, they &quot;were the unholy practitioners of punk rock long before anyone knew what to call it&quot;. Founded in 1960, they eventually enlisted the services of vocalist Gerry Rosalie and saxophonist Rob Lind and proceeded to cut their first single, &quot;The Witch&quot; in 1964. The song was re-issued again in 1965, this time with the even more intense &quot;Psycho&quot; on the flip side. They released several albums and are also known for other &quot;high-octane&quot; rockers such as &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s Waitin. Prompted by the Sonics, the Wailers entered the mid-1960s with a harder-edged sound in the fuzz-driven &quot;Hang Up&quot; and &quot;Out of Our Tree&quot;.

====New England and Mid-Atlantic====
The Barbarians from Cape Cod, wearing sandals and long hair and cultivating an image of &quot;noble savages&quot;, recorded an album and several singles, such as &quot;Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl&quot;. In 1964, the group appeared on the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; on same bill as the Rolling Stones and James Brown. In the film of the show, their drummer, Victor &quot;Moulty&quot; Moulton, is seen holding one of his drumsticks with a prosthetic clamp while playing—the result of a previous accident in which he lost his left hand. In 1966, Moulton recorded &quot;Moulty&quot;, a spoken monologue set to music, in which he recounted the travails of his disfigurement, released under the Barbarians&#x27; name, but backed by future members of the Band.

Boston&#x27;s the Remains (sometimes called Barry &amp; the Remains), led by Barry Tashian, became one of the region&#x27;s most popular bands and, in addition to issuing five singles and a self-titled album, toured with the Beatles in 1966. Also from Boston, the Rockin&#x27; Ramrods released the distortion-driven &quot;She Lied&quot; in 1964, which Rob Fitzpatrick called &quot;a truly spectacular piece of proto-punk, the sort of perfect blend of melody and aggression that the Ramones would go on to transform the planet with a dozen or more years later&quot;. The Squires from Bristol, Connecticut, issued a song now regarded as a garage rock classic, &quot;Going All the Way&quot;. Garage rock flourished up and down the Atlantic coast, with acts such as the Vagrants, from Long Island, and Richard and the Young Lions from Newark, New Jersey, and the Blues Magoos from the Bronx, who got their start in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village scene and had a hit in 1966 with &quot;(We Ain&#x27;t Got) Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot;, which appeared on their debut album, &quot;Psychedelic Lollipop&quot;, along with a lengthy rendition of the Nashville Teens&#x27; &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;.

====California====

The garage craze came into full swing in California, particularly in Los Angeles. The Sunset Strip was the center of L.A. nightlife, providing bands with high-profile venues to attract a larger following and possibly capture the attention of record labels looking to sign a new act. Exploitation films such as &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Mondo Hollywood&quot;, captured the musical and social milieu of life on the strip. In &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot;, several bands make appearances at the Pandora&#x27;s Box, including the Standells who are seen during the opening credits performing the theme song, as well as San Jose&#x27;s the Chocolate Watchband. The Seeds and the Leaves were favorites with the &quot;in-crowd&quot; and managed to achieve national hits with songs that have come to be regarded as garage classics: the Seeds with &quot;Pushin&#x27; Too Hard&quot; and the Leaves with their version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, which became a staple in countless bands&#x27; repertoires.

Love, a racially integrated band headed by African-American musician Arthur Lee, was one of the most popular bands in the scene. Their propulsive 1966 proto-punk anthem &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot; was another song often covered by other groups. The Music Machine, led by Sean Bonniwell, employed innovative musical techniques, sometimes building their own custom-made fuzzboxes. Their first album &quot;(Turn On) The Music Machine&quot; featured the hit &quot;Talk Talk&quot;. The Electric Prunes were one of the more successful garage bands to incorporate psychedelic influences into their sound, such as in the hit &quot;I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)&quot;, whose opening featured a buzzing fuzz-toned guitar, and which appeared on their self titled debut LP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger (Liner Notes/Prunes)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Garage rock was also present in the Latino community of East L.A. The Premiers, who had a hit in 1964 with &quot;Farmer John&quot;, and Thee Midniters are considered prominent figures in Chicano rock, as are the San Diego–based, Cannibal &amp; the Headhunters, who had a hit with Chris Kenner&#x27;s &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;.

San Jose and the South Bay area had a bustling scene featuring the Chocolate Watchband, the Count Five, and the Syndicate of Sound. The Chocolate Watchband released several singles in 1967, including &quot;Are You Gonna Be There (at the Love In)&quot;, which was also featured on their debut album &quot;No Way Out&quot;. The album&#x27;s opening cut was a rendition of &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Girls&quot;, previously recorded by the Tongues of Truth (aka the Grodes).

====Midwest====
Chicago, known for electric blues, continued to have a strong recording industry in the 1960s and was also a hotbed of activity for garage rock. Chicago blues as well as the Rolling Stones, the Pretty Things, and the Yardbirds influenced the Shadows of Knight, who recorded for Dunwich Records and were known for a tough, hard-driving sound. In 1966 they had hits with versions of Them&#x27;s Van Morrison-penned &quot;Gloria&quot; and Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, and also released the aggressive &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Mine&quot;, which Mike Stax remarked &quot;was recorded live in the studio with the amps cranked beyond distortion, this is 60s punk at its sexually charged, aggressive best.&quot; Also recording for Dunwich were the Del-Vetts and the Banshees, who released the cathartic &quot;Project Blue&quot;. Other notable Chicago acts were the Little Boy Blues and the New Colony Six.

Michigan had one of the largest scenes in the country. In early 1966, Detroit&#x27;s MC5 released a version of &quot;I Can Only Give You Everything&quot; before they went on to greater success at the end of the decade. The Unrelated Segments recorded a string of songs beginning with local hit &quot;The Story Of My Life&quot;, followed by &quot;Where You Gonna Go&quot;. In 1966, the Litter from Minneapolis released the guitar-overdriven &quot;Action Woman&quot;, a song which Michael Hann described as &quot;one of garage&#x27;s gnarliest, snarliest, most tight-trousered pieces of hormonal aggression&quot;.

====Other US Regions====
In Texas, the 13th Floor Elevators from Austin, featured Roky Erickson on guitar and vocals and are considered one of the prominent bands of the era. They had a regional hit with &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; and a string of albums, but the band was hampered by drug busts and related legal problems that hastened their demise. Richie Unterberger singled out The Zakary Thaks, from Corpus Christi, for their songwriting skills, and they are best known for the frantic and sped-up &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. The Moving Sidewalks, from Houston, featured Billy Gibbons on guitar, later of ZZ Top. The Gentlemen from Dallas cut the fuzz-driven &quot;It&#x27;s a Cry&#x27;n Shame&quot;, which in Mike Markesich&#x27;s &quot;Teenbeat Mayhem&quot; is ranked as one of the top two garage rock songs of all time, second only to &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;, by the 13th Floor Elevators. The Outcasts from San Antonio cut two highly regarded songs, &quot;I&#x27;m in Pittsburgh and It&#x27;s Raining&quot;, which became a local hit, and &quot;1523 Blair&quot;, that Jason Ankeny described as &quot;Texas psychedelia at its finest&quot;.

The Five Americans were from Durant, Oklahoma, and released a string of singles, such as &quot;Western Union&quot;, which became a top 10 US hit in 1967. From Phoenix, Arizona, the Spiders featured Vincent Furnier, later known as Alice Cooper, and eventually adopted that name as the group&#x27;s moniker. As the Spiders they recorded two singles, most notably &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Mind&quot;, which became a local hit in Phoenix in 1966. The group ventured to Los Angeles in 1967 in hopes of achieving greater success, however they found it not there, but while in Detroit several years later, re-christened as Alice Cooper.

From Florida, Orlando&#x27;s We the People came about as the result of the merger of two previous bands and featured songwriters Tommy Talton and Wane Proctor. They recorded a string of self-composed songs, such as primitive rockers, &quot;You Burn Me Upside Down&quot; and &quot;Mirror of my Mind&quot;, as well as the esoteric &quot;In the Past&quot;, later covered by the Chocolate Watchband. Evil from Miami, had a hard, sometimes thrashing sound and a reputation for musical mayhem, typified in songs such as &quot;From a Curbstone&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot;.

====Canada, islands, and territories====
Like the United States, Canada experienced a large and vigorous garage rock movement. Vancouver&#x27;s the Northwest Company, who recorded &quot;Hard to Cry&quot;, had a power chord-driven approach. The Painted Ship were known for primal songs such as the angst-ridden &quot;Frustration&quot; and &quot;Little White Lies&quot;, which Stansted Montfichet called a &quot;punk classic&quot;. Chad Allan and the Reflections from Winnipeg, Manitoba, began in 1962 and had a hit in the mid-1960s, Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates&#x27; &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot;, then went on to greater success in the late 1960s and early 1970s as the Guess Who.

In 1966, the Ugly Ducklings from Toronto had a hit with &quot;Nothin and toured with the Rolling Stones. The Haunted from Montreal specialized in a gritty blues-based sound influenced by the Rolling Stones and released the single &quot;1–2–5&quot;. Two other bands from Toronto were the Paupers and the Mynah Birds. The Paupers released several singles and two albums. The Mynah Birds featured the combination of Rick James on lead vocals and Neil Young on guitar, who both went on to fame as solo acts, as well as Bruce Palmer who later accompanied Young to California to join Buffalo Springfield in 1966. They signed a contract with Motown Records and recorded several songs including &quot;It&#x27;s My Time&quot;.

Outside of the mainland, garage rock became a fixture in the islands and territories adjacent to the continent. The Savages from Bermuda recorded the album &quot;Live &#x27;n Wild&quot;, which features &quot;The World Ain&#x27;t Round It&#x27;s Square&quot;, an angry song of youthful defiance.

===Variants in regions outside of the US and Canada===
The garage phenomenon, though most often associated with North America, was not exclusive to it. As part of the international beat trend of the 1960s, other countries developed grass-roots rock movements that closely mirrored what was happening in North America, which have sometimes been characterized as variants of garage rock or as closely related forms.

====United Kingdom====

Although Britain did not develop a distinct garage rock genre in the same way as the United States, many British beat groups shared important characteristics with the American bands who often attempted to emulate them, and the music of certain UK acts has been mentioned in particular relation to garage.

Beat music emerged in Britain in the early 1960s, as musicians who originally came together to play rock and roll or skiffle assimilated American rhythm and blues influences. The genre provided the model for the format of many later rock groups. The Liverpool area had a particularly high concentration of acts and venues, and the Beatles emerged from this thriving music scene. In London and elsewhere, certain groups developed a harder-driving, distinctively British blues style. Nationally popular blues- and R&amp;B- influenced beat groups included the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds from London, the Animals from Newcastle, and Them, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, featuring Van Morrison.

Coinciding with the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the US, a musical cross-fertilization developed between the two continents. In their 1964 transatlantic hits &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;, the Kinks took the influence of the Kingsmen&#x27;s version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and applied greater volume and distortion, which in turn, influenced the approach of many American garage bands. With Van Morrison, Them recorded two songs widely covered by American garage bands: &quot;Gloria&quot;, which became a big hit for Chicago&#x27;s the Shadows of Knight, and &quot;I Can Only Give You Everything&quot;. Keith Richards&#x27;s use of fuzz distortion in the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1965 hit, &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; affected the sound of countless American garage bands. Also influential were the Pretty Things and the Downliners Sect, both of whom were known for a particularly raw approach to blues-influenced rock that has sometimes been compared to garage.
By 1965, bands such as the Who and the Small Faces tailored their appeal to the mod subculture centered in London. Some of the harder-driving and more obscure bands associated with the mod scene in the UK are sometimes referred to as Freakbeat, which is sometimes viewed as a more stylish British equivalent of garage rock. Several bands often mentioned as Freakbeat are the Creation, the Action, the Move, the Smoke, the Sorrows, and Wimple Winch.

Some commentators have branded the Troggs as garage rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;presley/troggs/garage&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Extolling the virtues of their seemingly unrepentant primitivism and sexually charged innuendo, in 1971 Lester Bangs memorialized the Troggs as a quintessential &quot;punk&quot; [i.e. garage] band of the 1960s. They had a worldwide hit in 1966 with &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, written by American Chip Taylor. The Equals, a racially integrated band from North London whose membership included guitarist Eddy Grant, later a popular solo artist, specialized in an upbeat style of rock—their 1966 recording &quot;Baby Come Back&quot; was a hit in Europe before becoming a British number one in 1968.

====Continental Europe====

The beat boom swept through continental Europe, resulting in the emergence of national movements sometimes cited as European variants of garage rock. The Netherlands had one of the largest scenes, sometimes retroactively described as Nederbeat. From Amsterdam, the Outsiders, who Richie Unterberger singled out as one of the most important 1960s rock acts from a non-English speaking country, featured Wally Tax on lead vocals and specialized in an eclectic R&amp;B and folk-influenced style. Q65 from the Hague had a diverse but primitive sound, particularly on their early records. Also from the Hague, the Golden Earrings, who later gained international fame in the 1970s and 1980s as Golden Earring, had a top ten hit in the Netherlands in 1965 with &quot;Please Go&quot;, followed by &quot;That Day&quot;, which went to number two on the Dutch charts.

Having nurtured the Beatles&#x27; early development in Hamburg, Germany was well-positioned to play a key role as beat music overtook the continent. Bands from Britain and around Europe traveled there to gain exposure, playing in clubs and appearing on popular German television shows such as &quot;Beat Club&quot; and &quot;Beat! Beat! Beat!&quot; The Lords, founded in Düsseldorf in 1959, pre-dated the British Invasion by several years, and adapted their sound and look to reflect the influence of the British groups, even singing in English, but providing a comic twist. The Rattles from Hamburg also had a lengthy history, but were more serious in their approach. There were numerous bands active in Spain, such as Los Bravos, who had a worldwide hit with &quot;Black Is Black&quot;, as well as los Cheyenes and others.

====Latin America====

Latin America got swept up in the worldwide beat trend and developed several of its own national scenes. Mexico experienced its own equivalent to North American garage. The nation&#x27;s proximity to the United States was detectable in the raw sounds produced by a number of groups while the country simultaneously embraced the British Invasion. One of Mexico&#x27;s most popular acts were Los Dug Dug&#x27;s, who recorded several albums and stayed active well into the 1970s.

The beat boom flourished in Uruguay during the mid-1960s in a period sometimes referred to as the Uruguayan Invasion. Two of the best-known acts were Los Shakers and Los Mockers. In Peru, Los Saicos were one of the first bands to gain national prominence. Their 1965 song &quot;¡Demolición!&quot; with its humorously anarchistic lyrics was a huge hit in Peru. About them Phil Freeman noted &quot;These guys were a punk rock band, even if nobody outside Lima knew it at the time&quot;. Los Yorks became one of Peru&#x27;s leading groups. Colombia hosted bands such Los Speakers and Los Flippers from Bogotá, Los Yetis from Medellín. Los Gatos Salvajes, who came from Rosario, Argentina, were one of the country&#x27;s first beat groups, and two of their members went on to form Los Gatos, a popular act in Argentina during the late 1960s.

====Asia====

The Far East was not immune to the beat craze, and Japan was no exception; this was particularly true after the Beatles&#x27; 1966 visit, when they played five shows at Tokyo&#x27;s Budokan arena. The popular 1960s beat/garage movement in Japan is often referred to as Group Sounds (or &quot;GS&quot;). The Spiders were one of the better-known groups. Other notable bands were the Golden Cups and the Tigers.

Despite famine, economic hardship, and political instability, India experienced its own proliferation of garage bands in the 1960s, persisting into the early 1970s with the 1960s musical style still intact even after it fallen out of favor elsewhere. Mumbai, with its hotels, clubs, and nightlife, had a bustling music scene. The Jets, who were active from 1964 to 1966, were perhaps the first beat group to become popular there. Also popular in Mumbai were the Trojans, featuring Biddu, originally from Bangalore, who later moved to London and become a solo act. Every year the annual Simla Beat Contest was held in Bombay by the Imperial Tobacco Company. Groups from all over India, such as the Fentones and Velvet Fogg, competed in the event.

====Australia and New Zealand====

Australia and New Zealand experienced a garage/beat explosion in the mid-1960s. Before the British Invasion hit, the region enjoyed a sizable surf rock scene, with popular bands such as the Atlantics, who had several instrumental hits, as well as the Aztecs and the Sunsets. In late 1963 and early 1964 British Invasion influence began to permeate the music scenes there. In June 1964 the Beatles visited Australia as part of their world tour and were greeted by a crowd of an estimated 300,000 in Adelaide. In response, many prior Australian surf bands adapted by adding vocals over guitars, and a host of new bands formed. The first wave of British-inspired bands tended towards the pop-oriented sound of the Merseybeat. With rise in popularity of bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals, a second wave of Australian bands emerged that favored a harder, blues-influenced approach.

Sydney was the host to numerous acts. The Atlantics switched to a vocal rock format and brought in veteran singer Johnny Rebb, formerly with Johnny Rebb and His Rebels. &quot;Come On&quot; was their best-known song from this period. The Easybeats, featuring vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young, the older brother of Angus and Malcolm Young of the later hard rock group AC/DC, became the most popular group in Australia during the mid-1960s. One of Sydney&#x27;s most notorious acts was the Missing Links, who throughout 1965 went through a complete and total lineup change between the release their first single in March and on the subsequent releases later that year, such as the primitivist anthems &quot;Wild About You&quot;, as well as their self-titled LP. In 1966, the Throb had a hit in Australia with their version of &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;, and later that year released &quot;Black&quot;, a brooding version of a traditional folk ballad noted for its expressionistic use of guitar feedback. The Black Diamonds&#x27; &quot;I Want, Need, Love You&quot; featured an intense and hard-driving guitar sound that Ian D. Marks described as &quot;speaker cone-shredding&quot;.

From Brisbane came the Pleazers and the Purple Hearts, and from Melbourne the Pink Finks, the Loved Ones, Steve and the Board, and the Moods. Like Sydney&#x27;s the Missing Links, the Creatures were another notorious group of the period, who Iain McIntyre remarked &quot;Thanks to their brightly coloured hair and bad-ass attitude, the Creatures left in their wake a legacy of multiple arrests, bloodied noses and legendary rave ups&quot;. The Masters Apprentices&#x27; early sound was largely R&amp;B-influenced garage and psychedelic.

From New Zealand, the Bluestars cut the defiant &quot;Social End Product&quot;, aimed at social oppression much in the manner of 1970s punk rock acts. Chants R&amp;B were known for a raw R&amp;B-influenced sound. The La De Da&#x27;s recorded a version of the Changin&#x27; Times&#x27; &quot;How is the Air Up There?&quot;, which went to No. 4 on the nation&#x27;s charts.

===Integration with psychedelia and counterculture===
====Historical and cultural associations====

Increasingly throughout 1966, partly due to the growing influence of drugs such as marijuana and LSD, numerous bands began to expand their sound, sometimes employing eastern scales and various sonic effects to achieve exotic and hypnotic soundscapes in their music. The development was nonetheless the result of a longer musical evolution growing out of folk rock and other forms, and prefigured even in certain surf rock recordings. As the decade progressed, psychedelic influences became pervasive in much garage rock.
By the mid-1960s, numerous garage bands began to employ tone-altering devices such as fuzzboxes on guitars often for the purpose of enhancing the music&#x27;s sonic palate, adding an aggressive edge with loudly amplified instruments to create a barrage of &quot;clanging&quot; sounds, in many cases expressing anger, defiance, and sexual frustration. The genre came into its peak of popularity at a time when a collective sense of discontent and alienation crept into the psyche of the youth in the United States and elsewhere—even in the largely conservative suburban communities which produced so many garage bands. Garage bands, though generally apolitical, nonetheless reflected the attitudes and tenor of the times. Nightly news reports had a cumulative effect on the mass consciousness, including musicians. Detectable in much of the music from this era is a disparate array of raw sounds and emotions, coinciding with surrounding events, such as the assassinations of major political figures and the ongoing escalation of troops sent to Vietnam, yet certain commentators have also noted an apparent bygone innocence as part of the style&#x27;s appeal to later generations.

In 1965, the influence of artists such as Bob Dylan, who moved beyond political protest by experimenting with abstract and surreal lyrical imagery and switched to electric guitar, became increasingly pervasive across the musical landscape, affecting a number of genres, including garage rock. The members of garage bands, like so many musicians of the 1960s, were part of a generation that was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time, but grew up confronting a new set of issues facing a more advanced and technological age. Postwar prosperity brought the advantages of better education, as well as more spare time for recreation, which along with the new technology, made it possible for an increasing number of young people to play music. With the advent of television, nuclear weapons, civil rights, the Cold War, and space exploration, the new generation was more global in its mindset and began to conceive of a higher order of human relations, attempting to reach for a set of transcendent ideals, often expressed through rock music. Though set to a backdrop of tragic events that proved increasingly disillusioning, various forms of personal and musical experimentation held promise, at least for a time, in the minds of many. While opening boundaries and testing the frontiers of what the new world had to offer, 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of the new reality, yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy of a moment when the realm of the infinite seemed possible and within reach.

====Garage-based psychedelic rock====

Tapping into the psychedelic zeitgeist, musicians sonically pushed barriers and explored new horizons. Garage acts, while generally lacking the budgetary means to produce musical extravaganzas on the scale of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; or the instrumental virtuosity of acts such as Jimi Hendrix or Cream, nonetheless managed to infuse esoteric elements into basic primitive rock. The 13th Floor Elevators from Austin, Texas, are usually thought to be first band to use the term &quot;psychedelic&quot;—in their promotional literature in early 1966. They also used it in the title of their debut album released in November, &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot;. In August 1966, the Deep traveled from New York to Philadelphia to record a set of hallucinogenic songs for the album &quot;Psychedelic Moods: A Mind-Expanding Phenomena&quot;, released in October 1966, one month before the 13th Floor Elevators&#x27; debut album, and whose all-night sessions produced mind-expanding stream of consciousness ramblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benes (Deep/Psych Moods)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable bands that incorporated psychedelia into garage rock were the Electric Prunes, the Music Machine, the Blues Magoos, and the Chocolate Watchband. Garage rock helped lay the groundwork for the acid rock of the late 1960s.

====Primitivist avant-garde acts====
Certain acts conveyed a world view markedly removed from the implicit innocence of much psychedelia and suburban garage, often infusing their work with subversive political or philosophical messages, dabbling in experimental musical forms and concepts considered at the time to be decidedly out of the mainstream. Such artists shared certain characteristics with the garage bands in their use of primitivistic instrumentation and arrangements, while displaying psychedelic rock&#x27;s affinity for exploration—creating more urbanized, intellectual, and avant garde forms of primitivist rock, sometimes characterized as variants of garage rock. New York City was the home to several such groups. The Fugs, who formed in 1963, were one of rock&#x27;s first experimental bands and its core members were singer, poet, and social activist Ed Sanders, along with Tuli Kupferberg and Ken Weaver. They specialized in a satirical mixture of amateurish garage rock, jug, folk, and psychedelic laced with leftist political commentary. In a 1970 interview, Ed Sanders became the first known musician to describe his music as &quot;punk rock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essor-Winston (Sanders/Punk)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Velvet Underground, whose roster included Lou Reed, are now generally considered the foremost experimental rock group of the period. At the time of recording their first album, they were involved with Andy Warhol, who produced some its tracks, and his assemblage of &quot;scenesters&quot; at the Factory, including model-turned-singer Nico. She shared billing with them on the resulting album, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrics, though generally apolitical, depict the world of hard drugs in songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot; and &quot;Heroin&quot;, and other topics considered taboo at the time.

Outside of New York were the Monks from Germany, whose members were former US servicemen who chose to remain in Germany, where in 1965 they developed an experimental sound on their album &quot;Black Monk Time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deming (Monks/album)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The group, who sometimes wore habits and partially shaven tonsures, specialized in a style featuring chanting and hypnotic percussion.

===Decline===
Even at the height of garage rock&#x27;s popularity in the mid-1960s, the success of most of its records, in spite of a handful of notable exceptions, was relegated to local and regional markets. In the wake of psychedelia, as rock music became increasingly sophisticated, garage rock began to fade. After the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and other late-1960s big-production spectaculars, rock albums became increasingly elaborate and were expected to display a high level of maturity and complexity, while the 45-RPM single ceded to the long-play album as the preferred medium.

Album-oriented FM radio stations eventually overtook AM radio in popularity, and as the large major-label record companies became more powerful and less willing to sign new acts, the once plentiful local and regional independent labels of the mid-1960s began to fold. Radio playlists became more regimented and disc jockeys began to have less freedom, making it increasingly difficult for local and regional bands to receive airplay. Teen clubs and dance venues which previously served as reliable and steady engagements for young groups started to close. The garage sound disappeared at both the national and local level, as band members graduated and departed for college, work, or the military. Musicians in bands frequently faced the prospect of the Vietnam War draft, and many were selected for service. Some died in action. With the tumultuous political events of 1968, the tense mood of the country reached a breaking point, while increasing use of drugs and other factors intermingled with shifting musical tastes. New styles either evolved out of garage rock or replaced it, such as acid rock, progressive rock, heavy metal, country rock, and bubblegum. By 1969 the garage rock phenomenon had largely run its course.

==Later developments==
===1969–1975: Garage-based proto-punk===
Though the garage rock boom faded at the end of the 1960s, a handful of maverick acts carried its impetus into the next decade, seizing on the style&#x27;s rougher edges, while brandishing them with increased volume and aggression. Such acts, often retroactively described as &quot;proto-punk&quot;, worked in a variety of rock genres and came from various places, most notably Michigan, and specialized in music that was often loud, but more primitive than the typical hard rock of the time.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several Michigan bands rooted in garage rock recorded works that became highly influential, particularly with the 1970s punk movement. In 1969, MC5 issued their live debut LP, &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, which featured a set of highly energetic, politically charged songs. The Stooges, from Ann Arbor were fronted by lead singer Iggy Pop, Describing their approach, Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented: &quot;Taking their cue from the over-amplified pounding of British blues, the primal raunch of American garage rock, and the psychedelic rock (as well as the audience-baiting) of the Doors, the Stooges were raw, immediate, and vulgar.&quot; The group released three albums during this period, beginning with the self-titled &quot;The Stooges&quot; in 1969 and culminating with &quot;Raw Power&quot; (now billed as Iggy and the Stooges) in 1973, which featured the cathartic &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; as its opening track. The Alice Cooper band (previously the Spiders) relocated to Detroit, where they began to gain success with a new &quot;shock rock&quot; image, and recorded 1971&#x27;s &quot;Love It to Death&quot;, which featured their breakout hit &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot;.

Two bands that formed during the waning days of the Detroit scene in the early 1970s were the Punks and Death. The Punks had a sometimes thrashing sound that caught the attention of rock journalist Lester Bangs, and their song &quot;My Time&#x27;s Comin was retroactively featured in a 2016 episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl&quot;. In 1974, Death, whose membership was made up of brothers David, Bobby, and Dannis Hackney, recorded tracks for an album that remained unreleased for over 30 years, &quot;...For the Whole World to See&quot;, which, along with the release of their other previously unissued tracks, finally earned them a reputation as pioneers in punk rock. Death&#x27;s music anticipated the arrival of later African American punk acts such as the Bad Brains.

In Boston, the Modern Lovers, led by Velvet Underground devotee Jonathan Richman, gained attention with their minimalistic style. In 1972, they recorded a set of demos that formed the basis of their belated &quot;Modern Lovers&quot; album in 1976. In 1974, an updated garage rock scene began to coalesce around the Rathskeller club in Kenmore Square.&lt;ref name=&quot;(Time/Boston)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Real Kids, a leading band in the scene, were founded by former Modern Lover John Felice. The Electric Eels, who formed in 1972, were a fixture in the underground rock scene in Cleveland, Ohio, which has sometimes been mentioned as a precursor to the punk scenes in New York and London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eels/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Electric Eels were notorious for mayhem at their shows and had a markedly nihilistic approach suggestive of later acts and recorded a set of demos in 1975, from which the single &quot;Agitated&quot; b/w &quot;Cyclotron&quot; was eventually released in 1978, several years after the group&#x27;s demise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eels/Dangerous&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1969 and 1975, other movements further removed from the American garage rock tradition emerged, that nonetheless displayed hallmarks of proto-punk, such as Glam and pub rock in Great Britain, as well as Krautrock in Germany. Conversely, glam rock had an influence on the sound of the New York Dolls from New York, exhibited on their 1973 self-titled debut album and its follow-up, &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolls/Elewine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolls/SOS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dictators, fronted by Handsome Dick Manitoba, were another influential New York act of this period. The music from these disparate scenes helped set the stage for the punk rock phenomenon of the mid- to late- 1970s.

===Mid-1970s: Emergence of the punk movement===

Identification of garage rock by certain critics in the early 1970s (and their use of the term &quot;punk rock&quot; to describe it), as well as the 1972 &quot;Nuggets&quot; compilation exerted a marked degree of influence on the punk movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. As a result of the popularity of &quot;Nuggets&quot; and critical attention paid to primitive-sounding rock of the past and present, a self-conscious musical aesthetic began to emerge around the term &quot;punk&quot; that eventually manifested in the punk scenes of New York, London, and elsewhere between 1975 and 1977, and in the process transformed into a new musical and social movement having its own separate subculture, identity, and values.

The mid- to late-1970s saw the arrival of the acts now most commonly identified as punk rock. Frequently mentioned as the first of these were the Ramones from New York, some of whose members earlier played in 1960s garage bands. They were followed by the Sex Pistols in London, who struck a far more defiant pose and effectively heralded the arrival punk as a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in the larger public mind. Both bands spearheaded the popular punk movement from their respective locations. Simultaneously, Australia developed its own punk scene, which derived some of its inspiration from the 1960s Australian garage/beat movement. One of its leading bands the Saints, from Brisbane, included a rendition of the Missing Links&#x27; 1965 song &quot;Wild About You&quot; on their 1977 debut album.

Despite the influence of garage rock and proto-punk on the originating musicians of these scenes, in the later half of the 1970s punk rock emerged as a new phenomenon, distinct from its prior associations, and the garage band era of the 1960s came to be viewed as a distant forerunner.

===1970s–2000s: Revivalist and hybrid movements===
Garage rock has experienced various revivals in the ensuing years and continues to influence numerous modern acts who prefer a &quot;back to basics&quot; and &quot;do it yourself&quot; musical approach.

====1970s–1980s: Retro revival acts====
The earliest group to attempt to revive the sound of 1960s garage was the Droogs, from Los Angeles, who formed in 1972 and pre-dated many of the revival acts of the 1980s. In the early 1980s, revival scenes linked to the underground music movements of the period sprang up in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and elsewhere, with acts such as the Chesterfield Kings, the Fuzztones, the Pandoras, and Lyres earnestly attempting to replicate the sound and look of the 1960s garage bands. This trend fed in into the alternative rock movement and future grunge explosion, which embraced influences by 1960s garage bands such as the Sonics and the Wailers.

====Other movements====

Out of the garage revival, a more aggressive form of garage rock known as garage punk emerged in the late 1980s. It differed from the &quot;retro&quot; revival in that its acts did not attempt to replicate the exact look and sound of 1960s groups, and their approach tended to be louder, often infusing garage rock with elements of Stooges-era proto-punk, 1970s punk rock, and other influences, creating a new hybrid. Several notable garage punk bands were the Gories, thee Mighty Caesars, the Mummies and thee Headcoats. Originally associated with the 1960s garage revival of the early 1980s, the Pandoras&#x27; sound became increasingly harder as decade progressed. Out of Japan came Guitar Wolf from Nagasaki and the 5.6.7.8&#x27;s from Tokyo. Garage punk and revival acts persisted into the 1990s and the new millennium, with independent record labels releasing records by bands playing fast-paced, lo-fi music. Some of the more prolific independent labels include Estrus, Get Hip, Bomp!, and Sympathy for the Record Industry.

====2000s garage rock revival====

The 2000s was identified as having another wave of garage rock revivalism, with &quot;NME&quot; in 2003 designating it a &quot;new garage rock revolution&quot;, or simply a &quot;new rock revolution&quot;. The mainstream attention to the revival began with the Strokes and their 2001 debut album &quot;Is This It&quot;. Playing a style indebted to &#x27;60s-70s bands like the Velvet Underground and the Ramones, the band&#x27;s intention musically was to sound like &quot;a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record.&quot; When the Strokes released their commercial debut, the public perception of &quot;rock music&quot; was based in post-grunge, nu metal and rap rock, putting their throwback style of garage rock as a stark contrast to the mainstream. The Strokes were accompanied in this commercial breakthrough by the White Stripes and the Hives, who according to music critic Jim DeRogatis, all had a sound &quot;to some extent rooted in &quot;&quot;-era garage rock&quot;.

Detroit&#x27;s garage rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Detroit Cobras, and Rocket 455. Elsewhere, acts such as Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from Chatham, England, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Umeå, Sweden, and Jay Reatard and the Oblivians from Memphis, enjoyed moderate underground success and appeal. A second wave of bands that gained international recognition as a result of the movement included the Black Keys, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Death from Above 1979, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Killers, Interpol, Cage the Elephant, and Kings of Leon from the US, the Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, Editors, and Franz Ferdinand from the UK, Jet from Australia, and the Datsuns and the D4 from New Zealand.

The mid-2000s saw several underground bands achieve mainstream prominence. Acts such as Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, Black Lips and Jay Reatard, that initially released records on smaller garage punk labels such as In the Red Records, began signing to larger, better-known independent labels. Several bands followed them in signing to larger labels such as Rough Trade and Drag City.

==Compilations==
According to Peter Aaron, there are over a thousand garage rock compilations featuring work by various artists of the 1960s. The first major garage rock compilation, &quot;&quot;, was released by Elektra Records in 1972. &quot;Nuggets&quot; grew into a multi-volume series, when Rhino Records in the 1980s released fifteen installments that consisted of songs from the original album plus additional tracks. In 1998, Rhino released a four-CD box set version of &quot;Nuggets&quot;, containing the original album and three additional discs of material, that included extensive liner notes by some of garage rock&#x27;s most influential writers.

The &quot;Pebbles&quot; series was begun by Greg Shaw and originally appeared on his Bomp label in 1978 and has been issued in successive installments on LP and CD. &quot;Back from the Grave&quot; is a series issued by Crypt Records that focuses on hard-driving and primitive examples of the genre. Big Beat Records&#x27; &quot;Uptight Tonight: The Ultimate 1960s Garage Punk Primer&quot; also features harder material. There are several notable anthologies devoted to female garage bands from the 1960s. &quot;Girls in the Garage&quot; was the first female garage rock series, and Ace Records&#x27; issued the more recent &quot;Girls with Guitars&quot; compilations.

There are numerous collections featuring garage/beat music from outside of North America. Rhino&#x27;s &quot;Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964–1969&quot; 4-CD box set includes music from the United Kingdom and other countries in the British commonwealth. It is of particular interest to fans of freakbeat. The &quot;Trans World Punk Rave-Up&quot; series focuses on garage and Nederbeat music from Continental Europe from the 1960s. &quot;Ugly Things&quot; was the first compilation series to highlight 1960s Australian garage bands. &quot;Down Under Nuggets: Original Australian Artyfacts 1965–1967&quot; is also devoted to Australian acts, while &quot;Do the Pop! The Australian Garage Rock Sound 1976-1987&quot; covers more recent bands.

&quot;Los Nuggetz Volume Uno&quot; is devoted primarily to Latin American groups of the 1960s and is available in a single-CD edition, as well as an expanded 4-CD box set. &quot;GS I Love You: Japanese Garage Bands of the 1960s&quot; and its companion piece &quot;GS I Love You Too: Japanese Garage Bands of the 1960s&quot; Both sets feature GS acts from Japan. The &quot;Simla Beat 70/71&quot; compilation consists of recordings by garage rock acts from India that competed in the 1970 and 1971 Simla Beat contests. Though its tracks were recorded at the turn of the 1970s, most of them bear a striking resemblance to music made in the West several years earlier.

<text>John Bampton (16902 June 1751) was an English churchman who founded the Bampton Lectures at the University of Oxford.

==Biography==
Bampton&#x27;s father was Jasper Bampton of Salisbury. In 1705 at age 16 he was admitted to Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1709, M.A. in 1712. He was rector of Stratford Tony, Wiltshire, and simultaneously a prebendary of Salisbury, from April 1718 until his death in 1751.

==Will establishing lectures==
He is now remembered chiefly because of the contents of his will, which directs that eight lectures shall be delivered annually at Oxford in the University Church on as many Sunday mornings in full term, &quot;between the commencement of the last month in Lent term and the end of the third week in Act term, upon either of the following subjects: to confirm and establish the Christian faith, and to confute all heretics and schismatics; upon the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures; upon the authority of the writings of the primitive fathers, as to the faith and practice of the primitive Church; upon the divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; upon the divinity of the Holy Ghost; upon the articles of the Christian faith as comprehended in the Apostles and Nicene Creeds.&quot;

The bequest did not take effect until 1779, when the first lecturer was chosen.

The lecturer, who must be at least a Master of Arts of Oxford or Cambridge, was formerly chosen yearly by the heads of colleges, on the fourth Tuesday in Easter term, and no one can be chosen a second time. The Bampton Lectures, as they are known, began in 1780, and are still held, but have been biennial since 1901. The lectures have to be published within two months of their delivery.

==Background to the benefaction==

Bampton owned Nunton Farm, in southern Wiltshire near his parish, comprising land in Nunton, Downton, and Britford. Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone wished to purchase it for his estate at Longford Castle which is just north-east of Nunton. Bampton was unwilling to sell, a dispute arose, and to put the land beyond Folkestone&#x27;s reach, Bampton left it to the University of Oxford, which took possession around 1778 after his wife had died. Eventually Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor, Folkestone&#x27;s grandson, made an exchange in 1805 with the university of Nunton Farm for the Tinkersole estate at Wing, Buckinghamshire, backed by a local act of Parliament, the (45 Geo. 3. c. lxxxii).

==Sarum lectures==
A second series of lectures, not restricted to Anglican theologians, was established with the Bampton fund in 1952. The first Sarum lecturer was appointed for 1954; the lectureship was discontinued in 1995. The subsequent annual series of Sarum Theological Lectures are unconnected, being organised by Sarum College and taking place in Salisbury Cathedral.

<text>Adriano Banchieri (Bologna, 3 September 1568 – Bologna, 1634) was an Italian composer, music theorist, organist and poet of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He founded the Accademia dei Floridi in Bologna.

==Biography==
He was born and died in Bologna (then in the Papal States). In 1587 he became a monk of the Benedictine order, taking his vows in 1590, and changing his name to Adriano (from Tommaso). One of his teachers at the monastery was Gioseffo Guami, who had a strong influence on his style.

Like Orazio Vecchi he was interested in converting the madrigal to dramatic purposes. Specifically, he was one of the developers of a form called &quot;madrigal comedy&quot; — unstaged but dramatic collections of madrigals which, when sung consecutively, told a story. Formerly, madrigal comedy was considered to be one of the important precursors to opera, but most music scholars now see it as a separate development, part of a general interest in Italy at the time in creating musico-dramatic forms. In addition, he was an important composer of canzonettas, a lighter and hugely popular alternative to the madrigal in the late 16th century.
Banchieri disapproved of the monodists with all their revolutionary harmonic tendencies, about which he expressed himself vigorously in his &quot;Moderna Practica Musicale&quot; (1613), while systematizing the legitimate use of the monodic art of figured bass.

In several editions beginning in 1605 (reprinted at least six times before 1638), Banchieri published a series of organ works entitled &quot;l&#x27;Organo suonarino&quot;.

Banchieri&#x27;s last publication was the &quot;Trattenimenti da villa&quot; of 1630. According to Martha Farahat he wrote five madrigal comedies between 1598 and 1628 with &quot;plot and character development&quot;, starting with &quot;La pazzia senile&quot; of 1598, the last of them &quot;La saviezza giovenile&quot;.

<doc id="149104" wikidata="Q2484309" url="?curid=149104" title="Home Secretary">
<text>The Secretary of State for the Home Department, more commonly known as the Home Secretary, is a senior minister of the Crown in the Government of the United Kingdom and the head of the Home Office. The position is a Great Office of State, making the home secretary one of the most senior and influential ministers in the government. The incumbent is a statutory member of the British Cabinet and National Security Council.

The position, which may be known as interior minister in other nations, was created in 1782, though its responsibilities have changed many times. Past office holders have included the prime ministers Lord North, Robert Peel, the Duke of Wellington, Lord Palmerston, Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and Theresa May. The longest-serving home secretary is Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, who held the post continuously for 9 years, 221 days. The shortest-serving home secretary is Grant Shapps, who served in the position for the final six days of the premiership of Liz Truss. In 2007, Jacqui Smith became the first female home secretary. The incumbent home secretary is Yvette Cooper.

The office holder works alongside the other Home Office ministers and the permanent under-secretary of state of the Home Office. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow home secretary, and the performance of the home secretary is also scrutinized by the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons and the Justice and Home Affairs Committee in the House of Lords.

Historically, the role has a reputation for being a graveyard for aspiring politicians, owing to the large number of potential issues and controversies that can arise.

==Responsibilities==

Corresponding to what is generally known as an interior minister in many other countries, the home secretary&#x27;s remit includes:
* Law enforcement in England and Wales
* Matters of national security
* Issues concerning immigration
* Oversight of the Security Service (MI5).

Formerly, the home secretary was the minister responsible for prisons and probation in England and Wales; however in 2007 those responsibilities were transferred to the Ministry of Justice under the lord chancellor.

==History==
The title Secretary of State in the government of England dates back to the early 17th century. The position of Secretary of State for the Home Department was created in the British governmental reorganisation of 1782, in which the responsibilities of the Northern and Southern Departments were reformed into the Foreign Office and Home Office.

In 2007, the new Ministry of Justice took on the criminal justice functions of the Home Office and its agencies.

<doc id="149105" wikidata="Q690931" url="?curid=149105" title="Kaprun disaster">
<text>On 11 November 2000, a fire in the tunnel of Gletscherbahn Kaprun 2 funicular in Kaprun, Austria, killed 155 people. The cause was traced to a faulty fan heater. Most of the victims were skiers on their way to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier. To date, this incident remains the deadliest rail disaster in Austrian history.

==Train==
The Gletscherbahn Kaprun 2 funicular railway opened in 1974 and ran from Kaprun to the Kitzsteinhorn and was modernized in 1993. It had an unusual track gauge of , and a length of , of which was inside a tunnel. The train ascended and descended the 30 degree slope at . Two trains ran simultaneously on a single track, with a section halfway allowing them to pass each other. The tunnel terminated at the main reception centre, the Alpincenter, where a motorized winch drove the trains. It was a low-voltage electrical system, with 160-litre hydraulic tanks on board for the brakes and doors, and a conductor. Each train had four passenger compartments giving a total capacity of 180 passengers, and a conductor&#x27;s cab at each end; the conductor switched end as the train travelled up and down.

==Fire==
On 11 November 2000 shortly after 9:00 am, 161 passengers and one conductor boarded the funicular train for the slopes. The train unexpectedly halted into the tunnel. Some minutes later the conductor reported a fire to the control centre, and failed in an attempt to open the hydraulically operated doors. The conductor then lost contact with the control centre because the fire had burned through a 16kV power cable running alongside the track, causing a power blackout throughout the ski resort.

The passengers attempted to break the shatter-resistant acrylic windows. Twelve people from the rear of the train broke a window with a ski pole and, advised by an escapee who had been a volunteer fire fighter, escaped downwards past the fire and below the smoke.

Many of the trapped occupants lost consciousness due to toxic fumes. Eventually the conductor managed to unlock the doors, allowing them to be manually forced open. The conscious passengers fled up the tunnel away from the fire. The tunnel acted as a blast furnace, sucking oxygen in from below and sending poisonous fumes, heat and the fire itself upwards. The conductor and all the passengers ascending on foot died by asphyxiation and were burned.

The conductor and the sole passenger on the second train, which was descending in the same tunnel above the burning train, also died of smoke inhalation. The smoke rose into the Alpincenter above. Two fleeing workers in the Alpincenter alerted employees and customers and escaped via an emergency exit. They left the exit doors open, which contributed to the chimney effect. All except four people escaped the centre as it filled with smoke. Firefighters reached the centre and revived one of the four; the other three were asphyxiated.

==Investigation==
The official inquiry determined that the cause was the failure, overheating and ignition of a fan heater in the conductor&#x27;s compartments which was not designed for use in a moving vehicle. A design fault caused the unit to overheat, in turn causing the mount for the heating element to break off. The element jammed against its casing and caught fire. A slow leak of flammable hydraulic fluid was ignited which melted the fluid lines, further feeding the flames. The loss of hydraulic pressure applied the brakes (which are kept open by hydraulic pressure) and disabled the hydraulically operated doors.

The structural flaws of the funicular trains, especially the lack of safety mechanisms, were found to have played a role. Fire extinguishers in each funicular unit were in the sealed attendants&#x27; compartments out of the passengers&#x27; reach. There were no smoke detectors. There was no cellphone reception within the tunnels, meaning passengers had no way to contact the attendant. Funicular expert Professor Josef Nejez said the designers had a perception that fire could not occur in a funicular cabin because no fire had occurred previously. The train complied with area safety codes, which did not address the systems installed on the train during its 1993 upgrade. The onboard electric power, hydraulic braking systems, and fan heaters intended for domestic use increased the likelihood of fire.

==Casualties and aftermath==

In addition to those who escaped from the Alpincenter and the person whom firefighters revived, 10 Germans and two Austrians escaped from the burning train by descending past the fire.

19-year-old German freestyle skier Sandra Schmitt was one of the victims, at the time the reigning Women&#x27;s Dual Moguls World Champion. Josef Schaupper, a seven-time Deaflympic medalist, was killed along with his fellow deaf skiers.

The funicular was not reopened and was replaced by a gondola lift, a 24-person Gletscherjet 1 funitel. The stations were abandoned and the tunnel sealed. The track remained in place for over a decade until the track and the supporting structure below the tunnel were removed in 2014, leaving just a gap in the trees where it had been.

On 19 February 2004, Judge Manfred Seiss acquitted all 16 suspects, including company officials, technicians, and government inspectors, saying there was insufficient evidence to find them guilty of criminal negligence. In September 2007, the public prosecutor found the manufacturer of the electric heater was not responsible.

== Memorial ==

On 11 November 2004, coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the disaster, a memorial was inaugurated. It features a stone structure with 155 glass columns, each representing one of the victims who perished in the incident.

<text>Abba Solomon Meir Eban (; ; born Aubrey Solomon Meir Eban; 2 February 1915 – 17 November 2002) was a South African-born Israeli diplomat and politician, and a scholar of the Arabic and Hebrew languages.

During his career, he served as Foreign Affairs Minister, Education Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister of Israel. He was the second ambassador to the United States and the first Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations. He was also vice president of the United Nations General Assembly and president of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

==Early life==
Eban was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on 2 February 1915 to Lithuanian Jewish parents; his mother, Alida Sacks, was an aunt of Oliver Sacks, while his father, Avram Solomon, died while Eban was still an infant. Eban&#x27;s mother moved to the United Kingdom at an early age. As a child, he recalled being sent to his grandfather&#x27;s house every weekend to study the Hebrew language, Talmud, and Biblical literature. He lived for a period of time in Belfast.

He attended St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, then in Southwark, and read Classics and Oriental languages at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he achieved a very rare triple first, studying Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian; these were three of the ten languages he would reportedly master (he enjoyed translating newspapers into Ancient Greek). At the age of 23, he became a Fellow of Pembroke College, a role he held from 1938 to 1939, and was marked for a distinguished academic career.

During his time at university and afterwards, Eban was highly involved in the Federation of Zionist Youth and was editor of its journal, &quot;The Young Zionist&quot;. At the outbreak of World War II, he worked for Chaim Weizmann at the Zionist Organization in London from December 1939.

He served in the British Army in Egypt and Mandate Palestine, becoming an intelligence officer in Jerusalem, where he coordinated and trained volunteers for resistance in the event of a German invasion, serving as a liaison officer for the Allies to the Jewish Yishuv.

After the war he continued in his post, helping to establish and run the British Foreign Office&#x27;s Middle East Centre for Arab Studies which was originally based in Jerusalem before relocating to Shemlan near Beirut. He was at that time known as &quot;Aubrey Evans&quot;.

In 1947, he translated from the original Arabic &quot;Maze of Justice: Diary of a Country Prosecutor&quot;, a 1937 novel by Tawfiq al-Hakim.

==Diplomacy==
Eban moved back to London briefly to work in the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Information Department, from which he was posted to New York, where the United Nations General Assembly was considering the &quot;Palestine Question&quot;. In 1947, he was appointed as a liaison officer to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, where he was successful in attaining approval for the recommendation of partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab segments—Resolution 181. At this stage, he changed his name to the Hebrew word Abba, meaning &quot;Father&quot;.

Eban continued at the United Nations over the next decade. From 1950 to 1959 he also served as his country&#x27;s ambassador to the United States. He was renowned for his oratorical skills. As Henry Kissinger stated:I have never encountered anyone who matched his command of the English language. Sentences poured forth in mellifluous constructions complicated enough to test the listener’s intelligence and simultaneously leave him transfixed by the speaker&#x27;s virtuosity. His knowledge of history and fluency in ten languages enhanced his speech-making in the United Nations, even to skeptical or hostile audiences. In 1952, Eban was elected vice president of the UN General Assembly. A collection of Eban&#x27;s speeches before the United Nations&#x27; Security Council and General Assembly both at universities and other venues between 1948 and 1968 was compiled in &quot;Voice of Israel&quot;, recently reissued in eBook form by Plunkett Lake Press.

He was known for his witty remarks. For example, when he was complimented on his perfect Oxford English he replied &quot;Cambridge actually, but in politics one expects to be smeared.&quot;

==Politics==

Eban left the United States in 1959 and returned to Israel, where he was elected to the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) as a member of Mapai. He served under David Ben-Gurion as Minister of Education and Culture from 1960 to 1963, then as deputy to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol until 1966. Through this period (1959–66), he also served as president of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot.

From 1966 to 1974, Eban served as Israel&#x27;s foreign minister. He defended the country&#x27;s reputation after the Six-Day War by asserting, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, that Israel acted in response to an imminent threat: &quot;So on the fateful morning of 5 June, when Egyptian forces moved by air and land against Israel&#x27;s western coast and southern territory, our country&#x27;s choice was plain.&quot; Nonetheless, he was a strong supporter of trading parts of the territories occupied in the war in exchange for peace. While serving as foreign minister, he remained in contact with Israel&#x27;s Ambassador to the U.S. Avraham Harman during the war. Five days after the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident took place, Harman cabled from Washington D.C. to Eban in Tel Aviv that one of their sources was reporting that the Americans had &quot;clear proof that from a certain stage the pilot discovered the identity of the ship and continued the attack anyway.&quot; Three days later, Harman repeated the warning to Eban that the White House was &quot;very angry&quot; and &quot;the reason for this is that the Americans probably have findings showing that our pilots indeed knew that the ship was American.&quot; Eban also played an important part in the shaping of UN Security Council Resolution 242 in 1967, as well as Resolution 338 in 1973. Among his other high level contacts, he was received by Pope Paul VI in 1969.

Eban was at times criticized for not voicing his opinions in Israel&#x27;s internal debate. However, he was generally known to be on the &quot;dovish&quot; side of Israeli politics and was increasingly outspoken after leaving the cabinet. In 1977 and 1981, it was widely understood that Shimon Peres intended to name Eban Foreign Minister, had the Labor Party won those elections. Eban was offered the chance to serve as minister without portfolio in the 1984 national unity government, but chose to serve instead as chair of the Knesset&#x27;s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee from 1984 to 1988.

His comment that Arabs &quot;never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity&quot; (i.e., for peace), made after the Geneva peace talks in December 1973, is often quoted.

==Later life==
In 1988, after three decades in the Knesset, Eban lost his seat over internal splits in the Labour Party. He devoted the rest of his life to writing and teaching, including serving as a visiting academic at Princeton University, Columbia University and George Washington University. He also narrated television documentaries including &quot;Heritage: Civilization and the Jews&quot; (PBS, 1984), for which he was host, &quot;Israel, A Nation Is Born&quot; (1992), and &quot;On the Brink of Peace&quot; (PBS, 1997). In his book &quot;Diplomacy for the Next Century&quot; (p.161) he said of Benjamin Netanyahu &quot;Only Binyamin Netanyahu, the newly elected Israeli leader, failed to comprehend the centrality of the Palestine issue in the Middle East&quot;.

Eban died in 2002 and was buried in Kfar Shmaryahu, north of Tel Aviv. He was survived by his wife, Shoshana &quot;Suzy&quot; (née Ambache) (sister of Aura Herzog), who died in 2011, and their two children.

==Family==
Eban&#x27;s son, Eli Eban, is a clarinettist who teaches at Indiana University. Eli has two children, Yael and Omri Eban.

Eban&#x27;s brother-in-law was Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of Israel. Herzog&#x27;s son Isaac Herzog was leader of the Israeli Labor Party from 2013 to 2018 and has been the President of Israel since 7 July 2021.

Eban&#x27;s cousin, Oliver Sacks, was a neurologist and author. Eban&#x27;s nephew, Jonathan Lynn, is a filmmaker and scriptwriter known for satirical BBC shows &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. Lynn recounts that the plot of an episode of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (&quot;A Victory for Democracy&quot;), which involved the British Prime Minister bypassing his own Arab-centred bureaucracy by taking the Israeli ambassador&#x27;s advice, was based on an actual incident narrated to him by Eban.

==Awards==
In 2001, Eban was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State.

<text>Carole King Klein (born Carol Joan Klein; February 9, 1942) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. One of the most successful songwriters in American history, she wrote or co-wrote 118 pop hits appearing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 over the latter half of the 20th century. King also wrote 61 hits that charted in the UK, making her the most successful female songwriter on the UK singles charts between 1962 and 2005.

King&#x27;s major success began in the 1960s when she and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, wrote more than two dozen chart hits, many of which have become standards, for numerous artists. She has continued writing for other artists since then. King&#x27;s success as a performer in her own right did not come until the 1970s, when she sang her own songs, accompanying herself on the piano, in a series of albums and concerts. After experiencing commercial disappointment with her debut album &quot;Writer&quot;, King scored her breakthrough with the album &quot;Tapestry&quot;, which topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in 1971 and remained on the charts for more than six years.

King has made 25 solo albums, the most successful being &quot;Tapestry&quot;, which held the record for most weeks at No. 1 by a female artist for more than 20 years. Her record sales were estimated at more than 75 million copies worldwide. She has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She has been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a performer and songwriter. She is the recipient of the 2013 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first woman to be so honored. She is also a 2015 Kennedy Center Honoree.

==Early life and education==
King was born Carol Joan Klein on February 9, 1942, in Manhattan, New York City, to Jewish parents Eugenia (&quot;née&quot; Cammer), a teacher, and Sidney N. Klein, a firefighter. King&#x27;s parents met in an elevator in 1936 at Brooklyn College, where her father was a chemistry major and her mother was an English and drama major.

They married in 1937 during the last years of the Great Depression. King&#x27;s mother dropped out of college to run the household; her father also quit college and briefly took a job as a radio announcer. With the economy struggling, he then took a more secure job as a firefighter. After King was born, her parents settled in Brooklyn and were eventually able to buy a small two-story duplex where they could rent out the upstairs for income.

King&#x27;s mother had learned to play piano as a child and, after buying a piano, would sometimes practice. When King developed an insatiable curiosity about music from the time she was about three, her mother began teaching her basic piano skills without giving her actual lessons. When King was four, her parents discovered she had absolute pitch, which enabled her to name a note correctly just by hearing it. King&#x27;s father enjoyed showing off his daughter&#x27;s skill to visiting friends: &quot;My dad&#x27;s smile was so broad that it encompassed the lower half of his face. I enjoyed making my father happy and getting the notes right.&quot;

King&#x27;s mother began giving her real music lessons when she was four with King climbing the stool, made higher still by a phone book. With her mother sitting beside her, King learned music theory and elementary piano technique, including how to read notation and execute proper note timing. King wanted to learn as much as possible: &quot;My mother never forced me to practice. She didn&#x27;t have to. I wanted so much to master the popular songs that poured out of the radio.&quot;

King began kindergarten when she was four, and after her first year, she was promoted directly to second grade, showing an exceptional facility with words and numbers. In the 1950s, she attended James Madison High School in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. She formed a band called the Co-Sines, changed her name from Carol Klein to Carole King, and made demo records with her friend Paul Simon for $25 a session. Her first official recording was the promotional single &quot;The Right Girl&quot;, released by ABC-Paramount in 1958, which she wrote and sang to an arrangement by Don Costa.

King attended Queens College, where she met Gerry Goffin, who was to become her songwriting partner. When she was 17, they married in a Jewish ceremony on Long Island in August 1959 after King became pregnant with her first daughter, Louise. They quit college and took day jobs, Goffin working as an assistant chemist and King as a secretary. They wrote songs together in the evening.

Neil Sedaka, who had dated King when he was still in high school, had a hit in 1959 with &quot;Oh! Carol&quot;. Goffin took the tune and wrote the playful response, &quot;Oh! Neil&quot;, which King recorded and released as a single the same year. The B-side contained the Goffin-King song &quot;A Very Special Boy&quot;. The single was not a success. After writing the Shirelles&#x27; 1960 &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 1 hit, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; —the first No. 1 by a black girl group—Goffin and King gave up their daytime jobs to concentrate on writing. &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; became a pop standard.

==Career==
===1960s===

In the 1960s, with King composing the music and Goffin writing the lyrics, the two wrote a string of classic songs for a variety of artists. King and Goffin were also the songwriting team behind Don Kirshner&#x27;s Dimension Records, which produced songs including &quot;Chains&quot; (later recorded by the Everly Brothers and the Beatles), &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, &quot;Keep Your Hands off My Baby&quot; (both for their babysitter Little Eva), and &quot;It Might as Well Rain Until September&quot; which King recorded herself in 1962—her first success, which charted at 22 in the US and 3 in the UK (where it was her all-time greatest hit). King recorded a few follow-up singles in the wake of &quot;September&quot;, with none charting particularly well; by 1966, her already sporadic recording career was entirely abandoned – albeit temporarily.

Other songs of King&#x27;s early period (through 1967) include &quot;Crying In The Rain&quot; peaking at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 in February 1962 for the Everly Brothers, &quot;Half Way To Paradise&quot; for Tony Orlando (recorded by Billy Fury in the UK), &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby&quot; for Bobby Vee, &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; for the Drifters, &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot; for Earl-Jean (later recorded by Herman&#x27;s Hermits), &quot;One Fine Day&quot; for the Chiffons, and &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot; for the Monkees (inspired by their move to suburban West Orange, New Jersey), and the classic &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; for Aretha Franklin. The duo wrote several songs recorded by Dusty Springfield, including &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; and &quot;Some of Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;. They wrote at 1650 Broadway, alongside other songwriters associated with the Brill Building Sound.

By 1968, Goffin and King were divorced and not keeping in contact. King moved to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, with her two daughters, and reactivated her recording career by forming &quot;The City&quot;, a music trio consisting of bassist Charles Larkey (her future husband) and Danny Kortchmar on guitar and vocals, with King herself on piano and vocals. The City produced one album, &quot;Now That Everything&#x27;s Been Said&quot; (1968), but King&#x27;s reluctance to perform live meant promotion and sales were limited. A change of distributors meant that the album was quickly deleted, and the group disbanded in 1969. The album was rediscovered by Classic Rock radio in the early 1980s, with the cut &quot;Snow Queen&quot; receiving nominal airplay for a few years. Cleveland&#x27;s WMMS played it every few weeks between 1981 and 1985, and the long-out-of-print LP became sought-after by fans of King who liked the edgy sound of the music.

===1970s===

While living in Laurel Canyon, King met James Taylor and Joni Mitchell, as well as Toni Stern, with whom she collaborated. King released her debut solo album, &quot;Writer&quot;, in 1970 for Lou Adler&#x27;s Ode label, with Taylor playing acoustic guitar and providing backing vocals. It peaked at #84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. That same year, King played keyboard on B.B. King&#x27;s album &quot;Indianola Mississippi Seeds&quot;.

King followed up &quot;Writer&quot; with her sophomore effort &quot;Tapestry&quot; (1971), which featured new songs as well as renewed versions of &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;. The album was recorded concurrently with Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Mud Slide Slim,&quot; with an overlapping set of musicians including King, Danny Kortchmar and Joni Mitchell. Both albums included &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, which was a #1 hit for Taylor; King said in a 1972 interview that she &quot;didn&#x27;t write it with James or anybody really specifically in mind. But when James heard it he really liked it and wanted to record it&quot;.

&quot;Tapestry&quot; was an instant success. With numerous hit singles—including a &quot;Billboard&quot; #1 with &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;—&quot;Tapestry&quot; held the #1 spot on the albums chart for 15 consecutive weeks, remained on the charts for nearly six years, and has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. The album garnered four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance (Female), Record of the Year (&quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, lyrics by Toni Stern), and Song of the Year, with King becoming the first woman to win the award (for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;). The album appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at #36. In addition, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; was ranked #469 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

&quot;Carole King Music&quot; was released in December 1971 and subsequently certified gold on December 9. It entered the top ten at #8, with &quot;Tapestry&quot; and &quot;Carole King: Music&quot; simultaneously occupying the top 10 for many weeks. The following week, &quot;Tapestry&quot; rose to #3 before ascending to the top of the chart on January 1, 1972, staying there for three weeks. The album also spawned a top-ten hit with &quot;Sweet Seasons&quot; (US #9 and AC #2). &quot;Carole King: Music&quot; stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop album charts for 44 weeks and was eventually certified platinum.

&quot;Rhymes and Reasons&quot; (1972) and &quot;Fantasy&quot; (1973) followed, each record earning gold certifications. &quot;Rhymes and Reasons&quot; produced another successful single, &quot;Been to Canaan&quot; (US #24 and AC #1), and &quot;Fantasy&quot; produced two, &quot;Believe in Humanity&quot; (US #28) and &quot;Corazon&quot; (US #37 and AC #5), as well as another song that charted on the Hot 100, &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; (US #67 and AC #6).

In 1973, King performed a free concert in New York City&#x27;s Central Park for at least 100,000 people on Saturday, May 26. The concert was recorded for the film &quot;Carole King: Home Again - Live in Central Park&quot;.

In September 1974, King released her album &quot;Wrap Around Joy,&quot; which was certified gold on October 16, 1974, and entered the top ten at #7 on October 19, 1974. Two weeks later, it became King&#x27;s third album to reach #1. &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot; spawned two singles, &quot;Jazzman&quot; and &quot;Nightingale&quot;. &quot;Jazzman&quot; peaked at #2 on November 9 but fell out of the top ten the next week; &quot;Nightingale&quot; peaked at #9 on March 1, 1975.

In 1975, King scored and recorded songs for the children&#x27;s animated TV production of Maurice Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Really Rosie&quot;, released as an album by the same name, with lyrics by Sendak.
&quot;Thoroughbred&quot; (1976) was the last studio album King released under the Ode label. In addition to enlisting long-time friends (such as David Crosby, Graham Nash, James Taylor, and Waddy Wachtel), King reunited with ex Gerry Goffin to write four songs for the album. Their partnership continued intermittently. King also did a promotional tour for the album in 1976.

After covering her song &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; on October 17 and 18, 1975, at two of his high-profile Roxy gigs, Bruce Springsteen showed up at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on March 7, 1976, to sing &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; with King for the night&#x27;s final encore.

In 1977, King collaborated with another songwriter, Rick Evers, on &quot;Simple Things&quot;, the first release with a new label distributed by Capitol Records. Shortly after that, King and Evers were married; he died of a cocaine overdose, one year later, while King and her daughter, Sherry, were in Hawaii. &quot;Simple Things&quot; was her first album that failed to reach the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; since &quot;Tapestry&quot;, and it was her last gold-certified record by the RIAA, except for a compilation album, &quot;Her Greatest Hits&quot; (1978), and &quot;Live at the Troubadour&quot; (2010).

Despite its gold-certified record status, &quot;Simple Things&quot; was named &quot;The Worst Album of 1977&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Neither &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (1978)—her debut as a co-producer on an album—nor &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; (1979) entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100. &quot;Pearls – The Songs of Goffin and King&quot; (1980) yielded a hit single, an updated version of &quot;One Fine Day&quot;.

===1980s===
King moved to Atlantic Records for &quot;One to One&quot; (1982) and &quot;Speeding Time&quot; in 1983, which was a reunion with &quot;Tapestry&quot;-era producer Lou Adler. After a well-received concert tour in 1984, journalist Catherine Foster of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; dubbed King &quot;a Queen of Rock&quot;. She also called King&#x27;s performance &quot;all spunk and exuberance.&quot;

In 1985, she wrote and performed &quot;Care-A-Lot&quot;, the theme to &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, and she wrote and performed &quot;Home Is In Your Heart&quot;. Also in 1985, she scored and performed (with David Sanborn) the soundtrack to the Martin Ritt-directed movie &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot;. The soundtrack, again produced by Adler, included the songs &quot;Running Lonely&quot; and &quot;Love For The Last Time (Theme from &#x27;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&#x27;)&quot;, although a soundtrack album was apparently never officially released. King made a cameo appearance in the film as Tillie, a town hall employee.

In 1988, she starred in the off-Broadway production &quot;A Minor Incident&quot;. In 1989, she returned to Capitol Records and recorded &quot;City Streets&quot;, with Eric Clapton on two tracks and Branford Marsalis on one.

===1990s===
Her song &quot;Now and Forever&quot; was in the opening credits to the 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and was nominated for a Grammy Award. &quot;Colour of Your Dreams&quot; was released in 1993 and featured an appearance by Slash.

In 1994, she played Mrs. Johnstone on Broadway in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. In 1996, she appeared in &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; in Ireland, directed by Peter Sheridan. That same year, she released the live album &quot;The Carnegie Hall Concert: June 18, 1971&quot;.

In 1997, King wrote and recorded backing vocals on &quot;The Reason&quot; for Celine Dion on her album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;. The pair performed a duet on the first VH1 Divas Live benefit concert. King also performed her song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; with Dion, Gloria Estefan, and Shania Twain, as well as &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; with Aretha Franklin and others, including Mariah Carey. In 1998, King wrote and performed &quot;Anyone at All&quot; for the film &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

===2000s===

In 2000, King was asked to record a version of her hit song &quot;Where You Lead&quot; as the theme song for the show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. She rewrote a few lyrics to fit the mother-daughter story. She often performs this song with her daughter, Louise Goffin. She rarely performed the song after its original release due to the rise in the Women&#x27;s liberation movement and falling out of favor of the sentiment behind the lyrics. King agreed to revamp the song to be, &quot;something more relevant.&quot; The song became strongly associated with female friendships and family members.

In 2001, King appeared in a television ad for the Gap with her daughter. She performed a new song, &quot;Love Makes the World&quot;, which became a title track for her studio album in autumn 2001 on her own label, Rockingale, distributed by Koch Records. The album includes songs she wrote for other artists during the mid-1990s and features Celine Dion, Steven Tyler, Babyface, and k.d. lang. &quot;Love Makes the World&quot; went to 158 in the US and No. 86 in the UK. It also debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Top Independent Albums chart and Top Internet Albums chart at No. 20. An expanded edition of the album was issued six years later called &quot;Love Makes the World Deluxe Edition&quot;. It contains a bonus disc with five additional tracks, including a remake of &quot;Where You Lead (I Will Follow)&quot; co-written with Toni Stern.

The same year, King and Stern wrote &quot;Sayonara Dance&quot;, recorded by Yuki, former lead vocalist of the Japanese band Judy and Mary, on her first solo album &quot;Prismic&quot; the following year. Also in 2001, King composed a song for &quot;All About Chemistry&quot; album by Semisonic, with the band&#x27;s frontman Dan Wilson.

King launched her Living Room Tour in July 2004 at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago. That show, along with shows at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles and the Cape Cod Melody Tent (Hyannis, Massachusetts), were recorded as &quot;The Living Room Tour&quot; in July 2005. The album sold 44,000 copies in its first week in the US, landing at 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, her highest-charting album since 1977. The album also charted at 51 in Australia. It has sold 330,000 copies in the United States. In August 2006 the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at 151. The tour stopped in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. A DVD of the tour, &quot;Welcome to My Living Room&quot;, was released in October 2007.

In November 2007, King toured Japan with Mary J. Blige and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas. Japanese record labels Sony and Victor reissued most of King&#x27;s albums, including the works from the late 1970s previously unavailable on compact disc. King recorded a duet of the Goffin/King composition &quot;Time Don&#x27;t Run Out on Me&quot; with Anne Murray on Murray&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends&quot;. The song had previously been recorded by Murray for her 1984 album &quot;Heart Over Mind&quot;.

===2010s===

In 2010 King and James Taylor staged their Troubadour Reunion Tour together, recalling the first time they played at The Troubadour, West Hollywood in 1970. The pair had reunited to mark the club&#x27;s 50th anniversary two and a half years earlier in 2007 with the band they used in 1970. They enjoyed it so much that they decided to take the band on the road for 2010. The touring band featured players from that original band: Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Danny Kortchmar. Also present was King&#x27;s son-in-law, Robbie Kondor and Taylor&#x27;s three backing singers. King played piano and Taylor guitar on each other&#x27;s songs, and they sang together some of the numbers they were both associated with. The tour began in Australia in March, returning to the United States in May. It was a major commercial success, with King playing to some of the largest audiences of her career. Total ticket sales exceeded 700,000 and the tour grossed over 59 million dollars, making it one of the most successful tours of the year.

During their Troubadour Reunion Tour, King released two albums, one of new material recorded with Taylor. The first, released in April 2010, &quot;The Essential Carole King&quot;, was a compilation album of King&#x27;s work and artists covering her songs. The second album, &quot;Live at the Troubadour&quot; was released in May 2010, a collaboration between King and Taylor. It debuted at No.4 in the United States with sales of 78,000 copies. &quot;Live at the Troubadour&quot; has since received a gold record from the RIAA for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the US and remained on the charts for 34 weeks.

King&#x27;s mother, Eugenia Gingold, died in December 2010 in Delray Beach, Florida aged 94, from congestive heart failure.

In the fall of 2011, King released &quot;A Holiday Carole&quot;, an album of Christmas music and new songs written by her daughter Louise Goffin who co-produced the album. The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Album.

King&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Natural Woman: A Memoir,&quot; was published by Grand Central in the United States in April 2012. It entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list at No.6.

In May 2012, King announced her retirement from music. King herself doubted she would ever write another song and said that her 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour with James Taylor was probably the last tour of her life, saying that it &quot;was a good way to go out.&quot; King also said she will most likely not be writing or recording any new music. Later that month, she wrote on her Facebook page that she never said she was actually retiring and insisted that she was taking a break. Carole campaigned for Idahoan Nicole LeFavour and Barack Obama in 2012.

Early in December 2012, King received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2012 she was given the benefit concert &#x27;Painted Turtle – a celebration of Carole King&#x27;. King also did an Australian tour in February 2013. Following the Boston Marathon bombing, she performed in Boston with James Taylor to help victims of the bombing.

In late 2012, the Library of Congress announced that King had been named the 2013 recipient of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song—the first woman to receive the distinction given to songwriters for a body of work. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama hosted the award concert at the White House on May 22, 2013, with the President presenting the prize and reading the citation. In May 2013, Carole King received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. In June 2013, she campaigned in Massachusetts for US Representative Ed Markey, the Democratic nominee in a special election for the US Senate to succeed John Kerry who had resigned to become Secretary of State.

King was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in January 2014. 
On December 6, 2015, she was honored as a Kennedy Center Honoree.

In 2016, King was the headline performer at the British Summer Time Festival held in Hyde Park, London, on July 3, 2016, playing all of &quot;Tapestry&quot; live for the first time. An album of the concert was released in 2017.

In October 2018, King released a new version of her song, &quot;One&quot;. In her first new recording since 2011, she was inspired to re-write the lyrics to her song &quot;One&quot; (originally on her 1977 album &quot;Simple Things&quot;) as &quot;One (2018)&quot; to reflect her dream for America in the 2018 United States elections, as &quot;Love won&quot;.

===Acting roles===
King has appeared occasionally in acting roles. One of her earliest was in 1975 when she was the speaking and singing voice of the title character in &quot;Really Rosie&quot;, an animated TV special based on the works of Maurice Sendak. Also in 1975, she appeared (credited under her married name, Carole Larkey) on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in the episode &quot;Anyone Who Hates Kids and Dogs&quot;. In 1984, she starred alongside Tatum O&#x27;Neal, Hoyt Axton, Alex Karras, and John Lithgow in the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; episode &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;. She later made three appearances as guest star on the TV series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Sophie, the owner of the Stars Hollow music store. King&#x27;s song &quot;Where You Lead (I Will Follow)&quot; was also the theme song to the series, in a version sung with her daughter Louise. She reprised the role in the 2016 Gilmore Girls Netflix revival, &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;. King also appeared as Mrs. Johnstone as a replacement in the original Broadway production of &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;.

==Personal life and family==
King has been married four times: Gerry Goffin, Charles Larkey, Rick Evers, and Rick Sorenson. In her 2012 memoir, King wrote Evers physically abused her on a regular basis. Evers died of a cocaine overdose days after they separated in 1978.

Her children are musicians Louise Goffin and Sherry Goffin Kondor, artist Molly Larkey, and Levi Larkey.

, King lives in Idaho.

==Political and environmental activism==
After relocating to Idaho in 1977, King became involved in environmental issues. Since 1990, she has been working with the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other groups towards the passage of the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act (NREPA). King has testified on Capitol Hill three times on behalf of NREPA: in 1994, 2007, and again in 2009.

King is also a supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2003, she began campaigning for John Kerry, performing in private homes for caucus delegates during the Democratic primaries. On July 29, 2004, she made a short speech and sang at the Democratic National Convention about two hours before Kerry made his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination for president. King continued her support of Kerry throughout the general election. When Kerry was named Secretary of State in 2013, she campaigned with US Representative Ed Markey, the Democratic nominee to succeed Kerry in a special election.

In 2008, King appeared on the March 18 episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, touching on her politics again. She said she was supporting Hillary Clinton and said the choice had nothing to do with gender. She also said she would have no issues if Barack Obama won the election. Before the show&#x27;s conclusion, she returned to the stage to perform &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;.

On October 6, 2014, she performed at a Democratic fundraiser at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, attended by Vice President Joe Biden.

On January 21, 2017, King marched in the 2017 Women&#x27;s March in Stanley, Idaho, carrying a sign that said &quot;One Small Voice.&quot; In an op-ed for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, she wrote she carried that message because &quot;I&#x27;ve never stopped believing that one small voice plus millions of other small voices is exactly how we change the world.&quot;

King endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 US Presidential election.

==Legacy==

An all-star roster of artists paid tribute to King on the 1995 album &quot;Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King&quot;. From the album, Rod Stewart&#x27;s version of &quot;So Far Away&quot; and Celine Dion&#x27;s recording of &quot;A Natural Woman&quot; were both Adult Contemporary chart hits. Other artists who appeared on the album included Amy Grant (&quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;), Richard Marx (&quot;Beautiful&quot;), Aretha Franklin (&quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;), Faith Hill (&quot;Where You Lead&quot;), and the Bee Gees (&quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot;).

Former Monkee Micky Dolenz released &quot;King for a Day&quot;, a tribute album consisting of songs written or co-written by King, in 2010. The album includes &quot;Sometime in the Morning&quot;, a King-penned song originally recorded by the Monkees in 1967. Dolenz had previously recorded another of King&#x27;s Monkees compositions, &quot;Porpoise Song&quot;, on his lullaby-themed CD &quot;Micky Dolenz Puts You to Sleep.&quot;

Many other cover versions of King&#x27;s work have appeared over the years. Among the most notable are:
* &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; was a No. 1 hit for James Taylor in 1971 and a Top 40 hit for Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway that same year.
* Barbra Streisand had a top 40 hit in 1972 with &quot;Where You Lead&quot; twice—by itself and as part of a live medley with &quot;Sweet Inspiration&quot;.
* &quot;Locomotion&quot; was recorded by Grand Funk in 1974 and went to Number 1.
* Helen Reddy covered two Carole King penned tunes: the first was &quot;No Sad Song&quot; in 1971 (number 62); the second was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hear You No More&quot; in 1976, combined with &quot;Music Is My Life&quot; to reach number 29.
* The Carpenters recorded King&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Going to Take Some Time&quot; in 1972 and reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.
* Martika had a number 25 hit in 1989 with her version of &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;.
* &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; reappeared on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1995 by Gloria Estefan.

* Celine Dion recorded King&#x27;s song &quot;The Reason&quot; on her 1997 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; with Carole King singing backup. The remake was certified Diamond in France.
* &quot;Where You Lead&quot; (lyrics by Toni Stern), re-recorded to include King&#x27;s daughter, became the title song of the TV show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.
* The Crusaders had an instrumental hit with &quot;So Far Away&quot;, rising to number 39 in 1972 on the AC Chart.
* &quot;Locomotion&quot; was recorded by Kylie Minogue, having success and starting off a long career in the music industry.

===Film biography===

In 1996, a film very loosely based on King&#x27;s life, &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;, was written and directed by Allison Anders. In the film, an aspiring singer sacrifices her own singing career to write hit songs that launch the careers of other singers. Mirroring King&#x27;s life, the film follows her from her first break, through the pain of rejection from the recording industry and a bad marriage, to her final triumph in realizing her dream to record her own hit album.

The story includes material and characters loosely based on King&#x27;s songwriting colleagues, as well as the singers for whom they wrote their material, and various producers involved in the creative environment that existed at the Brill Building from 1958 to 1964 and in the California music scene from 1965 to 1971.

===Broadway musical biography===

A musical version of King&#x27;s life and career debuted in pre-Broadway tryouts in September 2013 in San Francisco, titled &quot;&quot;. It starred Jessie Mueller in the title role. Previews on Broadway began on November 21, 2013, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, with the official opening on January 12, 2014. The book is by Douglas McGrath. Reviews were mixed but generally warm. Jessie Mueller won the Tony Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical for her portrayal of King, and Brian Ronan won the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Musical.
The show ran for 6 years and 2418 performances on Broadway.

<doc id="149113" wikidata="Q1427730" url="?curid=149113" title="Wayne's World 2">
<text>Wayne&#x27;s World 2 is a 1993 American comedy film directed by Stephen Surjik and starring Mike Myers and Dana Carvey as hosts of a public-access television cable television show in Aurora, Illinois. The film is the sequel to &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992), which was itself adapted from a sketch on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Plot==
Rock and roll fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their public-access television show, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, from an abandoned doll factory and Wayne&#x27;s new home in Aurora, Illinois. Wayne, Garth and two of their co-workers attend an Aerosmith concert, with Wayne and Garth having backstage passes. They meet up with Wayne&#x27;s girlfriend Cassandra (lead singer and bassist of the band Crucial Taunt) and are introduced to her new producer, Bobby Cahn. The duo is then denied further access backstage in spite of having passes. That night, Wayne has a dream in which he meets Jim Morrison and a &quot;weird naked Indian&quot; in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert &quot;Waynestock&quot; (a pun on &quot;Woodstock&quot;) and hire a former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands (Aerosmith, Pearl Jam, and Van Halen are mentioned off the cuff by Wayne) and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.

Bobby tries to pull Cassandra away from Illinois, and Wayne, and have her move to Los Angeles. Wayne becomes suspicious of Bobby&#x27;s ulterior motives and spies on them while they are having lunch. Wayne is spotted by them and flees with Garth and their friends while Bobby gives chase. Wayne and company are able to evade Bobby after performing an impromptu performance of &quot;Y.M.C.A&quot; in a gay club. After Wayne later admits spying on her, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Wayne becomes more determined to make Waynestock a success to get Cassandra back. In the meantime, Garth meets a beautiful woman named Honey Hornée. Later, Hornée attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.

Tickets are sold for Waynestock, but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra&#x27;s wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a parody of finale of &quot;The Graduate&quot;. Meanwhile, Garth has stage fright during the concert and the crowd grows impatient. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.

In another desert dream, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come, and that all that matters is they tried. Unable to return to Waynestock, they become lost in the desert and begin to die of thirst. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;, driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth admit that they just have to end the film with a standard happy ending in which the bands arrive, and Waynestock is a success. Morrison tells Wayne that he needed to organize Waynestock to learn that Cassandra loves him for who he is; and also that adulthood requires one to take responsibility while being able to find fun in life. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to pursue Cassandra, but is prevented from entering.

In a mid-credits scene, the entire park is covered with trash after the concert. The &quot;weird naked Indian&quot; begins to cry, but he cheers up when Wayne and Garth promise to clean up.

==Production==
Penelope Spheeris, who directed the first film, believes that Myers encouraged the studio not to have her back for the sequel due to personality conflicts with Myers during the making of the first film. She went on to direct another TV to big screen adaptation, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, instead and was replaced by Stephen Surjik for the sequel.

Myers&#x27; original script for &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; had Wayne and Garth forming their own country and seceding from the US after finding an ancient scroll, in a story taken from the 1949 British comedy &quot;Passport to Pimlico.&quot; This version was well into pre-production before it came to light that the studio had no idea the script was based on a previous film and thus had not obtained the rights to &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;. Production was immediately halted—director Surjik said: &quot;I could hear the chainsaws literally chopping the sets down.&quot; Studio executive Sherry Lansing was reportedly furious with Myers and threatened to ruin his life and career if he did not immediately produce a new script.

The character of Del Preston, played by Ralph Brown, is an extension of his Danny character from the cult film &quot;Withnail and I&quot;. The character was a late addition to the script, and came about after Dana Carvey saw a repertory screening of &quot;Withnail and I&quot; in Los Angeles. Due to the age discrepancy between the two characters, they landed on Del being a &quot;spiritual reprisal&quot; of Danny, rather than a direct representation of the same character.

Kim Basinger did three days&#x27; worth of work on &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;. When discussing being approached to do the project, Basinger said &quot;I never saw &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; so I didn&#x27;t know what it was about. But Dana Carvey just clean-called me and he was very sweet and sincere. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re really going to have fun, please do this with me.&quot; At first I said no, but he kept calling. It was just a blast. Dana&#x27;s wonderful. It was a little gift to be given in the middle of the year.&quot;

Basinger noted that when Carvey approached her with the part, he refused to take no for an answer. When she showed the script to her then husband, Alec Baldwin, he loved it and told her that she must be in the film. According to her, the echo effect clinched her decision to take part in the movie.

She said when describing her character, &quot;I&#x27;m this little character that they call Honey Hornée. ... I don&#x27;t want to give away the whole plot, but I want to say that it&#x27;s Garth&#x27;s first screen kiss. Oh, and it&#x27;s wonderful and (Dana Carvey) wrote it. He was magic for three days.&quot; And when asked whose hair was longer, hers or Garth&#x27;s, Basinger said with a laugh, &quot;You know, It was so funny, we sorta looked like each other. We&#x27;re like Harold and Maude; we&#x27;re kinda this odd couple. But it works. You&#x27;d just love to follow these two people around the grocery store and see what they buy and wonder what they&#x27;re gonna do with it. That&#x27;s the kind of characters these two are.&quot;

Basinger also said about working with Dana Carvey, &quot;I honestly thought I was going to get fired because I could not keep a straight face. I never really looked into his eyes. I could never do it. I would focus on a piece of his hair and say&quot; Be really cool Kim&quot;. And them when he started to kiss me, I just came apart.&quot; Dana Carvey joked that making out with Kim Basinger was just awful. He added that he felt very bad for her because &quot;kissing Garth is like kissing a moving truck. The guy is so nervous, he&#x27;s always weaving around&quot;.

The entire subplot of Garth finding himself in the clutches of a potentially dangerous femme fatale has drawn comparisons to the 1944 film &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. In that film, MacMurray plays an insurance salesman while Stanwyck plays a provocative housewife who wishes her husband were dead.

The laundromat where Garth first meets Honey Hornée was located at 6803 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles and Honey&#x27;s apartment building was located at 5023 Maytime Lane in Culver City, California. When Garth is floating in the air kissing Honey in said apartment, a black wire that&#x27;s holding Dana Carvey against the background of the white lampshade is visible.

==Reception==
&quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 60% approval rating, based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; are more hit-and-miss the second time around&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote that Wayne and Garth are &quot;impossible to dislike&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; earned $13.5 million during its opening weekend. Although it was intended to be a Christmas season blockbuster, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; did not receive the box office intake nor positive fan reaction that the first film did. It grossed $48 million in the United States and Canada and $24 million internationally for a worldwide total of $72 million, much less than the original film&#x27;s gross of over $180 million. &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; also suffered from competition from other holiday season blockbusters such as &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, and &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Beginning in 2006, DirecTV began a series of commercials in which characters from popular movies and television shows break the fourth wall to tout the service&#x27;s picture quality and the number of channels available in high definition. Instead of using CGI the original actors normally reprise their roles on recreated sets, and resulting footage is mixed with the original scenes. One such ad featured Kim Basinger reprising her role as Honey Hornée from &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;.

<doc id="149115" wikidata="Q316859" url="?curid=149115" title="Ferdinand IV of Castile">
<text>Ferdinand IV of Castile (6 December 1285 – 7 September 1312) called the Summoned (&quot;el Emplazado&quot;), was King of Castile and León from 1295 until his death.

Ferdinand&#x27;s upbringing and personal custody was entered to his mother Queen María de Molina, however, he was tutored by his granduncle Henry of Castile the Senator. Queen María attempted to placate the nobility, confronted her son&#x27;s enemies, and repeated prevented her son from being dethroned. He faced the insubordination of the nobility, led at numerous times by his uncle John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos, and by Juan Núñez II de Lara, who were sometimes supported by another royal relative, Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena.

Like his predecessors on the throne, Ferdinand IV continued the Reconquista and, although he failed to conquer Algeciras in 1309, he captured the city of Gibraltar that same year. In 1312 the city of Alcaudete was also conquered. During the Cortes of Valladolid of 1312, he promoted the reform of the administration of justice, among other areas of administration. He attempted to strengthen the royal authority to the detriment of the nobility. He died in Jaén on 7 September 1312 aged 26, and his mortal remains are now in the Royal Collegiate Church of Saint Hippolytus.

==Infancy (1285–1295)==

Ferdinand was born in the city of Alcazar de San Juan on 6 December 1285 as the second child and eldest son of King Sancho IV of Castile and his wife María de Molina. He was baptized at Seville Cathedral by Archbishop Raimundo de Losana and was immediately proclaimed heir to the Crown and received the homage of the nobles of the kingdom.

King Sancho IV entrusted to Fernán Pérez Ponce de León the raising of his newborn son, since he had been first &quot;majordomo&quot; of King Alfonso X. The prince and his tutor left for the city of Zamora, where the family of Fernán Pérez resided. Likewise the King appointed Isidro González and Alfonso Godínez as Chancellors of the prince, while appointing Samuel de Belorado &quot;almojarife&quot; (Treasurer) of the prince. Fernán Pérez Ponce de León and his wife, Urraca Gutiérrez de Meneses, had a significant influence on Ferdinand&#x27;s character, and he would show them, as a King, a profound gratitude.

Already in his infancy the question of his marriage was raised, being the desire of Sancho IV to choose a princess from Kingdoms of France or Portugal. In the agreement signed by Sancho IV and King Denis of Portugal in September 1291, it was established the betrothal between Ferdinand and the &quot;Infanta&quot; Constance, daughter of the Portuguese sovereign. Nevertheless, in spite of the commitment contracted with the Portuguese monarch, in 1294, Sancho IV thought about the possibility of marrying his son with Margaret or Blanche, daughters of King Philip IV of France. The death of Sancho IV a year later put an end to the negotiations with the French court.

==Under regency (1295–1301)==
King Sancho IV of Castile died in the city of Toledo on 25 April 1295, leaving his eldest son Ferdinand as heir of the throne. After the burial of the sovereign at Toledo Cathedral, his widow María de Molina retired to the Alcázar of Toledo for a mourning of nine days. The now Dowager Queen was in charge of the regency of her 9-year-old son. Because the marriage between Sancho IV and María de Molina was without validity, all their children (including the now Ferdinand IV) were illegitimate, so the Dowager Queen had to face numerous problems to keep her son on the throne.

To the incessant struggles with the Castilian nobility, led by the &quot;Infante&quot; John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos (who claimed the throne of his brother Sancho IV) and by the &quot;Infante&quot; Henry of Castile the Senator, son of Ferdinand III and great-uncle of Ferdinand IV (who demanded the guardianship of the king) were joined the claims of the &quot;Infantes de la Cerda&quot; (Alfonso and Ferdinand, sons of the deceased first-born son of Alfonso X, Ferdinand de la Cerda), who were supported by France and Aragon and by their grandmother Dowager Queen Violante of Aragon, widow of Alfonso X. To this were added the problems with Aragon, Portugal and France, who tried to take advantage of the political instability that suffered the Kingdom of Castile in their own benefit. At the same time, Diego López V de Haro, Lord of Biscay, Nuño González de Lara, and Juan Núñez II de Lara, among many others nobles, sowed confusion and anarchy in the kingdom.

In the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Valladolid in 1295, Henry of Castile the Senator was appointed guardian of the King, but the Dowager Queen María de Molina got (thanks to the support of the cities with votes in the Cortes) that the custody of her son was entrusted to her. While celebrating the Cortes of Valladolid, John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos, left the city of Granada and tried to occupy the city of Badajoz, but, when failing in this attempt, he seized Coria and the castle of Alcántara. He later passed to the Kingdom of Portugal, where he pressed King Denis of Portugal to declare war to Castile and, at the same time, to support his claims to the Castilian throne.

In the summer of 1295, when the Cortes of Valladolid were finished, the Dowager Queen and Henry of Castile met in Ciudad Rodrigo with King Denis of Portugal, to whom they delivered several localities located near the Portuguese border. In the meeting of Ciudad Rodrigo the betrothal between Ferdinand IV and Constance of Portugal (daughter of King Denis) was renewed, and in addition &quot;Infanta&quot; Beatrice of Castile, younger sister of Fernando IV, would marry Afonso, heir to the Portuguese throne. At the same time, Diego López V de Haro was confirmed the possession of the Lordship of Biscay, and John of Castile, who recognized (but only privately) Ferdinand IV as his sovereign, was momentarily restored his property. Shortly after, King James II of Aragon returned the &quot;Infanta&quot; Isabella of Castile to the Castilian court without having married her, and declared the war to the Kingdom of Castile.

At the beginning of 1296, John of Castile rebelled against Ferdinand IV and took Astudillo, Paredes de Nava and Dueñas, while his son Alfonso of Valencia seized Mansilla. In April 1296 Alfonso de la Cerda invaded the Kingdom of Castile accompanied by Aragonese troops, and went to the city of León, where John of Castile was proclaimed King of León, Seville and Galicia. Immediately afterwards, John of Castile accompanied Alfonso de la Cerda to Sahagún, where he was proclaimed King of Castile, Toledo, Córdoba, Murcia and Jaén. Shortly after being crowned Alfonso de la Cerda and John of Castile, both surrounded the Valladolid municipality of Mayorga, while Henry of Castile parted to the Kingdom of Granada to arrange the peace between the Sultan Muhammed II al-Faqih and Ferdinand IV, since the Granadian troops attacked in those moments in all Andalusia the lands of the King, that were defended, among others, by Alonso Pérez de Guzmán. On 25 August 1296, the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Aragon died victim of the plague while he was under the command of the Aragonese army that surrounded the city of Mayorga, losing with him John of Castile one of his main supporters. Due to the mortality that extended between the besiegers of Mayorga, their commanders were forced to raise the siege.

While John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara waited for the arrival of the King of Portugal with his troops to join them in the siege of the city of Valladolid, where the Dowager Queen María de Molina and Ferdinand IV took refuge, the Aragonese monarch attacked Murcia and Soria, and King Denis of Portugal attacked along the line of Douro river, while Diego López V de Haro sowed disorder in his Lordship of Biscay.

When Henry of Castile, who was conferring with the Sultan of Granada, learned that the Aragonese and the Portuguese had left the Kingdom of Castile, and that the Dowager Queen was besieging Paredes de Nava, he decided to return to Castile, fearing that he would be deprived from his position of guardian of Ferdinand IV. However, under pressure from Alonso Pérez de Guzmán and other knights he attacked the Granadians, who at that time had again attacked the Castilians. Four leagues from Arjona, a battle was fought with the Granadians, in which Henry of Castile would have lost his life if Alonso Pérez de Guzmán had not saved him. For the Castilians the defeat was complete, and their camp was looted. After his return to Castile, Henry of Castile persuaded some knights to leave the siege of Paredes de Nava, despite the opposition of the Dowager Queen, that returned to Valladolid in January 1297 without having taken that.

During the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Cuellar of 1297, summoned by the Dowager Queen María de Molina, Henry of Castile wanted that the city of Tarifa would be returned to the Sultan of Granada, but he was unable to achieve his objective due to the opposition of María de Molina. In these &quot;Cortes&quot; Henry of Castile managed to obtain for his nephew Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena the Castle of Alarcón in compensation for having lose the town of Elche after being conquered by the Aragonese, despite the opposition of the Dowager Queen, who didn&#x27;t want to established such precedents between Castilian nobles and magnates. Shortly before the signing of the Treaty of Alcañices, Juan Núñez II de Lara, who supported Alfonso de la Cerda and John of Castile, was besieged in Ampudia, although he managed to escaped from the siege.

==The Treaty of Alcañices (1297)==

In 1296 the Dowager Queen María de Molina had threatened the Portuguese monarch with breaking the agreements of the previous year if his attacks on the Castilian territory persisted, before which King Denis of Portugal agreed to return with his troops to his domains.

Through the Treaty of Alcañices were fixed, among other points, the borders between Castile and Portugal, which received a series of fortresses and towns in exchange for breaking their agreements with James II of Aragon, Alfonso de la Cerda, John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara.

At the same time, in the Treaty of Alcañices the projected marriage between Ferdinand IV and the &quot;Infanta&quot; Constance of Portugal was confirmed as well as the betrothal of Afonso of Portugal, heir to the throne of Portugal, and &quot;Infanta&quot; Beatrice, sister of Ferdinand IV. On the other hand, the Portuguese monarch brought an army of 300 knights, placed under the orders of João Afonso de Albuquerque, to help María de Molina in her fight against John of Castile who until that moment had received the support of the King Denis of Portugal.

In addition, it was stipulated in the treaty that the towns and localities of Campo Maior, Olivenza, Ouguela and San Felices de los Gallegos would be surrendered to Denis de Portugal as compensation for the loss by Portugal during the reign of Afonso III for a series of towns that were taken from him by Alfonso X of Castile. In addition, the Portuguese king also received the towns of Almeida, Castelo Bom, Castelo Melhor, Castelo Rodrigo, Monforte, Sabugal, Sastres and Vilar Maior. The Castilian and Portuguese monarchs renounced their future mutual territorial claims and the prelates of the two kingdoms agreed on 13 September 1297 to support each other and defend themselves against the possible pretensions of other estates to deprive them of freedoms or privileges. The treaty was ratified not only by the two monarchs of both kingdoms, but also by several representatives of the nobiliary and ecclesiastical arms of both kingdoms, as well as by the Brotherhood of the councils of Castile and by its equivalent of the Kingdom of León. In the long term, the consequences of this treaty were long lasting, since the border between the two kingdoms was hardly modified in the course of the later centuries, becoming one of the longest frontiers of the European continent.

On the other hand, the Treaty of Alcañices contributed to secure the position of Ferdinand IV in the Castilian throne, who was insecure because of internal and external discords, and allowed Dowager Queen María de Molina to extend her freedom of movement in the absence of disputes with the Portuguese sovereign, who had come to support it in her fight against John of Castile, who, at that moment, was still controlling the territory of León.

==Last stage of minority (1297–1301)==
At the end of 1297, the Dowager Queen sent Alonso Pérez de Guzmán to the Kingdom of León to fight against John of Castile, who continued to control the territory. At the beginning of 1298, Alfonso de la Cerda and John of Castile, supported by Juan Núñez II de Lara, began to mint fake coin, since it contained less metal than it corresponded, with the purpose of destabilizing the economy of the Kingdoms of Castile and León. In 1298, the city of Sigüenza fell to Juan Núñez II de Lara, but it had to be evacuated shortly afterwards by the resistance of the defenders; however soon afterwards he conquered Almazán (who became the stronghold of Alfonso de la Cerda) and Deza, being also returned to Juan Núñez II de Lara the city of Albarracín by King James II of Aragon. In the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Valladolid in 1298, Henry of Castile again advised the sale of the city of Tarifa to the Muslims, but this was opposed by the Dowager Queen.

The Dowager Queen met in 1298 with the King of Portugal in Toro, and requested that he help her in the fight against John of Castile. However, the Portuguese sovereign refused to attack him and, in common agreement with Henry of Castile, both planned that Ferdinand IV reached a peace agreement with John of Castile, under which the latter kept the Kingdom of Galicia, the city of León, and all the towns that he had conquered only during his lifetime, and at his death, all those territories would pass to Ferdinand IV. Nevertheless, the Dowager Queen, who opposed the project of surrender these territories to John of Castile, bribed Henry of Castile by giving him the cities of Écija, Roa and Medellin so that the project didn&#x27;t continue, while at the same time she managed to obtain from the representatives of the councils the public rejection of the project for the Portuguese sovereign.

After the meeting with the Portuguese monarch in 1298, the Dowager Queen sent to her son, the 7-years-old &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile to the Kingdom of Galicia, with the purpose to reinforce the royal authority in that zone, where João Afonso de Albuquerque and Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria, planted the disorder. In April 1299, after the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Valladolid of that year, the Dowager Queen recovered the castles of Monzón and Becerril de Campos, which were in the possession of the supporters of Alfonso de la Cerda. In 1299 Juan Alfonso de Haro, Lord of Cameros, captured Juan Núñez II de Lara, partisan of Alfonso de la Cerda. Meanwhile, the Dowager Queen send troops to rescue Lorca, besieged by the King of Aragon, while in August of the same year, the troops of the Castilian king surrounded Palenzuela. Juan Núñez II de Lara was released in 1299 on condition that his sister Juana Núñez de Lara married Henry of Castile, to pay tribute to Ferdinand IV and swear not to revolt against him, and return to the Crown the cities of Osma, Palenzuela, Amaya, Dueñas (which was granted to Henry of Castile), Ampudia, Tordehumos (which was given to Diego López V de Haro), La Mota, and Lerma.

In March 1300, the Dowager Queen met again with King Denis of Portugal in Ciudad Rodrigo, where the Portuguese sovereign requested funds to pay the cost of the matrimonial dispensations that the Pope should grant, so that the marriages between Fernando IV and Constance of Portugal, and Beatrice of Castile with Afonso of Portugal could be carried out. In the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Valladolid in 1300 the Dowager Queen imposed her will and managed to obtain the necessary amount of money which could persuade Pope Boniface VIII to grant the dispensation that legitimized the marriage of the late Sancho IV of Castile with María de Molina.

During the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Valladolid of 1300 John of Castile renounced to his pretensions to the throne, notwithstanding to have been proclaimed King of León in 1296, and made public his oath of fidelity to Fernando IV and his successors on 26 June 1300. In return for his resignation to the possession of the Lordship of Biscay, whose possession was confirmed to Diego López V de Haro, John of Castile and his wife María I Díaz de Haro (niece of Diego López V de Haro and legitimate heiress of Biscay) received the cities of Mansilla, Paredes de Nava, Medina de Rioseco, Castronuño and Cabreros. Shortly after, the Dowager and Henry and John of Castile, accompanied by Diego López V de Haro, besieged the town of Almazán, but they left the siege due to the opposition of Henry of Castile.

In 1301 King James II of Aragon besieged the town of Lorca, who belonged to Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, who surrender it to the Aragonese monarch, and at the same time the Dowager Queen, with the purpose of amortizing the disbursement made to provide an army with which to release the city of the Aragonese siege, ordered the siege of the castles of Alcalá and Mula, and immediately after besieged the city of Murcia, where James II was; the Aragonese monarch was close to be by the Castilian troops, but he was warned by Henry and John of Castile, who were afraid of a complete defeat of James II, because both wanted to maintain good relations with him.

In the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Burgos of 1301 were approved the subsidies demanded by the Crown to finance the war against the Kingdoms of Aragon and Granada and against Alfonso de la Cerda, while were granted subsidies to obtain the legitimation of marriage of the Dowager Queen with Sancho IV; for this purpose, were sent 10,000 silver marks to the Pope, despite the famine that ravaged the Kingdoms of Castile and León.

In June 1301, during the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Zamora, John of Castile and the &quot;ricoshombres&quot; of Léon, Galicia and Asturias, supporters mostly of the John, approved the subsidies demanded by the Crown.

==Personal rule (1301–1312)==

In November 1301, when the court was in the city of Burgos, was made public the bull by which Pope Boniface VIII legitimized the marriage of María de Molina with the late King Sancho IV, and therefore her children were legitimate from that moment. At the same time, Ferdinand IV attained his legal majority, who was officially declared on 6 December 1301. With this, John of Castile and the &quot;Infantes de la Cerda&quot; lost one of their main arguments when reclaiming the throne, not being able to use the illegitimacy of the Castilian monarch. In addition was also received the papal dispensation for the marriage of Fernando IV with Constance of Portugal.

Henry of Castile, annoyed by the legitimation of Ferdinand IV by Pope Boniface VIII, allied himself with Juan Núñez II de Lara, in order to indispose and antagonize Ferdinand IV with his mother the Dowager Queen. Both were joined by John of Castile, who continued to claim the Lordship of Biscay on behalf of his wife, María I Díaz de Haro.

In 1301, while the Dowager Queen was in Vitoria with Henry of Castile answering the complaints presented by the Kingdom of Navarre in relation to the Castilian attacks to their lands, John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara indisposed the King with his mother and sought his amusement in the lands of León by means of hunting, to which Ferdinand IV showed his predilection since childhood. With the Dowager Queen in Vitoria, the Aragonese nobles revolted against their monarch offered their support to obtain from James II the return to Castile of the towns from which he had taken over in the Kingdom of Murcia. That same year Henry of Castile, allied with Diego López V de Haro, demanded to Ferdinand IV, in compensation to leave his position of royal guardian (and after having previously blackmailed the Dowager Queen with declaring the war to his son if they didn&#x27;t accede to his request), the possession of the towns of Atienza and San Esteban de Gormaz, which were granted by the King.

On 23 January 1302 Ferdinand IV married in Valladolid with Constance, daughter of King Denis of Portugal. In the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Medina del Campo of May 1302, Henry and John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara tried to indispose the King with his mother, accusing her of having given away the jewels given to her by Sancho IV, and later, when the accusation was proved to be false, they accused her of having appropriated the subsidies granted to the Crown in the &quot;Cortes&quot; of previous years, an accusation that was also proved false when Nuño, Abbot of Santander and Chancellor of the Dowager Queen, reviewed and made public the accounts of María de Molina, who not only had not appropriated the Crown&#x27;s funds but contributed with her own income to the support of the monarchy. While celebrating the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Medina del Campo in 1302, which was attended by a representation of the King of Castile, Sultan Muhammed II al-Faqih of Granada died and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad III, who attacked the Kingdoms of Castilla y León and conquered the municipality of Bedmar.

In July 1302 Ferdinand IV went to the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Burgos along with his mother, with whom he had restored good relations, and with Henry of Castile. The King, although under the influence of his private Samuel de Belorado, of Jewish origin —who tried to indispose the King from his mother— had decided to dispense from the presence of the John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara in the &quot;Cortes&quot;. At the end of the &quot;Cortes&quot;, Ferdinand IV went to the city of Palencia, where was celebrated the marriage of Alfonso of Valencia (son of John of Castile) with Teresa Núñez de Lara (sister of Juan Núñez II de Lara).

At that time was accentuated the rivalry existed between Henry of Castile, María de Molina and Diego López V de Haro on one side, and John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara on the other side. Henry of Castile threatened the Dowager Queen with declaring the war to Ferdinand IV and herself if his demands were accepted, while the magnates sought to eliminate the influence that María de Molina exerted on her son, of whom the people began to distrust, because of the influence of the &quot;ricoshombres&quot; had over him. In the final months of 1302, the Dowager Queen, who was in Valladolid, was forced to appease the &quot;ricoshombres&quot; and members of the nobility, who planned to rise up in arms against Ferdinand IV, who spent the Christmas of 1302 in lands of the Kingdom of León, accompanied by the John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara.

At the beginning of 1303 there was a planned meeting between King Denis of Portugal and Ferdinand IV, where the Castilian monarch hoped that his cousin and father-in-law the Portuguese monarch would return to him some territory. For his part, Henry of Castile, Diego López V de Haro and the Dowager Queen presented their excuses for not attending the meeting. María de Molina&#x27;s purpose in refusing to attend was to watch over Henry of Castile and the Lord of Biscay, whose relations with Ferdinand IV were strained because of the friendship showed by the monarch to John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara. In May 1303 the meeting between Denis of Portugal and Ferdinand IV took place in the city of Badajoz. The infant John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara predisposed Fernando IV against Henry of Castile and Diego López V de Haro, while the concessions offered by the Portuguese sovereign, who offered to help him if necessary against Henry of Castile, disappointed Ferdinand IV.

==Meeting of Ariza and death of Henry of Castile (1303)==
In 1303, while the King was in Badajoz, Henry of Castile, Diego López V de Haro and Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena had a meeting in Roa, and they agreed that Juan Manuel would have a meeting with the King of Aragon, who agreed that the three magnates and himself should meet the Day of John the Baptist in the municipality of Ariza. Later, Henry of Castile communicated his plans to María de Molina, who was in Valladolid, with the purpose of that she was united to them. The plan of Henry of Castile consisted in that Alfonso de la Cerda became King of León and married with the &quot;Infanta&quot; Isabel (sister of Ferdinand IV and repudiated child-bride of the Aragonese monarch), while the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Castile (brother of Fernando IV) would be proclaimed King of Castile and would marry with a daughter of James II of Aragon. Henry of Castile stated that his intention was to achieve peace in the Kingdom and to eliminate the influence of the John of Castile and Juan Núñez II de Lara.

This plan, which would have meant the disintegration of the Kingdom of Castile and León, as well as the forced resignation of Ferdinand IV to the throne, was rejected by the Dowager Queen, who refused to support the project and to participate in the Meeting of Ariza. In the meanwhile, Ferdinand IV begged his mother to put peace between him and the magnates who supported Henry of Castile, who again begged the Dowager Queen to support the Henry&#x27;s plan, to which she refused. While still celebrating the Meeting of Ariza, the Dowager Queen reminded Henry of Castile and his companions of the loyalty they owed to her son, as well as the properties with which she had endowed them, thereby enabling some knights to leave Ariza without seconding Henry&#x27;s plan. However, Henry of Castile, Juan Manuel of Villena and other knights were committed to make the war to Ferdinand IV, as well as to that the Kingdom of Murcia should be returned to Aragon and the Kingdom of Jaén given to Alfonso de la Cerda. However, while the Dowager Queen met the Councils and obstructed the intentions of Henry of Castile, he became seriously ill and had to be transferred to his village of Roa. Faced with Henry&#x27;s illness, the Dowager Queen, fearing that his lordships and castles would be inherited by Juan Manuel of Villena and Lope Díaz de Haro (to those he planned to bequeath his possessions to his death), she persuaded Henry&#x27;s confessor, as well as his companions, to convince him to return his properties to the Crown, to which Henry refused, since he didn&#x27;t wish that his inheritance could be taken by Ferdinand IV.

When Juan Manuel of Villena, nephew of Henry of Castile, arrived at Roa, he found him speechless, and taking him for dead, he took possession of all the valuable objects that were there, as referred to in the &quot;Chronicle of Ferdinand IV&quot;:

The Dowager Queen then sent orders to all the fortresses of the dying Henry, in which it was arranged that if he died, they would not surrender the castles but to the King&#x27;s troops, to which they belonged. Henry of Castile died on 8 August 1303 and was buried in the disappeared Monastery of San Francisco of Valladolid. His vassals gave little evidence of mourning for him, and when the Dowager Queen learned of it, she ordered that a brocade cloth be placed on the coffin, and that all the clerics and nobles present in Valladolid should attend the funerals.

While Henry of Castile was agonizing, Ferdinand IV made a pact with Sultan Muhammed III of Granada, which stipulated that the sovereign of Granada would keep Alcaudete, Quesada and Bedmar, while Ferdinand IV would keep the city of Tarifa. Muhammed III declared himself vassal of Ferdinand IV and promised to pay him the corresponding &quot;parias&quot;. On learning that Henry of Castile had died, Ferdinand IV was pleased and granted most of his land to Juan Núñez II de Lara, who also received the position of &quot;Adelantado mayor&quot; of the Andalusian border, while returning Écija to María de Molina, for having been hers before she gave it to Henry of Castile. In November 1303 the King was in Valladolid with his mother, and requested her advice, since he wished to put an end to the dispute between John of Castile and Diego López V de Haro for the possession of the Lordship of Biscay. The Dowager Queen told him that she would help him to resolve the matter, while the King made important donations to her, for the good relations between Ferdinand IV and his mother had been fully restored.

In January 1304, when the King was in Carrión de los Condes, John of Castile claimed again, in the name of his wife, and supported by Juan Núñez II de Lara, the Lordship of Biscay, although the monarch at first resolved that John of Castile&#x27;s wife be satisfied with receiving Paredes de Nava and Villalón de Campos as compensation, to which John of Castile refused, arguing that his wife would not accept this for disagreeing with the previous pacts established by her husband in relation to The Lordship of Biscay. In view of the situation, the King proposed that Diego López V de Haro surrender to María I Díaz de Haro, in exchange for the Lordship of Biscay, the cities of Tordehumos, Íscar, Santa Olalla, as well as his possessions in Cuéllar, Córdoba, Murcia, Valdetorio, and the Lordship of Valdecorneja. For his part, Diego López V de Haro would retain the Lordship of Biscay, Orduña, Valmaseda, Las Encartaciones, and Durango. John of Castile accepted the offer of the King, who called Diego López V de Haro to Carrión de los Condes. Nevertheless, the Lord of Biscay didn&#x27;t accept the proposal of the sovereign and threatened him with the rebellion before leaving. The King then made his mother reconcile with Juan Núñez II de Lara, while were initiated the maneuvers for the Treaty of Torrellas, signed in 1304, in which Diego López V de Haro didn&#x27;t take part because he was distanced from Ferdinand IV, who promised to John of Castile to give him the Lordship of Biscay, and to Juan Núñez II de Lara La Bureba and the possessions of Diego López V de Haro in La Rioja, if both resolved the diplomatic negotiations with Aragon following the desire of the monarch.

In April 1304, John of Castile began negotiations with the Kingdom of Aragon, pledging Fernando IV to accept the decisions to be made by the mediators of the Kingdoms of Portugal and Aragon, who would meet in the following months, regarding the demands of Alfonso de la Cerda and respect to his disputes with the King of Aragon. At the same time, the King confiscated the lands of Diego López V de Haro and Juan Alfonso de Haro, Lord of Cameros, and divided them among the &quot;ricoshombres&quot;. In spite of this, both magnates didn&#x27;t rebel against the King.

In the meanwhile, in Galicia, the &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile, brother of Fernando IV, defeated in a battle his brother-in-law Fernando Rodríguez de Castro (husband of Violante Sánchez, illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV of Castile) who lost his life in that battle.

==Treaty of Torrellas (1304)==

One of the most important events of the reign of Ferdinand IV once reached his majority, was the agreement of borders established with James II of Aragon in 1304, and known in history as the Treaty of Torrellas —called a &quot;sentencia arbitral&quot;, &quot;sentence by arbitration,&quot; in Castilian—. With the agreement also tried to put an end to the claims of Alfonso de la Cerda, pretender to the Castilian-Leonese throne.

On 8 August 1304, in the town of Torrellas, King Denis of Portugal, the Archbishop of Zaragoza, Jimeno de Luna (who represented the Kingdom of Aragon) and John of Castile (who represented the Kingdom of Castile), made public the clauses of the Treaty of Torrellas. The purpose of the negotiation was to put an end to the existing disputes between the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon with respect to the possession of the Kingdom of Murcia. Sultan Muhammed III of Granada participated in the conversations at the request of Ferdinand IV, who ordered that the Granadian ruler intervene in the Treaty and alliance between the Christian Kingdoms of the peninsula, since he had an interest in preserving the friendship, submission and &quot;parias&quot; which every year Granada was obliged to pay to the King of Castile, and which constituted a precious resource. Therefore, James II of Aragon and the Denis of Portugal both agreed to maintain good relations with the Sultan of Granada.

According to the terms of the Treaty, the Kingdom of Murcia, then in the hands of James II of Aragon, would be divided between the Kingdoms of Aragon and Castile, and along the Segura river would be established the southern border of Aragon. The cities of Alicante, Elche, Orihuela, Novelda, Elda, Abanilla, Petrel, Crevillente and Sax, would continue in the hands of the Aragonese monarch. In the Treaty was also recognized the possession by the Kingdom of Castile of the cities of Murcia, Monteagudo, Alhama, Lorca and Molina de Segura. Citizens affected by the change of sovereignty would be free to stay in their cities and towns if they wished, or they could freely leave the territory. At the same time, both Kingdoms agreed to grant freedom to prisoners of war, as well as to be enemies of their common rivals, excepting the Holy See and the Kingdom of France. The Seigneury of Villena continued in the hands of Prince Juan Manuel, but the lands in which it was settled would remain under Aragonese sovereignty.

On 8 August 1304, the Kings of Portugal and Aragon pronounced, in the presence of John of Castile, about the claims of the &quot;Infantes de la Cerda&quot;. Alfonso de la Cerda, supported by James II of Aragon, was granted as compensation for his resignation to the throne of Castile several lordships and possessions (although dispersed throughout the Castilian-Leonese territory in order to avoid the formation of a microstate), who included Alba de Tormes, Valdecorneja, Gibraleón, Béjar and Real de Manzanares, in addition to the castle of Monzón de Campos, Gatón de Campos, La Algaba, and Lemos. In addition, Alfonso de la Cerda received numerous rents and possessions in Medina del Campo, Córdoba, Toledo, Bonilla and Madrid. Ferdinand IV, who wished that his cousin Alfonso de la Cerda enjoyed an annual income of 400,000 &quot;maravedíes&quot;, ordered that if the income of the possessions that had been granted to him didn&#x27;t reach that amount he would give him other territories until the incomes reached the expected amount. At the same time it was arranged that, as a proof that the Castilian monarch would gave these lands to Alfonso de la Cerda, the castles of Alfaro, Cervera, Curiel de los Ajos and Gumiel would be granted to four &quot;ricoshombres&quot; for thirty years.

For his part, Alfonso de la Cerda renounced his rights to the Castilian-Leonese throne, to use the royal titles, and to use the royal seal. At the same time, he promise to return to the King the cities of Almazan, Soria, Deza, Serón, Alcalá, and Almenara. However, he soon used the royal symbols again, contrary to what was agreed in Torrellas. The question of the rights to the throne of Alfonso de la Cerda was finally settled during the reign of the son and successor of Ferdinand IV, Alfonso XI, when in 1331 at Burguillos, Alfonso de la Cerda finally paid homage to the King of Castile and León.

Ferdinand IV promised that the clauses of the Treaty of Torrellas should be sworn in and honored by the &quot;ricoshombres&quot;, magnates, the Masters of the Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, Templars and Hospitallers, and by the councils of his Kingdoms. In the winter of 1305, during the visit of Ferdinand IV in the city of Guadalajara, the monarch received the homage of his cousin Ferdinand de la Cerda, who acted on behalf of his older brother, Alfonso de la Cerda, who stated through his brother that he had received the castles and lordships that were awarded to him in the Treaty of Torrellas, and paid homage to Ferdinand IV for the first time.

In January 1305, Ferdinand IV —still in Guadalajara but with the Dowager Queen, John of Castile, Juan Manuel of Villena, Juan Núñez II de Lara, Diego López V de Haro and Juan Alfonso de Haro—, requested again to Diego López V de Haro the return of the Lordship of Biscay to his niece María I Díaz de Haro, but he refused.

==Treaty of Elche (1305)==

In order to solve the inconveniences derived from the distribution of the Murcia territory, and to other minor questions, was agreed a meeting between Ferdinand IV and James II of Aragon in the Monastery of Santa María de Huerta, located in the Province of Soria.

This meeting took place on 26 February 1305, and was attended by the Kings of Castile and Aragon, John of Castile, Juan Núñez II de Lara, Juan Manuel of Villena, Violante Manuel and her husband the &quot;Infante&quot; Afonso of Portugal, the Archbishop of Toledo and the Bishops of Sigüenza and Oporto, among others. In exchange for her renunciation of the Lordships of Elda and Novelda, which would become part of the Kingdom of Aragon, Violante Manuel (sister of Juan Manuel), received the Lordships of Arroyo del Puerco and Medellín from Ferdinand IV, who at the same time gave to Juan Manuel the Lordship and Castle of Alarcón as compensation for his resignation to the possession of Elche. Juan Manuel took possession of the town of Alarcón on 25 March 1305.

On the other hand, James II of Aragon, in spite of the insistence of Ferdinand IV, refused to hand over the Lordship of Albarracín to Juan Núñez II de Lara, who blamed his hitherto ally John of Castile for the low influence exerted on his behalf, and in consequence began to distance from him. On the other hand, Fernando IV and James II granted powers to Diego García de Toledo, Chancellor of the seal of the Puridad, and to Gonzalo García, advisor of the Aragonese monarch, respectively, so that both personages concluded the distribution of Kingdom of Murcia between both Kingdoms, following the terms of the Treaty of Torrellas.

Finally, the delegates of both monarchs reached an agreement that was expressed in the Treaty of Elche, signed on 19 May 1305, and which definitively established the border of the Kingdom of Murcia, which had been divided between Castile and Aragon. The dividing line between the two Kingdoms was established between Pechín and Almansa (who belonged to Ferdinand IV) and Caudete (who passed to James II). The dividing line established between the two kingdoms in the territory of Murcia would follow the course of the Segura river from Cieza, corresponding to Castile the possession of Murcia, Molina de Segura and Blanca, as well as the city of Cartagena, which James II resigned because was located in the inner south of the Segura river, and that belong definitively to the Kingdom of Castile and León. Nevertheless, the transfer of the city of Cartagena to Castile was made on condition that Ferdinand IV respected the property of Juan Manuel of Villena on the Lordship de Alarcón, to which the Castilian monarch didn&#x27;t oppose. At the same time, in the Treaty of Elche was arranged that the municipality of Yecla would continue in the possession of Juan Manuel, and his jurisdiction would correspond to Castile.

The partition of the Kingdom of Murcia, which didn&#x27;t take into account the historical ties of the region, meant that the northern part would correspond to the Kingdom of Aragon, which sought to assimilate it immediately to the rest of his dominions, while the southern part, including Cartagena and the city of Murcia, passed definitely to Castilian hands.

==Conflicts over the possession of the Lordship of Biscay (1305–1307)==

In 1305 Diego López V de Haro was called to appear in the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Medina del Campo, although he didn&#x27;t come but after being summoned several times, to respond to the demands of his niece María I Díaz de Haro, who claimed, using the influence of her husband John of Castile, the possession of the Lordship of Biscay.

In the absence of the Lord of Biscay, John of Castile filed a lawsuit against him before Ferdinand IV, and alleged that he can prove that the Lordship of Biscay was illegally occupied by Sancho IV of Castile, which is why it was now in the hands of Diego López V de Haro, uncle of his wife. However, while John of Castile presented the evidence to the King&#x27;s representatives, Diego López V de Haro arrived, accompanied by 300 knights. The Lord of Biscay refused to renounce to his domains, arguing that John of Castile and his wife had renounced to their rights in a solemn oath in 1300.

Failing to reach an agreement, due to the arguments presented by both parties, Diego López V de Haro returned to Biscay, although the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Medina del Campo had not yet finished until mid-June 1305. In mid-1305, the court was in the city of Burgos, and while Diego López V de Haro proposed to appeal to the Pope, due to the solemn oath of resignation to the Lordship of Biscay made John of Castile and his wife in 1300, Ferdinand IV offered to María I Díaz de Haro the possession of several cities of the Lordship of Biscay, among them San Sebastián, Salvatierra, Fuenterrabia and Guipúzcoa, but she refused, advised by Juan Núñez II de Lara (who was distanced from with her husband) and despite the pressures of John of Castile. Shortly thereafter, John of Castile and Diego López V de Haro signed a truce, valid for two years, during which the King was confident that the Lord of Biscay would break his alliance with Juan Núñez II de Lara. Later, during Christmas of 1305, Ferdinand IV met with Diego López V de Haro in Valladolid, but the Lord of Biscay was accompanied by Juan Núñez II de Lara, who was forced by the King (because he was estranged from him) to leave the city, because he wished to break the alliance between him and Diego López V de Haro, although the monarch did not succeed, since the Lord of Biscay was convinced that John of Castile would not cease in his claims.

At the beginning of 1306, Lope Díaz de Haro, son and heir of Diego López V de Haro, was also estranged from Juan Núñez II de Lara and tried to persuade his father to accept the solution proposed by Ferdinand IV. That same year, the King gave the position of First &quot;Majordomo&quot; to Lope Díaz de Haro; shortly after, the Lord of Biscay had a meeting with the King, but again caused his anger because arrived accompanied by Juan Núñez II de Lara. During the meeting, Diego López V de Haro tried to reconcile Juan Núñez II de Lara with the sovereign, while the latter tried that the Lord of Biscay broke his relations with his ally. Persuaded by Juan Núñez II de Lara, Diego López V de Haro left without the King&#x27;s consent, while ambassadors arrived from the Kingdom of France, requesting an alliance between both countries, and also asking the hand of &quot;Infanta&quot; Isabella of Castile, sister of Fernando IV.

In April 1306, John of Castile, despite the opposition of the Dowager Queen, induced Ferdinand IV to declare war to Juan Núñez II de Lara, knowing that Diego López V de Haro would defend him, and advised the monarch besiege Aranda de Duero, where Juan Núñez II de Lara was, who, in view of the situation, broke his oath of vassalage to the King. After a camp battle, Juan Núñez II de Lara managed to escape from the siege to which Aranda de Duero was intended to be subjected, and met Diego López V de Haro and his son, and agreed to declare the war on Ferdinand IV separately in their respective domains. The royal troops demanded concessions from Ferdinand IV, who had to grant them even though they were not diligent in making war, and so the King ordered John of Castile to enter into negotiations with Diego López V de Haro and his supporters, to which he agreed, because his vassals didn&#x27;t supported the war.

Negotiations didn&#x27;t begin, and the war continued, although John of Castile advised the monarch to sign the peace if this was viable. Ferdinand IV asked the intervention of his mother, who, after negotiations with the rebels through Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, succeeded in arrange a meeting with them in Pancorbo. In the meeting was agreed that the three rebellious magnates granted castles as hostages to the King, who in exchange from their homage as vassals, promised to respect their properties and pay their troops; however, the agreement didn&#x27;t satisfy John of Castile, who renewed his claim over the Lordship of Biscay in the name of his wife, while Ferdinand IV, with the purpose of pleasing John of Castile, took the merindad of Galicia from his brother the &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile, and granted to Diego García de Toledo, private of John of Castile.

Ferdinand IV, still anxious to please John of Castile, sent Alonso Pérez de Guzmán and Juan Núñez II de Lara to talk with Diego López V de Haro, who refused to cede the Lordship of Biscay to John of Castile and his wife, María I Díaz de Haro. When John of Castile learned of this, he summoned Juan Manuel of Villena and his vassals to support him in his pretensions, while the King and his mother talk with Juan Núñez II de Lara to persuade Diego López V de Haro to return the Lordship of Biscay. In September 1306 the King had a meeting with Diego López V de Haro in Burgos. Ferdinand IV proposed that Diego López V de Haro could retain the Lordship of Biscay during his lifetime, but after his death the succession should pass to María I Díaz de Haro, with the exception of the cities of Orduña and Valmaseda, which should be granted to Lope Díaz de Haro, son of Diego López V de Haro. However, the proposal wasn&#x27;t accepted by Diego López V de Haro, and in view of his obstinacy, the monarch again tried to end his alliance with Juan Núñez II de Lara. Shortly afterwards, the Lord of Biscay again appealed to the Pope.

At the beginning of 1307, while the King, his mother, and John of Castile were going to Valladolid, they learned that Pope Clement V recognized the validity of the oath taken by John of Castile and his wife in 1300 about their resignation over the Lordship of Biscay; in consequence, John of Castile was forced to accept it or respond to the lawsuit brought against him by Diego López V de Haro. In February 1307, another attempt was made to resolve the dispute over the Lordship of Biscay, who repeat the terms of the meeting of Burgos in September 1306, but with the addition that, besides Orduña and Valmaseda, Lope Díaz de Haro would also receive the cities Miranda and Villalba de Losa from the King. However, again the agreement wasn&#x27;t accepted by the Lord of Biscay. Soon after, the &quot;Cortes&quot; were summoned in the city of Valladolid.

In the &quot;Cortes&quot; de Valladolid in 1307, when María de Molina saw that the &quot;ricoshombres&quot;, led by John of Castile, protested against the measures taken by the King&#x27;s privates, she tried, in order to please John of Castile, to put a definitive end over the possession of the Lordship of Biscay. For this, the Dowager Queen counted on the collaboration of her half-sister Juana Alfonso de Molina, who persuaded her daughter María I Díaz de Haro to accept the agreement proposed by the King in February 1307. Diego López V de Haro and his son Lope Díaz de Haro agreed to sign the agreement, who followed the terms of the previous meetings of September 1306 and February 1307: María I Díaz de Haro should succeed her uncle after his death and Lope Díaz de Haro received the cities of Orduña, Valmaseda, Miranda and Villalba de Losa.

Once the agreement about the possession of the Lordship of Biscay became known, Juan Núñez II de Lara felt despised by both the King and his mother, and he suddenly left the &quot;Cortes&quot; before they had finalized. For this reason, Ferdinand IV granted the position of First &quot;Majordomo&quot; to Diego López V de Haro, which caused that John of Castile left the court, warning the King that he wouldn&#x27;t count with his help until the governors of the castles of Diego López V de Haro paid homage to his wife María I Díaz de Haro. However, shortly afterwards they met in Lerma, where are already stay María I Díaz de Haro, John of Castile, Juan Núñez II de Lara, Diego López V de Haro, and Lope Díaz de Haro, and was agreed that the Biscay nobility would pay homage to María I Díaz de Haro as heiress and future Lady of Biscay, and the same oath was done in the cities and castle that would receive Lope Díaz de Haro.

==Internal conflicts in Castile and meeting of Grijota (1307–1308)==
In 1307, on the advice of the now reconciled John of Castile and Diego López V de Haro, the King ordered Juan Núñez II de Lara to leave the Kingdom of Castile and to return the castles of Moya and Cañete, located in the Province of Cuenca, and that Ferdinand IV had granted him previously. The King went to Palencia, where his mother was, who advised him that, since he had expelled Juan Núñez II de Lara from the Kingdom, if he wished to preserve the respect of the &quot;ricoshombres&quot; and the nobility, he should be inflexible. Ferdinand IV then went to Tordehumos, where the rebellious magnate was, and surrounded the town at the end of October 1307, being accompanied by numerous &quot;ricoshombres&quot; and the Master of the Order of Santiago with their troops. Shortly after they were joined by the John of Castile (recently recovered from an illness) and his son, Alfonso de Valencia, with their troops.

During the siege of Tordehumos, Ferdinand IV received the order of Pope Clement V to seize the castles and possessions of the Knights Templar, and to keep them in his possession until the pontiff arranged what was to be done with them. At the same time, John of Castile presented to the King a proposal of peace, coming from the besieged ones in Tordehumos, that Ferdinand IV didn&#x27;t accept. During the siege, the King, having difficulty in paying his troops, sent his wife Queen Constance and their newborn daughter, &quot;Infanta&quot; Eleanor of Castile to request a loan in his name to King Denis of Portugal, his father-in-law. At the same time, John of Castile, resentful, advised the monarch to abandon the siege and that he would either finish it or take Íscar, or else he would attend the meeting that Ferdinand IV was to keep with the King of Aragon in Tarazona in his place. However, the King, suspicious of John of Castile, disavowed his proposals and sought to satisfy him by other means.

Because of the desertions of some &quot;ricoshombres&quot;, including Alfonso de Valencia, Rodrigo Álvarez de las Asturias and García Fernández de Villamayor, and also because of the illness of the Dowager Queen, who couldn&#x27;t advise him, Ferdinand IV decided to negotiate with Juan Núñez II de Lara the surrender of the latter. After the capitulation of the town of Tordehumos at the beginning of 1308, Juan Núñez II de Lara promised to surrender all his lands to the King, except those he had in La Bureba and La Rioja, for having them Diego López V de Haro, while paid homage to Ferdinand IV, who signed this agreement without the knowledge of his mother, seriously ill in those moments.

After the siege of Tordehumos, numerous magnates and knights tried to indispose the King with Juan Núñez II de Lara and with John of Castile, telling each of them separately that Ferdinand IV desired the death of both; for this, both allied themselves, fearing that the King desired their deaths, although without the support of Diego López V de Haro. Nevertheless, they were persuaded by María de Molina that Ferdinand IV didn&#x27;t wish them any bad, something that later was confirmed to them by the own sovereign. However, John of Castile and his companions requested to present their petitions to the Dowager Queen and not to him, to which the sovereign acceded. The claims (presented by the plaintiffs in the called Meeting of Grijota) were that the sovereign granted the merindad of Galicia to Rodrigo Álvarez de las Asturias and the merindad of Castile to Fernán Ruiz de Saldaña and the expel from the court of his privates Sancho Sánchez de Velasco, Diego García and Fernán Gómez de Toledo. The demands presented by the magnates were accepted by the monarch.

In 1308, Rodrigo Yáñez, Master of the Knights Templar in the Kingdom of Castile, surrender to María de Molina the fortresses of the Order in the Kingdom, but the Dowager Queen didn&#x27;t agree to take them without the consent of her son, which the latter granted. However, the Master didn&#x27;t deliver the castles to the Dowager Queen, but offered them to the &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile, brother of Ferdinand IV, to give them to him, with the condition that he asked the King in his name that he could attend the demands of the Templars to the prelates of his Kingdom.

In the Cortes de Burgos in 1308 were also present, besides the King, the Dowager Queen, John of Castile, the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Castile, Juan Manuel of Villena and most of the &quot;ricoshombres&quot; and magnates. Ferdinand IV tried to put order in the affairs of his domains, as well as to reach a budgetary balance and to reorganize the administration of the Court, while trying to reduce the attributions of John of Castile, aspect this last who proved to be impossible for the monarch.

John of Castile filed suit with &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile for the possession of the Templar castles of Ponferrada, Alcañices, San Pedro de Latarce and Haro, of which he had appropriated, and which he was forced to hand over to the King, while the Master of the Knights Templar was committed to deliver to Ferdinand IV the castles that still had in his power.

==Treaty of Alcalá de Henares (1308)==

In March 1306 Ferdinand IV had requested to meet with James II of Aragon, and from that moment the ambassadors of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon tried to set a date for the meeting between the two sovereigns, that had to be postponed several times due to the existing internal conflicts in both Kingdoms. The clauses of the Treaty of Alcalá de Henares, signed on 19 December 1308, had their origins in the meetings held by the Kings of Castile and Aragon in the Monastery of Santa María de Huerta and in Monreal de Ariza in December 1308. The themes discussed in the meetings were the relaunch of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; wars, desired by both sovereigns, and the marriage of the &quot;Infanta&quot; Eleanor of Castile, eldest daughter and heiress of Ferdinand IV, with the &quot;Infante&quot; James of Aragon, eldest son and heir of James II and, finally, the satisfaction of the commitments made with Alfonso de la Cerda, which had not yet been fully fulfilled.

Regarding the marriage between Eleanor of Castile and James of Aragon, although it was celebrated in October 1319 was never consummated, since the &quot;Infante&quot; James escaped after the wedding ceremony, resigned soon after to his rights to the Aragonese throne, and entered in the Knights Hospitaller Order. The &quot;Infanta&quot; Eleanor, years later (1329), marry with Alfonso IV of Aragon, second son and successor of James II. Regarding the second subject discussed in the meetings of the sovereigns, Ferdinand IV gave to Alfonso de la Cerda 220,000 &quot;maravedíes&quot; that had not yet been received by him and in exchange he surrender to the king the cities of Deza, Serón and Alcalá. The idea of re-launching the struggle against the Kingdom of Granada was enthusiastically received by both sovereigns, who had the support of King Abu al-Rabi Sulayman of Morocco, who was at war against Sultan Muhammed III of Granada.

After the meetings held between the two sovereigns, Ferdinand IV met in the town of Almazán with his mother and both agreed to clean up the area between Almazán and Atienza from criminals and destroy the fortresses that served them as a refuge, work which was made by &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile, brother of Ferdinand IV. For her part, the Dowager Queen was pleased with the agreements between her son and the King of Aragon. Immediately after, the King went to Alcalá de Henares.

On 19 December 1308, in Alcala de Henares, Ferdinand IV and the Aragonese ambassadors Bernaldo de Sarriá and Gonzalo García signed the Treaty of Alcalá de Henares. The Castilian sovereign, who had the support of his brother, the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, Diego López V de Haro, the Archbishop of Toledo and the Bishop of Zamora, agreed to start the war against the Kingdom of Granada on 24 June 1309 and promised, like the Aragonese monarch, not to sign a separate peace with the Granadine ruler. Ferdinand IV and James II both agree to contribute with ten galleys each for the expedition. It was approved with the consent of both parties that the troops of the Kingdom of Castile and León would attack the cities of Algeciras and Gibraltar, while the troops of the Kingdom of Aragon would conquer the city of Almería.

Ferdinand IV promised to give up one-sixth of the Kingdom of Granada to the Aragonese king, and granted him the Kingdom of Almería in its entirety as advance, except for the cities of Bedmar, Locubin, Alcaudete, Quesada, and Arenas, who previously belonged to the Kingdom of Castile and León. Ferdinand IV established that if the situation occurred that the Kingdom of Almería didn&#x27;t correspond to the sixth part of the Kingdom of Granada, the Archbishop of Toledo (on the part of Castile) and the Bishop of Valencia (on the part of the Aragon) would be the ones in charge to solve the possible deficiencies of the calculation. The granting to the kingdom of Aragon of such a large part of the Kingdom of Granada caused that John of Castile and Juan Manuel of Villena protested against the ratification of the Treaty, although their protests had no consequences.

The entry into force of the clauses of the Alcalá de Henares treaty meant a significant expansion of the future boundaries of the Kingdom of Aragon, which reached a higher limit than those foreseen in the Treaties of Cazola and Almizra, in which future areas of expansion of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon would be previously established. In addition, Ferdinand IV gave his consent for James II of Aragon to negotiate an alliance with the King of Morocco, in order to combat the Kingdom of Granada.

After the signing of the Treaty of Alcalá de Henares, the Kings of Castile and Aragon sent ambassadors to the Court of Avignon, in order to request Pope Clement V to grant the condition of Crusade to the fight against the Muslims in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, and to grant the necessary dispensation for the marriage between Eleanor of Castile and James of Aragon, to which the Pope acceded, because such necessary dispensation was granted before the arrival of the ambassadors to Avignon. On 24 April 1309, Pope Clement V, through the bull &quot;&quot;Indesinentis cure&quot;, authorized the preaching of the Crusade in the dominions of King James II of Aragon, and granted to this fight the tithes that had been destined for conquest of Corsica and Sardinia.

In the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Madrid in 1309 —the first celebrated in the present capital of Spain—, the king manifested his desire to go to war against the Kingdom of Granada, while demanding subsidies to this enterprise. In these Cortes were present King Ferdinand IV and his wife Queen Constance, Dowager Queen María de Molina, &quot;Infantes&quot; Peter and Philip, John of Castile, Juan Manuel of Villena, Juan Núñez II de Lara, Diego López V de Haro, Alfonso Téllez de Molina (maternal uncle of the King), the Archbishop of Toledo, the Masters of the Military Orders of Santiago and Calatrava, representatives of cities and councils, and other nobles and prelates. The &quot;Cortes&quot; approved the concession of five services, destined to pay the soldiers of the &quot;ricoshombres&quot; and &quot;hidalgos&quot;.

Numerous magnates of the Kingdom, headed by John of Castile and Juan Manuel of Villena, opposed to the project of taking the city of Algeciras, preferring to carry out a campaign of plunder and devastation in Vega de Granada. In addition, John of Castile was resentful to the King because of the latter&#x27;s refusal to hand him the municipality of Ponferrada, and Juan Manuel of Villena, although he wished to wage war against the Kingdom of Granada from his lands in Murcia, was forced by Ferdinand IV to participate together with his troops at the siege of Algeciras.

At that time, the Master of the Order of Calatrava made a raid on the border and obtained considerable booty, and on 13 March 1309 the Bishop of Cartagena, with the approval of the cathedral chapter of Cartagena, seized the city and of the castle of Lubrín, that later would be donated to him by Ferdinand IV. After the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Madrid, the King went to Toledo, where he waited for his troops to join him, while leaving his mother María de Molina in charge of the Kingdom&#x27;s government, entrusting her with the custody of the royal seals.

==The conquest of Gibraltar and the siege of Algeciras (1309)==
In the campaign participated John of Castile, Juan Manuel of Villena, Diego López V de Haro, Juan Núñez II de Lara, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, Fernán Ruiz de Saldaña, and other Castilian magnates and &quot;ricoshombres&quot;. Also took part in the enterprise the council militias of Salamanca, Segovia, Seville and other cities. For its part, King Denis of Portugal, father-in-law of Ferdinand IV, sent a contingent of 700 knights under the command of Martín Gil de Sousa, and James II of Aragon contributed to the expedition against Algeciras with 10 galleys. Pope Clement V, by the bull &quot;Prioribus, decanis&quot;&quot; issued on 29 April 1309 in the city of Avignon, granted Ferdinand IV a tenth of all the ecclesiastical revenues of his Kingdoms for three years, in order to contribute to the maintenance of the war against the Kingdom of Granada.

From the city of Toledo, Ferdinand IV went to Córdoba, where the emissaries of James II of Aragon announced that he was ready to begin the siege of Almería. In the city of Córdoba Ferdinand IV again discussed the campaign plan, because his brother the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Castile, John of Castile, Juan Manuel of Villena and Diego López V de Haro, among others, were opposed to the project of besiege the city of Algeciras, since all of them preferred to plunder and devastate the Vega de Granada through a series of successive attacks that would demoralize the Granada Muslims. Nevertheless, the will of Ferdinand IV prevailed and the Castilian-Leonese troops prepared to besiege Algeciras. The last preparations of the campaign were made in the city of Seville, to which Ferdinand IV arrived in early July 1309. The provisions and supplies accumulated in the city of Seville by the Castilian-Leonese army were transferred by the Guadalquivir river, and then by sea to Algeciras.

On 27 July 1309, a part of the Castilian-Leonese army was found before the walls of the city of Algeciras, and three days later, on 30 July, arrived Ferdinand IV and John of Castile accompanied by numerous &quot;ricoshombres&quot;. James II of Aragon began to besiege the city of Almería on 15 August, and the siege lasted until 26 January 1310. A few days after the start of the siege of Algeciras, Ferdinand IV sent Juan Núñez II de Lara, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, the Archbishop of Seville, the council of the city of Seville and the Master of the Order of Calatrava to besiege Gibraltar, who capitulated before the Castilian troops on 12 September 1309 after a brief and hard siege.

In mid-October 1309, John of Castile, his son Alfonso de Valencia, Juan Manuel of Villena and Fernán Ruiz de Saldaña, deserted and left the Christian camp located before Algeciras, being accompanied in their flight by others 500 knights. This action, motivated by the fact that Ferdinand IV owed them certain sums of money for the payment of their soldiers, provoked the indignation of the European courts and the protest of James II of Aragon, who tried to persuade the deserters, though unsuccessfully, to return to the siege of Algeciras. However, Ferdinand IV, who had the support of his brother, the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, Juan Núñez II de Lara and Diego López V de Haro, persisted in his attempt to conquer Algeciras.

The scarcity and poverty of means in the Christian camp became so alarming that Ferdinand IV was obliged to pawn the jewels and crowns of his wife Queen Constance in order to be able to pay the soldiers and the crews of the galleys. Shortly afterwards arrived at the Christian camp the troops of the &quot;Infante&quot; Philip of Castile and the Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, who came accompanied by 400 knights and a good number of peons. At the end of 1309, Diego López V de Haro became seriously ill as a result of a gout attack, which added to the death of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, the rainy season that flooded the Christian camp, and the desertion of the John of Castile and Juan Manuel of Villena. Nevertheless, in spite of these adversities, Ferdinand IV persisted until the last moment in his objective to capture Algeciras, although in the end he abandoned this purpose.

In January 1310 Ferdinand IV decided to negotiate with the Granadians, who sent the &quot;arráez&quot; of Andarax as an emissary to the Christian camp. An agreement reached, which stipulated that in exchange for lifting the siege of Algeciras the Castilian sovereign would receive Quesada and Bedmar, in addition to 50,000 gold &quot;doblas&quot;, Ferdinand IV ordered to lift the siege at the end of January 1310. After the signing of the preliminary agreement Diego López V de Haro died, and María I Díaz de Haro, wife of John of Castile, took possession of the Lordship of Biscay. After this, John of Castile returned to the King the towns of Paredes de Nava, Cabreros, Medina de Rioseco, Castronuño and Mansilla. At the same time as Ferdinand IV ordered to abandon the siege of Algeciras, James II of Aragon ordered the siege of Almería to be lifted, without having managed to seize the city.

On the whole, the campaign of the year 1309 proved more profitable for the arms of the Kingdom of Castile and León than for the Kingdom of Aragon, since Ferdinand IV was able to incorporate Gibraltar into their dominions. The betrayal and desertion of the two relatives of the king, Juan Manuel of Villena and John of Castile was badly considered by all the European courts, that didn&#x27;t save qualifiers to criticize the two Castilian magnates.

==Last years and death (1310–1312)==
=== Conflicts with John of Castile and Juan Manuel of Villena (1310–1311) ===
In 1310, after the siege of Algeciras, Ferdinand IV sent Juan Núñez II de Lara to confer with Pope Clement V, to implore him not to permit the process against his predecessor Pope Boniface VIII, who had legitimized the marriage of the parents of Ferdinand IV in 1301, thereby legitimizing the Castilian King himself. Juan Núñez II de Lara was to inform the Pope about the causes that had motivated the lifting of the siege of Algeciras, and also had to petitioned, on behalf of Ferdinand IV, funds for the continuation of the war against the Kingdom of Granada. Pope Clement V tried to soften the animosity that King Philip IV of France felt towards the late Pope Boniface VIII, condemn the behavior of John of Castile and Juan Manuel of Villena during the siege of Algeciras, granted the Castilian monarch the &quot;tithes&quot; collected In his domains for a year, and sent various letters to the prelates of the Kingdom of Castile and León in which they were ordered to severely reprimand those who didn&#x27;t collaborate with Ferdinand IV in the enterprise of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;.

In the meanwhile, Ferdinand IV undertook again the war against the Kingdom of Granada. His brother the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter conquered the castle of Tempul and later went to Seville, where the King was. In November 1310, both brothers went to Córdoba, where a popular uprising had taken place against several knights of the city. Meanwhile, Dowager Queen María de Molina, who was in Valladolid, begged her son to join her there, so that the monarch might be present at the wedding of his sister, the &quot;Infanta&quot; Isabella with John, Viscount of Limoges and heir of the Duchy of Brittany. On the way to Burgos, Ferdinand IV stopped in the city of Toledo and confessed to Juan Núñez II de Lara that he planned to arrest or assassinate John of Castile, because he thought that if he still live, he would harm and hinder him in all his purposes. However, Juan Núñez II de Lara, in spite of his hatred for John of Castile, realized that the King didn&#x27;t do it out of affection for him, and that if he helped Ferdinand IV to get rid of John of Castile, this would mean his own ruin.

Ferdinand IV arrived in Burgos in January 1311, and after the marriage of his sister, he planned to assassinate John of Castile, as a revenge for his desertion during the siege of Algeciras and, at the same time, to subdue the nobility, who again rebelled against the royal authority. However, the Dowager Queen advised John of Castile of the purposes of her son and he was able to escape. Ferdinand IV, accompanied by his brother &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, Lope Díaz de Haro, and by the troops of the council of Burgos persecuted John of Castile and his supporters, who took refuge in the city of Saldaña.

The King then deprived John of Castile of his title of &quot;Adelantado Mayor&quot; (who was granted to Juan Núñez II de Lara) and ordered the confiscation of lands and lordships that he had given to him and his sons Alfonso de Valencia and Juan &quot;The one-eyed&quot;, and the same luck was suffered by Sancho of Castile, cousin of Ferdinand IV and supporter of John of Castile. At the same time, Juan Manuel of Villena reconciled with the monarch and asked him to grant him the position of First &quot;Majordomo&quot;; Ferdinand IV, who wished that Juan Manuel would break his friendship with John of Castile, stripped &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of the position of First &quot;Majordomo&quot; and gave it to Juan Manuel of Villena, and in as a compensation for the loss of the title the King gave his brother the cities of Almazán and Berlanga de Duero, which he had previously promised to him.

At the beginning of February 1311, and although he had reconciled with Ferdinand IV, Juan Manuel of Villena left the city of Burgos and went to Peñafiel, reuniting shortly afterwards with John of Castile in Dueñas. The supporters and vassals of John of Castile, fearing the wrath of the King, prepared to defend him, among them Sancho of Castile and Juan Alfonso de Haro. In view of the situation, Ferdinand IV, who didn&#x27;t want an open revolt of the supporters of John of Castile, in addition to wanting to dedicate himself exclusively to the war against the Kingdom of Granada, sent his mother to confer with John of Castile, his children, and supporters in Villamuriel de Cerrato. The conversations lasted fifteen days and the Dowager Queen was accompanied by the Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela and by the Bishops of León, Lugo, Mondoñedo and Palencia. The meeting concluded with the peace between John of Castile (who was worried about his personal security) and Ferdinand IV. This concord was opposed by both Queen Constance and Juan Núñez II de Lara, who still was distanced from John of Castile. Shortly afterwards, Ferdinand IV met with John of Castile in the municipality of Grijota, and both ratified the previous agreement orchestrated by the Dowager Queen in Villamuriel de Cerrato.

On 20 March 1311, during an assembly of prelates in the city of Palencia, Ferdinand IV confirmed and granted new privileges to the churches and prelates of his Kingdoms, and responded to their demands. In April 1311, being in Palencia, Ferdinand IV became seriously ill and had to be transferred to Valladolid, despite the opposition of his wife Queen Constance, who wished to transfer him to Carrión de los Condes, in order to be able to control the sovereign along with her ally Juan Núñez II de Lara. During the illness of Ferdinand IV discrepancies arose between the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, Juan Núñez II de Lara, John of Castile and don Juan Manuel. While the King was in Toro, the Queen gave birth in Salamanca on 13 August 1311 to a son, the future Alfonso XI of Castile. The newborn heir of the Castilian throne was baptized in the Old Cathedral of Salamanca, and despite the King&#x27;s wishes to entrust the guardianship of his son to his mother the Dowager Queen, the will of Queen Constance prevailed, who wanted (with the support of Juan Núñez II de Lara and Lope Díaz de Haro), that the custody of her son should be entrusted to the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter.

In the fall of 1311 a conspiracy arose which sought the overthrow of Ferdinand IV in favor of his brother &quot;Infante&quot; Peter. The conspiracy was carried out by John of Castile, Juan Núñez II de Lara and by Lope Díaz de Haro, son of the late Diego López V de Haro. However, the project failed due to the contundent refusal of the Dowager Queen.

=== Concord of Palencia and meeting of Calatayud (1311–1312) ===

In mid-1311, John of Castile and the principal magnates of the Kingdom threatened Ferdinand IV by ceasing to serve him, if the monarch didn&#x27;t satisfy their requests. John of Castile and his followers demanded that the King replace his advisers and privates for John of Castile himself, the Dowager Queen, &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, Juan Manuel of Villena, Juan Núñez II de Lara and the Bishops of Astorga, Zamora, Orense and Palencia. Juan Manuel of Villena remained loyal to Ferdinand IV, because on 15 October the King had given him all the royal &quot;pechos&quot; (tributes) and rights of Valdemoro and Rabrido, except for the &quot;moneda forera&quot; of both places and the &quot;martiniega&quot; (another tribute) de Rabrido, which had been granted to Alfonso de la Cerda.

With the desire to achieve peace in order to continue with the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, Ferdinand IV agreed to sign the Concord of Palencia on 28 October 1311 with John of Castile and the rest of the magnates, and whose clauses were ratified in the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Valladolid in 1312. The King promised to respect the customs, &quot;fueros&quot; and privileges of the nobles, prelates, and subjects of the towns, and not to try to deprive the nobles of the rents and lands that belonged to the Crown. Ferdinand IV ratified that the custody of his son, the &quot;Infante&quot; Alfonso, would be entrusted to his brother, &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, to whom was also ceded the city of Santander. The King ceded to John of Castile the municipality of Ponferrada, on the condition that John would not establish any type of alliance with Juan Núñez II de Lara; John violated his word on 5 November, eight days after signing of the Concord.

In December 1311 Ferdinand IV meet in Calatayud with James II of Aragon. At that moment was celebrated the marriage of &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Castile and the &quot;Infanta&quot; Maria of Aragon, daughter of James II, although some authors indicate that the marriage was celebrated in January 1312. At the same time, Ferdinand IV gave to James II his eldest daughter, the &quot;Infanta&quot; Eleanor of Castille, to be raised in the Aragonese court until she had the proper age to marry the &quot;Infante&quot; James of Aragon, firstborn son and heir of James II.

In the meeting of Calatayud of 1311 it was also agreed to resume the war against the Kingdom of Granada, but it was decided that each Kingdom should do it separately, while James II promised to mediate between Ferdinand IV and his father-in-law in the conflict that both maintained about the possession of some cities of which Denis of Portugal had taken over during Ferdinand IV&#x27;s minority. However, the death of Ferdinand IV in September 1312 put an end to such negotiations between the sovereigns of Aragon and Portugal. On 3 April 1312, shortly after the meeting of Calatayud, Juan Manuel of Villena married in the city of Xàtiva with the &quot;Infanta&quot; Constance of Aragon, another daughter of James II.

=== Last period of the Ferdinand IV&#x27;s life (1312) ===
After his stay in the city of Calatayud, Ferdinand IV went to the city of Valladolid, where the &quot;Cortes&quot; were to meet. In the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Valladolid in 1312, the last of the reign of Ferdinand IV, funds were raised to maintain the army to be used in the next campaign against the Kingdom of Granada, were reorganized the administration of justice, the territorial administration and the local administration, thus showing the King&#x27;s desire to make profound reforms in all areas of administration, while attempting to strengthen the royal authority against the nobility. The &quot;Cortes&quot; approved the concession of five services and one &quot;moneda forera&quot;, for the payment of the soldiers of the King&#x27;s vassals, except for Juan Núñez II de Lara, who had become the vassal of King Denis of Portugal.

As early as October 1311, Ferdinand IV had requested a loan from King Edward II of England, in order to continue the war against the Kingdom of Granada, although the English sovereign refused to grant it, arguing that he had many expenses due to his war against Scotland. In July 1312, Ferdinand IV pledge the Templar castles of Burguillos del Cerro and Alconchel for 3,600 marks to King Denis of Portugal, which he needed to continue the war against the Kingdom of Granada. At the end of April 1312, after the &quot;Cortes&quot; had been end, the King left the city of Valladolid. In 1312 Sancho of Castile, Lord of Ledesma first-cousin of Ferdinand IV died; immediately the King went to Ledesma, that acted as a capital of the dominions of his cousin, and incorporated the dominions to the royal patrimony, after it had been proved that the deceased had no legitimate children. Ferdinand IV then went to Salamanca, and deprived his cousin Alfonso de la Cerda (who had rebelled again against him) of the municipalities of Béjar and Alba de Tormes.

On 13 July 1312, the King arrived in Toledo, after leaving the &quot;Infante&quot; Alfonso, heir to the throne, in the city of Ávila, and went to the province of Jaén, where his brother &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Castile was besieging the town of Alcaudete. The King, after a short stay in the city of Jaén, went to the town of Martos, where he ordered the execution of the Carvajal brothers, accused of having murdered Juan Alonso de Benavides, private of Ferdinand IV, in Palencia. According to legend, since this is not included in the &quot;Chronicle of Ferdinand IV&quot;, the brothers were condemned to be introduced into an iron cage with sharp points inside and later to be thrown from top of the Rock of Martos, still inside the iron cage. The &quot;Chronicle of Ferdinand IV&quot; states that before dying, the brothers summoned the King to appear before the Court of God within thirty days.

After his stay in Martos, the King went to Alcaudete, where he awaited John of Castile, that should be united with his troops to the siege of the locality. However, John of Castile didn&#x27;t appear for fear that Ferdinand IV would order his death. Sick of gravity, Ferdinand IV left the siege of Alcaudete and went to the city of Jaén at the end of August 1312.

On 5 September 1312, the garrison of Alcaudete was surrendered after three months of siege, and the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter went to the city of Jaén, where his brother the King was waiting for him. On 7 September, the day of Ferdinand IV&#x27;s death, both brothers agreed to help Nasr, Sultan of Granada, with whom a truce had been agreed, and to help him in his fight against his brother-in-law Ferrachén, &quot;arráez&quot; de Málaga, who had rebel against him.

==Different versions of the king&#x27;s death==

Ferdinand IV died on 7 September 1312 in the city of Jaén, without anyone seeing him die. History and legend have intertwined indissolubly in what concerns the death of the monarch, who received at his death the nickname of &quot;the Summoned&quot;, because of the mysterious circumstances in which it occurred. Ferdinand IV died aged 26, and when he died he left an only 1-year-old son, who would reign as Alfonso XI of Castile.

The &quot;Chronicle of Fernando IV&quot;, written around 1340, almost thirty years after the death of the king, describes the death of the Castilian-Leonese monarch in Chapter XVIII of the work, and the Carvajal brothers, thirty days Before that of Ferdinand IV, although it does not specify how the latter died:

In the chapter III of the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso XI&quot;, the death of Ferdinand IV is described in the same way as described in the &quot;Chronicle of Ferdinand IV&quot;. The historian Diego Rodríguez de Almela, in his work &quot;Valerio de las historias escolásticas y de los hechos de España,&quot; which was written around the year 1472, related as follows the death of the monarch:

Martín Ximena Jurado, a historian and chronicler of the 17th century in his work &quot;Catálogo de los Obispos de las Iglesias Catedrales de Jaén y Anales eclesiásticos de este Obispado&quot;, described the Royal Church of Santa Marta in the city of Martos, where the remains of the Carvajal brothers, executed by order of Ferdinand IV, are buried. While describing the grave of the two brothers, he provided some information on the death of the monarch:

Juan de Mariana, writer and historian of the 17th century, described the conviction and execution of the Carvajal brothers in the city of Martos, and for the first time established the possible relationship between the legend of the emplacement before the Court of God of Ferdinand IV, and the emplacements suffered by Pope Clement V and King Philip IV of France, both in 1314, two years after the death of the Castilian sovereign. The last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in Paris in March 1314, and before his death, according to tradition, he ordered to appear before God within a year, Pope Clement V, King Philip IV of France and Guillaume de Nogaret, responsible for the suppression of the Order of the Temple and the death of many of its members:

Historian and archaeologist Francisco Simón y Nieto, in his book &quot;Una página del reinado de Fernando IV. Pleito seguido en Valladolid ante el rey y su corte en una sesión, por los personeros de Palencia contra el Obispo D. Álvaro Carrillo, 28 de mayo de 1298&quot;, published in 1912, noted that the ultimate cause of the death of Ferdinand IV may have been due to a coronary Thrombosis, but without discard others, such as Intracerebral hemorrhage, acute Pulmonary edema, Angina pectoris, Myocardial infarction, Embolism, Syncope or others.

==Burial==

In September 1312, shortly after his death, the mortal remains of Ferdinand IV were transferred to the city of Córdoba, and on 13 September they were buried in a chapel of the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba, although his corpse should have been buried in the Toledo Cathedral next to his father Sancho IV or in Seville Cathedral with his paternal grandfather Alfonso X and his paternal great-grandfather Ferdinand III.

However, due to the high temperatures that occurred in September 1312, Queen Constance of Portugal, widow of Ferdinand IV, and the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter of Castile, brother of the late King, decided the burial of the mortal remains Of Fernando IV in the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba. Queen Constance also founded six chaplaincies and ordered that in September was celebrated the perpetual anniversary in memory of the late King. Within a year of the monarch&#x27;s death, four candles burned permanently in his grave, and daily, during that year, the bishop of the city and the cathedral chapter sang once a day prays for the soul of the King. In 1371, the mortal remains of Ferdinand IV and those of his son Alfonso XI were deposited in the Royal Chapel of the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba, whose construction had ended that same year.

In 1728, Pope Benedict XIII issued a bull for which the Royal Chapel of the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba was attached to the Church of Saint Hippolytus of Córdoba, and that same year, after several requests on the part of the canons of Saint Hippolytus, who had requested Philip V to have the remains of Ferdinand IV and Alfonso XI transferred to his Collegiate Church, the King authorized the transfer of the remains of the two monarchs.

In 1729 works for the completion of the Church of Saint Hippolytus were begun, which were terminated in 1736, and on the night of 8 August 1736, with all honors, the mortal remains of Ferdinand IV and Alfonso XI were transferred to the Royal Collegiate Church of Saint Hippolytus, where they rest since then. At the same time, the canons of Saint Hippolytus transferred to their Collegiate Church all the furniture of the Royal Chapel of the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba.

In the first section of the presbytery of the Royal Collegiate Church of Saint Hippolytus, housed in two arcosolium, are the tombs that contain the mortal remains of Ferdinand IV (located on the side of the Epistle) and the one containing the remains of his son Alfonso XI (which is on the side of the Gospel). The remains of both monarchs are deposited inside red marble urns, built with marble from the disappeared Monastery of San Jerónimo of Córdoba, and both were made in 1846, commissioned by the Monuments Commission.

Until that moment, the remains of both monarchs were placed in two wooden coffins in the presbytery of the church, where they were shown to distinguished visitors. On the roofs of both sepulchres are placed pillows on which are deposited a crown and a scepter, symbols of royalty.

==Marriage and issue==
In Valladolid on 23 January 1302, Ferdinand IV married with Constance, daughter of King Denis of Portugal. They had:

*Eleanor (1307–1359), married firstly in 1319 with James of Aragon (the union was never consummated and annulled) and secondly in 1329 with King Alfonso IV of Aragon, brother of her first husband. She was killed in Castrojeriz by orders of her nephew, King Peter of Castile.
*Constance (1308–1310), who died in infancy. She was initially buried in the lost Convent of Santo Domingo el Real in Madrid, and in 1869 her remains were found and transferred to the crypt of the Church of San Antonio de los Alemanes, where they still remain.
*Alfonso XI (1311–1350), successor of his father in the Castilian-Leonese throne. He died a victim of the Black Death during the Fifth Siege of Gibraltar.

<text>The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. It is a rock opera which explores Pink, a jaded rock star, as he constructs a psychological &quot;wall&quot; of social isolation. &quot;The Wall&quot; topped the US charts for 15 weeks and reached number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.

The bassist, Roger Waters, conceived &quot;The Wall&quot; during Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 In the Flesh tour, modelling the character of Pink after himself and the former member Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. The producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial problems. The keyboardist, Richard Wright, was fired by Waters during production but stayed on during the tour as a salaried musician.

Three singles were issued: &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot; (Pink Floyd&#x27;s only UK &quot;and&quot; US number-one single), &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, &quot;The Wall&quot; was adapted into a feature film written by Waters.

&quot;The Wall&quot; is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second-best-selling Pink Floyd album behind &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), the best-selling double album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Some outtakes sessions were used on the next Pink Floyd album, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new &quot;Wall&quot; live tour that became one of the highest-grossing tours by a solo musician.

== Background ==

Throughout 1977, Pink Floyd played the In the Flesh tour to promote their new album &quot;Animals&quot;. Bassist and lyricist Roger Waters despised the experience – angered by the audience&#x27;s rowdy behavior (such as setting off fireworks in the middle of songs) and convinced that they were not really listening to the music. On 6 July 1977 at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters so much that he leaned over the side and spat on one of them. Said Waters of the incident, &quot;Immediately afterwards I was shocked by my behaviour. I realised that what had once been a worthwhile and manageable exchange between us (the band) and them (the audience) had been utterly perverted by scale, corporate avarice and ego. All that remained was an arrangement that was essentially sado-masochistic.&quot; That night, Waters spoke with producer Bob Ezrin and a psychiatrist friend of Ezrin&#x27;s about the alienation and despair he was experiencing. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the band and the audience. The concept was an instant source of inspiration.

While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and the drummer, Nick Mason, was busy producing Steve Hillage&#x27;s &quot;Green&quot;, Waters began to write material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist&#x27;s self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a child.

In July 1978, Pink Floyd reconvened at Britannia Row Studios, where Waters presented two new ideas for concept albums. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title &quot;Bricks in the Wall&quot;. The second was about a man&#x27;s dreams on one night, and dealt with marriage, sex, and the pros and cons of monogamy and family life versus promiscuity. The band chose the first option; the second eventually became Waters&#x27;s debut solo studio album, &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; (1984).

By September, Pink Floyd were having financial problems and urgently needed to produce an album to make money. The financial planners Norton Warburg Group (NWG) had invested £1.3–3.3 million, up to £ in contemporary value, of the group&#x27;s money in high-risk venture capital to reduce their tax liabilities. The strategy failed when many of the businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 per cent. Waters said: &quot;Eighty-three per cent was a lot of money in those days and we didn&#x27;t have it.&quot; Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds. Gilmour said he became closely involved in the business side of Pink Floyd afterwards: &quot;Ever since then, there&#x27;s not a penny that I haven&#x27;t signed for. I sign every cheque and examine everything.&quot;

To help manage the project&#x27;s 26 tracks, Waters decided to bring in an outside producer and collaborator, feeling he needed &quot;a collaborator who was musically and intellectually in a similar place to where I was&quot;. They hired Ezrin at the suggestion of Waters&#x27;s then-wife Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin&#x27;s secretary. Ezrin had previously worked with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, Kiss, and Peter Gabriel. From the start, Waters made it clear who was in charge, telling him: &quot;You can write anything you want. Just don&#x27;t expect any credit.&quot;

Ezrin and Gilmour reviewed Waters&#x27;s concept, discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. Ezrin presented a 40-page script to the rest of the band, with positive results. He recalled: &quot;The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album.&quot; Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written and basing it on a composite character named Pink. The engineer Nick Griffiths later said: &quot;Ezrin was very good in &quot;The Wall&quot;, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He&#x27;s a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them.&quot; Waters wrote most of the album, with Gilmour co-writing &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and &quot;Young Lust&quot;, and Ezrin co-writing &quot;The Trial&quot;.

== Concept and storyline ==
&quot;The Wall&quot; is a rock opera that explores abandonment, cycles of violence, and isolation, symbolized by a wall. The songs create a storyline of events in the life of Pink, a fictional rock star based on Waters and Pink Floyd&#x27;s former frontman Syd Barrett. The first half of the album largely features events from Waters&#x27; childhood and young adulthood, such as the death of his father in WWII, and his wife&#x27;s infidelity. The album also includes several references to Barrett, namely the track &quot;Nobody Home&quot;. &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was inspired by Waters&#x27; injection with a muscle relaxant to combat the effects of hepatitis during the In the Flesh tour in Philadelphia. Also paralleling the In the Flesh tour was the song &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, a satirical commentary on fascism that is also representative of Waters&#x27; feelings of hostility towards his audiences.

=== Plot ===
The album opens with Pink, a rock star, addressing a crowd of fans at one of his concerts, to whom he is about to give an apparently unexpected performance of his life story (&quot;In the Flesh?&quot;). A flashback on his life up to that point begins, in which it is revealed that his father was killed during World War II, leaving Pink&#x27;s mother to raise him alone. Beginning with the death of his father, Pink starts to build a metaphorical wall around himself (&quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1&quot;). Growing older, Pink is tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers (&quot;The Happiest Days of Our Lives&quot;), and memories of these traumas become metaphorical &quot;bricks in the wall&quot; (&quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot;).
Now an adult, Pink remembers his domineering, overprotective mother (&quot;Mother&quot;) and his upbringing during the Blitz (&quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;). Pink soon marries, and after more &quot;bricks&quot; are created through more traumas, he is preparing to complete his &quot;wall&quot; (&quot;Empty Spaces&quot;). While touring in the United States, he seeks casual sex to relieve the tedium of touring, though in making a phone call home, he learns of his wife&#x27;s infidelity (&quot;Young Lust&quot;). He brings a groupie back to his hotel room, only to trash it in a violent fit of rage, terrifying her out of the room (&quot;One of My Turns&quot;). Depressed, Pink thinks about his wife and fantasizes about committing violence against her (&quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Now&quot;). Feeling trapped, he dismisses the impact his past has had on him while rejecting human contact and medication (&quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3&quot;). Pink&#x27;s wall is now finished, completely isolating himself from the outside world (&quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;).

Immediately after the wall&#x27;s completion, Pink questions his decisions (&quot;Hey You&quot;) and locks himself in his hotel room (&quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot;). As his depression worsens, Pink turns to his possessions for comfort (&quot;Nobody Home&quot;), and yearns for the idea of reconnecting with his personal roots (&quot;Vera&quot;). Pink&#x27;s mind flashes back to World War II, with the people demanding that the soldiers return home (&quot;Bring the Boys Back Home&quot;). Returning to the present, Pink&#x27;s manager and roadies break into his hotel room, where they find him unresponsive. A paramedic injects him with drugs to enable him to perform at a concert later that night (&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;).

The drugs kick in, resulting in a hallucinatory on-stage performance (&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;) where he believes that he is a fascist dictator, and that his concert is a Neo-Nazi rally, at which he sets brownshirt-like men on fans that he considers unworthy (&quot;In the Flesh&quot;). He proceeds to attack minorities (&quot;Run Like Hell&quot;), culminating in him imagining holding a violence-inciting rally in suburban London (&quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot;). Pink&#x27;s hallucination then ceases, and he begs for everything to stop (&quot;Stop&quot;). Tormented with guilt, Pink places himself on trial before his inner judge, who orders him to &quot;tear down the wall&quot; as punishment for his actions (&quot;The Trial&quot;). This is the opening of Pink to the outside world (&quot;Outside the Wall&quot;).

The album turns full circle with its closing words &quot;Isn&#x27;t this where...&quot;, the first words of the phrase that begins the album, &quot;...we came in?&quot;, with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters&#x27; theme, and that the existential crisis at the heart of the album will never truly end.

== Production ==
=== Recording ===
&quot;The Wall&quot; was recorded in several locations. Super Bear Studios in France was used between January and July 1979, and Waters recorded his vocals at the nearby Studio Miraval. Michael Kamen supervised the orchestral arrangements at CBS Studios in New York in September. Over the next two months the band used Cherokee Studios, Producers Workshop and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. A plan to work with the Beach Boys at the Sundance Productions studio in Los Angeles was cancelled (although Beach Boys member Bruce Johnston does sing backing vocals on &quot;In the Flesh?&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, the side 4 version of &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot;).

James Guthrie, recommended by previous Floyd collaborator Alan Parsons, arrived early in the production process. He replaced engineer Brian Humphries, who was emotionally drained by his five years with the band. Guthrie was hired as a co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin&#x27;s role: &quot;I saw myself as a hot young &quot;producer&quot; ... When we arrived, I think we both felt we&#x27;d been booked to do the same job.&quot; The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin became an intermediary between Waters and the rest of the band.

As Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for &quot;The Wall,&quot; the band upgraded much of its equipment, and by March another set of demos was complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6 April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As non-residents they would pay no UK taxes during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the Greek Islands. Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near Nice. Gilmour and Wright were both familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded solo albums there. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters&#x27;s villa near Vence, while Ezrin stayed in Nice.

Ezrin&#x27;s poor punctuality caused problems with the tight schedule dictated by Waters. Mason found Ezrin&#x27;s behaviour &quot;erratic&quot;, but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for &quot;tongue-in-cheek resentment&quot;. Ezrin&#x27;s share of the royalties was less than the rest of the band and he viewed Waters as a bully, especially when Waters mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share. Ezrin later said he had had marital problems and was not &quot;in the best shape emotionally&quot;.
More problems became apparent when Waters&#x27;s relationship with Wright broke down. The band were rarely in the studio together. Ezrin and Guthrie spliced Mason&#x27;s previously recorded drum tracks together, and Guthrie worked with Waters and Gilmour during the day, returning at night to record Wright&#x27;s contributions. Wright, worried about the effect that the introduction of Ezrin would have on band relationships, was keen to have a producer&#x27;s credit on the album. Their albums since &quot;More&quot; (1969) had credited production to &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;.

Waters agreed to a trial period with Wright producing, after which he was to be given a producer&#x27;s credit, but after a few weeks he and Ezrin expressed dissatisfaction with Wright&#x27;s methods. A confrontation with Ezrin led to Wright working only at nights. Gilmour also expressed his annoyance, complaining that Wright&#x27;s lack of input was &quot;driving us all mad&quot;. Ezrin later reflected: &quot;it sometimes felt that Roger was setting him up to fail. Rick gets performance anxiety. You have to leave him alone to freeform, to create ...&quot;

Wright was troubled by a failing marriage and the onset of depression, exacerbated by his non-residency. While the other band members brought their children, Wright&#x27;s children were older and could not join as they were attending school; he said he missed them &quot;terribly&quot;. The band&#x27;s holidays were booked for August, after which they were to reconvene at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, but Columbia offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album. Waters increased the band&#x27;s workload accordingly, booking time at the nearby Studio Miraval. He also suggested recording in Los Angeles ten days earlier than agreed, and hiring another keyboardist to work alongside Wright, whose keyboard parts had not yet been recorded. Wright refused to cut short his family holiday in Rhodes.

Accounts of Wright&#x27;s subsequent departure from the band differ. In his autobiography, &quot;Inside Out&quot;, Mason says that Waters called the band&#x27;s manager, Steve O&#x27;Rourke, who was travelling to the US on the &quot;QE2&quot;, and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album. In another version recorded by a later historian of the band, Waters called O&#x27;Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements, to which Wright responded: &quot;Tell Roger to fuck off&quot;. Wright denied this, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Mason later wrote that Waters was &quot;stunned and furious&quot;, and felt that Wright was not doing enough.

Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learnt of Waters&#x27;s ultimatum, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him about his minimal contributions. Waters insisted that Wright leave, or he would refuse to release &quot;The Wall&quot;. Several days later, worried about their financial situation and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press. Although his name did not appear on some editions of the album (it does appear on the UK gatefold sleeve), he was employed as a session musician on the band&#x27;s subsequent tour.

By August 1979, the running order was largely complete. Wright completed his duties at Cherokee Studios aided by session musicians Peter Wood and Fred Mandel, and Jeff Porcaro played drums in Mason&#x27;s stead on &quot;Mother&quot;. Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his debut solo album, &quot;Nick Mason&#x27;s Fictitious Sports&quot;. In advance of its release, technical constraints led to some changes to the running order and content of &quot;The Wall&quot;, with &quot;What Shall We Do Now?&quot; replaced by the similar but shorter &quot;Empty Spaces&quot;, and &quot;Hey You&quot; being moved from the end of side three to the beginning. With the November 1979 deadline approaching, the band left the inner sleeves of the album unchanged.

=== Instrumentation ===
Mason&#x27;s early drum sessions were performed in an open space on the top floor of Britannia Row Studios. The 16-track recordings from these sessions were mixed down and copied onto a 24-track master, as guide tracks for the rest of the band to play to. This gave the engineers greater flexibility, but also improved the audio quality of the mix, as the original 16-track drum recordings were synced to the 24-track master and the duplicated guide tracks removed. Ezrin later related the band&#x27;s alarm at this method of working – they apparently viewed the erasure of material from the 24-track master as &quot;witchcraft&quot;.

While at Super Bear studios, Waters agreed to Ezrin&#x27;s suggestion that several tracks, including &quot;Nobody Home&quot;, &quot;The Trial&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, should have an orchestral accompaniment. Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with David Bowie, was booked to oversee these arrangements, which were performed by musicians from the New York Philharmonic and New York Symphony Orchestras, and a choir from the New York City Opera. Their sessions were recorded at CBS Studios in New York without Pink Floyd present. Kamen eventually met the band once recording was complete.
&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; has its origins in Gilmour&#x27;s debut solo album, and was the source of much argument between Waters and Gilmour. Ezrin claimed that the song initially started life as &quot;Roger&#x27;s record, about Roger, for Roger&quot;, but he thought that it needed further work. Waters changed the key of the verse and added more lyrics to the chorus, and Gilmour added extra bars for the line &quot;I have become comfortably numb&quot;. Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;stripped-down and harder&quot; recording was not to Waters&#x27;s liking; Waters preferred Ezrin&#x27;s &quot;grander Technicolor, orchestral version&quot;. Following a major argument in a North Hollywood restaurant, the two compromised; the song&#x27;s body included the orchestral arrangement, with Gilmour&#x27;s second and final guitar solo standing alone.

=== Sound design ===
Ezrin and Waters oversaw the capture of the album&#x27;s sound effects. Waters recorded the phone call used on the original demo for &quot;Young Lust&quot;, but neglected to inform its recipient, Mason, who assumed it was a prank call and angrily hung up. A real telephone operator was also an unwitting participant. The call references Waters&#x27; viewpoint of his bitter 1975 divorce from first wife Judy. Waters also recorded ambient sounds along Hollywood Boulevard by hanging a microphone from a studio window. Engineer Phil Taylor recorded some of the screeching tyre noises on &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; from a studio car park, and a television set being destroyed was used on &quot;One of My Turns&quot;. At Britannia Row Studios, Nick Griffiths recorded the smashing of crockery for the same song. Television broadcasts were used, and one actor, recognising his voice, accepted a financial settlement from the group in lieu of legal action against them.

The maniacal schoolmaster was voiced by Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie&#x27;s voice. Backing vocals were performed by a range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot; was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Beach Boys touring musician Toni Tennille.

Ezrin&#x27;s suggestion to release &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot; as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters opposed releasing a single, but became receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie&#x27;s mix. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic, saying: &quot;I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – &#x27;We don&#x27;t need no education, we don&#x27;t need no thought control ...&#x27; I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids.&quot;

Griffiths first recorded small groups of pupils and then invited more, telling them to affect a Cockney accent and shout rather than sing. He multitracked the voices, making the groups sound larger, before sending his recordings back to Los Angeles. The result delighted Waters, and the song was released as a single, becoming a Christmas number one. There was some controversy when the British press reported that the children had not been paid for their efforts; they were eventually given copies of the album, and the school received a £1,000 donation (£ in contemporary value).

== Artwork and packaging ==
The album&#x27;s cover art is one of Pink Floyd&#x27;s most minimal – a white brick wall and no text. Waters had a falling out with Hipgnosis designer Storm Thorgerson a few years earlier when Thorgerson had included the cover of &quot;Animals&quot; in his book &quot;The Work of Hipgnosis: &#x27;Walk Away René&quot;&#x27;. &quot;The Wall&quot; is therefore the first album cover of the band since &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; not to be created by the design group.

Issues of the album included the lettering of the artist name and album title by cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, either as a sticker on sleeve wrapping or printed onto the cover itself, in either black or red. Scarfe, who had previously created animations for the band&#x27;s &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour, also created the LP&#x27;s inside sleeve art and labels of both vinyl records of the album, showing the eponymous wall in various stages of construction, accompanied by characters from the story.

The drawings were translated into dolls for &quot;The Wall&quot; Tour, as well as into Scarfe&#x27;s animated segments shown during the tour and the film based on the album. It is notable that the stadium drawn in the inner sleeve highly resembles the Montreal Olympic Stadium where the album&#x27;s concept happens to find its origin. It seems plausible that the artist was inspired by the stadium&#x27;s appearance in 1977 and its inclined tower which was completed only at a third of its projected (and present) height, reminiscent of the many &quot;towers&quot; pictured in the artist&#x27;s stadium.

== Release and reception ==

When the completed album was played for an assembled group of executives at Columbia&#x27;s headquarters in California, several were reportedly unimpressed by what they heard. Matters had not been helped when Columbia Records offered Waters smaller publishing rights on the grounds that &quot;The Wall&quot; was a double album, a position he did not accept. When one executive offered to settle the dispute with a coin toss, Waters asked why he should gamble on something he owned. He eventually prevailed. The record company&#x27;s concerns were alleviated when &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part 2&quot; reached number one in the UK, US, Norway, Portugal, West Germany and South Africa. It was certified platinum in the UK in December 1979, and platinum in the US three months later. In Germany, the album reached the one million sales mark within three months of its release. In Canada, the album had sold 830,000 copies by January 1981.

&quot;The Wall&quot; was released in the UK and in the US on 30 November 1979. Coinciding with its release, Waters was interviewed by veteran DJ Tommy Vance, who played the album in its entirety on BBC Radio 1. Critical reception of the album upon release was mixed. Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in February 1980, Kurt Loder hailed it as &quot;a stunning synthesis of Waters&#x27;s by now familiar thematic obsessions&quot; that &quot;leaps to life with a relentless lyrical rage that&#x27;s clearly genuine and, in its painstaking particularity, ultimately horrifying.&quot;

By contrast, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau regarded it as &quot;a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic&quot; backed by &quot;kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments&quot;, adding in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that its worldview is &quot;self-indulgent&quot; and &quot;presents the self-pity of its rich, famous and decidedly post-adolescent protagonist as a species of heroism&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; declared, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s brilliant or terrible, but I find it utterly compelling.&quot;

The album topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for 15 weeks, selling over a million copies in its first two months of sales and in 1999, it was certified 23× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time in the US, having sold over 19 million copies worldwide between 1979 and 1990. &quot;The Wall&quot; is Pink Floyd&#x27;s second-best selling album after 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

Engineer James Guthrie&#x27;s efforts were rewarded in 1980 with a Grammy award for Best Engineered Recording (non-classical), and the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 87 on its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list in 2003, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, although this was updated to 129 with the list&#x27;s 2020 revision. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;The Wall&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

&quot;The Wall&quot;, said Billy Corgan at his induction of the Floyd into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, was &quot;at my tender age of fourteen… too creepy, too intense, too nihilistic. And, of course, these are all the things that I believe in now… But at twenty-eight years old, it&#x27;s one of the bravest records I&#x27;ve ever heard. And I really can&#x27;t point to anything else that&#x27;s ever summed up everything that&#x27;s fucked up about life; everything that&#x27;s fucked up about rock. It takes on politics, hero worship, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and our desires to connect with the universe, all in one fell swoop. It really, truly, is an amazing testament to how far they were willing to go to reach the outer limits of what&#x27;s important.&quot;

&quot;&quot;The Wall&quot; is stupefyingly good,&quot; Waters declared in 1992. &quot;Christ, what a brilliant idea that was. It holds together so well… And of course Dave&#x27;s musical influence on that was considerable. Despite what has happened between us since then, I still have great respect for him as a guitarist.&quot;

== Reissues ==
A remastered CD was released by Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs in 1989, this version and all following CD reissues had the &quot;Pink Floyd The Wall&quot; text printed directly onto the cover, rather than a sticker (as it was on vinyl copies). Another remastered CD was included in the band&#x27;s 1992 box set Shine On remastered by Guthrie and Doug Sax. The remaster was released as a two-disc standalone in the UK and in Europe in 1994. The remastered CD would be released in 1997 for the world excluding Europe using a new 1994 remaster which was done for the short lived Mini Disc format. The China version of the album omits &quot;Young Lust&quot;, but retains a composition credit for Waters/Gilmour in the booklet. The album was reissued in three versions as part of the &quot;Why Pink Floyd...?&quot; campaign, which featured a massive restoration of the band&#x27;s catalogue with remastering by producer James Guthrie. In 2011, a &quot;Discovery&quot; edition, featuring the remastered version with no extras; and in 2012, both the &quot;Experience&quot; edition, which adds a bonus disc of unreleased material and other supplementary items, and the &quot;Immersion&quot; edition, a seven-disc collection that also adds video materials. On both the &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot; editions, the text on the cover changed from black to red, meanwhile the &quot;Immersion&quot; edition featured new artwork altogether. The album was reissued under the Pink Floyd Records label on 26 August 2016 along with &quot;The Division Bell&quot;. Vinyl copies of the 2016 reissue featured the plain cover with the black text once again printed onto a sticker, while CD copies continued to feature the red text from the &quot;Discovery&quot; version.

== Tour ==
&quot;The Wall Tour&quot; opened at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on 7 February 1980. Touring continued throughout 1980 and 1981 in New York, London, and Dortmund, Germany. In comparison to previous tours, the audiences were much smaller (Waters&#x27; having tired of large inattentive crowds).

By this time, Pink Floyd concerts had garnered a reputation for spectacle, which The Wall tour built upon. Most famously, as the band played, a wall of 340 cardboard bricks was gradually constructed between them and the audience. Gerald Scarfe was employed to produce a series of animations to be projected onto the wall. At his London studio, he employed a team of 40 animators to create Pink&#x27;s nightmarish visions, many of which were re-used in the film version of The Wall.

Unbeknownst to the audience, at the beginning of each show the real Pink Floyd would not actually be the ones performing. Instead, a &quot;surrogate band&quot; played, wearing hyper-realistic face masks of each of the real members. At the end of the opening number (&quot;In the Flesh?&quot;), the surrogates would freeze in place, and lights would reveal the real band behind them. The surrogates would then later re-appear without the masks as backing musicians.

Pyrotechnics were also involved. Most prominently, towards the beginning of each performance, a model Stuka aeroplane was flown over the audience, crashing and exploding as it hit the wall. This stunt caused a mishap during the first night of the tour, when it set the stage curtains on fire. The stadium had to be evacuated, but following the revelation of the surrogate band, Waters had difficulty convincing the audience that the fire was not also part of the performance. No serious injuries occurred.

Throughout the show, three characters were realised as giant inflatables looming over the stage – Pink&#x27;s schoolmaster, his mother, and his wife. During &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, an inflatable pig also floated over the audience (a carryover from prior tours), this time sporting a crossed hammers logo to match the uniforms of the band and stage crew.

Unlike prior tours, The Wall required precise timing and staging (allowing for little improvisation). For &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, while Waters sang his opening verse, Gilmour waited in darkness at the top of the wall, standing on a flight case on casters, held steady by a technician, both precariously balanced atop a hydraulic platform. On cue, bright blue and white lights would suddenly illuminate him. At the very end of each concert, the wall would be dramatically torn down, controlled carefully by tipping mechanisms in order to prevent the front rows of the audience from being harmed.

Along with the songs on the album, the tour featured an instrumental medley, &quot;The Last Few Bricks&quot;, played before &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot; to allow the construction crew to complete the wall. &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; was also replaced by a longer version of the track, &quot;What Shall We Do Now?&quot;.

During the tour, band relationships dropped to an all-time low; at one point, they stayed in four Winnebagos parked in a circle with the doors facing away from the centre. Waters, however, used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue, and stayed in separate hotels from the rest of the band. Ultimately, Wright, returning as a salaried musician, was the only member of the band to profit from the tour, which lost about £400,000.

== Adaptations ==

A film adaptation, &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot;, was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in July 1982. It was written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, with Bob Geldof as Pink. It used Scarfe&#x27;s animation alongside actors, with little conventional dialogue. A modified soundtrack was created for some of the film&#x27;s songs.

On 21 July 1990, Waters and producer Tony Hollingsworth created &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot;, staged for charity at a site once occupied by part of the Berlin Wall. The concert included several artists and celebrities popular at the time, including Scorpions, Cyndi Lauper, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Joni Mitchell, Ute Lemper, Tim Curry, Van Morrison, Bryan Adams, and Thomas Dolby among others. The concert was broadcast on television in 52 countries, and was later released as a video and album at the end of that same year. The band omitted the song &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; and instead played &quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot;, a song from Roger Waters&#x27; 1987 solo album Radio K.A.O.S. In 2003, the album was remastered and for the first time, the video was released on DVD.

In 2000, Pink Floyd released &quot;Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81&quot;, which contains portions of various live shows from the Wall Tour, but mainly the shows in the Earls Court in London. In 2012, it was remastered and released on The Wall &quot;Immersion&quot; Box-Set as an extra.

Beginning in 2010 and with dates lasting into 2013, Waters performed the album worldwide on his tour, &quot;The Wall Live&quot;. This had a much wider wall, updated higher quality projected content and leading-edge projection technology. Gilmour and Mason played at one show in London at The O2 Arena. A film of the live concert, &quot;Roger Waters: The Wall&quot;, was released in 2015.

In 2016, Waters adapted &quot;The Wall&quot; into an opera, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall: The Opera&quot; with contemporary classical composer Julien Bilodeau. It premiered at Opéra de Montréal in March 2017, and was produced by Cincinnati Opera in July 2018. It is orchestrated for a score of eight soloists, 48 chorus members, and a standard 70-piece operatic orchestra.

In 2018, a tribute album &quot;The Wall [Redux]&quot; was released, with individual artists covering the entire album. This included Melvins&#x27; version of &quot;In The Flesh?&quot;, Pallbearer covering &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, former Screaming Trees&#x27; singer Mark Lanegan covering &quot;Nobody Home&quot; and Church of the Cosmic Skull reworking &quot;The Trial&quot;.

On 19 September 2019, Channel Awesome&#x27;s internet series, &quot;Nostalgia Critic&quot;, released a music video review of the album called &quot;Nostalgia Critic&#x27;s The Wall&quot;, featuring Corey Taylor and Rob Scallon. The album and video received overwhelmingly poor reviews from viewers and critics.

<text>Thomas Bayes ( , ; 7 April 1761) was an English statistician, philosopher and Presbyterian minister who is known for formulating a specific case of the theorem that bears his name: Bayes&#x27; theorem.

Bayes never published what would become his most famous accomplishment; his notes were edited and published posthumously by Richard Price.

== Biography ==

Thomas Bayes was the son of London Presbyterian minister Joshua Bayes, and was possibly born in Hertfordshire. He came from a prominent nonconformist family from Sheffield. In 1719, he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh to study logic and theology. On his return around 1722, he assisted his father at the latter&#x27;s chapel in London before moving to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, around 1734. There he was minister of the Mount Sion Chapel, until 1752.

He is known to have published two works in his lifetime, one theological and one mathematical:

#&quot;Divine Benevolence, or an Attempt to Prove That the Principal End of the Divine Providence and Government is the Happiness of His Creatures&quot; (1731)
#&quot;An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst&quot; (published anonymously in 1736), in which he defended the logical foundation of Isaac Newton&#x27;s calculus (&quot;fluxions&quot;) against the criticism by George Berkeley, a bishop and noted philosopher, the author of &quot;The Analyst&quot;

Bayes was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1742. His nomination letter was signed by Philip Stanhope, Martin Folkes, James Burrow, Cromwell Mortimer, and John Eames. It is speculated that he was accepted by the society on the strength of the &quot;Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions&quot;, as he is not known to have published any other mathematical work during his lifetime.

In his later years he took a deep interest in probability. Historian Stephen Stigler thinks that Bayes became interested in the subject while reviewing a work written in 1755 by Thomas Simpson, but George Alfred Barnard thinks he learned mathematics and probability from a book by Abraham de Moivre. Others speculate he was motivated to rebut David Hume&#x27;s argument against believing in miracles on the evidence of testimony in &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. His work and findings on probability theory were passed in manuscript form to his friend Richard Price after his death.
By 1755, he was ill, and by 1761, he had died in Tunbridge Wells. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground in Moorgate, London, where many nonconformists lie.

In 2018, the University of Edinburgh opened a £45 million research centre connected to its informatics department named after its alumnus, Bayes. 

In April 2021, it was announced that Cass Business School, whose City of London campus is on Bunhill Row, was to be renamed after Bayes.

== Bayes&#x27; theorem ==
Bayes&#x27;s solution to a problem of inverse probability was presented in &quot;An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&quot;, which was read to the Royal Society in 1763 after Bayes&#x27;s death. Richard Price shepherded the work through this presentation and its publication in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot; the following year. This was an argument for using a uniform prior distribution for a binomial parameter and not merely a general postulate. This essay gives the following theorem (stated here in present-day terminology).
 Suppose a quantity &quot;R&quot; is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Suppose each of &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is equal to either 1 or 0 and the conditional probability that any of them is equal to 1, given the value of &quot;R&quot;, is &quot;R&quot;. Suppose they are conditionally independent given the value of &quot;R&quot;. Then the conditional probability distribution of &quot;R&quot;, given the values of &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, is
: formula_1
Thus, for example,
: formula_2

This is a special case of the Bayes&#x27; theorem.

In the first decades of the eighteenth century, many problems concerning the probability of certain events, given specified conditions, were solved. For example: given a specified number of white and black balls in an urn, what is the probability of drawing a black ball? Or the converse: given that one or more balls has been drawn, what can be said about the number of white and black balls in the urn? These are sometimes called &quot;inverse probability&quot; problems.

Bayes&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; contains his solution to a similar problem posed by Abraham de Moivre, author of &quot;The Doctrine of Chances&quot; (1718).

In addition, a paper by Bayes on asymptotic series was published posthumously.

== Bayesianism ==
Bayesian probability is the name given to several related interpretations of probability as an amount of epistemic confidence – the strength of beliefs, hypotheses etc. – rather than a frequency. This allows the application of probability to all sorts of propositions rather than just ones that come with a reference class. &quot;Bayesian&quot; has been used in this sense since about 1950. Since its rebirth in the 1950s, advancements in computing technology have allowed scientists from many disciplines to pair traditional Bayesian statistics with random walk techniques. The use of the Bayes theorem has been extended in science and in other fields.

Bayes himself might not have embraced the broad interpretation now called Bayesian, which was in fact pioneered and popularised by Pierre-Simon Laplace; it is difficult to assess Bayes&#x27;s philosophical views on probability, since his essay does not go into questions of interpretation. There, Bayes defines &quot;probability&quot; of an event as &quot;the ratio between the value at which an expectation depending on the happening of the event ought to be computed, and the value of the thing expected upon its happening&quot; (Definition 5). In modern utility theory, the same definition would result by rearranging the definition of expected utility (the probability of an event times the payoff received in case of that event – including the special cases of buying risk for small amounts or buying security for big amounts) to solve for the probability. As Stigler points out, this is a subjective definition, and does not require repeated events; however, it does require that the event in question be observable, for otherwise it could never be said to have &quot;happened&quot;. Stigler argues that Bayes intended his results in a more limited way than modern Bayesians. Given Bayes&#x27;s definition of probability, his result concerning the parameter of a binomial distribution makes sense only to the extent that one can bet on its observable consequences.

The philosophy of Bayesian statistics is at the core of almost every modern estimation approach that includes conditioned probabilities, such as sequential estimation, probabilistic machine learning techniques, risk assessment, simultaneous localization and mapping, regularization or information theory. The rigorous axiomatic framework for probability theory as a whole, however, was developed 200 years later during the early and middle 20th century, starting with insightful results in ergodic theory by Plancherel in 1913.

<text>Nonconformists were Protestant Christians who did not &quot;conform&quot; to the governance and usages of the established church in England, and in Wales until 1914, the Church of England.

Use of the term &quot;Nonconformist&quot; in England and Wales was precipitated after the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660, when the Act of Uniformity 1662 renewed opposition to reforms within the established church. By the late 19th century the term specifically included other Reformed Christians (English Presbyterians and Congregationalists), plus the Baptists, Brethren, Methodists, and Quakers. English Dissenters, such as the Puritans, who violated the Act of Uniformity 1558 – typically by practising radical, sometimes separatist, dissent – were retrospectively labelled as Nonconformists. In Ireland, the comparable term until the Church of Ireland&#x27;s disestablishment in 1869 was Dissenter (the term earlier used in England), commonly referring to Irish Presbyterians who dissented from the approved Anglican communion. 

By law and social custom, Nonconformists were restricted from many spheres of public life – not least, from access to public office, civil service careers, or degrees at university – and were referred to as suffering from civil disabilities. In England and Wales in the late 19th century the new terms &quot;free church&quot; and &quot;Free churchman&quot; (or &quot;Free church person&quot;) started to replace Nonconformist or Dissenter.

One influential Nonconformist minister was Matthew Henry, who beginning in 1710 published his multi-volume biblical commentary that is still used and available in the 21st century. Isaac Watts is an equally recognised Nonconformist minister whose hymns are still sung by Christians worldwide.

The term is used in a broader sense to refer to Christians who are not communicants of a majority national church, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden.

==England==
===Origins===
The Act of Uniformity 1662 required churchmen to use all rites and ceremonies as prescribed in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. It also required episcopal ordination of all ministers of the Church of England—a pronouncement most odious to the Puritans, the faction of the church which had come to dominance during the English Civil War and the Interregnum. Consequently, nearly 2,000 clergymen were &quot;ejected&quot; from the established church for refusing to comply with the provisions of the act, an event referred to as the Great Ejection. The Great Ejection created an abiding public consciousness of nonconformity.

Thereafter, a Nonconformist was any English subject belonging to a non-Anglican church or a non-Christian religion. More broadly, any person who advocated religious liberty was typically called out as Nonconformist. The strict religious tests embodied in the laws of the Clarendon Code and other penal laws excluded a substantial section of English society from public affairs and benefits, including certification of university degrees, for well more than a century and a half. Culturally, in England and Wales, discrimination against Nonconformists endured even longer.

Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Calvinists, other &quot;reformed&quot; groups and less organised sects were identified as Nonconformists at the time of the 1662 Act of Uniformity. Following the act, other groups, including Methodists, Unitarians, Quakers, Plymouth Brethren, and the English Moravians were officially labelled as Nonconformists as they became organised.

The term &quot;dissenter&quot; came into particular use after the Act of Toleration 1689, which exempted those Nonconformists who had taken oaths of allegiance from being penalised for certain acts, such as for non-attendance at Church of England services.

A census of religion in 1851 revealed Nonconformists made up about half the number of people who attended church services on Sundays. In the larger manufacturing areas, Nonconformists clearly outnumbered members of the Church of England.

===Trends within Nonconformism===

Nonconformists in the 18th and 19th century claimed a devotion to hard work, temperance, frugality, and upward mobility, with which historians today largely agree. A major Unitarian magazine, the &quot;Christian Monthly Repository&quot; asserted in 1827:

====Women====

The emerging middle-class norm was for women to be excluded from the public sphere—the domain of politics, paid work, commerce and public speaking. Instead, it was considered that women should dominate in the realm of domestic life, focused on care of the family, the husband, the children, the household, religion, and moral behaviour. Religiosity was in the female sphere, and the Nonconformist churches offered new roles that women eagerly entered. They taught Sunday school, visited the poor and sick, distributed tracts, engaged in fundraising, supported missionaries, led Methodist class meetings, prayed with other women, and a few were allowed to preach to mixed audiences.

===Politics===
====Disabilities removed====
Parliament had imposed a series of disabilities on Nonconformists that prevented them from holding most public offices, that required them to pay local taxes to the Anglican church, be married by Anglican ministers, and be denied attendance at Oxford or degrees at Cambridge. Dissenters demanded removal of political and civil disabilities that applied to them (especially those in the Test and Corporation Acts). The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828. The Test Act 1673 made it illegal for anyone not receiving communion in the Church of England to hold office under the crown. The Corporation Act 1661 did likewise for offices in municipal government. Although the Test and Corporation Acts remained on the statute-book, in practice they were not enforced against Protestant nonconformists due to the passage of various Indemnity Acts, in particular the Indemnity Act 1727, which relieved Nonconformists from the requirements in the Test Act 1673 and the Corporation Act 1661 that public office holders must have taken the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper in an Anglican church. In 1732, Nonconformists in the City of London created an association, the Dissenting Deputies to secure repeal of the Test and Corporation acts. The Deputies became a sophisticated pressure group, and worked with liberal Whigs to achieve repeal in 1828. It was a major achievement for an outside group, but the Dissenters were not finished.

Next on the agenda was the matter of church rates, which were local taxes at the parish level for the support of the parish church building in England and Wales. Only buildings of the established church received the tax money. Civil disobedience was attempted but was met with seizure of personal property and even imprisonment. The compulsory factor was finally abolished in 1868 by William Ewart Gladstone, and payment was made voluntary. While Gladstone was a moralistic evangelical inside the Church of England, he had strong support in the Nonconformist community. The marriage question was settled by Marriage Act 1836 which allowed local government registrars to handle marriages. Nonconformist ministers in their own chapels were allowed to marry couples if a registrar was present. Also in 1836, civil registration of births, deaths and marriages was taken from the hands of local parish officials and given to local government registrars. Burial of the dead was a more troubling problem, for urban chapels rarely had graveyards, and sought to use the traditional graveyards controlled by the established church. The Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880 finally allowed this.

Oxford University required students seeking admission to submit to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Cambridge University required that for a diploma. The two ancient universities opposed giving a charter to the new London University in the 1830s, because it had no such restriction. London University, nevertheless, was established in 1836, and by the 1850s Oxford dropped its restrictions. In 1871 Gladstone sponsored legislation that provided full access to degrees and fellowships. The Scottish universities never had restrictions.

====Impact on politics====

Since 1660, Dissenters, later Nonconformists, have played a major role in English politics. In a political context, historians distinguish between two categories of Dissenters, in addition to the evangelical element in the Church of England. &quot;Old Dissenters&quot;, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, included Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Presbyterians outside Scotland. &quot;New Dissenters&quot; emerged in the 18th century and were mainly Methodists. The &quot;Nonconformist conscience&quot; was their moral sensibility which they tried to implement in British politics. The &quot;Nonconformist conscience&quot; of the Old group emphasised religious freedom and equality, pursuit of justice, and opposition to discrimination, compulsion, and coercion. The New Dissenters (and also the Anglican evangelicals) stressed personal morality issues, including sexuality, family values, and temperance. Both factions were politically active, but until mid-19th century the Old group supported mostly Whigs and Liberals in politics, while the New, like most Anglicans, generally supported Conservatives. By the late 19th century, the New Dissenters had mostly switched to the Liberal Party. The result was a merging of the two groups, strengthening their great weight as a political pressure group.

After the Test and Corporation Acts were repealed in 1828, all the Nonconformists elected to Parliament were Liberals. Relatively few MPs were Dissenters. However the Dissenters were major voting bloc in many areas, such as the East Midlands. They were very well organised and highly motivated and largely won over the Whigs and Liberals to their cause. Gladstone brought the majority of Dissenters around to support for Home Rule for Ireland, putting the dissenting Protestants in league with the Irish Catholics in an otherwise unlikely alliance. The Nonconformist conscience was also repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy. In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket. (In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales.) Many of the first MPs elected for the Labour Party in the 1900s were also nonconformists.

Nonconformists were angered by the Education Act 1902, which provided for the support of denominational schools from taxes. The elected local school boards that they largely controlled were abolished and replaced by county-level local education authorities that were usually controlled by Anglicans. Worst of all the hated Anglican schools would now receive funding from local taxes that everyone had to pay. One tactic was to refuse to pay local taxes. John Clifford formed the National Passive Resistance Committee. By 1904 over 37,000 summonses for unpaid school taxes were issued, with thousands having their property seized and 80 protesters going to prison. It operated for another decade but had no impact on the school system. The education issue played a major role in the Liberal victory in the 1906 general election, as Dissenter Conservatives punished their old party and voted Liberal. After 1906, a Liberal attempt to modify the law was blocked by the Conservative-dominated House of Lords; after 1911 when the Lords had been stripped of its veto over legislation, the issue was no longer of high enough priority to produce Liberal action.

By 1914 the linkage between the Nonconformists and Liberal Party was weakening, as secularisation reduced the strength of Dissent in English political life.

===Today===
Today, Protestant churches independent of the Anglican Church of England or the Presbyterian Church of Scotland are often called &quot;free churches&quot;, meaning they are &quot;free&quot; from state control. This term is used interchangeably with &quot;Nonconformist&quot;.

The steady pace of secularisation picked up faster and faster during the 20th century, until only pockets of nonconformist religiosity remained in England.

==Wales==
Nonconformity in Wales can be traced to the Welsh Methodist revival; Wales effectively had become a Nonconformist country by the mid-19th century; nonconformist chapel attendance significantly outnumbered Anglican church attendance. They were based in the fast-growing upwardly mobile urban middle class.
The influence of Nonconformism in the early part of the 20th century, boosted by the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, led to the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales in 1920 and the formation of the Church in Wales.

==Scandinavia==
In other countries, the term Nonconformist is used in a broader sense to refer to Christians who are not communicants of a majority national church, such as the Lutheran Church of Sweden. The largest Nonconformist church in Sweden, the Uniting Church in Sweden, was formed by merging the Baptist Union of Sweden, the United Methodist Church, and the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden.

<text>Isabella II (, María Isabel Luisa de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias; 10 October 1830 – 9 April 1904) was Queen of Spain from 1833 until her deposition in 1868. She is the only queen regnant in the history of unified Spain.

Isabella was the elder daughter of King Ferdinand VII and Queen Maria Christina. Shortly before Isabella&#x27;s birth, her father issued the Pragmatic Sanction to revert the Salic Law and ensure the succession of his firstborn daughter, due to his lack of a son. She came to the throne a month before her third birthday, but her succession was disputed by her uncle Infante Carlos (founder of the Carlist movement), whose refusal to recognize a female sovereign led to the Carlist Wars. Under the regency of her mother, Spain transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy, adopting the Royal Statute of 1834 and Constitution of 1837.

Isabella was declared of age and began her personal rule in 1843. Her effective reign was a period marked by palace intrigues, back-stairs and antechamber influences, barracks conspiracies, and military &quot;pronunciamientos&quot;. Her marriage to Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz was an unhappy one, and her personal conduct as well as rumours of affairs damaged her reputation. In September 1868, a naval mutiny began in Cadiz, marking the beginning of the Glorious Revolution. The defeat of her forces by Marshal Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre, brought her reign to an end, and she went into exile in France. In 1870, she formally abdicated the Spanish throne in favour of her son, Alfonso. In 1874, the First Spanish Republic was overthrown in a coup. The Bourbon monarchy was restored, and Alfonso ascended the throne as King Alfonso XII. Isabella returned to Spain two years later but soon again left for France, where she resided until her death in 1904.

== Birth and regencies ==

Isabella was born in the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1830, the eldest daughter of King Ferdinand VII of Spain, and of his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies. She was entrusted to the royal governess María del Carmen Machín y Ortiz de Zárate. Queen Maria Christina became regent on 29 September 1833, when her three-year-old daughter Isabella was proclaimed sovereign following the death of Ferdinand VII.

Isabella succeeded to the throne because Ferdinand VII had induced the Cortes Generales to help him set aside the Salic law, introduced by the Bourbons in the early 18th century, and to reestablish the older succession law of Spain. The first pretender to the throne, Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, fought for seven years during Isabella&#x27;s minority to dispute her title (see First Carlist War). The supporters of Carlos and his descendants were known as Carlists, and the fight over the succession was the subject of a number of Carlist Wars in the 19th century.

Isabella&#x27;s reign was maintained only through the support of the army. The Cortes and the Moderate Liberals and Progressives reestablished constitutional and parliamentary government, dissolved the religious orders and confiscated their property (including that of the Jesuits), and tried to restore order to Spain&#x27;s finances. After the Carlist war, the regent, Maria Christina, resigned to make way for Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara, the most successful and most popular Isabelline general. Espartero, a Progressive, remained regent for only two years.

Her minority saw tensions with the United States over the &quot;Amistad&quot; affair.

Baldomero Espartero was deposed in 1843 by a military and political &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; led by Generals Leopoldo O&#x27;Donnell and Ramón María Narváez. They formed a cabinet, presided over by Joaquín María López y López. This government induced the Cortes to declare Isabella of age at 13. Between the beginning of her reign in 1833, and the abdication of Margrethe II of Denmark in 2024, at any given time, there was a queen regnant in Europe.

==Reign as an adult==
=== Beginnings ===

Isabella was declared of age and swore the 1837 Constitution on 10 November 1843, age thirteen. Despite the alleged parliamentary supremacy, in practice, the &quot;double trust&quot; led to Isabella having a role in the making and toppling of governments, undermining the progressives. The uneasy alliance between moderates and progressives that had toppled Espartero in July 1843 was already disintegrating by the time of the coming of age of the queen. Following a brief government led by progressive Salustiano de Olózaga, the moderates elected their candidate, Pedro José Pidal, to the presidency of the Cortes. After the subsequent decision to dissolve the hostile Cortes by Olózaga on 28 November, rumours about an alleged forcing of the queen to sign the royal decree spread. As a result, Olózaga was prosecuted, removed from political office, and forced to exile, with the Progressive Party already being beheaded, in what was the starting point of their growing disaffection from the Isabelline monarchy.

=== Moderate decade ===
Dominated by the figure of Marshal Narváez, the &quot;Espadón&quot; (&quot;Big Sword&quot;) of Loja, the so-called &quot;Moderate decade&quot; began in 1844. The constitutional reforms devised by Narváez moved away from the 1837 Constitution by rejecting national sovereignty and reinforcing the power of the monarch, to the point of a &quot;co-sovereignty&quot; between the Cortes and the Queen.
On 10 October 1846, the Moderate Party made their sixteen-year-old queen marry her double-first cousin Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz (1822–1902), the same day that her younger sister, Infanta Luisa Fernanda, married Antoine d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Montpensier. Disgusted by her marriage, Isabella reportedly commented later to one of her intimates: &quot;what shall I tell you about a man whom I saw wearing more lace than I was wearing on our wedding night?&quot;

The marriages suited France and Louis Philippe, King of the French, who as a result bitterly quarrelled with Britain. However, the marriages were not happy; persistent rumour had it that few if any of Isabella&#x27;s children were fathered by her King Consort, rumoured to be a homosexual. The Carlist party asserted that the heir-apparent to the throne, who later became Alfonso XII, had been fathered by a captain of the guard, Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans.

In 1847, a major scandal took place when Isabella, age seventeen, publicly showed her love for General Serrano and her willingness to divorce from her husband Francisco de Asís; though Narváez and Isabella&#x27;s mother Maria Christina solved the problem posed to the monarchical institution—Serrano was shifted away from the capital to the post of Captain General of Granada in 1848—, the deterioration of the public image of the queen increased from then on. Following the near-revolution of 1848, Narváez was authorised to rule as dictator to repress insurrectionary attempts up until 1849.

In late 1851, Isabella II gave birth to her first daughter and heir presumptive, who was baptised on 21 December as María Isabel Francisca de Asís. Historians have attributed the Princess of Asturias&#x27; biological parenthood to José Ruiz de Arana, &quot;Gentilhombre de cámara&quot;.
On 2 February 1852, Isabella and the Royal Guard were caught by surprise while the Queen was leaving the Chapel of the Royal Palace intending to go with her parade to the Basilica of Nuestra Señora de Atocha: , an ordained priest and liberal activist approached the queen giving the impression of wanting to deliver her a message, and stabbed her. The impact was reduced by the gold embroidery of her dress and by the baleen stays of her corset, and what was intended to be a stab wound to the chest only resulted in a minor incision at the right side of the belly. Merino, quickly seized by the halberdiers of the Royal Guard (with help from the dukes of Osuna and Tamames, the Marquis of Alcañices and the Count of Pinohermoso), was removed from sacerdocy and executed by &quot;garrote&quot;.
Under the government of the Count of San Luis (whose ascension to premiership had been solely founded on the support from the networks of the royal court), the system was in a critical state by June 1854. On 28 June 1854 a military &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; intending to force the queen to oust the government of the Count of San Luis, featuring Leopoldo O&#x27;Donnell (a &quot;puritan&quot; moderate), took place in Vicálvaro, the so-called &quot;Vicalvarada&quot;. The military coup (rather dominated by the moderates themselves) had a mixed result and O&#x27;Donnell (advised by Ángel Fernández de los Ríos and Antonio Cánovas del Castillo) proceeded then to seek for civilian support, promising new reforms not in the initial plans in order to appeal to progressives, by bringing a &quot;liberal regeneration&quot;, as proclaimed in the &quot;Manifesto of Manzanares&quot;, drafted by Antonio Cánovas del Castillo and issued on 7 July 1854.

Days later, the situation was followed by a full-scale people&#x27;s revolution, with revolutionary juntas organised on 17 July in Madrid, and barricades erected in the streets. With the prospect of a civil war on the horizon, Isabella was advised to appoint General Espartero (who enjoyed charisma and popular support) as prime minister. This renewed ascension of Espartero marked the beginning of the &quot;bienio progresista&quot;.

=== Progressive biennium ===
Espartero entered the capital of Spain on 28 July, and proceeded to separate again Isabella from the influence of María Christina. In any case, though Isabella accepted advice from María Christina, she was not characterised for displaying a profound filial love towards her mother.

By virtue of a royal decree, the port of Iloílo in then-Spanish Philippines was opened to world trade on 29 September 1855, mainly to export sugar and other products to America, Australia and Europe.

A Liberal Constitution (&quot;the Unborn One&quot;) was drafted in 1856, yet it was never enacted as the counter-revolutionary coup by O&#x27;Donnell seized power.

=== Later reign ===

On 28 November 1857, Isabella II gave birth to a male heir, who was baptised on 7 December 1857 as Alfonso Francisco de Asís Fernando Pío Juan María Gregorio y Pelagio. Assumed by historians to be the biological son of , the toddler, who replaced infanta Isabella as Prince of Asturias upon his birth, was known under the moniker , in reference to the rumours about his presumed biological parenthood. Isabella II showed a special affection for the child, greater than that shown to her daughters.

The later part of her reign saw a war against Morocco (1859–1860), which ended in a treaty advantageous for Spain and cession of some Moroccan territory, the Spanish retaking of Santo Domingo (1861–1865), and the fruitless Chincha Islands War (1865–1866) against Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.

==== Revolution and coup ====
In August 1866, exiled forces comprising both elements from the Democratic and the Progressive Party met secretly in Belgium and subscribed to the under the initiative of Marshal Prim, seeking to topple Isabella. On 7 July 1868, Isabella banished her sister and brother-in-law from Spain, as they were linked to a conspiracy against the Crown in connivance with generals from the Liberal Union.

Since the late summer, Isabella II had been enjoying her traditional holiday on the coast at Lekeitio, Biscay. The royal entourage moved to San Sebastián to hold a meeting with Napoleon III and Eugenia de Montijo, scheduled for 18 September, but it did not take place, as the French royals did not arrive in time and it was subsequently aborted.

On that day, a &quot;pronunciamento&quot; took place in Cádiz. Led by Marshal Prim and the Admiral Topete (himself an unconditional follower of the Duke of Montpensier), it marked the beginning of the Glorious Revolution. The Democratic Party provided the insurrection with popular support, making it transcend the nature of a simple military statement into an actual revolution.

Factors for the revolution included the weariness of the moderates alienated by the Crown and the progressives barely having even the chance to rule. Both developed a with the Isabelline monarchy. Other factors were the personal behaviour of the queen, the corruption, the abortion of the possibility of political reform and the economic crisis alienating the bourgeoisie. Historians looking at social roots for the revolution highlight that peasantry, small bourgeoisie, and the proletariat formed an alternative to bourgeoisie proper, articulated through the progressive and federal republican forces.

By September 1868 Isabella was a repudiated monarch, and, during the early stages of the revolution, instances of political iconoclasm carried out by the masses took place, leading to the destruction of many symbols and emblems of the Bourbon dynasty, a &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot;.

The defeat of the Isabelline forces commanded by Manuel Pavía y Lacy by the revolutionary forces led by Marshal Serrano at the 28 September 1868 Battle of Alcolea led to the definitive demise of Isabella II&#x27;s 35-year reign. In the light of the news, Isabella and her entourage left San Sebastián and went to exile taking a train to Biarritz (France) on 30 September. As Isabella entered France after her abdication, her train passed a group of homecoming exiles who taunted her with cries of &quot;Down with the Bourbons!&quot;, &quot;Long Live Liberty!&quot; and &quot;Long Live the Republic!&quot;.

Primleader of the liberal progressiveswas received in a festive mood by the Madrilenian people at his arrival in the capital in early October. He pronounced his famous speech of the &quot;three nevers&quot; directed against the Bourbons. At the Puerta del Sol, he gave a highly symbolic hug to Serrano, the leader of the revolutionary forces triumphant in the bridge of Alcolea.

== Life after ousting ==
Following the crossing of the French–Spanish border by train on 30 September, the Queen and King spent 5 weeks in the Château de Pau organising their Parisian future. They went to the French capital and arrived on 8 November, settling in the Rue de Rivoli 172. Isabella was forced to renounce to her dynastic rights in Paris in favour of her son Alfonso on 25 June 1870, officially &quot;freely and spontaneously&quot;. Involving an economic settling, the formal separation between Isabella and Francisco had pended on the passing of the former queen&#x27;s dynastic rights to her son.

Following the election to the Spanish throne of Amadeo of Savoy (second son of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy) in November 1870, Isabella reconciled in 1871 with her brother-in-law, the Duke of Montpensier, who assumed the political management of the family.

The First Spanish Republic that followed Amadeo&#x27;s short reign was overthrown by a military coup started in Sagunto by General Arsenio Martínez Campos on 29 December 1874 that proclaimed the restoration of the monarchy and the Bourbon dynasty in the person of Isabella&#x27;s son Alfonso XII, who landed in Barcelona on 9 January 1875.

After 1875 she lived in a relationship with Ramiro de la Puente y González Nandín, her secretary and chief of staff.

Cánovas del Castillo, the dominant figure of the new regime, became convinced that the figure of Isabella had become an issue for the Crown and wrote her a letter bluntly stating &quot;Your Majesty is not a person, it is a reign, it is a historical time, and what the country needs is another reign, a different time&quot;, hellbent on avoiding the former queen stepping onto the Spanish capital before the proclamation of the new constitution in June 1876.

She returned to Spain in July 1876, stayed in Santander and El Escorial and was only allowed to visit Madrid for barely hours on 13 October. She moved to Seville, where she remained for a longer time and left for France in 1877. Isabella&#x27;s son would marry Mercedes of Orléans (first cousin of Alfonso and daughter of the Dukes of Montpensier) in 1878, only for the latter to die five months after the wedding.

Isabella mostly lived in Paris for the rest of her life, based at the Palacio Castilla. She paid some visits to Seville.

She wrote her testament in Paris in June 1901, making her will to be entombed in El Escorial. Less than a month after passing through a cold categorised as &quot;flu&quot; by the physicians, she died on 9 April 1904, at 8:45 AM. Her corpse was moved from the Palacio Castilla to the Gare d&#x27;Orsay, and arrived to El Escorial on 15 April. The funeral took place on the next day at San Francisco el Grande.

== Issue ==

Isabella had twelve pregnancies, but only five children reached adulthood: 
* Infante Luis Fernando (20 May 1849 – 20 May 1849), stillborn. 
* Infante Fernando Francisco (12 July 1850 – 12 July 1850), died five minutes after his birth. 
* Infanta María Isabel (20 December 1851 – 22 April 1931): married her parents&#x27; first cousin Prince Gaetan, Count of Girgenti. 
* Infanta Maria Cristina (5 January 1854 - 7 January 1854). 
* Infanta Margarita (23 September 1855 - 24 September 1855), she was born prematurely. 
* Infante Francisco de Asis Fernando (21 December 1856 – 21 December 1856), stillborn. 
* Alfonso XII of Spain (28 November 1857 – 25 November 1885) Future King of Spain. 
* Infanta Maria de la Conception (1859 - 21 October 1861). 
* Infanta María del Pilar (4 June 1861 – 5 August 1879).
* Infanta María de la Paz (23 June 1862 – 4 December 1946); married her paternal first cousin Prince Louis Ferdinand of Bavaria. 
* Infanta María Eulalia (12 February 1864 – 8 March 1958); married her maternal first cousin Infante Antonio d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Galliera. 
* Infante Francisco de Asis Leopoldo Maria Enrique (24 January 1866 - 14 February 1866). 

There has been considerable speculation that some or all of Isabella&#x27;s children were not fathered by Francisco de Asís; this has been bolstered by rumours that Francisco de Asís was either homosexual or impotent. Francisco de Asís recognised all of them: he played the offended, proceeding to blackmail the queen to receive money in exchange for keeping his mouth shut. The extortion by her husband would continue and intensify during Isabella&#x27;s exile.

==Sobriquets==
She came to be known by the sobriquets of &quot;the Traditional Queen&quot; (Spanish: &quot;la Reina Castiza&quot;), and &quot;the Queen of Sad Mischance&quot; (Spanish: &quot;la de los Tristes Destinos&quot;).

<text>Lost in Space is an American science fiction television series created and produced by Irwin Allen, which originally aired between 1965 and 1968 on CBS. Lightly dramatic, sometimes comedic in tone, the series was inspired by the 1812 Johann David Wyss novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson.&quot; The series follows the adventures of the Robinsons, a pioneering family of space colonists who struggle to survive in the depths of space. The show ran for 83 episodes over three seasons. The first season comprised 29 one-hour episodes, filmed in black and white. The 29th episode however had a few minutes of color at the end. Seasons 2 and 3 were shot entirely in color.

==Series synopsis==
===Overview===
On October 16, 1997, amidst overpopulation on Earth, the United States is gearing up to colonize space. The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot;, a futuristic saucer-shaped spacecraft, stands on its launchpad undergoing final preparations. Its mission is to take a single family on a five-and-a-half-year journey to an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri.

The Robinson family consists of a married couple, John (Guy Williams) and Maureen (June Lockhart), and their three children: Judy (Marta Kristen); Penny (Angela Cartwright); and Will (Bill Mumy). John is a professor. The family is accompanied by U.S. Space Corps Major Donald West (Mark Goddard). The Robinsons and Major West are to be cryogenically frozen for the voyage, and they are set to be unfrozen when the spacecraft approaches its destination.

Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), a physician working for &quot;Alpha Control&quot;, which is conducting the launch, is revealed to be a saboteur working on behalf of an unnamed nation or organization, with which he communicated under the code name &quot;Aeolis-14-Umbra&quot;. After disposing of a guard who catches him aboard the spacecraft, Smith reprograms the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot;″s B-9 environmental control robot (Bob May, voiced by Dick Tufeld) to destroy critical systems on the spaceship eight hours after launch. To his horror, however, Smith becomes trapped aboard, and after launch his extra weight throws the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; off course, causing it to encounter asteroids. This, plus the robot&#x27;s rampage, causes the ship to prematurely engage its hyperdrive, and the expedition becomes hopelessly lost in the infinite depths of outer space.

===Season 1===
The first season begins as the Robinson family and their pilot are about to set out from Earth for a planet circling the star Alpha Centauri. Dr. Smith saves himself from the post-launch crisis of his own making by prematurely reviving the crew from suspended animation. The ship survives, but the damage caused by Smith&#x27;s earlier sabotage of the robot leaves the crew lost in space. The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; crash-lands on an alien world, later identified by Will as Priplanus, where they spend the rest of the season and survive a host of adventures. Smith remains with the crew and acts as a source of comedic cowardice and villainy, exploiting the eternally forgiving nature of Professor Robinson.

===Season 2===
At the start of the second season (from this point on filmed in color), the repaired &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; launches into space once more, to escape the destruction of Priplanus following a series of cataclysmic earthquakes. The Robinsons crash-land on a strange new world, to become planet-bound again for another season.

===Season 3===
In the third season, a format change was introduced. In this season, the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; travels freely in space in seven episodes, visiting a planet but leaving at the end, or encountering an adventure in space. They visit new worlds in several episodes, with both crash and controlled landings, as the family attempts to either return to Earth or else at least reach their original destination in the Alpha Centauri system. A newly introduced &quot;Space Pod&quot; provides a means of transportation between the ship and passing planets, allowing for various escapades. This season had a different set of opening credits and a new theme tune, which had been composed by John Williams as part of the show&#x27;s new direction.

==Cast and characters==
===Main cast===

* Dr. (Professor) John Robinson (Guy Williams) – The expedition commander and the father of the Robinson children. Robinson is an astrophysicist who also specializes in applied planetary geology.
* Dr. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) – A biochemist who is often seen preparing meals, tending the garden, and helping with light construction while adding a voice of compassion.
* Major Don West (Mark Goddard) – The pilot of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; whose military training and discipline is relied upon by the castaways.
* Judy Robinson (Marta Kristen) – The eldest of the Robinson children, she is in her early twenties and shares a mutual attraction with Major West.
* Penny Robinson (Angela Cartwright) – The middle child. An imaginative 11-year-old who loves animals and classical music. Early in the series, she acquires a chimpanzee-like alien pet which she names Debbie and is usually referred to as the &quot;bloop&quot; for the sound it makes.
* Will Robinson (Bill Mumy) – The youngest child. A precocious 9-year-old in the first season, he is a child prodigy in electronics and computer technology.
* Dr. (Colonel) Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) – Acting as Alpha Control&#x27;s flight surgeon in the first episode, he is later referred to as a &quot;doctor of intergalactic environmental psychology&quot;, an expert in cybernetics and an enemy agent. Smith&#x27;s predominantly selfish actions, schemes, and laziness frequently endanger the expedition, but his role assumes less sinister overtones in later parts of the series. Young Will and the Robot are often foils to Dr. Smith&#x27;s outlandish behavior.
* The Robot (Bob May, voiced by Dick Tufeld) – A B-9 model, class YM-3, environmental control robot who has no given name. The machine was endowed with superhuman strength and futuristic weaponry, and additionally often displays human emotions. The Robot was designed by Robert Kinoshita.

===Guest stars===
During its three-season run, a number of actors made guest appearances:

Jonathan Harris, although a permanent cast member, was listed in the opening credits as a &quot;special guest star&quot; in every episode of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

==Production==
===Props===
Props and monsters were regularly recycled from other Irwin Allen shows. A sea monster outfit that had been featured on &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; might get a spray paint job for its &quot;Lost in Space&quot; appearance, while space monster costumes were reused on &quot;Voyage&quot; as sea monsters. The clear round plastic pen holder used as a control surface in the episode &quot;The Derelict&quot; turned up regularly throughout the show&#x27;s entire run both as primary controls to activate alien machinery (or open doors or cages), and as background set dressing; some primary controls were seen used in episodes such as Season 1&#x27;s &quot;The Keeper (Parts 1 and 2)&quot;, &quot;His Majesty Smith&quot;, and Season 3&#x27;s &quot;A Day At The Zoo&quot;, and &quot;The Promised Planet&quot;.

Computers and tape drives were often depicted in various episodes using the Burroughs 205 commercial products. Spacecraft models were also routinely re-used. The forbidding derelict ship from season 1 was redressed to become the &quot;Vera Castle&quot; in season 3. The fuel barge from season 2 became a space lighthouse in season 3. The derelict ship was used again in season 3, with a simple color change. Likewise the alien pursuer&#x27;s ship in &quot;The Sky Pirate&quot;, was lifted from the 1958 film &quot;War of the Satellites&quot;, and was re-used in the episode &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;.

Filming took place at 20th Century Fox Corp. studios and stages, Los Angeles. For season 1 &amp; 2 Stage 11 (Jupiter 2/Campsite) and Stage 6 (lower deck, planet set and cave) were used. Due to budget cuts in 3rd season the Jupiter 2, campsite and lower deck were shifted to Stage 17 (opened in 1966). Stage 11 was used for planet exterior, cave and various alien planet sets.

===Character development===
Despite being credited as a &quot;special guest star&quot; in every episode, Smith became the pivotal character of the series. The show&#x27;s writers expected Smith to be a temporary villain who would only appear in early episodes. Harris, on the other hand, hoped to stay longer on the show, but found his character to be boring, and feared it would also quickly bore viewers. Harris &quot;began rewriting his lines and redefining his character&quot;, by playing Smith in an attention-getting, flamboyant style, and ad-libbing his scenes with ripe, colorful dialogue. By the end of the first season, the character was established as a self-serving coward whose moral haughtiness and contrasting deceitfulness, along with his alliterative insults largely aimed at the Robot, were staple elements of each episode. 

===Catchphrases===
&quot;Lost in Space&quot; is remembered for the Robot&#x27;s oft-repeated lines such as &quot;Warning! Warning!&quot; and &quot;It does not compute&quot;. Smith&#x27;s frequent put-downs of the Robot were also popular. Harris was proud to talk about how he used to lie in bed at night dreaming them up for use on the show. &quot;You Bubble-headed Booby!&quot;, &quot; You Cowardly Clump!&quot;, &quot;You Tin-Plated Traitor!&quot;, &quot;You Cackling Cacophony&quot;, &quot;You Blithering Blatherskyte&quot;, and &quot;Traitorous Transistorized Toad&quot; are but a few, alongside his signature lines: &quot;Oh, the pain ... the pain!&quot; and &quot;Never fear, Smith is here!&quot; One of Harris&#x27;s last roles was providing the voice of the praying mantis Manny in Disney&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, who also says the line &quot;Oh, the pain ... the pain!&quot; near the end of the film.

The catchphrase &quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot; originates with the series, when the Robot warns young Will Robinson about impending threats. It was also used as the slogan of the 1998 film, whose official website had the address &quot;www.dangerwillrobinson.com&quot;.

===Legal issues===
In 1962, Gold Key comics, a division of Western Publishing Company, began publishing a series of comic books under the title &quot;Space Family Robinson&quot;. The story was largely inspired by &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; but with a space-age twist. The film and television rights to the comic book were then purchased by noted television writer Hilda Bohem (&quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;), who created a treatment under the title &quot;Space Family 3000&quot;.

Intended as a follow-up to his first successful television venture, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, Allen quickly sold his concept for a television series to CBS. Concerned about confusion with the Gold Key comic book, CBS requested that Allen come up with a new title. Nevertheless, Hilda Bohem filed a claim against Allen and CBS Television shortly before the series premiered in 1965.

An agreement was reached with Gold Key which allowed them to subtitle their comic &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

Additional legal challenges appeared in 1995, when Prelude Pictures announced its intention to turn &quot;Lost in Space&quot; into a motion picture.

===Series history===
The show was conceptualized in 1965 with the filming of an unaired pilot episode titled &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;. The plot of the pilot episode followed the mission of a ship called the &quot;Gemini 12,&quot; which was to take a single family on a 98-year journey to an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri. The &quot;Gemini 12&quot; was pushed off course due to an encounter with an asteroid, and the story centered on the adventures of the Robinson family, depicting them as a happy crew without internal conflicts. While many storylines in the later series focused primarily on Dr. Zachary Smith, a stowaway and saboteur played by Jonathan Harris, he was absent from the unaired pilot. His character was added after the series was commissioned for production. The pilot episode was first aired on television during a 1997 retrospective.

CBS bought the series, turning down &quot;Star Trek&quot; in favor of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. Before the first episode was filmed, the characters Smith and the Robot were added, and the spaceship, originally named &quot;Gemini 12&quot;, was renamed the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; and redesigned. For budget considerations, a good part of the footage included in the pilot episode was reused, being carefully worked into the early series episodes.

The first season emphasized the daily adventures of the Robinsons. The first half of season 1 dealt with the Robinson party trekking around the rocky terrain and stormy inland oceans of Priplanus in the Chariot to avoid extreme temperatures. However, the format of the show later changed to a &quot;Monster of the Week&quot; style, where stories were loosely based on fantasy and fairy tales.

In January 1966, ABC scheduled &quot;Batman&quot; in the same time slot as &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. Season 2 imitated &quot;Batman&quot;″s campy humor to compete against that show&#x27;s enormous success. Bright outfits, over-the-top action, and outrageous villains came to the fore in outlandish stories. Stories giving all characters focus were sacrificed in favor of a growing emphasis on Smith, Will, and the Robot. According to Bill Mumy, Mark Goddard and Guy Williams both disliked the shift away from serious science fiction.

The third season had more adventure, but also episodes like &quot;The Great Vegetable Rebellion&quot; with actor Stanley Adams as Tybo, the talking carrot. With the reputation of being &quot;the most insipid and bizarre episode in television history&quot;, Kristen recalled that Goddard complained that &quot;seven years of Stanislavski method acting had led to his talking to a carrot.&quot; The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; was now functional and traveled from planet to planet, but the episodes still tended to be whimsical and to emphasize humor, including fanciful space hippies, more pirates, offbeat intergalactic zoos, ice princesses, and a galactic beauty pageant.

During the first two seasons, episodes concluded in a &quot;live action freeze&quot; anticipating the following week, with a cliff-hanger caption, &quot;To be continued next week! Same time, same channel!&quot; For the third season, each episode&#x27;s conclusion was immediately followed by a vocal &quot;teaser&quot; from the Robot (Dick Tufeld), advising viewers to &quot;Stay tuned for scenes from next week&#x27;s exciting adventure!&quot;. Scenes from the next episode were then presented, followed by the closing credits. There was little continuity between each episode, except for the aspiration of reaching a large goal, &quot;i.e.&quot;, enough fuel to travel from planet to planet.

After cancellation, the show was successful in reruns and in syndication for many years, appearing on the USA Network (in the mid-to-late 1980s) and on FX, Syfy, ALN, MeTV and Hulu.

==Episodes==

==Cancellation==
In early 1968, after the final third-season episode &quot;Junkyard in Space&quot; completed filming, the cast and crew were informally led to believe the series had been renewed for a fourth season. Allen had ordered new scripts for the coming season. A few weeks later, however, CBS announced the complete list of returning television series for the 1968–69 season, and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; was not included. CBS executives failed to offer any reasons why &quot;Lost in Space&quot; was canceled.

The most likely reason the show was canceled was its increasingly high cost. The cost per episode had grown from $130,980 during the first season to $164,788 during the third season, and the actors&#x27; salaries nearly doubled during that time. Further, the interior of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; was the most expensive set for a television show at the time, at a cost of $350,000. 20th Century Fox had also recently incurred huge budget overruns for the film &quot;Cleopatra,&quot; which are believed to have caused budget cuts. Allen claimed the series could not continue with a reduced budget. During a negotiating conference regarding the series direction for the fourth season with CBS chief executive Bill Paley, Allen became furious when told the budget would be reduced up to 15% of the Season Three budget.

The &quot;Lost in Space Forever&quot; DVD cites declining ratings and escalating costs as the reasons for cancellation. Irwin Allen admitted that the Season 3 ratings showed an increasing percentage of children among the total viewers, meaning a drop in the &quot;quality audience&quot; that advertisers preferred.

Guy Williams had grown embittered with his role on the show as it became increasingly &quot;campy&quot; in Seasons 2 and 3 while centering squarely on the antics of Harris&#x27;s Dr. Smith character. Williams retired from acting and relocated to Argentina after the end of the series.

==Documentaries==
===&quot;The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen&quot;===
In 1995, Kevin Burns produced a documentary showcasing the career of Irwin Allen, hosted by Bill Mumy and June Lockhart in a recreation of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; exterior set. Mumy and Lockhart utilize the &quot;Celestial Department Store Ordering Machine&quot; as a temporal conduit to show information and clips on Allen&#x27;s history. Clips from Allen&#x27;s various productions as well as pilots for his unproduced series were presented along with new interviews with cast members of Allen&#x27;s shows. Mumy and Lockhart complete their presentation and enter the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot;, following which Jonathan Harris appears in character as Smith and instructs the Robot once again to destroy the ship as per his original instructions &quot;... and this time get it right, you bubble-headed booby&quot;.

===&quot;Lost in Space Forever&quot;===
In 1998, to promote the film version of Lost in Space, Burns produced a television special about the series which was hosted by John Larroquette and the Robot (performed by actor Bob May and voice actor Dick Tufeld). The special was hosted within a recreation of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; upper deck set. The program ends with Laroquette mockingly pressing a button on the Amulet from &quot;The Galaxy Gift&quot; episode, disappearing and being replaced by Mumy and Harris who play an older Will Robinson and an older Zachary Smith. They attempt to return to Earth one more time but they find out that they are &quot;Lost in Space ... Forever!&quot;

&quot;Lost in Space&quot; showcased a variety of transportation methods in the series. The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; is a two-deck, nuclear powered flying saucer spacecraft. The version seen in the series was depicted with a lower level and landing legs.

On the lower level were the atomic motors, which use a fictional substance called &quot;deutronium&quot; for fuel. The ship&#x27;s living quarters feature Murphy beds, a galley, a laboratory, and the robot&#x27;s &quot;magnetic lock&quot;. On the upper level were the guidance control system and suspended animation &quot;freezing tubes&quot; necessary for non-relativistic interstellar travel. The two levels were connected by both an electronic glide tube elevator and a fixed ladder. The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; explicitly had artificial gravity. Entrances and exits to the ship were via the main airlock on the upper level, or via the landing struts from the lower deck, and, according to one season 2 episode, a back door. The spacecraft was also intended to serve as home to the Robinsons once it had landed on the destination planet orbiting Alpha Centauri.

&quot;The Chariot&quot; was an all-terrain, amphibious tracked vehicle that the crew used for ground transport when they were on a planet. The Chariot existed in a disassembled state during flight, to be re-assembled once on the ground. The Chariot was actually an operational cannibalized version of a Thiokol Snowcat Spryte, with a Ford 170-cubic-inch (3 L) inline-6, 101 horsepower engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission including reverse. Test footage filmed of the Chariot for the first season of the series can be seen on YouTube.

Most of the Chariot&#x27;s body panels were clear, including the roof and its dome-shaped &quot;gun hatch&quot;. Both a roof rack for luggage and roof mounted &quot;solar batteries&quot; were accessible by exterior fixed ladders on either side of the vehicle. The vehicle had dual headlights and dual auxiliary area lights beneath the front and rear bumpers. The roof also had swivel-mounted, interior controllable spotlights located near each front corner, with a small parabolic antenna mounted between them. The Chariot had six bucket seats (three rows of two seats) for passengers. The interior featured retractable metallized fabric curtains for privacy, a seismograph, a scanner with infrared capability, a radio transceiver, a public address system, and a rifle rack that held four laser rifles vertically near the inside of the left rear corner body panel.

A jet pack, specifically a Bell Rocket Belt, was used occasionally by Professor Robinson or Major West.

The &quot;Space Pod&quot; was a small spacecraft first shown in the third and final season, which was modeled on the Apollo Lunar Module. The Pod was used to travel from its bay in the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; to destinations either on a nearby planet or in space, and the pod apparently had artificial gravity and an auto-return mechanism.

===Other technology===
For self-defense, the crew of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; had an arsenal of laser guns at their disposal, including sling-carried rifles and holstered pistols. The first season&#x27;s personal issue laser gun was a film prop modified from a toy semi-automatic pistol made by Remco. The crew also employed a force field around the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; for protection while on alien planets. The force shield generator was able to protect the campsite and in one season 3 episode was able to shield the entire planet.

For communication, the crew used small transceivers to communicate with each other, the Chariot, and the ship. In &quot;The Raft&quot;, Will improvised several miniature rockoons in an attempt to send an interstellar &quot;message in a bottle&quot; distress signal. In season 2 a set of relay stations was built to further extend communications while planet-bound.

Their environmental control Robot B-9 ran air and soil tests, and was able to discharge strong electrostatic charges from his claws, detect threats with his scanner and could produce a defensive smoke screen. The Robot could detect faint smells and could both understand speech and speak in its own right. The Robot claimed the ability to read human minds by translating emitted thought waves back into words.

The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; had some unexplained advanced technology that simplified or did away with mundane tasks. The &quot;auto-matic laundry&quot; took seconds to clean, iron, fold, and package clothes in clear plastic bags. Similarly, the &quot;dishwasher&quot; would clean, wash, and dry dishes in just seconds.

Technology in the show reflected contemporary real-world developments. Silver reflective space blankets, a then new invention developed by NASA in 1964, were used in the episode titled &quot;The Hungry Sea&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Monster Plants&quot;. The crew&#x27;s spacesuits were made with aluminum-coated fabric, like NASA&#x27;s Mercury spacesuits, and had Velcro fasteners, which NASA first used during the Apollo program (1961–1972).

While the crew normally grew a hydroponic garden on a planet as an intermediate step before cultivating the soil of a planet, they also had &quot;protein pills&quot;, which was a complete nutritional substitute for normal foods, in cases of emergency.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
Some members within the science-fiction community have pointed to &quot;Lost in Space&quot; as an example of early television&#x27;s perceived poor record at producing science-fiction. The series&#x27; deliberate fantasy elements were perhaps overlooked as it drew comparisons to its supposed rival, &quot;Star Trek&quot;. However, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; was a mild ratings success, unlike &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which received relatively poor ratings during its original network television run. The more cerebral &quot;Star Trek&quot; never averaged higher than 52nd in the ratings during its three seasons, while &quot;Lost in Space&quot; finished season one 35th in the Nielsen ratings, season two in 44th place, and the third and final season in 53rd place.

&quot;Lost in Space&quot; also ranked third as one of the top five favorite new shows for the 1965–1966 season in a viewer TVQ poll. The other top contenders were &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;F Troop&quot;. &quot;Lost in Space&quot; was the favorite show of John F. Kennedy, Jr. while he was growing up in the 1960s.

===Awards===
&quot;Lost in Space&quot; received a 1966 Emmy Award nomination for Cinematography-Special Photographic Effects but did not win, and again in 1968 for Achievement in Visual Arts &amp; Makeup but did not win. In 2005, it was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best DVD Retro Television Release, but did not win. In 2008, TVLand nominated and awarded the series for Awesomest Robot.

==Music==
===Theme music===
The open and closing theme music was written by John Williams, listed in the credits as &quot;Johnny Williams&quot;. The original pilot and much of Season One reused Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s eerie score from the classic sci-fi film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951).

Season three featured a new score which was considered more exciting and faster tempo. The opening music was accompanied by live action shots of the cast, featuring a pumped-up countdown from seven to one to launch each week&#x27;s episode.

===Incidental music===
Much of the incidental music in the series was written by Williams who scored four episodes. These scores helped Williams gain credibility as a composer. Other notable film and television composers who worked on the music for &quot;Lost in Space&quot; included Alexander Courage, who contributed six scores to the series.

===Discography===

There have been a number of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; soundtrack CDs released.

==Syndication==
&quot;Lost in Space&quot; was picked up for syndication in most major U.S. markets. The program did not have the staying power throughout the 1970s of its rival &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Part of the reason for the show&#x27;s obsolescence was that the first season of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; was in black-and-white, while a majority of American households at the time had a color television receiver. By 1975, many markets began removing &quot;Lost in Space&quot; from daily schedules or moving it to less desirable time slots. The series experienced a revival when Ted Turner acquired it for his growing WTBS &quot;superstation&quot; in 1979. Viewer response was positive, and it became a WTBS mainstay for the next five years.

The OTT video streaming platform Hulu (of which 70% of its service is owned by the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; distributor The Walt Disney Company) has consistently carried the show over the years. The show also airs on the classic television digital broadcast network MeTV as part of their Super Sci-Fi Saturday Night block.

==Remakes==
===Cast comparison===
Notes:
: Cameo, not part of the main cast
: Poses as &quot;Dr. Smith&quot;

=== &quot;Lost in Space: The Epilogue&quot; ===
In 1978, Bill Mumy, Brian Grier &amp; Paul Gordon wrote a spec script for a made for television reunion movie called Lost in Space: The Epilogue. Mumy sent it to the entire cast &amp; CBS who both expressed interest. The project was halted when Irwin Allen refused to even read Mumy&#x27;s sreenplay. Not wanting to hand Lost in Space to anyone else. The project was eventually filmed as a cast table reading for the 50th anniversary blu ray set. Bringing the series to a close by having the characters return to earth.

=== &quot;Lost in Space: The Journey Home&quot; ===
In the early 2000s, Kevin Burns attempted to produce a tv reunion film called Lost in Space: The Journey Home. Focusing on a new group of characters who become lost in space themselves &amp; find The Robinsons cryogenically frozen. It was hoped that the film would be a pilot for a revival focused on the new characters. Jonathan Harris&#x27; death, (which occurred four months before shooting was to begin) halted the project. Though the studio did suggest recasting the role with Christopher Lloyd or John Lithgow.

===&quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998 film)===

In 1998, New Line Cinema produced a film adaptation. The 1998 film includes a number of homages to the original television series. These include cameos and story details from the original TV-series, including:

Additional cameo appearances of actors from the original series were considered, but not included in the film:
* Jonathan Harris was offered a cameo appearance, not as Smith (performed by actor Gary Oldman in the film), but as the Global Sedition leader who hires, then betrays, Smith. Harris turned down the role, reportedly saying, &quot;I play Smith or I don&#x27;t play&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve never played a bit part in my life and I&#x27;m not going to start now!&quot; The role of the Sedition leader was eventually performed by actor Edward Fox. Many years later, Harris appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, mentioning the role offered to him: &quot;Yes, they offered me a part in the new movie; six lines!&quot;
* Bill Mumy was likewise offered a cameo, but turned it down after being told he would not be considered for the part he wanted — the role of the older Will Robinson — because, he was told, that would &quot;confuse the audience.&quot;

The film used a number of ideas familiar to viewers from the original show: Smith reprogramming the robot and its subsequent rampage (&quot;Reluctant Stowaway&quot;), near miss with the Sun (&quot;Wild Adventure&quot;), the derelict spaceship (&quot;The Derelict&quot;), discovery of the Blawp and the crash (&quot;Island in the Sky&quot;) and an attempt to change history by returning to the beginning (&quot;The Time Merchant&quot;). Also a scene-stealing &#x27;Goodnight&#x27; homage to the Waltons was included. Something fans of the original always wanted to see happen was finally realized when Don knocks out an annoyingly complaining Smith at the end of the film, saying, &quot;That felt good!&quot;

===&quot;The Robinsons: Lost in Space&quot; (2004)===
In 2004, a television series titled &quot;The Robinsons: Lost in Space&quot; was developed in the U.S. A pilot for the series was filmed; however, the series was ultimately never produced. The series originally was intended to emulate the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; unaired pilot. The 2004 show did feature the unnamed robot, and an additional older Robinson child named David. Penny, who had been depicted as a preteen in the original series was depicted as an infant in the 2004 remake. The pilot was titled &quot;The Robinsons: Lost in Space&quot; and was commissioned by The WB. The pilot was directed by John Woo and produced by Synthesis Entertainment, Irwin Allen Productions, Twentieth Century Fox Television and Regency Television.

The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; interstellar flying-saucer spacecraft of the original series was depicted as a planet-landing craft, deployed from a larger inter-stellar mothership.

The plot of the series followed John Robinson, a retiring war hero of an alien invasion who had decided to take his family to another colony elsewhere in space. The Robinson&#x27;s ship is attacked and the Robinsons are forced to escape in the small &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; &quot;Space Pod&quot; of the mothership.

The show was not among the network&#x27;s series pickups confirmed later that year. Looking back at the pilot when the 2018 Netflix reboot was aired, Neil Calloway of Flickering Myth said, &quot;you&#x27;re hardly on the edge of your seat.&quot; He continued, &quot;You start to wonder where the $2 million went, and then you question why something directed by John Woo is so pedestrian.&quot;

The producers of the new &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; show bought the show&#x27;s sets. They were redesigned the next year and used for scenes on the Battlestar &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

Dick Tufeld reprised his role as voice of the robot for the third time.

===&quot;Lost in Space&quot; (2018–2021)===

On October 10, 2014, it was announced that Legendary TV was developing a new reboot of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; for Netflix with &quot;Dracula Untold&quot; screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless attached to write. On June 29, 2016, Netflix ordered the series with 10 episodes. The series debuted on Netflix on April 13, 2018. It was renewed for a second season on May 13, 2018, which aired on December 24, 2019. On March 9, 2020, the series was renewed for a third and final season.

The Robot also appears in the series in a modified form.

==In other media==
===Comics===
Before the television series was developed, a comic book named &quot;Space Family Robinson&quot; was published by Gold Key Comics, written by Gaylord Du Bois and illustrated by Dan Spiegle. The comic book series had been loosely based on an 1812 novel by Johann David Wyss, &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. Du Bois became the sole writer of the series once he began chronicling the Robinsons&#x27; adventures with &quot;Peril on Planet Four&quot; in issue #8. Due to a deal worked out with Gold Key, the title of the comic later incorporated the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; sub-title. The comic book featured different characters and a unique H-shaped spacecraft rather than one of a saucer shape.

In 1991, Bill Mumy provided &quot;Alpha Control Guidance&quot; for a &quot;Lost in Space&quot; revival in comic book form &quot;Lost in Space&quot; comic book for Innovation Comics, writing six of the issues. The first officially licensed comic to be based on the TV series, the series was set several years after the show. The kids were now teenagers, and the stories attempted to return the series to its straight adventure roots with one story even explaining the camp / farce episodes of the series as fanciful entries in Penny&#x27;s Space Diary.

Complex adult-themed story concepts were introduced and the story included a love triangle developing between Penny, Judy and Don. The &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; had various interior designs in the first year. The first year had an arc ultimately leading the travelers to Alpha Centauri with Smith contacting his former alien masters along the way. Aeolis 14 Umbra were furious with Smith for not having succeeded in his mission to prevent the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot;, built with technology from a crashed ship of their race, from reaching the star system they had claimed as their own. The year ended with Smith caught out for his traitorous associations and imprisoned in a freezing tube for the &quot;Jupiter&quot;″s final journey to the Promised Planet. Year two was to be Mumy&#x27;s own full season story of a complex adventure following the Robinson&#x27;s arrival at their destination and capture by the Aoleans. Innovation folded in 1993 with the story only halfway through and it wasn&#x27;t until 2005 that Mumy was able to present his story to Lost in Space fandom as a complete graphic novel via Bubblehead Publishing. The theme of an adult Will Robinson was also explored in the film and in the song &quot;The Ballad of Will Robinson&quot; (written and recorded by Mumy; see &quot;Music&quot; below).

In 1998, Dark Horse Comics published a three-part story chronicling the Robinson Clan as depicted in the film.

In 1990, Bill Mumy and Peter David co-wrote &quot;Star Trek: The Return of the Worthy&quot;, a three-part story that was essentially a crossover between &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew encountering a Robinson-like expedition among the stars, though with different characters.

In 2016, American Gothic Press published a six-issue miniseries titled &quot;Irwin Allen&#x27;s Lost in Space, the Lost Adventures&quot;, based on unfilmed scripts from the series. The scripts &quot;The Curious Galactics&quot; and &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; were written by Carey Wilber. The first script was adapted as issues 1 – 3 of the series, with the adapted script written by Holly Interlandi and drawn by Kostas Pantaulas, with Patrick McEvoy doing coloring and covers. The second script was adapted as issues 4 – 6 of the series, again adapted by Interlandi, with McEvoy providing pencil art, coloring and covers.

===Novel===
In 1967, a novel based on the series, with significant changes to the personalities of the characters and the design of the ship, was published by Pyramid Books, and written by Dave Van Arnam and Ted White (as &quot;Ron Archer&quot;). A scene in the book correctly predicts Richard Nixon winning the Presidency after Lyndon Johnson.

===Cartoon===
In the 1972–1973 television season, ABC produced &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;, a weekly collection of 60-minute animated films, pilots and specials from various production companies, such as Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, and Rankin/Bass. Hanna-Barbera Productions contributed animated work based on such television series as &quot;Gidget&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;Tabitha&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;, and &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

The &quot;Lost in Space&quot; episode aired on September 8, 1973. Dr. Smith (voiced by Jonathan Harris) was the only character from the original program to appear in the special, along with the Robot (who was named Robon and employed in flight control rather than a support activity). The spacecraft was launched vertically by rocket, and Smith was a passenger rather than a stowaway and a saboteur (though his greed, selfishness, and cowardice is the same as his live action counterpart). The pilot for the animated &quot;Lost in Space&quot; series was not picked up as a series, and only this episode was produced. This cartoon was included in the Blu-ray release of the entire original television series on September 15, 2015.

===Games===
Two board games were published based on the show. A self titled game was released in 1965 by Milton Bradley Company, and the Lost in Space 3D Action Fun Game in 1966 by Remco.

===Music===
As part of his 1997 album &quot;Dying To Be Heard&quot; (Infinite Visions), Bill Mumy recorded &quot;The Ballad of William Robinson&quot;, in which a now 42-year-old Will Robinson recounts the premise of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, the current state of his family (his father Professor John Robinson has died five years previously) and his despair at &quot;still [being] Lost in Space.&quot; The song can also be found as a track on &quot;Dr. Demento&#x27;s Hits From Outer Space&quot; (Laughs.com - LGH1137, 2002).

==Home media==
20th Century Fox has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1. Several of the releases contain bonus features including interviews, episodic promos, video stills and the original un-aired pilot episode.

All episodes of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; were remastered and released on a Blu-ray disc set on September 15, 2015 (the 50th anniversary of the premiere on the CBS TV Network).

All episodes of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; were reformatted (from the Blu-ray video masters) to 16:9 widescreen and released on a 17 disc DVD set on February 5, 2019.

<doc id="149127" wikidata="Q186256" url="?curid=149127" title="Ferdinand VII">
<text>Ferdinand VII (; 14 October 1784 – 29 September 1833) was King of Spain during the early 19th century. He reigned briefly in 1808 and then again from 1813 to his death in 1833. Before 1813 he was known as &quot;el Deseado&quot; (the Desired), and after, as &quot;el Rey Felón&quot; (the Criminal King).

Born in Madrid at El Escorial, Ferdinand was heir apparent to the Spanish throne in his youth. Following the 1808 Tumult of Aranjuez, he ascended the throne. That year Napoleon overthrew him; he linked his monarchy to counter-revolution and reactionary policies that produced a deep rift in Spain between his forces on the right and liberals on the left. Back in power in December 1813, he re-established the absolutist monarchy and rejected the liberal constitution of 1812. A revolt in 1820 led by Rafael del Riego forced him to restore the constitution, starting the Liberal Triennium, a three-year period of liberal rule. In 1823 the Congress of Verona authorized a successful French intervention, restoring him to absolute power for the second time. He suppressed the liberal press from 1814 to 1833, jailing many of its editors and writers.

Under his rule, Spain lost nearly all of its American possessions, and the country entered into a large-scale civil war upon his death. His political legacy has remained contested since his death; some historians regard him as incompetent, despotic, and short-sighted.

==Early life==

Ferdinand was the eldest surviving son of Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma. Ferdinand was born in the palace of El Escorial near Madrid. In his youth Ferdinand occupied the position of an heir apparent who was excluded from any participation in government by his parents and their favourite advisor and Prime Minister, Manuel Godoy. National discontent with the government produced a rebellion in 1805. In October 1807, Ferdinand was arrested for his complicity in the El Escorial Conspiracy in which the rebels aimed at securing foreign support from the French Emperor Napoleon. When the conspiracy was discovered, Ferdinand submitted to his parents.

==First reign and abdication==

Following a popular riot at Aranjuez Charles IV abdicated in March 1808. Ferdinand ascended the throne and turned to Napoleon for support. He abdicated on 6 May 1808, and thereafter Napoleon kept Ferdinand under guard in France for six years at the Château de Valençay. Historian Charles Oman records that the choice of Valençay was a practical joke by Napoleon on his former foreign minister Talleyrand, the owner of the château, for his lack of interest in Spanish affairs.

While the upper echelons of the Spanish government accepted his abdication and Napoleon&#x27;s choice of his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king of Spain, the Spanish people did not. Uprisings broke out throughout the country, marking the beginning of the Peninsular War. Provincial juntas were established to control regions in opposition to the new French king. After the Battle of Bailén proved that the Spanish could resist the French, the Council of Castile reversed itself and declared null and void the abdications of Bayonne on 11 August 1808. On 24 August, Ferdinand VII was proclaimed king of Spain again, and negotiations between the council and the provincial juntas for the establishment of a Supreme Central Junta were completed. On 14 January 1809 the British government acknowledged Ferdinand VII as king of Spain.

==Second reign==
===Restoration===

Five years later after experiencing serious setbacks on many fronts, Napoleon agreed on 11 December 1813 to acknowledge Ferdinand VII as king of Spain, and signed the Treaty of Valençay so that the king could return to Spain. The Spanish people, blaming the policies of the Francophiles (&quot;afrancesados&quot;) for causing the Napoleonic occupation and the Peninsular War by allying Spain too closely to France, at first welcomed &quot;Fernando&quot;. Ferdinand soon found that in the intervening years a new world had been born of foreign invasion and domestic revolution. In his name Spain fought for its independence and in his name as well had governed Spanish America. Spain was no longer the absolute monarchy he had relinquished six years earlier. Instead he was now asked to rule under the liberal Constitution of 1812. Before being allowed onto Spanish soil, Ferdinand had to guarantee the liberals that he would govern on the basis of the constitution, but only gave lukewarm indications he would do so.

On 24 March the French handed him over to the Spanish Army in Girona, and thus began his procession towards Madrid. During this process and in the following months, he was encouraged by conservatives and the Church hierarchy to reject the constitution. On 4 May he ordered its abolition, and on 10 May had the liberal leaders responsible for the constitution arrested. Ferdinand justified his actions by claiming that the constitution had been made by a Cortes illegally assembled in his absence, without his consent and without the traditional form. (It had met as a unicameral body, instead of in three chambers representing the three estates: the clergy, the nobility and the cities.) Ferdinand initially promised to convene a traditional Cortes, but never did so, thereby reasserting the Bourbon doctrine that sovereign authority resided in his person only.

Meanwhile, the wars of independence had broken out in the Americas, and although many of the republican rebels were divided and royalist sentiment was strong in many areas, the Spanish treasure fleets – carrying tax revenues from the Spanish Empire – were interrupted. Spain was all but bankrupt.

Ferdinand&#x27;s restored autocracy was guided by a small &quot;camarilla&quot; of his favorites, although his government seemed unstable. Whimsical and ferocious by turns, he changed his ministers every few months. &quot;The king,&quot; wrote Friedrich von Gentz in 1814, &quot;himself enters the houses of his prime ministers, arrests them, and hands them over to their cruel enemies;&quot; and again, on 14 January 1815, &quot;the king has so debased himself that he has become no more than the leading police agent and prison warden of his country.&quot;

The king did recognize the efforts of foreign powers on his behalf. As the head of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece, Ferdinand made the Duke of Wellington, head of the British forces on the peninsula, the first Protestant member of the order.

During the aftermath of the Mexican War of Independence, the general of the Army of the Three Guarantees, Agustín de Iturbide, and Jefe Superior Juan O&#x27;Donojú, signed the Treaty of Córdoba, which concluded the war of independence and established the First Mexican Empire. The imperial constitution contemplated that the monarch would be &quot;a Spanish prince,&quot; and Iturbide and O&#x27;Donojú intended to offer the Mexican Imperial Crown to Ferdinand VII himself to rule Mexico in personal union with Spain. However, Ferdinand, refusing to recognize Mexican independence or be bound by a constitution, decreed that the Mexican constitution was &quot;void&quot;, declined the Mexican crown, and stated that no European prince could accede to the Mexican throne. The imperial crown was consequently given to Iturbide himself, but the Mexican Empire collapsed and was replaced by the First Mexican Republic a few years later.

===Revolt===

There were several &quot;pronunciamientos&quot;, or military uprisings, during the king&#x27;s second reign. The first came in in September 1814, three months after the end of the Peninsular War, and was led by General Espoz y Mina in Pamplona. Juan Díaz Porlier revolted at La Coruña in the following year. General Luis Lacy led an uprising in Barcelona in 1817, and General Juan Van Halen did the same in Valencia in 1818. In 1820 Rafael del Riego undertook the most successful &quot;pronunciamiento&quot;, leading to the Trienio Liberal.

In 1820 a revolt broke out in favor of the Constitution of 1812, beginning with a mutiny of the troops under Riego. The king was quickly taken prisoner. Ferdinand had restored the Jesuits upon his return, but now they had become identified with repression and absolutism among the liberals, who attacked them: twenty-five Jesuits were slain in Madrid in 1822. For the rest of the 19th century, liberal political regimes expelled the Jesuits, and authoritarian regimes reinstated them.

Ferdinand VII was an ardent opponent of Freemasonry in Spain, seeing it as a vehicle for liberal revolutions, an enemy of the Spanish Crown and the Catholic faith, subordinated to foreign interests (the Grand Orient of France primarily). After reinstating the Spanish Inquisition and the Jesuits, on 4 May 1814 he publicly declared all Spanish freemasons to be traitors. The same year Pope Pius VII issued a decree against Freemasonry, approved by Ferdinand VII and became an edict of the Spanish Inquisition. Freemasons in high places in Spanish society were arrested and the Masonic Lodges suppressed. Ferdinand blamed Freemasonry for the 1820 coup, the &quot;Trienio Liberal,&quot; as well as for the loss of Spanish colonies in Latin America, with his return to the throne for the so-called &quot;Ominous Decade&quot;, the Anti-Masonic campaign stepped up and members who would not renounce Freemasonry were hanged. He had his police compile reports on Freemasons and former Freemasons active in Spanish society.
In the spring of 1823, the restored Bourbon French King Louis XVIII of France invaded Spain, &quot;invoking the God of St. Louis, for the sake of preserving the throne of Spain to a fellow descendant of Henry IV of France, and of reconciling that fine kingdom with Europe.&quot; In May 1823 the revolutionary party moved Ferdinand to Cádiz, where he continued to make promises of constitutional amendment until he was free.

When Ferdinand was freed after the Battle of Trocadero and the fall of Cádiz, reprisals followed. The Duc d&#x27;Angoulême made known his protest against Ferdinand&#x27;s actions by refusing the Spanish decorations Ferdinand offered him for his military services.

During his last years, Ferdinand&#x27;s political appointments became more stable. The last ten years of his reign (sometimes referred to as the Ominous Decade) saw the restoration of absolutism, the re-establishment of traditional university programs and the suppression of any opposition, both by the Liberal Party and by the reactionary revolt (known as &quot;War of the &quot;Agraviados&quot;&quot;) which broke out in 1827 in Catalonia and other regions.

===Death and succession crisis===
In May 1830, Ferdinand VII published the Pragmatic Sanction, again allowing daughters to succeed to the Spanish throne as well as sons. This decree had originally been approved by the Cortes in 1789, but it had never been officially promulgated. On 10 October 1830, Ferdinand&#x27;s wife gave birth to a daughter, Isabella, who thereupon displaced her uncle, Carlos, in the line of succession. After Ferdinand&#x27;s death, Carlos revolted and said he was the legitimate king. Needing support, Maria Christina, as regent for her daughter, turned to the liberals. She issued a decree of amnesty on 23 October 1833. Liberals who had been in exile returned and dominated Spanish politics for decades, leading to the Carlist Wars.

==Legacy==
Ferdinand VII&#x27;s reign is typically criticized by historians, even in his own country. Historian Stanley G. Payne wrote that Ferdinand was &quot;in many ways the basest king in Spanish history. Cowardly, selfish, grasping, suspicious, and vengeful, D. Fernando seemed almost incapable of any perception of the commonwealth.&quot;

==Marriages==
Ferdinand VII married four times. His first wife died of tuberculosis, the second died in childbirth, and the third died of &quot;a fever&quot;. His fourth wife outlived him by 45 years.

In 1802, he married his first cousin Princess Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily (1784–1806), daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Marie Caroline of Austria. Her two pregnancies in 1804 and 1805 both ended in miscarriages.

In 1816, Ferdinand married his niece Maria Isabel of Portugal (1797–1818), daughter of his older sister Carlota Joaquina and John VI of Portugal. They had a daughter who lived only five months, and a stillborn daughter.

On 20 October 1819, in Madrid, Ferdinand married the daughter of his father&#x27;s first cousin Maximilian, Prince of Saxony and of his mother&#x27;s first cousin Caroline of Parma, Princess Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony (1803–1829). They had no children.

Lastly, on 27 May 1829, Ferdinand married another niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies (1806–1878), daughter of his younger sister Maria Isabella of Spain and of their first cousin Francis I of the Two Sicilies, who was also the brother of Ferdinand&#x27;s first wife. They had two surviving daughters, the older of whom succeeded Ferdinand upon his death.

<doc id="149128" wikidata="Q354534" url="?curid=149128" title="David Suzuki">
<text>David Takayoshi Suzuki (born March 24, 1936) is a Canadian academic, science broadcaster, and environmental activist. Suzuki earned a PhD in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1961, and was a professor in the genetics department at the University of British Columbia from 1963 until his retirement in 2001. Since the mid-1970s, Suzuki has been known for his television and radio series, documentaries and books about nature and the environment. He is best known as host and narrator of the popular and long-running CBC Television science program &quot;The Nature of Things&quot;, seen in over 40 countries. He is also well known for criticizing governments for their lack of action to protect the environment.

A longtime activist to reverse global climate change, Suzuki co-founded the David Suzuki Foundation in 1990, to work &quot;to find ways for society to live in balance with the natural world that does sustain us.&quot; The Foundation&#x27;s priorities are: oceans and sustainable fishing, climate change and clean energy, sustainability, and Suzuki&#x27;s Nature Challenge. The Foundation also works on ways to help protect the oceans from large oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Suzuki has also served as a director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association from 1982 to 1987.

Suzuki was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 2009. His 2011 book, &quot;The Legacy&quot;, won the Nautilus Book Award. He is a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2004, Suzuki ranked fifth on the list of final nominees in a CBC television series that asked viewers to select The Greatest Canadian of all time.

==Early life==
Suzuki has a twin sister named Marcia, as well as two other siblings, Geraldine (now known as Aiko) and Dawn. He was born in 1936 to Setsu Nakamura and Kaoru Carr Suzuki in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his parents were also born. Suzuki&#x27;s maternal and paternal grandparents had immigrated to Canada at the beginning of the 20th century from Hiroshima Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture respectively.

A third-generation Japanese Canadian (&quot;Canadian Sansei&quot;), Suzuki&#x27;s family suffered internment in British Columbia early during the Second World War until after the war ended in 1945. In June 1942, the government sold the Suzuki family&#x27;s dry cleaning business, then interned Suzuki, his mother, and two sisters in a camp at Slocan in the British Columbia Interior. His father had been sent to a labour camp in Solsqua in the Southern Interior region of BC two months earlier. His sister Dawn was born in the internment camp.

After the war, Suzuki&#x27;s family, like other Japanese Canadian families, were forced to move east of the Rockies. They moved around Ontario, from Etobicoke, Leamington, and eventually to London. In interviews, Suzuki has consistently credited his father for having interested him in and sensitized him to nature.

Suzuki attended Mill Street Elementary School and Grade 9 at Leamington District Secondary School before moving to London, Ontario, where he attended London Central Secondary School.

==Academic career==
Suzuki received his Bachelor of Arts degree in biology in 1958 from Amherst College in Massachusetts where he first developed an interest in genetics, and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1961. From 1961 to 1962, Suzuki worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. From 1962 to 1963, he was an assistant professor at the University of Alberta. He was a professor in the genetics department at the University of British Columbia for almost forty years, from 1963 until his retirement in 2001, and has since been professor emeritus at a university research institute.

Early in his research career he studied genetics using the popular model organism &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (fruit flies). To be able to use his initials in naming any new genes he found, he studied dominant temperature-sensitive (DTS) phenotypes. He jokingly noted at a lecture at Johns Hopkins University that the only alternative subject was &quot;(damn) tough skin.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==
Suzuki began in television on January 10, 1971 with the weekly children&#x27;s show &quot;Suzuki on Science&quot;. In 1974, he founded the radio program &quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks&quot;, which he also hosted on CBC AM radio (the forerunner of CBC Radio One) from 1975 to 1979. Throughout the 1970s, he also hosted &quot;Science Magazine&quot;, a weekly program geared towards an adult audience.

From 1979 to 2023, Suzuki hosted &quot;The Nature of Things&quot;, a CBC television series that has aired in nearly fifty countries worldwide. In this program, Suzuki&#x27;s aim is to stimulate interest in the natural world, to point out threats to human well-being and wildlife habitat, and to present alternatives to humanity for achieving a more sustainable society. Suzuki has been a prominent proponent of renewable energy sources and the soft energy path.

Suzuki was the host of the critically acclaimed 1993 PBS series &quot;The Secret of Life&quot;. His 1985 hit series, &quot;A Planet for the Taking&quot;, averaged more than 1.8 million viewers per episode and earned him a United Nations Environment Programme Medal. His perspective in this series is summed up in his statement: &quot;We have both a sense of the importance of the wilderness and space in our culture and an attitude that it is limitless and therefore we needn&#x27;t worry.&quot; He concludes with a call for a major &quot;perceptual shift&quot; in our relationship with nature and the wild.

Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;The Sacred Balance&quot;, a book first published in 1997 and later made into a five-hour mini-series on Canadian public television, was broadcast in 2002. Suzuki is now taking part in an advertisement campaign with the tagline &quot;You have the power&quot;, promoting energy conservation through various household alternatives, such as the use of compact fluorescent lightbulbs.

For the Discovery Channel, Suzuki also produced &quot;Yellowstone to Yukon: The Wildlands Project&quot; in 1997. The conservation-biology based documentary focused on Dave Foreman&#x27;s Wildlands Project, which considers how to create corridors between and buffer zones around large wilderness reserves as a means to preserve biological diversity. Foreman developed this project after leaving Earth First! (which he co-founded) in 1990. The conservation biologists Michael Soulé and Reed Noss were also directly involved.

In October 2022, Suzuki announced his retirement from &quot;The Nature of Things&quot; series in spring 2023.

==Climate change activism==

In February 2008, he urged McGill University students to speak out against politicians who fail to act on climate change, stating, &quot;What I would challenge you to do is to put a lot of effort into trying to see whether there&#x27;s a legal way of throwing our so-called leaders into jail because what they&#x27;re doing is a criminal act.&quot;

Suzuki is unequivocal that climate change is a very real and pressing problem and that an &quot;overwhelming majority of scientists&quot; now agree that human activity is responsible. The David Suzuki Foundation website has a clear statement of this:

The debate is over about whether or not climate change is real. Irrefutable evidence from around the world – including extreme weather events, record temperatures, retreating glaciers, and rising sea levels – all point to the fact climate change is happening now and at rates much faster than previously thought.

The overwhelming majority of scientists who study climate change agree that human activity is responsible for changing the climate. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is one of the largest bodies of international scientists ever assembled to study a scientific issue, involving more than 2,500 scientists from more than 130 countries. The IPCC has concluded that most of the warming observed during the past 50 years is attributable to human activities. Its findings have been publicly endorsed by the National Academies of Science of all G8 nations, as well as those of China, India and Brazil.
Suzuki says that despite this growing consensus, many in the public and the media seemed doubtful about the science for many years. The reason for the confusion about climate change, in Suzuki&#x27;s view, was due to a well organized campaign of disinformation about the science involved. &quot;A very small number of critics&quot; denies that climate change exists and that humans are the cause. These climate change deniers, Suzuki says, tend not to be climate scientists and do not publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals but rather target the media, the general public, and policy makers. Their goal: &quot;delaying action on climate change.&quot; According to Suzuki, deniers have received significant funding from coal and oil companies, including ExxonMobil. They are linked to &quot;industry-funded lobby groups&quot;, such as the Information Council on the Environment (ICE), whose aim is to &quot;reposition global warming as theory (not fact).&quot;

Suzuki is a &quot;messenger&quot; / ambassador for the environmental organization 350.org advocating for cutting CO2 emissions and creating climate solutions.

Suzuki has supported ecocide becoming a crime at the International Criminal Court stating &quot;Ecocide is not only a crime against life, it is suicidal for us because we are the apex predator that is utterly dependent on nature&#x27;s services.&quot;

Suzuki has attracted criticism for maintaining a lifestyle with a substantial carbon footprint while proselytizing against carbon emissions. Suzuki himself laments that in travelling constantly to spread his message of climate responsibility, he has ended up &quot;over his [carbon] limit by hundreds of tonnes.&quot; He says that he has stopped vacationing overseas, and aims to &quot;cluster&quot; his speaking engagements together to reduce his carbon footprint. He would prefer, he says, to appear solely by video conference.

Suzuki has criticized the discipline of economics for not valuing the environment.

In 2021, he said that pipelines would be &quot;blown up&quot; if climate action was not taken; he later apologized.

==Social commentary==
===Genetically modified food===
Suzuki has been criticized for his pseudoscientific beliefs on GMOs. Suzuki has written that &quot;products of biotechnology are being rammed into our food, onto our fields and into our medicines, without any public participation in discussions and with the complicity, indeed, the active support and funding of governments. But there are profound health, ecological and economic ramifications of this activity.&quot; In a 1999 CP Wire article, Suzuki is quoted as saying: &quot;Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying.&quot; In an interview with CBC TV, Suzuki argues that the science showing GMOs are safe is &quot;very, very bad science&quot; and that the commercialization of GMOs is &quot;driven by money.&quot; His foundation&#x27;s website includes an &quot;Understanding GMO&quot; page which claims &quot;the safety of GMO foods is unproven and a growing body of research connects these foods with health concerns.&quot;

===Fukushima===
In a 2013 speech on water policy at the University of Alberta, Suzuki claimed that a second emergency at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant would require the evacuation of the North American west coast. Three months later, he admitted that his comment was &quot;off-the-cuff.&quot; However, Suzuki still speculates that another earthquake could trigger a new nuclear disaster in Fukushima, as the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission paper he cited in his aforementioned speech at the University of Alberta states that such a disaster could call for the evacuation of over 10 million Japanese residents.

===Immigration===
In 2013, in the French news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, Suzuki called Canada&#x27;s immigration policy &quot;disgusting&quot; (We &quot;plunder southern countries to deprive them of their future leaders, and wish to increase our population to support economic growth&quot;) and insisted that &quot;Canada is full&quot; (&quot;Our useful area is reduced&quot;).

===Canadian justice system===
While being interviewed by Tony Jones on Australia&#x27;s ABC TV network in September 2013, Suzuki repeated the claim from Canadian media that the Harper government was building prisons even though crime rates were declining in Canada.
He suggested that the prisons might be being built so that Stephen Harper can incarcerate environmental activists. Jean-Christophe De Le Rue, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney, denied the claims, emphasizing that the Canadian government is not building any prisons, nor do they have plans to build any. However, in 2011, the Harper government did announce a 5-year, &quot;$2-billion federal prison-building boom&quot; to add &quot;over 2,700 beds to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prisons across Canada&quot; with $517-million already &quot;spent on prison construction&quot; in 2010–2011.
===Relationship with Justin Trudeau===
According to Suzuki, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Suzuki to ask for Suzuki&#x27;s endorsement of the Liberal platform on climate change. Upon pointed questioning by Suzuki, the conversation turned &quot;nasty&quot;, with Trudeau saying &quot;I don&#x27;t have to listen to this sanctimonious crap&quot;, at which time Suzuki &quot;proceeded to call him a twerp&quot;

==Personal life==
Suzuki was married to Setsuko Joane Sunahara from 1958 to 1965; the couple had three children. In 1973, Suzuki married a second time to Tara Elizabeth Cullis, with whom he had two daughters: Severn Cullis-Suzuki and Sarika Cullis-Suzuki. As of 2022, he has ten grandchildren, including snowboarder and filmmaker Tamo Campos. His cousin’s grandchildren are Montreal Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki, and Carolina Hurricanes player Ryan Suzuki.

Suzuki is an atheist.

Suzuki was criticized by the &quot;National Post&quot; for owning multiple homes &quot;because he often preaches the virtues of minimalism&quot;.

<doc id="149129" wikidata="Q685264" url="?curid=149129" title="Progressive scan">
<text>Progressive scanning (alternatively referred to as noninterlaced scanning) is a format of displaying, storing, or transmitting moving images in which all the lines of each frame are drawn in sequence. This is in contrast to interlaced video used in traditional analog television systems where only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video. The system was originally known as &quot;sequential scanning&quot; when it was used in the Baird 240 line television transmissions from Alexandra Palace, United Kingdom in 1936. It was also used in Baird&#x27;s experimental transmissions using 30 lines in the 1920s. Progressive scanning became universally used in computer screens beginning in the early 21st century.

== Interline twitter ==
This rough animation compares progressive scan with interlace scan, also demonstrating the interline twitter effect associated with interlacing. On the left there are two progressive scan images. In the middle there are two interlaced images and on the right there are two images with line doublers. The original resolutions are above and the ones with spatial anti-aliasing are below. The interlaced images use half the bandwidth of the progressive ones. The images in the center column precisely duplicate the pixels of the ones on the left, but interlacing causes details to twitter. Real interlaced video blurs such details to prevent twittering, but as seen in the pictures of the lower row, such softening (or anti-aliasing) comes at the cost of image clarity. A line doubler shown in the bottom right picture cannot restore the previously interlaced image in the center to the full quality of the progressive image shown in the top left.

Note: Because the refresh rate has been slowed by a factor of three, and the resolution is less than half a resolution of a typical interlaced video, the flicker in the simulated interlaced portions and also the visibility of the black lines in these examples are exaggerated. Also, the images above are based on what it would look like on a monitor that does not support interlaced scan, such as a PC monitor or an LCD or plasma-based television set, with the interlaced images displayed using the same mode as the progressive images.

==Usage in storing or transmitting==
Progressive scan is used for scanning and storing film-based material on DVDs, for example, as 480p24 or 576p25 formats. Progressive scan was included in the Grand Alliance&#x27;s technical standard for HDTV in the early 1990s. It was agreed that all film transmission by HDTV would be broadcast with progressive scan in the United States. Even if a signal is sent interlaced, an HDTV will convert it to progressive scan.

==Usage in TVs, video projectors, and monitors==
Progressive scan is used for all LCD computer monitors and most HDTVs. Most cathode-ray tube (CRT) computer monitors and CRT-type displays, such as SDTVs, needed to use interlace to achieve full vertical resolution, but could display progressive video at the cost of halving the vertical resolution. Before HDTV became common, some televisions and video projectors were produced with one or more full-resolution progressive-scan inputs, allowing these displays to take advantage of formats like PALPlus, progressive scan DVD players, and certain video game consoles. Early HDTVs supported the progressively-scanned resolutions of 480p and 720p with 1080p displays available at higher cost. At the debut of UHD, TVs had emerged on the consumer market in the 2010s, also using progressive resolutions, but usually sold with prohibitive prices (4K HDTVs) or were still in prototype stage (8K HDTVs). Prices for consumer-grade 4K HDTVs have since lowered and become more affordable, which has increased their prevalence amongst consumers. Computer monitors can use even greater display resolutions.

The disadvantage of progressive scan is that it requires higher bandwidth than interlaced video that has the same frame size and vertical refresh rate. Because of this 1080p is not used for broadcast. For explanations of why interlacing was originally used, see interlaced video. For an in-depth explanation of the fundamentals and advantages/disadvantages of converting interlaced video to a progressive format, see deinterlacing.

===Advantages===
The main advantage with progressive scan is that motion appears smoother and more realistic. There is an absence of visual artifacts associated with interlaced video of the same line rate, such as interline twitter. Frames have no interlace artifacts and can be captured for use as still photos. With progressive scan there is no need to introduce intentional blurring (sometimes referred to as anti-aliasing) to reduce interline twitter and eye strain.

In the case of most media, such as DVD movies and video games, the video is blurred during the authoring process itself to subdue interline twitter when played back on interlaced displays. As a consequence, recovering the sharpness of the original video is impossible when the video is viewed progressively. A user-intuitive solution to this is when display hardware and video games come equipped with options to blur the video at will, or to keep it at its original sharpness. This allows the viewer to achieve the desired image sharpness with both interlaced and progressive displays.

Progressive scan also offers clearer and faster results for scaling to higher resolutions than its equivalent interlaced video, such as upconverting 480p to display on a 1080p HDTV. HDTVs not based on CRT technology cannot natively display interlaced video, therefore interlaced video must be deinterlaced before it is scaled and displayed. Deinterlacing can result in noticeable visual artifacts and/or input lag between the video source and the display device.

<text>Western Airlines was a major airline in the United States based in California, operating in the Western United States including Alaska and Hawaii, and western Canada, as well as to New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Miami and to Mexico City, London and Nassau. Western had hubs at Los Angeles International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport, and the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver. Before it merged with Delta Air Lines in 1987 it was headquartered at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Throughout the company&#x27;s history, its slogan was &quot;Western Airlines...The Only Way to Fly!&quot;

==History==
===Western Air Express===

In 1925, the United States Postal Service began to give airline contracts to carry airmail throughout the country. Western Airlines first incorporated in 1925 as &quot;Western Air Express&quot; by Harris Hanshue. It applied for, and was awarded, the 650-mile long Contract Air Mail Route #4 (CAM-4) from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Los Angeles. On 17 April 1926, Western&#x27;s first flight took place with a Douglas M-2 airplane. It began offering passenger services a month later, when the first commercial passenger flight took place at Woodward Field. Ben F. Redman (then president of the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce) and J.A. Tomlinson perched atop U.S. mail sacks and flew with pilot C.N. &quot;Jimmy&quot; James on his regular eight-hour mail delivery flight to Los Angeles. By the mid-1930s, Western Air Express had introduced new Boeing 247 aircraft. Western Air Express built and owned Vail Airport in Montebello, CA from 1926 to 1930 and the Alhambra Airport in southern California from 1930 to 1931. Western Air Express operated a seaplane route out of Hamilton Cove Seaplane Base on Catalina Island, California from 1928 to 1930

===Transcontinental &amp; Western Air===
The company reincorporated in 1928 as Western Air Express Corp. In 1930 it purchased Standard Air Lines, a subsidiary of Aero Corp. of Ca., founded in 1926 by Paul E. Richter, Jack Frye and Walter Hamilton. WAE with Fokker aircraft merged with Transcontinental Air Transport to form Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (TWA, later known as Trans World Airlines).

===General Air Lines===
In 1934 Western Air Express was severed from TWA and changed its name to General Air Lines, returning to the name Western Air Express after several months. In a 1934 press release by the company, it called itself the Western Air Division of General Air Lines. Its route map ran San Diego to Los Angeles to Salt Lake City.

===Western Airlines===
In 1937 Western merged National Parks Airways, which extended its route north from Salt Lake to Great Falls, and, in 1941, across the border to Lethbridge, Alberta. In 1941 Western Air Express changed its name to Western Air Lines and later to Western Airlines. (In 1967–69 Western called itself Western Airlines International.)

In 1944 Western acquired a controlling interest in Inland Air Lines, which became a subsidiary with Inland&#x27;s schedules in Western timetables until Inland was merged into Western in 1952. Western started flying Los Angeles to San Francisco in 1943, so the Western/Inland route map was a W: San Francisco south to San Diego, north from San Diego to Lethbridge, Alberta in Canada, south to Denver, and northeast to Huron. (It extended to Minneapolis in 1947.)

In 1946, Western was awarded a route from Los Angeles to Denver via Las Vegas, but in 1947 financial problems forced Western to sell the route, and Douglas DC-6 delivery positions, to United Air Lines. In 1947 Western extended the left arm of the W north to Seattle, and added San Diego to Yuma for a few years; in 1950 it extended the middle of the W north to Edmonton. It finally cut across the W in 1953 when DC-6Bs started a one-stop flight MSP-SLC-LAX; in 1956 it resumed flights west out of Denver, to San Francisco via Salt Lake. In 1957 it began Los Angeles to Mexico City nonstop DC-6Bs, and in December 1957 it began Denver-Phoenix-San Diego.

The airline&#x27;s president was Terrell &quot;Terry&quot; Drinkwater. Drinkwater got into a dispute with the administration in Washington D.C. that hampered WAL&#x27;s growth. Pressured in a famous phone call by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to &quot;buy American made aircraft&quot;, Drinkwater reportedly responded: &quot;Mr. President, you run your country and let me run my airline!&quot; For years after this exchange, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) would not award Western new routes while its competitors, including United and American, grew enormous even though all Western airliners were of U.S. manufacture while its competitors&#x27; fleets included aircraft produced in Europe. 
In August 1953, Western was serving 38 airports; in June 1968 that number had grown to 42.

In June 1960, Western Airlines introduced Boeing 707s (707-139s) between Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. 720B nonstops MSP-SFO and MSP-LAX began in 1966, along with LAX-Acapulco. In 1967 WAL acquired Pacific Northern Airlines (PNA, the successor of Woodley Airways) based in Anchorage, Alaska, its primary routes being Anchorage - Seattle nonstop as well as Anchorage - Juneau - Seattle and Anchorage - Juneau - Ketchikan - Seattle with PNA flying Boeing 720 jetliners on these routes with the airline also operating nonstop Kodiak, Alaska - Seattle service with Lockheed Constellation propliners. Also in 1967, Western added Vancouver, and in 1969 it began nonstop flights between several California airports and Hawaii.

In the late 1960s, Western aimed for an all-jet fleet, adding Boeing 707-320s, 727-200s and 737-200s to its 720Bs. The two leased B707-139s had been sold in favor of the turbofan-powered Boeing 720B. Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops were replaced with new 737-200s. In 1973 Western added nine McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10s, marketing its wide-body cabins as &quot;DC-10 Spaceships&quot;. They were configured with 46 first-class seats, 193 coach, and a lower level galley. From 1976 to 1981 the DC-10s flew Los Angeles to Miami nonstop.

Starting in 1968 future billionaire Kirk Kerkorian was a major investor in Western Airlines. Kerkorian had previously controlled Trans International Airlines, making his first fortune by selling it to insurance conglomerate Transamerica Corporation earlier in 1968. Kerkorian built a large stake in Western from 1968 to 1970 and took control of the board, reshaping management (including side-lining Drinkwater) and, among other changes, cancelling Western&#x27;s orders for Boeing 747s, helping Western minimize the impact of the widebody-driven capacity glut of the early 1970s. He remained a power at Western until 1976, when he sold his remaining stock back to the company.

In 1969, Western Airlines opened negotiations to merge with American Airlines. However, the merger was opposed by rival airlines such as Continental Airlines and the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division under Richard Wellington McLaren. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s attorney Herbert W. Kalmbach suggested that the antitrust suit would be dropped in exchange for a $75,000 campaign contribution to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, which American Airlines CEO George A. Spater agreed to. However, the merger was nonetheless rejected in a 4–1 decision by the Civil Aeronautics Board in July 1972.

Western was headquartered in Los Angeles, California. After the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, the airline&#x27;s hubs were reduced to two airports: Los Angeles International Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport. Before deregulation, Western had small hubs in Anchorage, Alaska, Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul and San Francisco. In spring 1987, shortly before Western was acquired by Delta Air Lines, the airline had two hubs, a major operation in Salt Lake City and a small hub in Los Angeles.

At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, Western flew to cities across the western United States, and to Mexico (Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo and Mazatlán), Alaska (Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Ketchikan, Kodiak and other Alaskan destinations), Hawaii (Honolulu, Kahului, Kona, and Hilo), and Canada (Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton). New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, and Miami were added on the east coast as well as Chicago and St. Louis, and cities in Texas (Austin, Dallas/Ft. Worth, El Paso, Houston and San Antonio), and New Orleans in the south. Western had many intrastate flights in California, competing with Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), Air California/AirCal, Air West/Hughes Airwest and United Airlines. In addition, Western operated &quot;Islander&quot; service with Boeing 707-320s, Boeing 720Bs and McDonnell Douglas DC-10s to Hawaii from a number of cities that previously did not have direct flights to the 50th state. In 1973, Western flew nonstop between Honolulu and Anchorage, Los Angeles, Oakland, California, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, California and one-stop between Honolulu and Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Phoenix, Sacramento and Salt Lake City. In 1981, the airline also flew nonstop DC-10s between Vancouver, British Columbia and Honolulu.

One of the smallest jet destinations was West Yellowstone, Montana, near Yellowstone National Park. Western flew Boeing 737-200s to West Yellowstone Airport in the summer, replacing Lockheed L-188 Electras. In the 1970s and 1980s, Western served a number of small cities with 737-200s including Butte, Montana, Casper, Wyoming, Cheyenne, Wyoming, Helena, Montana, Idaho Falls, Idaho, Pierre, South Dakota, Pocatello, Idaho, Rapid City, South Dakota and Sheridan, Wyoming. The 737 replaced Electras to all of these cities. In 1968 the airline was operating nonstop Boeing 720Bs between the Annette Island Airport (serving Ketchikan, Alaska) and Seattle in addition to 720Bs between Juneau and Seattle, and in 1973 was flying 720B nonstops between Kodiak, Alaska and Seattle.

In 1978, Western Airlines and Continental Airlines agreed to merge. A dispute broke out over what to call the combined airline: Western-Continental or Continental-Western, prompting an infamous coin toss. Bob Six, the colorful founder of CAL, demanded that Continental be &quot;tails&quot; in deference to its marketing slogan &quot;We Really Move Our Tail for You! Continental Airlines: the Proud Bird with the Golden Tail&quot;. The coin flip turned up &quot;heads&quot;. Six was so disappointed he called the merger off.

From October 1980 to October 1981, Western flew Honolulu to Anchorage to London Gatwick Airport with a single McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30; for less than a year starting in April 1981 it flew LGW to Denver, continuing to Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Another international route was Los Angeles to Miami to Nassau, in the Bahamas for a year in 1980–81. Western extended its network to New York City, Washington, D.C. and Boston, as well as to Chicago and St. Louis in the midwest, Albuquerque and El Paso in the west, and Houston, New Orleans, Miami and Fort Lauderdale. In 1987 Western had four Boeing 737-300 round trips between Boston and New York LaGuardia Airport, and a major hub at Salt Lake City International Airport and a small hub at Los Angeles International Airport.

===Western Express===

In 1986, Western entered into a code sharing agreement with SkyWest Airlines, a commuter airline. SkyWest (Western Express) Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners connected to Western mainline flights at Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego, and other Western mainline destinations. In spring 1987 SkyWest/Western Express served 36 cities in Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. Western entered a similar code-sharing agreement with Alaska-based South Central Air, a small commuter airline that operated as Western Express as well, connecting to Western flights at Anchorage. Several cities in southern Alaska including Homer, Kenai, Soldotna were served by South Central Air operating as Western Express. After the acquisition of Western by Delta Air Lines, SkyWest became a Delta Connection code sharing airline.

===Delta Air Lines merger===

In the early 1980s Air Florida tried to buy Western Airlines, but it was able to purchase only 16 percent of the airline&#x27;s stock. On September 9, 1986, Western Airlines and Delta Air Lines entered into an agreement and plan of merger. The merger agreement was approved by the United States Department of Transportation on December 11, 1986. On December 16, 1986, shareholder approval was conferred and Western Airlines became a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta. The Western brand was discontinued and the employee workforces were fully merged on April 1, 1987. All of Western&#x27;s aircraft were repainted in Delta&#x27;s livery, including twelve McDonnell Douglas DC-10s. Delta eventually decided to eliminate the DC-10s from its fleet as it already operated Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, a similar type. Delta retained Western&#x27;s hubs in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City; both remain major gateways and hubs for Delta.

==Advertising==

Western contributed to popular culture with its 1956 advertising slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s the oooooonly way to fly!&quot; Spoken by Wally Bird, an animated bird hitching a ride atop the fuselage of a Western airliner, and voiced by veteran actor Shepard Menken, the phrase soon found its way into animated cartoons by Warner Bros. (&quot;Crow&#x27;s Feat&quot;) and Hanna-Barbera. Another famous advertising campaign by the airline centered on &quot;Star Trek&quot; icons William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Some of the carrier&#x27;s last television ads, shortly before the merger with Delta, featured actor/comedian Rodney Dangerfield.

In the 1970s Western called itself &quot;the champagne airline&quot; because champagne was offered free of charge to every passenger over age 21. (Actor Jim Backus uttered the &quot;It&#x27;s the only way to fly!&quot; phrase while piloting an airplane, somewhat inebriated, in the 1963 film &quot;It&#x27;s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;.)

Western Airlines was famous for its &quot;Flying W&quot; corporate identity and aircraft livery. Introduced in 1970, the scheme featured a large red &quot;W&quot; that fused into a red cheatline running the length of an all-white fuselage. This new corporate identity was the subject of litigation by Winnebago Industries, which contended the new &quot;Flying W&quot; was too similar to its own stylized &quot;W&quot; logo. In the 1980s Western Airlines slightly modified the scheme by stripping the white fuselage to bare metal, retaining the red &quot;Flying W&quot; (with a dark blue shadow). This color scheme was known as &quot;Bud Lite&quot; due to its resemblance to a popular beer&#x27;s can design.

Western Airlines was a favorite first class carrier for Hollywood movie stars and frequently featured them in its on board magazine, &quot;Western&#x27;s World&quot;. Marilyn Monroe and many other silver screen actors were frequent flyers and the airline capitalized on it. Western had a famous flyer out of Seattle: Captain &quot;Red&quot; Dodge. Red worked previously as a helicopter test pilot, and got involved with flying for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in his later years when he wasn&#x27;t flying as captain on the DC-10. The movie &quot;Breakout&quot; starring Charles Bronson was based on his daring airlift of a CIA operative out of the courtyard of a Mexican prison. The Mexican government tried to extradite Dodge back to face charges. Red became wealthy leasing government storage units with unlimited government business but never again flew to Mexico.

The airline was promoted in the Carpenters promotional video for the track &quot;I Need to Be in Love&quot;, released in 1976. The video shows exterior footage of a DC-10 in takeoff and landing shots, as well as seating promotions for Western&#x27;s FiftyFair seating product, with shots of a cabin setting depicting what looks like business class of the DC-10.

During the 1980s, destination flights aboard Western Airlines were featured as prizes on televised game shows, including &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;.

==Fleet==
===Fleet in 1986===

In 1986 Western Airlines&#x27; fleet was 78 jets:
* Western used a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 starting in 1981 to serve London, England, United Kingdom. The DC-10-30 was the largest plane type ever flown by Western.

===Fleet in 1970===
In 1970 Western Airlines operated 75 aircraft:

* 5 Boeing 707-320C (not included were 5 Boeing 707-347C ordered (assigned registration N1506W through N1510W) that were cancelled and acquired by the RCAF).
* 29 Boeing 720 (720 turbojet and 720B turbofan models; the 720s were ex-Pacific Northern)
* 6 Boeing 727-200
* 30 Boeing 737-200
* 5 Lockheed L-188 Electra (included passenger, freighter and passenger/freighter combi aircraft versions. Only turboprop type operated by the airline)

===Earlier piston fleet===

Western used a variety of piston-powered airliners including Boeing 247Ds, Convair 240s, Douglas DC-3s, DC-4s, DC-6Bs and L-749 Constellations. The Constellations had been operated by Pacific Northern Airlines and served smaller Western Airlines destinations in Alaska such as Cordova, Homer, Kenai, King Salmon, Kodiak and Yakutat from Anchorage or Seattle in the late 1960s.

==Accidents and incidents ==
* December 15, 1936: Seven died when a Western Air Express Boeing 247 crashed just below Hardy Ridge on Lone Peak near Salt Lake City, Utah. The major parts of the aircraft were hurled over the ridge and fell over a thousand feet into a basin below.
* January 12, 1937: Western Air Express Flight 7, a Boeing 247 flying from Salt Lake City to Burbank, crashed near Newhall, California, killing five of the 10 persons on board, including adventurer and documentary filmmaker Martin Johnson of Martin and Osa Johnson fame.
* December 15, 1942: A Western Airlines transport crashed near Fairfield, Utah, approximately 50 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah, on the way to Los Angeles, California. The plane took off at 1:05 a.m. and was reported missing approximately 15 minutes later. Of the 19 passengers and crew aboard, 17 died.
* November 13, 1946: Western Airlines Flight 23 crashed into the mountains 12 miles south of Gorman, California, while descending towards Burbank Airport. All 11 on board were killed.
* December 24, 1946: Western Air Lines Flight 44 crashed into the Laguna Mountains while descending towards San Diego. All 12 on board were killed. The CAB investigation determined that the pilot misjudged his position relative to the mountains, and flew too low to clear terrain.
* April 20, 1953: Western Air Lines Flight 636, flying in the night, on the last leg of a Los Angeles-San Francisco-Oakland itinerary, descended below the prescribed minimum altitude of 500 ft and crashed into the waters of San Francisco Bay, killing eight of ten people aboard the Douglas DC-6.
* February 26, 1954: Western Air Lines Flight 34, a Convair CV-240-1 crashed near Wright, Wyoming, killing 6 passengers and 3 crew members.
* February 25, 1971 – Western Air Lines Flight 329, a Boeing 737, was hijacked by a passenger, demanding to be taken to Cuba but instead landed in Canada.
* March 31, 1971 – Western Air Lines Flight 366, a Boeing 720-047B flying from Los Angeles to Ontario, California, on a pilot proficiency check flight, yawed and rolled out of control, and crashed while in the process of executing a 3-engine missed-approach from a simulated engine-out instrument approach. The five crew members and only occupants died in the crash.
* May 5, 1972 – Western Airlines Flight 407, a Boeing 737, was hijacked by a man demanding to be taken to North Vietnam. After refueling in Tampa, Florida, the plane went to Cuba.
* June 2, 1972: Western Airlines Flight 701 from Los Angeles to Seattle was hijacked by Willie Roger Holder, a Vietnam War veteran, and his girlfriend Catherine Marie Kerkow. The hijackers claimed they had a bomb in an attaché case and demanded $500,000 and that Angela Davis, who was then on trial, be freed. After allowing half the passengers to get off in San Francisco and the other half to get off in New York on a re-fueling stop, they flew on to Algeria, where they were granted political asylum, joining the International Section of the Black Panther Party. It was and still remains the longest-distance hijacking in American history. Later, $488,000 of the ransom money was returned to American officials.
* March 31, 1975: Western Flight 470 was landing at Casper Airport when it overshot the runway, and struck a shallow irrigation ditch before stopping about 800 feet beyond the departure end of the runway. Weather conditions at the time were at minimum visibility with light snow. The Boeing 737-200 was written off beyond repair. Four passengers suffered various injuries.
* July 31, 1979: Western Airlines Flight 44 departed Los Angeles International Airport en route to Denver, Colorado, and Billings, Montana, via several other intermediate stops and then mistakenly landed at Buffalo, Wyoming, instead of Sheridan, Wyoming, which was the intended destination. No injuries occurred and the only damage was to the ramp at the airport, which was not designed to support the weight of the Boeing 737-200 jetliner. The incident prompted a legal battle and subsequent landmark aviation ruling of &quot;Ferguson v. NTSB&quot;.
* October 31, 1979: Western Airlines Flight 2605 crashed while landing at Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City, killing 72. The crew landed the DC-10 on a closed runway and it collided with construction vehicles during the attempted go-around.

<doc id="149131" wikidata="Q207732" url="?curid=149131" title="Messiah (Handel)">
<text>Messiah (HWV 56) is an English-language oratorio composed in 1741 by George Frideric Handel. The text was compiled from the King James Bible and the Coverdale Psalter by Charles Jennens. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.

Handel&#x27;s reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; &quot;Messiah&quot; was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens&#x27;s text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only &quot;scene&quot; taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion of Jesus and ends with the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus. In Part III, he covers Paul&#x27;s teachings on the resurrection of the dead and Christ&#x27;s glorification in heaven.

Handel wrote &quot;Messiah&quot; for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional alternate settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified, such as Mozart&#x27;s . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel&#x27;s original intentions, although &quot;big &quot;Messiah&quot;&quot; productions continue to be mounted. A near-complete version was issued on 78 rpm discs in 1928; since then the work has been recorded many times.

The autograph manuscript of the oratorio is preserved in the British Library.

==Background==
The composer George Frideric Handel, born in Halle in Brandenburg-Prussia (modern Germany) in 1685, took up permanent residence in London in 1712, and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. By 1741 his pre-eminence in British music was evident from the honours he had accumulated, including a pension from the court of King George II, the office of Composer of Musick for the Chapel Royal, and—most unusually for a living person—a statue erected in his honour in Vauxhall Gardens. Within a large and varied musical output, Handel was a vigorous champion of Italian opera, which he had introduced to London in 1711 with &quot;Rinaldo&quot;. He subsequently wrote and presented more than 40 such operas in London&#x27;s theatres.
By the early 1730s public taste for Italian opera was beginning to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel&#x27;s productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums of his own money in doing so.

Although prospects for Italian opera were declining, Handel remained committed to the genre, but as alternatives to his staged works he began to introduce English-language oratorios. In Rome in 1707–08 he had written two Italian oratorios at a time when opera performances in the city were temporarily forbidden under papal decree. His first venture into English oratorio had been &quot;Esther&quot;, which was written and performed for a private patron in about 1718. In 1732 Handel brought a revised and expanded version of &quot;Esther&quot; to the King&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket, where members of the royal family attended a glittering premiere on 6 May. Its success encouraged Handel to write two more oratorios (&quot;Deborah&quot; and &quot;Athalia&quot;). All three oratorios were performed to large and appreciative audiences at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford in mid-1733. Undergraduates reportedly sold their furniture to raise the money for the five-shilling tickets.

In 1735 Handel received the text for a new oratorio named &quot;Saul&quot; from its librettist Charles Jennens, a wealthy landowner with musical and literary interests. Because Handel&#x27;s main creative concern was still with opera, he did not write the music for &quot;Saul&quot; until 1738, in preparation for his 1738–39 theatrical season. The work, after opening at the King&#x27;s Theatre in January 1739 to a warm reception, was quickly followed by the less successful oratorio &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; (which may also have come from Jennens). Although Handel continued to write operas, the trend towards English-language productions became irresistible as the decade ended. After three performances of his last Italian opera &quot;Deidamia&quot; in January and February 1741, he abandoned the genre. In July 1741 Jennens sent him a new libretto for an oratorio; in a letter dated 10 July to his friend Edward Holdsworth, Jennens wrote: &quot;I hope [Handel] will lay out his whole Genius &amp; Skill upon it, that the Composition may excell all his former Compositions, as the Subject excells every other subject. The Subject is Messiah&quot;.

==Synopsis==

In Christian theology, the Messiah is the saviour of humankind. The Messiah (&quot;Māšîaḥ&quot;) is an Old Testament Hebrew word meaning &quot;the Anointed One&quot;, which in New Testament Greek is Christ, a title given to Jesus of Nazareth, known by his followers as &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; has been described by the early-music scholar Richard Luckett as &quot;a commentary on [Jesus Christ&#x27;s] Nativity, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension&quot;, beginning with God&#x27;s promises as spoken by the prophets and ending with Christ&#x27;s glorification in heaven. In contrast with most of Handel&#x27;s oratorios, the singers in &quot;Messiah&quot; do not assume dramatic roles; there is no single, dominant narrative voice; and very little use is made of quoted speech. In his libretto, Jennens&#x27;s intention was not to dramatise the life and teachings of Jesus, but to acclaim the &quot;Mystery of Godliness&quot;, using a compilation of extracts from the Authorized (King James) Version of the Bible, and from the Psalms included in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.

The three-part structure of the work approximates to that of Handel&#x27;s three-act operas, with the &quot;parts&quot; subdivided by Jennens into &quot;scenes&quot;. Each scene is a collection of individual numbers or &quot;movements&quot; which take the form of recitatives, arias and choruses. There are two instrumental numbers, the opening &quot;Sinfony&quot; in the style of a French overture, and the pastoral &quot;Pifa&quot;, often called the &quot;pastoral symphony&quot;, at the mid-point of Part I.

In Part I, the Messiah&#x27;s coming and the virgin birth are predicted by the Old Testament prophets. The annunciation to the shepherds of the birth of the Christ is represented in the words of Luke&#x27;s gospel. Part II covers Christ&#x27;s passion and his death, his resurrection and ascension, the first spreading of the gospel through the world, and a definitive statement of God&#x27;s glory summarised in the &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. Part III begins with the promise of redemption, followed by a prediction of the day of judgment and the &quot;general resurrection&quot;, ending with the final victory over sin and death and the acclamation of Christ. According to the musicologist Donald Burrows, much of the text is so allusive as to be largely incomprehensible to those ignorant of the biblical accounts. For the benefit of his audiences Jennens printed and issued a pamphlet explaining the reasons for his choices of scriptural selections.

==Writing history==
===Libretto===

Charles Jennens was born around 1700, into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and properties in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited. His religious and political views—he opposed the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the accession to the British throne for the House of Hanover—prevented him from receiving his degree from Balliol College, Oxford, or from pursuing any form of public career. His family&#x27;s wealth enabled him to live a life of leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests. Although musicologist Watkins Shaw dismisses Jennens as &quot;a conceited figure of no special ability&quot;, Burrows has written: &quot;of Jennens&#x27;s musical literacy there can be no doubt&quot;. He was certainly devoted to Handel&#x27;s music, having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since &quot;Rodelinda&quot; in 1725. By 1741, after their collaboration on &quot;Saul&quot;, a warm friendship had developed between the two, and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at Gopsall.

Jennens&#x27;s letter to Holdsworth of 10 July 1741, in which he first mentions &quot;Messiah&quot;, suggests that the text was a recent work, probably assembled earlier that summer. As a devout Anglican and believer in scriptural authority, Jennens intended to challenge advocates of Deism, who rejected the doctrine of divine intervention in human affairs. Shaw describes the text as &quot;a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief&quot;, and despite his reservations on Jennens&#x27;s character, concedes that the finished wordbook &quot;amounts to little short of a work of genius&quot;. There is no evidence that Handel played any active role in the selection or preparation of the text, such as he did in the case of &quot;Saul&quot;; it seems, rather, that he saw no need to make any significant amendment to Jennens&#x27;s work.

===Composition===
The music for &quot;Messiah&quot; was completed in 24 days of swift composition. Having received Jennens&#x27;s text some time after 10 July 1741, Handel began work on it on 22 August. His records show that he had completed Part I in outline by 28 August, Part II by 6 September and Part III by 12 September, followed by two days of &quot;filling up&quot; to produce the finished work on 14 September. This rapid pace was seen by Jennens not as a sign of ecstatic energy but rather as &quot;careless negligence&quot;, and the relations between the two men would remain strained, since Jennens &quot;urged Handel to make improvements&quot; while the composer stubbornly refused. The autograph score&#x27;s 259 pages show some signs of haste such as blots, scratchings-out, unfilled bars and other uncorrected errors, but according to the music scholar Richard Luckett the number of errors is remarkably small in a document of this length. The original manuscript for &quot;Messiah&quot; is now held in the British Library&#x27;s music collection. It is scored for two trumpets, timpani, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.

At the end of his manuscript Handel wrote the letters &quot;SDG&quot;—&#x27;, &quot;To God alone the glory&quot;. This inscription, taken with the speed of composition, has encouraged belief in the apocryphal story that Handel wrote the music in a fervour of divine inspiration in which, as he wrote the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus, &quot;He saw all heaven before him&quot;. Burrows points out that many of Handel&#x27;s operas of comparable length and structure to &quot;Messiah&quot; were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons. The effort of writing so much music in so short a time was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries; Handel commenced his next oratorio, &quot;Samson&quot;, within a week of finishing &quot;Messiah&quot;, and completed his draft of this new work in a month. In accordance with his practice when writing new works, Handel adapted existing compositions for use in &quot;Messiah&quot;, in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously. Thus, &#x27; HWV 193 from 1722 became the basis of &quot;O Death, where is thy sting?&quot;; &quot;His yoke is easy&quot; and &quot;And he shall purify&quot; were drawn from &#x27; HWV 192 (July 1741), &quot;Unto us a child is born&quot; and &quot;All we like sheep&quot; from &#x27; HWV 189 (July 1741). Handel&#x27;s instrumentation in the score is often imprecise, again in line with contemporary convention, where the use of certain instruments and combinations was assumed and did not need to be written down by the composer; later copyists would fill in the details.

Before the first performance Handel made numerous revisions to his manuscript score, in part to match the forces available for the 1742 Dublin premiere; it is probable that his work was not performed as originally conceived in his lifetime. Between 1742 and 1754 he continued to revise and recompose individual movements, sometimes to suit the requirements of particular singers. The first published score of &quot;Messiah&quot; was issued in 1767, eight years after Handel&#x27;s death, though this was based on relatively early manuscripts and included none of Handel&#x27;s later revisions.

==Premières==
===Dublin, 1742===

Handel&#x27;s decision to give a season of concerts in Dublin in the winter of 1741–42 arose from an invitation from the Duke of Devonshire, then serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A violinist friend of Handel&#x27;s, Matthew Dubourg, was in Dublin as the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s bandmaster; he would look after the tour&#x27;s orchestral requirements. Whether Handel originally intended to perform &quot;Messiah&quot; in Dublin is uncertain; he did not inform Jennens of any such plan, for the latter wrote to Holdsworth on 2 December 1741: &quot;…it was some mortification to me to hear that instead of performing &quot;Messiah&quot; here he has gone into Ireland with it.&quot; After arriving in Dublin on 18 November 1741, Handel arranged a subscription series of six concerts, to be held between December 1741 and February 1742 at the Great Music Hall, Fishamble Street. The venue had been built in 1741 specifically to accommodate concerts for the benefit of &quot;The Charitable and Musical Society for the Release of Imprisoned Debtors&quot;, a charity for whom Handel had agreed to perform one benefit performance. These concerts were so popular that a second series was quickly arranged; &quot;Messiah&quot; figured in neither series.

In early March Handel began discussions with the appropriate committees for a charity concert, to be given in April, at which he intended to present &quot;Messiah&quot;. He sought and was given permission from St Patrick&#x27;s and Christ Church cathedrals to use their choirs for this occasion. These forces amounted to sixteen men and sixteen boy choristers; several of the men were allocated solo parts. The women soloists were Christina Maria Avoglio, who had sung the main soprano roles in the two subscription series, and Susannah Cibber, an established stage actress and contralto who had sung in the second series. To accommodate Cibber&#x27;s vocal range, the recitative &quot;Then shall the eyes of the blind&quot; and the aria &quot;He shall feed his flock&quot; were transposed down to F major. The performance, also in the Fishamble Street hall, was originally announced for 12 April, but was deferred for a day &quot;at the request of persons of Distinction&quot;. The orchestra in Dublin comprised strings, two trumpets, and timpani; the number of players is unknown. Handel had his own organ shipped to Ireland for the performances; a harpsichord was probably also used.

The three charities that were to benefit were prisoners&#x27; debt relief, the Mercer&#x27;s Hospital, and the Charitable Infirmary. In its report on a public rehearsal, the &quot;Dublin News-Letter&quot; described the oratorio as &quot;…far surpass[ing] anything of that Nature which has been performed in this or any other Kingdom&quot;. Seven hundred people attended the premiere on 13 April. So that the largest possible audience could be admitted to the concert, gentlemen were requested to remove their swords, and ladies were asked not to wear hoops in their dresses. The performance earned unanimous praise from the assembled press: &quot;Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring and crouded Audience&quot;. A Dublin clergyman, Rev. Delaney, was so overcome by Susanna Cibber&#x27;s rendering of &quot;He was despised&quot; that reportedly he leapt to his feet and cried: &quot;Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven thee!&quot; The takings amounted to around £400, providing about £127 to each of the three nominated charities and securing the release of 142 indebted prisoners.

Handel remained in Dublin for four months after the première. He organised a second performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; on 3 June, which was announced as &quot;the last Performance of Mr Handel&#x27;s during his Stay in this Kingdom&quot;. In this second &quot;Messiah&quot;, which was for Handel&#x27;s private financial benefit, Cibber reprised her role from the first performance, though Avoglio may have been replaced by a Mrs Maclaine; details of other performers are not recorded.

The warm reception accorded to &quot;Messiah&quot; in Dublin was not repeated in London. Indeed, even the announcement of the performance as a &quot;new Sacred Oratorio&quot; drew an anonymous commentator to ask if &quot;the &quot;Playhouse&quot; is a fit &quot;Temple&quot; to perform it&quot;. Handel introduced the work at the Covent Garden theatre on 23 March 1743. Avoglio and Cibber were again the chief soloists; they were joined by the tenor John Beard, a veteran of Handel&#x27;s operas, the bass Thomas Rheinhold and two other sopranos, Kitty Clive and Miss Edwards. The first performance was overshadowed by views expressed in the press that the work&#x27;s subject matter was too exalted to be performed in a theatre, particularly by secular singer-actresses such as Cibber and Clive. In an attempt to deflect such sensibilities, in London Handel had avoided the name &quot;Messiah&quot; and presented the work as the &quot;New Sacred Oratorio&quot;. As was his custom, Handel rearranged the music to suit his singers. He wrote a new setting of &quot;And lo, the angel of the Lord&quot; for Clive, never used subsequently. He added a tenor song for Beard: &quot;Their sound is gone out&quot;, which had appeared in Jennens&#x27;s original libretto but had not been in the Dublin performances.
The custom of standing for the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus originates from a popular belief that, at the London premiere, King George II did so, which would have obliged all to stand. There is no convincing evidence that the king was present, or that he attended any subsequent performance of &quot;Messiah&quot;; the first reference to the practice of standing appears in a letter dated 1756, three years prior to Handel&#x27;s death.

London&#x27;s initially cool reception of &quot;Messiah&quot; led Handel to reduce the season&#x27;s planned six performances to three, and not to present the work at all in 1744—to the considerable annoyance of Jennens, whose relations with the composer temporarily soured. At Jennens&#x27;s request, Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival: &quot;Their sound is gone out&quot; became a choral piece, the soprano song &quot;Rejoice greatly&quot; was recomposed in shortened form, and the transpositions for Cibber&#x27;s voice were restored to their original soprano range. Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745: &quot;[Handel] has made a fine Entertainment of it, though not near so good as he might &amp; ought to have done. I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition…&quot; Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745, on 9 and 11 April, and then set the work aside for four years.
The 1749 revival at Covent Garden, under the proper title of &quot;Messiah&quot;, saw the appearance of two female soloists who were henceforth closely associated with Handel&#x27;s music: Giulia Frasi and Caterina Galli. In the following year these were joined by the male alto Gaetano Guadagni, for whom Handel composed new versions of &quot;But who may abide&quot; and &quot;Thou art gone up on high&quot;. The year 1750 also saw the institution of the annual charity performances of &quot;Messiah&quot; at London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital, which continued until Handel&#x27;s death and beyond. The 1754 performance at the hospital is the first for which full details of the orchestral and vocal forces survive. The orchestra included fifteen violins, five violas, three cellos, two double basses, four bassoons, four oboes, two trumpets, two horns and drums. In the chorus of nineteen were six trebles from the Chapel Royal; the remainder, all men, were altos, tenors and basses. Frasi, Galli and Beard led the five soloists, who were required to assist the chorus. For this performance the transposed Guadagni arias were restored to the soprano voice. By 1754 Handel was severely afflicted by the onset of blindness, and in 1755 he turned over the direction of the &quot;Messiah&quot; hospital performance to his pupil, J. C. Smith. He apparently resumed his duties in 1757 and may have continued thereafter. The final performance of the work at which Handel was present was at Covent Garden on 6 April 1759, eight days before his death.

==Later performance history==

===18th century===

During the 1750s &quot;Messiah&quot; was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel&#x27;s death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel&#x27;s lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel&#x27;s music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that &quot;The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal &amp; instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.&quot; In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, &quot;Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).&quot; In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, &quot;The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers&quot;.

In continental Europe, performances of &quot;Messiah&quot; were departing from Handel&#x27;s practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented &quot;Messiah&quot; with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the to re-orchestrate several works by Handel, including &quot;Messiah&quot; (&quot;Der Messias&quot;). Writing for a small-scale performance, he eliminated the organ continuo, added parts for flutes, clarinets, trombones and horns, recomposed some passages and rearranged others. The performance took place on 6 March 1789 in the rooms of Count Johann Esterházy, with four soloists and a choir of 12. Mozart&#x27;s arrangement, with minor amendments from Hiller, was published in 1803, after his death. The musical scholar Moritz Hauptmann described the Mozart additions as &quot;stucco ornaments on a marble temple&quot;. Mozart himself was reportedly circumspect about his changes, insisting that any alterations to Handel&#x27;s score should not be interpreted as an effort to improve the music. Elements of this version later became familiar to British audiences, incorporated into editions of the score by editors including Ebenezer Prout.

===19th century===
In the 19th century, approaches to Handel in German- and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft with the aim of publishing authentic editions of all Handel&#x27;s works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel&#x27;s performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. &quot;Messiah&quot; was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600. In Britain a &quot;Great Handel Festival&quot; was held at the Crystal Palace in 1857, performing &quot;Messiah&quot; and other Handel oratorios, with a chorus of 2,000 singers and an orchestra of 500.

In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger forces were assembled. Bernard Shaw, in his role as a music critic, commented, &quot;The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted&quot;; he later wrote, &quot;Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous dullness of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James&#x27;s Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die.&quot; The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that &quot;the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting &#x27;additional orchestral accompaniments&#x27; exercised with due discretion.&quot;

One reason for the popularity of huge-scale performances was the ubiquity of amateur choral societies. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham wrote that for 200 years the chorus was &quot;the national medium of musical utterance&quot; in Britain. However, after the heyday of Victorian choral societies, he noted a &quot;rapid and violent reaction against monumental performances ... an appeal from several quarters that Handel should be played and heard as in the days between 1700 and 1750&quot;. At the end of the century, Sir Frederick Bridge and T. W. Bourne pioneered revivals of &quot;Messiah&quot; in Handel&#x27;s orchestration, and Bourne&#x27;s work was the basis for further scholarly versions in the early 20th century.

===20th century and beyond===

Although the huge-scale oratorio tradition was perpetuated by such large ensembles as the Royal Choral Society, the Tabernacle Choir and the Huddersfield Choral Society in the 20th century, there were increasing calls for performances more faithful to Handel&#x27;s conception. At the turn of the century, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; wrote of the &quot;additional accompaniments&quot; of Mozart and others, &quot;Is it not time that some of these &#x27;hangers on&#x27; of Handel&#x27;s score were sent about their business?&quot; In 1902, Prout produced a new edition of the score, working from Handel&#x27;s original manuscripts rather than from corrupt printed versions with errors accumulated from one edition to another. However, Prout started from the assumption that a faithful reproduction of Handel&#x27;s original score would not be practical:

Prout continued the practice of adding flutes, clarinets and trombones to Handel&#x27;s orchestration, but he restored Handel&#x27;s high trumpet parts, which Mozart had omitted (evidently because playing them was a lost art by 1789). There was little dissent from Prout&#x27;s approach, and when Chrysander&#x27;s scholarly edition was published in the same year, it was received respectfully as &quot;a volume for the study&quot; rather than a performing edition, being an edited reproduction of various of Handel&#x27;s manuscript versions. An authentic performance was thought impossible: &quot;The Musical Times&quot; correspondent wrote, &quot;Handel&#x27;s orchestral instruments were all (excepting the trumpet) of a coarser quality than those at present in use; his harpsichords are gone for ever ... the places in which he performed the &#x27;Messiah&#x27; were mere drawing-rooms when compared with the Albert Hall, the Queen&#x27;s Hall and the Crystal Palace. In Australia, &quot;The Register&quot; protested at the prospect of performances by &quot;trumpery little church choirs of 20 voices or so&quot;.

In Germany, &quot;Messiah&quot; was not so often performed as in Britain; when it was given, medium-sized forces were the norm. At the Handel Festival held in 1922 in Handel&#x27;s native town, Halle, his choral works were given by a choir of 163 and an orchestra of 64. In Britain, innovative broadcasting and recording contributed to reconsideration of Handelian performance. For example, in 1928, Beecham conducted a recording of &quot;Messiah&quot; with modestly sized forces and controversially brisk tempi, although the orchestration remained far from authentic. In 1934 and 1935, the BBC broadcast performances of &quot;Messiah&quot; conducted by Adrian Boult with &quot;a faithful adherence to Handel&#x27;s clear scoring.&quot; A performance with authentic scoring was given in Worcester Cathedral as part of the Three Choirs Festival in 1935. In 1950 John Tobin conducted a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with the orchestral forces specified by the composer, a choir of 60, a countertenor alto soloist, and modest attempts at vocal elaboration of the printed notes, in the manner of Handel&#x27;s day. The Prout version sung with many voices remained popular with British choral societies, but at the same time increasingly frequent performances were given by small professional ensembles in suitably sized venues, using authentic scoring. Recordings on LP and CD were preponderantly of the latter type, and the large scale &quot;Messiah&quot; came to seem old-fashioned.

The cause of authentic performance was advanced in 1965 by the publication of a new edition of the score, edited by Watkins Shaw. In the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, David Scott writes, &quot;the edition at first aroused suspicion on account of its attempts in several directions to break the crust of convention surrounding the work in the British Isles.&quot; By the time of Shaw&#x27;s death in 1996, &quot;The Times&quot; described his edition as &quot;now in universal use&quot;.

&quot;Messiah&quot; remains Handel&#x27;s best-known work, with performances particularly popular during the Advent season; writing in December 1993, the music critic Alex Ross refers to that month&#x27;s 21 performances in New York alone as &quot;numbing repetition&quot;. Against the general trend towards authenticity, the work has been staged in opera houses, both in London (2009) and in Paris (2011). The Mozart score is revived from time to time, and in Anglophone countries &quot;singalong&quot; performances with many hundreds of performers are popular. Although performances striving for authenticity are now usual, it is generally agreed that there can never be a definitive version of &quot;Messiah&quot;; the surviving manuscripts contain radically different settings of many numbers, and vocal and instrumental ornamentation of the written notes is a matter of personal judgment, even for the most historically informed performers. The Handel scholar Winton Dean has written:

===Organisation and numbering of movements===
The numbering of the movements shown here is in accordance with the Novello vocal score (1959), edited by Watkins Shaw, which adapts the numbering earlier devised by Ebenezer Prout. Other editions count the movements slightly differently; the Bärenreiter edition of 1965, for example, does not number the recitatives and runs from 1 to 47. The division into parts and scenes is based upon the 1743 word-book prepared for the first London performance. The scene headings are given as Burrows summarised the scene headings by Jennens.

===Overview===

Handel&#x27;s music for &quot;Messiah&quot; is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel&#x27;s restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus &quot;Glory to God&quot;, apart from the solo in &quot;The trumpet shall sound&quot; they are heard only in &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and the final chorus &quot;Worthy is the Lamb&quot;. It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: &quot;Increase them and the thrill is diminished&quot;. In &quot;Glory to God&quot;, Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as &quot;da lontano e un poco piano&quot;, meaning &quot;quietly, from afar&quot;; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (&quot;in disparte&quot;) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, &quot;a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III&quot; according to Luckett.

Although &quot;Messiah&quot; is not in any particular key, Handel&#x27;s tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as &quot;an aspiration towards D major&quot;, the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the &quot;trumpet&quot; movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the &quot;ascending fourth&quot; as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of &quot;I know that my Redeemer liveth&quot; and on numerous other occasions. Nevertheless, Luckett finds this thesis implausible, and asserts that &quot;the unity of &quot;Messiah&quot; is a consequence of nothing more arcane than the quality of Handel&#x27;s attention to his text, and the consistency of his musical imagination&quot;. Allan Kozinn, &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic, finds &quot;a model marriage of music and text ... From the gentle falling melody assigned to the opening words (&quot;Comfort ye&quot;) to the sheer ebullience of the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus and the ornate celebratory counterpoint that supports the closing &quot;Amen&quot;, hardly a line of text goes by that Handel does not amplify&quot;.

===Part I===
The opening &quot;Sinfony&quot; is composed in E minor for strings, and is Handel&#x27;s first use in oratorio of the French overture form. Jennens commented that the &quot;Sinfony&quot; contains &quot;passages far unworthy of Handel, but much more unworthy of the Messiah&quot;; Handel&#x27;s early biographer Charles Burney merely found it &quot;dry and uninteresting&quot;. A change of key to E major leads to the first prophecy, delivered by the tenor whose vocal line in the opening recitative &quot;Comfort ye&quot; is entirely independent of the strings accompaniment. The music proceeds through various key changes as the prophecies unfold, culminating in the G major chorus &quot;For unto us a child is born&quot;, in which the choral exclamations (which include an ascending fourth in &quot;the Mighty God&quot;) are imposed on material drawn from Handel&#x27;s Italian cantata &quot;Nò, di voi non-vo&#x27;fidarmi&quot;. Such passages, says the music historian Donald Jay Grout, &quot;reveal Handel the dramatist, the unerring master of dramatic effect&quot;.

The pastoral interlude that follows begins with the short instrumental movement, the &quot;Pifa&quot;, which takes its name from the shepherd-bagpipers, or &quot;pifferari&quot;, who played their pipes in the streets of Rome at Christmas time. Handel wrote the movement in both 11-bar and extended 32-bar forms; according to Burrows, either will work in performance. The group of four short recitatives which follow it introduce the soprano soloist—although often the earlier aria &quot;But who may abide&quot; is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor form. The final recitative of this section is in D major and heralds the affirmative chorus &quot;Glory to God&quot;. The remainder of Part I is largely carried by the soprano in B-flat, in what Burrows terms a rare instance of tonal stability. The aria &quot;He shall feed his flock&quot; underwent several transformations by Handel, appearing at different times as a recitative, an alto aria and a duet for alto and soprano before the original soprano version was restored in 1754. The appropriateness of the Italian source material for the setting of the solemn concluding chorus &quot;His yoke is easy&quot; has been questioned by the music scholar Sedley Taylor, who calls it &quot;a piece of word-painting ... grievously out of place&quot;, though he concedes that the four-part choral conclusion is a stroke of genius that combines beauty with dignity.

===Part II===
The second Part begins in G minor, a key which, in Christopher Hogwood&#x27;s phrase, brings a mood of &quot;tragic presentiment&quot; to the long sequence of Passion numbers which follows. The declamatory opening chorus &quot;Behold the Lamb of God&quot;, in fugal form, is followed by the alto solo &quot;He was despised&quot; in E-flat major, the longest single item in the oratorio, in which some phrases are sung unaccompanied to emphasise Christ&#x27;s abandonment. Luckett records Burney&#x27;s description of this number as &quot;the highest idea of excellence in pathetic expression of any English song&quot;. The subsequent series of mainly short choral movements cover Christ&#x27;s Passion, Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection, at first in F minor, with a brief F major respite in &quot;All we like sheep&quot;. Here, Handel&#x27;s use of &quot;Nò, di voi non-vo&#x27;fidarmi&quot; has Sedley Taylor&#x27;s unqualified approval: &quot;[Handel] bids the voices enter in solemn canonical sequence, and his chorus ends with a combination of grandeur and depth of feeling such as is at the command of consummate genius only&quot;.

The sense of desolation returns, in what Hogwood calls the &quot;remote and barbarous&quot; key of B-flat minor, for the tenor recitative &quot;All they that see him&quot;. The sombre sequence finally ends with the Ascension chorus &quot;Lift up your heads&quot;, which Handel initially divides between two choral groups, the altos serving both as the bass line to a soprano choir and the treble line to the tenors and basses. For the 1754 Foundling Hospital performance Handel added two horns, which join in when the chorus unites towards the end of the number. After the celebratory tone of Christ&#x27;s reception into heaven, marked by the choir&#x27;s D major acclamation &quot;Let all the angels of God worship him&quot;, the &quot;Whitsun&quot; section proceeds through a series of contrasting moods—serene and pastoral in &quot;How beautiful are the feet&quot;, theatrically operatic in &quot;Why do the nations so furiously rage&quot;—towards the Part II culmination of Hallelujah.
The &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus, as Young points out, is not the climactic chorus of the work, although one cannot escape its &quot;contagious enthusiasm&quot;. It builds from a deceptively light orchestral opening, through a short, unison cantus firmus passage on the words &quot;For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth&quot; (the theme based on the fugue theme from Corelli&#x27;s &quot;Fuga a Quattro Voci&quot;), to the reappearance of the long-silent trumpets at &quot;And He shall reign for ever and ever&quot;. Commentators have noted that the musical line for this third subject is based on &quot;Wachet auf&quot;, Philipp Nicolai&#x27;s popular Lutheran chorale.

===Part III===
The opening soprano solo in E major, &quot;I know that my Redeemer liveth&quot; is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney&#x27;s eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass&#x27;s declamation in D major: &quot;Behold, I tell you a mystery&quot;, then the long aria &quot;The trumpet shall sound&quot;, marked &#x27; (&quot;dignified but not fast&quot;). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel&#x27;s awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of &quot;incorruptible&quot; may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone&#x27;s comment that he &quot;could observe some parts in &quot;Messiah&quot; wherein Handel&#x27;s judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even &quot;opposite&quot;, to what the words required&quot;. After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel&#x27;s final version of the music, &quot;O death, where is thy sting?&quot; The melody is adapted from Handel&#x27;s 1722 cantata &#x27;, and is in Luckett&#x27;s view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus &quot;But thanks be to God&quot;.

The reflective soprano solo &quot;If God be for us&quot; (originally written for alto) quotes Luther&#x27;s chorale &quot;&quot;. It ushers in the D major choral finale: &quot;Worthy is the Lamb&quot;, leading to the apocalyptic &quot;Amen&quot; in which, says Hogwood, &quot;the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven&quot;. Handel&#x27;s first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer &quot;rising still higher&quot; than in &quot;that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus&quot;. Young writes that the &quot;Amen&quot; should, in the manner of Palestrina, &quot;be delivered as though through the aisles and ambulatories of some great church&quot;.

==Recordings==
Many early recordings of individual choruses and arias from &quot;Messiah&quot; reflect the performance styles then fashionable—large forces, slow tempi and liberal reorchestration. Typical examples are choruses conducted by Sir Henry Wood, recorded in 1926 for Columbia with the 3,500-strong choir and orchestra of the Crystal Palace Handel Festival, and a contemporary rival disc from His Master&#x27;s Voice (HMV) featuring the Royal Choral Society under Sargent, recorded at the Royal Albert Hall.

The first near-complete recording of the whole work (with the cuts then customary) was conducted by Beecham in 1928. It represented an effort by Beecham to &quot;provide an interpretation which, in his opinion, was nearer the composer&#x27;s intentions&quot;, with smaller forces and faster tempi than had become traditional. His contralto soloist, Muriel Brunskill, later commented, &quot;His tempi, which are now taken for granted, were revolutionary; he entirely revitalised it&quot;. Nevertheless, Sargent retained the large-scale tradition in his four HMV recordings, the first in 1946 and three more in the 1950s and 1960s, all with the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Beecham&#x27;s second recording of the work, in 1947, &quot;led the way towards more truly Handelian rhythms and speeds&quot;, according to the critic Alan Blyth. In a 1991 study of all 76 complete &quot;Messiahs&quot; recorded by that date, the writer Teri Noel Towe called this version of Beecham&#x27;s &quot;one of a handful of truly stellar performances&quot;.

In 1954 the first recording based on Handel&#x27;s original scoring was conducted by Hermann Scherchen for Nixa, quickly followed by a version, judged scholarly at the time, under Sir Adrian Boult for Decca. By the standards of 21st-century performance, however, Scherchen&#x27;s and Boult&#x27;s tempi were still slow, and there was no attempt at vocal ornamentation by the soloists. In 1966 and 1967 two new recordings were regarded as great advances in scholarship and performance practice, conducted respectively by Colin Davis for Philips and Charles Mackerras for His Master&#x27;s Voice. They inaugurated a new tradition of brisk, small-scale performances, with vocal embellishments by the solo singers. A 1967 performance of Messiah by the Ambrosian Singers conducted by John McCarthy accompanying the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Charles Mackerras was nominated for a Grammy Award. Among recordings of older-style performances are Beecham&#x27;s 1959 recording with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, with orchestration commissioned from Sir Eugene Goossens and completed by the English composer Leonard Salzedo, Karl Richter&#x27;s 1973 version for Deutsche Grammophon, and David Willcocks&#x27;s 1995 performance based on Prout&#x27;s 1902 edition of the score, with a 325-voice choir and 90-piece orchestra.

By the end of the 1970s the quest for authenticity had extended to the use of period instruments and historically correct styles of playing them. The first of such versions were conducted by the early music specialists Christopher Hogwood (1979) and John Eliot Gardiner (1982). The use of period instruments quickly became the norm on record, although some conductors, among them Sir Georg Solti (1985) and Sir Andrew Davis (1989) continued to favour modern instruments. &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine and &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot; highlighted two versions, conducted respectively by Trevor Pinnock (1988) and Richard Hickox (1992). The latter employs a chorus of 24 singers and an orchestra of 31 players; Handel is known to have used a chorus of 19 and an orchestra of 37. Performances on an even smaller scale have followed.

Several reconstructions of early performances have been recorded: the 1742 Dublin version by Scherchen in 1954, and again in 1959, and by Jean-Claude Malgoire in 1980. In 1976, the London version of 1743 was recorded by Neville Marriner for Decca. It featured different music, alternative versions of numbers and different orchestration. There are several recordings of the 1754 Foundling Hospital version, including those under Hogwood (1979), Andrew Parrott (1989), and Paul McCreesh. In 1973 David Willcocks conducted a set for His Master&#x27;s Voice in which all the soprano arias were sung in unison by the boys of the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and in 1974, for Deutsche Grammophon, Mackerras conducted a set of Mozart&#x27;s reorchestrated version, sung in German.

==Editions==
The first published score of 1767, together with Handel&#x27;s documented adaptations and recompositions of various movements, has been the basis for many performing versions since the composer&#x27;s lifetime. Modern performances which seek authenticity tend to be based on one of three 20th-century performing editions. These all use different methods of numbering movements:

* The Novello Edition, edited by Watkins Shaw, first published as a vocal score in 1959, revised and issued 1965. This uses the numbering first used in the Prout edition of 1902.
* The Bärenreiter Edition, edited by John Tobin, published in 1965, which forms the basis of the &quot;Messiah&quot; numbering in Bernd Baselt&#x27;s catalogue (HWV) of Handel&#x27;s works, published in 1984.
* The Peters Edition, edited by Donald Burrows, vocal score published 1972, which uses an adaptation of the numbering devised by Kurt Soldan.
* The Van Camp Edition, edited by Leonard Van Camp, published by Roger Dean Publishing, 1993 rev. 1995 (now Lorenz pub.).
* The Oxford University Press edition by Clifford Bartlett, 1998.
* The Carus-Verlag Edition, edited by Ton Koopman and Jan H. Siemons, published in 2009 (using the HWV numbering).

The edition edited by Chrysander and Max Seiffert for the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft (Berlin, 1902) is not a general performing edition, but has been used as a basis of scholarship and research.

In addition to Mozart&#x27;s well-known reorchestration, arrangements for larger orchestral forces exist by Goossens and Andrew Davis; both have been recorded at least once, on the RCA and Chandos labels respectively.

<text>RSPB Leighton Moss is a nature reserve in Lancashire, England, which has been in the care of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds since 1964. It is situated near Silverdale, Carnforth, on the edge of Morecambe Bay and in the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Leighton Moss contains the largest area of reed bed in north-west England. The site provides habitats for many species of wildlife, including bearded tits, marsh harriers, bitterns, otters and red deer. As a wetland of international importance, it was designated a Ramsar site in 1985. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area, and an Important Bird Area.

The RSPB also protects a large area of Morecambe Bay, where a saltmarsh provides a habitat for birds such as avocets. 

== History ==
In 1822 the moss came into the possession of Richard Gillow, grandson of the Lancaster furniture manufacturer Robert Gillow. Using steam technology, Gillow drained the moss for agriculture. Although the soil is of good quality, by 1918 the land was flooded again, as drainage appeared to have become uneconomic when the price of coal was high. The area was used for duck shooting.

The RSPB initially leased the moss in 1964, before purchasing it from the Leighton Hall estate in 1974. The site was first opened to visitors in 1965 on a permit-only basis, receiving 375 visitors in its first year.

Despite owning the land, the shooting rights were still owned by the Leighton Hall estate until 1984, when they were sold to the RSPB.

== Facilities ==
The site is open to the public everyday except Christmas Day, with car parks, a Visitor Centre, shop (selling bird food, binoculars and nature-themed gifts), a cafe and an education room. There are a number of nature trails, seven wildlife watching hides and a variety of events.  

Some of the seven wildlife observation hides were renewed in 2012 with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. One is named after comedian Eric Morecambe.
A nine-metre high Skytower provides extensive views over the nature reserve. Plans were announced in 2024 to replace the Lower Hide on the site. 

==Flora and Fauna==
The site is well known for its breeding populations of bittern, marsh harrier and bearded tit. In 2021, it was reported that six booming male bitterns were present on the site. In the spring, a distinctive sound can be heard at the reserve, with male bitterns emitting noises similar to “the sound you hear when you blow on the top of a glass milk bottle” to attract a mate. Other regularly seen bird species include marsh tit, water rail and many wildfowl species such as common pochard and Eurasian teal. Red deer and otters are also present on the reserve. 

The site is also known for its breeding avocet colony, with a record of 40 chicks having fledged at the site in 2012.

Due to its proximity to the coast, the reserve has attracted rarer species, with species such as osprey, Eurasian spoonbill, black tern and little gull recorded at the site on a fairly regular basis. Rare birds present at the site have included red-footed falcon, purple heron, Caspian tern, great reed warbler and Savi&#x27;s warbler, whilst more recently, rarities have included American wigeon, great grey shrike, green-winged teal and European honey-buzzard in 2019.

== Management ==
The extensive reed beds are managed to prevent them from drying out and also to prevent saline intrusion from the coast. Despite such control of ecological succession, the breeding bittern population (measured by &quot;booming&quot; males) suffered declines in the 1990s and 2000s. Following extensive dynamic habitat management in recent years the number of bitterns is steadily increasing.

In 2015 there was controversy about a plan to cull small numbers of red deer, which create significant damage to the reedbeds.

== Media interest ==
In 2013 Leighton Moss hosted the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Autumnwatch&quot; programme. The programme returned in 2014.

== Opening times ==
The reserve and visitor centre are open daily all year round (except Christmas Day) from 9 am to dusk and the visitor centre from 9.30 am – 5 pm (4.30 pm November–January inclusive). Entrance is free for RSPB members, and half price for those who come by public transport, bicycle or on foot. Silverdale railway station is just a few minutes&#x27; walk away. The reserve is on a proposed cycle way around Morecambe Bay.

<text>Mayagüez (, ) is the ninth-largest municipality in Puerto Rico. It was founded as Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Mayagüez (Township of Our Lady of Candelaria), and is also known as &quot;La Sultana del Oeste&quot; (The Sultaness of the West), &quot;Ciudad de las Aguas Puras&quot; (City of Pure Waters), or &quot;Ciudad del Mangó&quot; (Mango City). On April 6, 1894, the Spanish Crown granted it the formal title of &quot;Excelente Ciudad de Mayagüez&quot; (Excellent City of Mayagüez). Mayagüez is located in the center of the western coast on the island of Puerto Rico. It has a population of 73,077, and it is the principal city of the Mayagüez Metropolitan Statistical Area (pop. 213,831) and the Mayagüez–Aguadilla, PR Combined Statistical Area (pop. 467,599).

==History==

The Mayagüez Metro Area (and part of Añasco) lies today on two former Taíno Cacicazgos (chiefdoms): Yaguex and Yagüeca, a region noted for its record of colonial resistance (i.e., Urayoán and Legend of Diego Salcedo). The Tainos constituted the majority of the island&#x27;s inhabitants at the time of contact with Europeans in 1493 and called it Borikén or Borinquen. Today, this appellation and its variations continue to designate the Island of Puerto Rico and its people. The Taínos came from South American branches of Arawakan speakers, more specifically from modern-day Venezuela, and lived in small villages, organized their society in clans and named their chiefs Cacique. They were farmers who domesticated crops as pineapples, cassava, and sweet potatoes supplemented by fish and seafood.
Mayagüez was founded on September 18, 1760, by a group led by brothers Faustino and Lorenzo Martínez de Matos, Juan de Silva and Juan de Aponte, at a hill located about one kilometer inland from Mayagüez Bay and the outlet of the Yagüez River. The Spanish Crown granted the founders the right to self-government in 1763, formally separating the town from the larger &quot;Partido de San Germán&quot;. The settlement was named Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Mayagüez (&quot;Our Lady of Candelaria of Mayagüez&quot;) to evoke an apparition of the Virgin Mary on the island of Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands. Most of the town&#x27;s settlers, including its founders, migrated from the archipelago, whose patron saint is the Virgin of Candelaria.

On May 7, 1836, the settlement was elevated to the royal status of villa, and Rafael Mangual was named its first mayor. At the time, the villa&#x27;s principal economic activity was agriculture. The famous patriot, educator, sociologist, philosopher, essayist and novelist Eugenio María de Hostos was born in Mayagüez in 1839. On July 10, 1877, the villa received its city charter from the Royal Crown of Spain.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States.In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Mayagüez was 35,700, making it one of the largest towns in Puerto Rico at the time.

The city&#x27;s main Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of the Candelaria, was built in a plot consecrated on August 21, 1760. Its first masonry building was erected in 1780. The current church was built in 1836, and was rebuilt in 1922. The redesign by architect Luis Perocier sought to restore the building to its original splendor. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake had destroyed the temple&#x27;s ceiling, and a lightning bolt struck and tore down a wedge-shaped corner of one of its two bell towers. However, lack of proper funding and the extent of the damage of the original structure forced the rebuilding to be scaled-down considerably.

In 1911, the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts was founded in Mayagüez. Today it is known as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM)—the Caribbean&#x27;s leading engineering institution.

Between 1962 and 1998 Mayagüez was a major tuna canning and processing center. At one time, 80% of all tuna products consumed in the United States were packed in Mayagüez (the biggest employer, StarKist, had 11,000 employees working three daily shifts in the local plant&#x27;s heyday). Mayagüez was also a major textile industry hub; almost a quarter of all drill uniforms used by the United States Army were sewn in the city. Today, Mayagüez is the fifth-largest city in Puerto Rico and is considered one of the most important cities in the island. The city is centered on the impressive Spanish-style main square Plaza Colón, a tribute to Christopher Columbus, whose statue stands in the middle of the square, surrounded by 16 bronze statues.

Mayagüez has become a major college town with the establishment of the UPRM, the now closed Eugenio María de Hostos Law School and the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico.

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Mayagüez, losses were described as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. The storm triggered numerous landslides in Mayagüez. In some areas of Mayagüez, there were over 25 landslides per square mile due to the deluge.

==Geography==
Mayagüez is located near the geographical center of the west coast of Puerto Rico about two to three hours by automobile from San Juan. Its land area is 77.6 square miles (201.06 km2). The city&#x27;s terrain includes; coast plains, river valleys, marshland, hills and mountains. Of its multiple rivers and streams, the two most important are the Río Yagüez, which flows from the Central Mountain Range through downtown until it empties into the Mona Passage; and the Río Guanajibo, which flows through several neighborhoods in the southern portion of the municipality until it empties in the Mona Passage.

===National protected areas===
The Desecheo National Wildlife Refuge on Desecheo Island is a protected area.

To the north of the El Maní community in Mayagüez is the Boquilla Creek Wildlife Reserve (&quot;Reserva Natural del Caño de la Boquilla&quot;), a protected area and the habitat of endangered species.

==Climate==
Mayagüez has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). The city has the most extreme weather of the island. The high frequency of severe storms in the summer can produce strong winds, floods, waterspouts, and sometimes hail and even tornadoes. The average annual temperature is . Winter is usually quite dry and warm, with temperatures between and . Summer is usually very hot and humid, with temperatures reaching , with heat index of up to . From May to October, most evenings experience strong thunderstorms, due to heat, humidity and the topography of the area.

===Contributions to Puerto Rican gastronomy===
Mayagüez&#x27;s contributions to Puerto Rican gastronomy have been many, and a few of these are known outside Puerto Rico. Besides being host to one of the largest concentrations of mango trees in the island, the city has been a host to various food enterprises whose products are popular in Puerto Rico (and elsewhere):
* – literally &quot;gypsy arm&quot;, is the locally produced Swiss or jelly roll, originally from Spain. E. Franco &amp; Co., a bakery, food importer, and restaurant established in the late 1850s, is the best-known provider of in town. Another (more recent) provider is Ricomini Bakery, whose central store in downtown Mayagüez has been open for over 100 years.

It had been bottled by hand by the bartender since the mid-1970s. &quot;Sangría de Fido&quot; has a sizeable reputation outside Puerto Rico, and can claim tasters from as far away as California and Spain. E &amp; J Gallo once awarded Aponte with a &quot;Customer of the Year&quot; award and flew him to their headquarters. Aponte was reportedly offered $250,000 by Bacardi to sell his original recipe once, to which he refused.
*Bolo&#x27;s Sorullitos – a now-defunct operation that originated at Bolo&#x27;s Restaurant, a seaside eatery next to Mayagüez Bay, which produced sorullitos, or fried cornsticks, along with mayo-ketchup, a dip made of mayonnaise, ketchup, and garlic extract.

*Tuna fish – At one time, StarKist, Chicken of the Sea, and Bumble Bee produced 80% of their collective production for consumption in the United States in Mayagüez. The last remaining tuna fish cannery closed in 2012 when Bumble Bee shuttered their operation.

==Symbols==
The has an official flag and coat of arms.

===Flag===
The wide cross represents Christianity brought to the New World by Christopher Columbus, who signed his documents with the phrase and the motto &quot;Christ Ferens&quot;, which means: &quot;He who has Christ.&quot; The blue and white waves between the third and fourth quarters recall the coat of arms granted to Columbus by kings Ferdinand and Isabella. The waves represent the ocean (and particularly the Mona Passage) through which he sailed to bring the gospel to these new lands. The blue and white waves symbolize the Yagüez River and evokes the nickname &quot;City of Pure Waters&quot;. The red and white flames on the flag symbolize the traditional bonfires of Day of Our Lady of Candelaria (&quot;Día de La Candelaria&quot;), ignited in honor of the city&#x27;s patron saint (a tradition started for Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands). The flag was officially adopted with the signing of City Ordinance 38, signed December 3, 1996.

===Coat of arms===
According to the Puerto Rican historian Federico Cedó Alzamora, the original version of the coat of arms of Mayagüez was given to the city December 19, 1894, by the Queen Regent of Spain Maria Christina of Austria. The upper half of the coat of arms shows the columbine coat of arms recalls and commemorates the discovery of the Island of Borinquén (Puerto Rico) by Columbus in his second trip to the New World in 1493. The lower half of the coat of arms shows a stylized version of Columbus&#x27;s landing on Puerto Rico. The explorer&#x27;s crew disembarked at the western coast of the island, where several rivers spill their waters in the Mona Passage, among them the Yagüez, from which the name of Mayagüez is derived. The present version was reinterpreted by heraldist Roberto Biascochea Lota.

===Anthem===
The city&#x27;s anthem was written by pianist and former music teacher Luciano Quiñones, a long-time resident and now &quot;adopted son&quot; of the city. Until this song&#x27;s adoption, the plena &quot;A Mayagüez&quot;, written by César Concepción, was used by many as an unofficial city song. Quiñones&#x27; composition was the winner of a contest sponsored by the city&#x27;s municipality in 2003.

Mayor José Guillermo Rodríguez and the Municipal Legislature entrusted the Advisory Board of Art and Culture of Mayagüez to hold a contest to select an anthem for the city. The selected composition was a danza by Mr Luciano Quiñones, who has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music, a piano professor the Escuela Libre de Música de Mayagüez, he is a music composer already winning nineteen abarrios in competitions held by the Institute of Puerto Rican culture, and the Circulo de Recreo de San Germán. The lyrics alludes to the emblematic symbols of Mayagüez; its nicknames, to its Patron Saint, its taste of mango, to its sunsets in the bay, to the Taíno, to Eugenio María de Hostos, their role as cultural cradle, the sympathy of the ladies and the dream of its valleys and its mountains.

The anthem was presented to the people in a memorable concert held in commemoration of the 239 anniversary of the founding of the city on the night of September 18, 1999, interpreted by tenor, Mayagüez adopted son, Rafael José Díaz, Mayagüezana lyric soprano, Hilda Ramos, accompanied by the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra conducted by its Associate Director, Mayagüezana Roselyn Pabón, in the same place where such Symphony Orchestra offered his first concert forty years earlier: the Plaza Colón. This danza was recognized as the official anthem of Mayagüez through the Municipal Ordinance number 58, series 1999–2000, adopted on December 20, 1999, by the City Council, which was signed by the Mayor, Honorable José Guillermo Rodríguez on December 24, 1999.

Puerto Rico Highway 2 existing as an arterial road is a primary route between Ponce to the south-east and Aguadilla and Arecibo to the north and north-east respectively. PR-2 is undergoing a conversion to a freeway between Ponce and Mayagüez.

Another important route in Mayagüez is PR-102. It begins at an intersection with PR-2, about 2 miles north of Mayagüez Pueblo at the Mar y Sol development and runs along Mayagüez&#x27;s coastal industrial areas to Joyuda, where it then turns east and terminates in Sabana Grande.

The portion of the highway adjacent to the &quot;Estadio Isidoro Garcia&quot; was upgraded from a two-lane road into an urban boulevard in anticipation of the 2010 Centro-American and Caribbean Games celebrated in Mayagüez. In addition to this upgrade, an elevated by-pass was constructed from the coastal park site over the Yagüez River ending at the Concordia Housing Project.

There are 41 bridges in Mayagüez.

Passenger transportation between Mayagüez and San Juan is operated by the Linea Sultana, another syndicated service.

The city operates three trolleys, free of charge, which run as shuttles between the downtown area and the Palacio de Recreación y Deportes.

The University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) also runs an internal network of trolleys to carry its students inside campus and between UPRM&#x27;s Mayagüez Terrace development and Palacio de Recreación y Deportes, linking here with the city&#x27;s trolley service. There are some proposals to expand the municipal trolley service to serve inside the UPRM.
For the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games the Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Transportation and Public Works released an express public bus system operated with Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses (San Juan&#x27;s Metropolitan Bus Authority) buses specially assigned to serve the city of Mayagüez. During the Mayagüez 2010 Games, this bus network was carrying passengers in a corridor along Highway 2 and some main roads. The UPRM trolleybus network was integrated into this service too. Although suspended after the Mayagüez 2010 Games ended, the system is expected to be re-established shortly.

===Seaport===

The Port of Mayagüez is the third busiest port in Puerto Rico. It was base for several years to several tuna and fish companies who made the port a considerable busy one. It was normal to see 3 to 4 ships docked at any given day but due to the Section 936 termination the industries started to leave until 2000 approximately when only the ferry and the &quot;Federacion de Industria Agropecuaria&quot; silos pier were left. It is located northwest of the central business district along Puerto Rico routes 64, 341, and 3341, and stretches for along the coast. Its main canal is wide and its depth ranges from , the water&#x27;s depth along the piers ranges between . The port is protected from rough seas by reefs which run along its northern and western sections.

On March 16, 2011, a new ferry service to the Dominican Republic was launched by America Cruise Ferries.
Late 2016 the municipal administration awarded an administration contract to a private company after years of legal disputes and non-complying groups involved. The municipal administration had plans of development for the port back to 2004 when they received a portion of port area from the central government (the ferry pier and terminal) but 12 years later the port has seen little to no progress.

===Airport===

Mayagüez&#x27;s airport, Eugenio María de Hostos Airport, also known as El Maní Airport, has had regular airline services for more than thirty years. It is located north of the central business district in the Sabanetas barrio. Before being inaugurated in 1955, the airport served as a military base. In the 1970s it had domestic service from Prinair, then from American Eagle and Eastern Air Lines&#x27;s regional carrier &quot;Eastern Metro Express&quot; in the 1980s. After Eastern went bankrupt in 1991, American Eagle remained the only airline serving the airport until it ended service to the city on April 30, 2005, due to poor loads. For a while, Fina Air served flights to the Dominican Republic before the airline went bankrupt. Cape Air currently serves the airport with five daily flights to San Juan during the high season and three daily flights during the low season.

<text>Where Angels Fear to Tread is a 1905 novel by E. M. Forster. The title comes from a line in Alexander Pope&#x27;s poem &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot;: &quot;For fools rush in where angels fear to tread&quot;.

The BBC adapted the novel for television in 1966 as a &quot;Play of the Month&quot;. In 1991 it was made into a film by Charles Sturridge, starring Rupert Graves, Giovanni Guidelli, Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham Carter, and Judy Davis. A ten-part radio adaptation of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. An opera based on the novel by Mark Weiser was premiered at the Peabody Institute of Music in 1999, and received its professional premiere at Opera San Jose in 2015.

==Plot summary==

On a journey to Tuscany with her young friend and travelling companion Caroline Abbott, widowed Lilia Herriton falls in love with Gino, a handsome Italian man much younger than herself, and decides to stay. Furious, her dead husband&#x27;s family send Lilia&#x27;s brother-in-law Philip to Italy to prevent a misalliance, but he arrives too late. Lilia has already married Gino and becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to a son, but dies in childbirth. Caroline decides to go to Tuscany again to save the child from what she perceives will be a difficult life. Not to be outdone, the Herritons send Philip again to Italy, this time accompanied by his sister Harriet, to save the family&#x27;s reputation. In the public eye, they make it known that it is both their right and their duty to travel to Italy to obtain custody of the infant so that he can be raised as an Englishman. Secretly, though, they have no regard for the child, only public appearances.

Philip and Harriet meet Caroline in Monteriano. Both Philip and Caroline eventually fall under the charm of Italy, which causes them to waver in their original purpose. They further learn that Gino is fiercely devoted to his and Lilia&#x27;s infant son. As they admit defeat in their mission however, Harriet kidnaps the baby, but the baby is accidentally killed when the carriage he is in overturns. Gino, hearing the news, attacks Phillip, but the two are reconciled after Caroline&#x27;s mediation. Gino&#x27;s physical outburst toward Philip in response to the news makes Philip realise what it is like to truly be alive. The guilt felt by Harriet causes her to lose her mind. Finally, as Philip and Caroline return to England, he realises that he is in love with Caroline but that he can never be with her, because she admits, dramatically, to being in love with Gino.

==Writing==
With a working title of &quot;The Rescue&quot;, Forster began the novel in late 1904, completing ten chapters in one month. He modelled the character of Philip Herriton on Professor Edward J Dent. &quot;He knew this, and took an interest in his own progress&quot;, said Forster. The author proposed to call the book &quot;Monteriano&quot; but the publishers didn&#x27;t like it. It was Dent who contributed the final title.

==Critical reception==
The reviewer for UK daily newspaper &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; (forerunner of &quot;The Guardian&quot;) wrote in August 1905: &quot;&quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; is not at all the kind of book that its title suggests. It is not mawkish or sentimental or commonplace. The motive of the story […] is familiar and ordinary enough, but the setting and treatment of this motive are almost startlingly original&quot;. The review noted &quot;a persistent vein of cynicism which is apt to repel, but the cynicism is not deep-seated. […] [I]t takes the form of a sordid comedy culminating, unexpectedly and with a real dramatic force, in a grotesque tragedy.&quot; It concluded by saying, &quot;We wonder whether EM Forster could be a little more charitable without losing in force and originality. An experiment might be worth trying.&quot;

Lionel Trilling wrote, &quot;Forster&#x27;s first novel appeared in 1905. The author was 26, not a remarkable age at which to have written a first novel unless the novel be, as Forster&#x27;s was, a whole and mature work dominated by a fresh and commanding intelligence&quot;.

<doc id="149135" wikidata="Q524737" url="?curid=149135" title="Mayaguez incident">
<text>The &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident took place between Kampuchea (now Cambodia) and the United States from 12 to 15 May 1975, less than a month after the Khmer Rouge took control of the capital Phnom Penh ousting the U.S.-backed Khmer Republic. After the Khmer Rouge seized the U.S. merchant vessel in a disputed maritime area, the U.S. mounted a hastily-prepared rescue operation. U.S. Marines recaptured the ship and attacked the island of Koh Tang where it was believed that the crew were being held as hostages. 
Encountering stronger-than-expected defences on Koh Tang, three United States Air Force helicopters were destroyed during the initial assault and the Marines fought a desperate day-long battle with the Khmer Rouge before being evacuated. The &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew were released unharmed by the Khmer Rouge shortly after the attack on Koh Tang began. The names of the Americans killed, including three Marines left behind on Koh Tang after the battle and subsequently executed by the Khmer Rouge, are the last names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

==Background==
In 1939 during the French colonial period an administrative line was drawn between Cambodia and French Cochinchina known as the Brevie Line, named after Jules Brévié then governor-general of French Indochina. While not intended to determine sovereignty, the Brevie Line became the de facto maritime border between Cambodia and Vietnam. In 1967 Prince Norodom Sihanouk then Prime Minister of Cambodia agreed with North Vietnam that the borders of Cambodia and Vietnam were those drawn by the French in order to prevent any further Vietnamese claims on Cambodian territory.

Following the Fall of Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge moved to take control of all of Cambodia from the residual Khmer Republic forces. With the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge demanded that all People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong forces leave their base areas in Cambodia, but the PAVN refused to leave certain areas which they claimed were Vietnamese territory. The PAVN also moved to take control of a number of islands formerly controlled by the now-defunct South Vietnam and other territories and islands contested between Vietnam and Cambodia.

On 1 May 1975 Khmer Rouge forces landed on Phú Quốc which was claimed by Cambodia but controlled by South Vietnam. On 10 May the Khmer Rouge captured the Thổ Chu Islands, where they evacuated and later executed 500 Vietnamese civilians. The PAVN launched a counterattack evicting the Khmer Rouge from Phú Quốc and Thổ Chu and attacked Cambodia&#x27;s Poulo Wai island.

As part of these island battles, the Khmer Navy actively patrolled Cambodian coastal waters both to stop Vietnamese incursions and also for fear that merchant ships could be used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to supply opponents of the new Khmer Rouge regime. On 2 May the Khmer Navy captured seven Thai fishing boats. On 4 May the Cambodians pursued a South Korean freighter after which the South Korean Transportation Ministry put out a warning about shipping in the area. On 7 May they held a Panamanian vessel near Poulo Wai and questioned its crew before releasing them and their ship after 36 hours. They fired on a Swedish vessel in the same area. On 12 May the Khmer Rouge sent a force to occupy Poulo Wai. Despite these actions no general warning was issued to U.S. merchant shipping.

Cambodia had claimed of territorial waters since 1969 and had boarded ships on this basis. The U.S. did not recognize 12 nautical mile territorial waters claims in 1975, recognizing only , and categorized the waters near Poulo Wai as international sea lanes on the high seas.

==Khmer Rouge seize the &quot;Mayaguez&quot;==
The crisis began on the afternoon of 12 May 1975, as the U.S. container ship , owned by Sea-Land Service Inc., passed nearby Poulo Wai en route from Hong Kong to Sattahip, Thailand. U.S. military reports state that the seizure took place off the island, but crew members brought evidence in a later legal action that &quot;Mayaguez&quot; had sailed about off Poulo Wai and was not flying a flag.

At 14:18, a Khmer Navy Swift Boat was sighted approaching the &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. The Khmer Rouge fired across the bow of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and when Captain Charles T. Miller ordered the engine room to slow down to manoeuvring speed to avoid the machine-gun fire, the Khmer Rouge then fired a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) across the bow of the ship. Miller ordered the transmission of an SOS and then stopped the ship. Seven Khmer Rouge soldiers boarded &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and their leader, Battalion Commander Sa Mean, pointed at a map indicating that the ship should proceed to the east of Poulo Wai.

One of the crew members broadcast a Mayday which was picked up by an Australian vessel. &quot;Mayaguez&quot; arrived off Poulo Wai at approximately 16:00 and another 20 Khmer Rouge boarded the vessel. Sa Mean indicated that &quot;Mayaguez&quot; should proceed to Ream on the Cambodian mainland, but Captain Miller showed that the ship&#x27;s radar was not working and mimed the ship hitting rocks and sinking. Sa Mean radioed his superiors and was apparently instructed to stay at Poulo Wai, dropping anchor at 16:55.

&quot;Mayaguez&quot; was carrying 107 containers of routine cargo, 77 containers of government and military cargo, and 90 empty containers, all insured for $5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The Khmer Rouge never inspected the containers, and exact contents have not been disclosed, but &quot;Mayaguez&quot; had loaded containers from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon nine days before the fall of Saigon. The captain had a U.S. government letter only to be opened in certain emergency circumstances, which he destroyed.

==President Ford reacts==
&quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s SOS and Mayday signals were picked up by a number of listeners including an employee of Delta Exploration Company in Jakarta, Indonesia, who notified the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. By 05:12 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) the first news of the incident reached the National Military Command Center (NMCC) in Washington, D.C.

President Gerald Ford was informed of the seizure of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; at his morning briefing with his deputy assistant for national security affairs, Brent Scowcroft. At 12:05 EDT (23:05 Cambodia), a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) was convened to discuss the situation. Meanwhile, the NMCC ordered Admiral Noel Gayler, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC), to launch reconnaissance aircraft to locate &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. The members of the NSC were determined to end the crisis decisively, believing that the fall of South Vietnam less than two weeks before, and the forced withdrawal of the United States from Cambodia (Operation Eagle Pull) and South Vietnam (Operation Frequent Wind) had severely damaged the U.S. reputation.

They also wished to avoid comparisons to the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident of 1968, where the failure to promptly use military force to halt the capture of a U.S. intelligence ship by North Korea led to an eleven-month hostage situation. Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller insisted that &quot;this will be seen as a test case... judged in South Korea.&quot; saying further &quot;I think a violent response is in order. The world should know that we will act and that we will act quickly.&quot; The &quot;Pueblo&quot; was not Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s preferred historical analogy, however. Instead, he was thinking of the 1969 EC-121 shootdown by a North Korean military aircraft over the Sea of Japan. Kissinger thought the US reaction to the North Korean downing of the US Navy’s EC-121 in international airspace with the loss of all 31 crewmen was exactly what they should avoid. Kissinger later told the security council members, &quot;We assembled forces like crazy. But in the end, we did not do anything.&quot;

It was determined that keeping &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and her crew away from the Cambodian mainland was essential. Since the United States had no diplomatic contact with the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, Ford instructed Kissinger to urge the People&#x27;s Republic of China to persuade the Khmer Rouge to release &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and her crew.

Following the NSC meeting, the White House issued a press release stating that Ford considered the seizure an act of piracy, though this claim did not have a foundation in maritime law. Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger ordered the military to locate &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and prevent her movement to the Cambodian mainland, employing munitions (including tear gas and sea mines) if necessary.

Kissinger sent a message to the Chinese Liaison Office in Washington demanding the immediate release of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and her crew, but the chief of the Liaison Office refused to accept the note. Kissinger then instructed George H. W. Bush, the head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing, to deliver the note to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and to pass on an oral message that &quot;The Government of the United States demands the immediate release of the vessel and of the full crew. If that release does not immediately take place, the authorities in Phnom Penh will be responsible for the consequences.&quot;

==U.S. rescue preparations==
Following Schlesinger&#x27;s instructions, P-3 Orion aircraft stationed at Naval Air Station (NAS) Cubi Point in the Philippines and at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield in Thailand took off to locate &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. The aircraft carrier , then en route to Australia, was ordered into the area. The destroyer escort and the guided missile destroyer were both ordered to proceed at high speed from the Philippine Sea towards &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s last known location.

An alert order was sent to 1st Battalion 4th Marines (1/4 Marines) at Subic Bay and to the 9th Marine Regiment on Okinawa. A reinforced company from 1/4 Marines was ordered to assemble at NAS Cubi Point for airlift to Thailand, while a 1,100-man Battalion Landing Team (BLT) assembled in Okinawa.

===Locating and stopping &quot;Mayaguez&quot;===
On the early morning of 13 May, the P-3 Orions identified large radar returns near Poulo Wai and dropped flares on the suspected location of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; provoking Khmer Rouge gunfire. Low on fuel, the two Orions returned to base and were replaced with another Orion from Patrol Squadron 17. At 08:16 local time the Orion made a low pass over Poulo Wai positively identifying &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and again drawing Khmer Rouge gunfire.

Shortly afterwards the Khmer Rouge leader, Sa Mean, ordered Captain Miller to get &quot;Mayaguez&quot; underway. At 08:45 &quot;Mayaguez&quot; set off towards the northeast following one of the Swift Boats. The Orion continued to track &quot;Mayaguez&quot; as it left Poulo Wai. Once the location of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; was identified, Admiral Gayler ordered the commander of the Seventh Air Force, Lieutenant General John J. Burns, at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, to move combat aircraft to the area.

At 13:00 two unarmed United States Air Force (USAF) F-111 fighter-bombers diverted from a training mission began making low-level high-speed passes by &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. Once the F-111s had left, Sa Mean ordered Captain Miller to follow the Swift Boats around Koh Tang and drop anchor approximately 1.5 km north of the island. Two F-4 Phantoms soon arrived over &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and began firing their 20 mm cannon into the water in front of the ship. The F-4s were followed by A-7D Corsairs and more F-111s which continued to fire into the sea in front of and behind the ship indicating that no further movement should be attempted.

At 16:15, the Khmer Rouge ordered &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew onto two fishing boats which then took them closer to the shore of Koh Tang.

===U.S. forces assemble===
U.S. Navy warships &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, &quot;Harold E. Holt&quot; and &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; were all scheduled to arrive on station by 15 May, but none of these ships carried any troops. carried a Marine contingent but could not arrive on station until 16 May, while also carried Marines but could not arrive until 18 May.

III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) assigned Task Force 79.9 with recovering &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and designated D Company 1/4 Marines in the Philippines as the unit that would actually retake &quot;Mayaguez&quot;, but Burns wanted additional force and orders were sent to the 3rd Marine Division on Okinawa. 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (BLT 1/9) was then on alert as the primary &quot;air contingency&quot; reaction force, but most of BLT 1/9 were ending their tours of duty and were not subject to further extension of their tours except in the case of emergency. III MAF requested the extension of BLT 1/9&#x27;s tour but this was refused.

The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines (BLT 2/9) (commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Randall W. Austin) was then on a training exercise on Okinawa and it received orders on the night of 13 May to return to camp and prepare for departure by air at dawn on 14 May. On the morning of 14 May BLT 2/9 boarded USAF C-141s at Kadena Air Base to fly to Thailand. The 9th Marine Regiment had been the first U.S. ground combat force committed to the Vietnam War in 1965, but in May 1975 only a few of the officers and non-commissioned officers from BLT 2/9 had seen combat in Vietnam.

Nine USAF HH-53C &quot;Jolly Green&quot; helicopters of the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron and 10 CH-53 &quot;Knives&quot; of the 21st Special Operations Squadron stationed at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base were available for the rescue operation. There were differences between the two types which would become relevant during the battle: the HH-53 was air-refuellable, had 450 US gallon (1,700 L; 370 imp gal) self-sealing fuel tip tanks, a tail minigun with armor plating, and two waist miniguns. The CH-53 was not air-refuellable, had 650 US gallon (2,500 L; 540 imp gal) non-self-sealing tip tanks and two waist miniguns. Thus, the HH-53&#x27;s fuel tanks were less vulnerable to ground fire and, with their refueling capability, could remain in the area of operations indefinitely, so long as it had access to an aerial tanker.

On 13 May Burns and his Seventh Air Force staff developed a contingency plan to retake &quot;Mayaguez&quot; using an assault force composed of men of the USAF 56th Security Police Squadron. 75 volunteers from the 56th would be dropped onto the containers on the decks of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; on the morning of 14 May. In preparation for this assault five HH-53s and seven CH-53s were ordered to proceed to U-Tapao for staging. At approximately 21:15, one of the 21st SOS CH-53s (68-10933, call sign &quot;Knife 13&quot;) crashed en route to U Tapao, killing 18 security police and its five-man crew.

===Third NSC meeting===
Just before 05:00 EDT on 14 May a message arrived in the Department of State from the US embassy in Tehran. The subject line was &quot;Chinese Embassy Tehran Believes Mayaguez to be Freed Soon.&quot; The Pakistani first secretary had told an American diplomat that a senior Chinese embassy official in Tehran said China was &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the Cambodian seizure of the Mayaguez and expected it to be released soon. The message was passed on to Kissinger who claimed it was of dubious reliability and it was not circulated among the NSC.

Ford chaired an NSC meeting at 10:22 EDT (21:22 Cambodia), where the Air Force rescue plan was cancelled due to the loss of &quot;Knife 13&quot; and the fact that the containers on &quot;Mayaguez&quot; could not bear the weight of the helicopters while rappelling men down would expose them to gunfire. It was decided that it was necessary to wait for the Navy ships to arrive off Koh Tang and for the Marines to assemble in Thailand before a rescue attempt would be mounted. Ford ordered the Air Force to sink any Cambodian boats moving between Koh Tang and the mainland. Following this meeting Kissinger told Ford &quot;This is your first crisis. You should establish a reputation for being too tough to tackle. This is a replay of the EC-121.&quot; 

===Boats interdicted===
Early on the morning of 14 May, the Khmer Rouge loaded &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew onto one of the fishing boats and they left Koh Tang following two of the Swift Boats on a heading for Kampong Som. Two F-111s swept past the fishing boat, followed by a pair of F-4s and a pair of A-7s, which began firing in front of the Swift Boats and then directly at the Swift Boats, causing one of them to turn back to Koh Tang. The jets were then joined by an AC-130H Spectre gunship from the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing which proceeded to engage the second Swift Boat with its cannons.

An A-7D then sprayed the Swift Boat with its 20 mm cannon, sinking it. The fighters then came at the fishing boat dropping bombs and firing their cannon into the water in front of it, spraying the boat with shrapnel. The fighter crews reported back that 30 to 40 Caucasians had been seen on board the fishing boat. Despite Ford&#x27;s order to sink all boats, the jets sought orders from higher command.

===Fourth NSC meeting===
In Washington, Ford convened another NSC meeting at 22:30 EDT (09:30 14 May Cambodia). A communication link had been established between the White House, Seventh Air Force at Nakhon Phanom, CINCPAC in Hawaii and the aircraft circling above Koh Tang allowing for near real-time communications. The circling fighters reported that they could try to shoot the rudder off the fishing boat to stop its progress to Kampong Som, but the NSC decided that the risk of killing &quot;Mayaguez&quot; crew was too great. At 23:00 EDT (10:00 Cambodia) Ford ordered that only tear gas should be dropped on or near the fishing boat, while all patrol boats should be sunk.

The NSC meeting continued to consider the appropriate course to resolve the crisis. It was informed that the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing had refused to pass on the American note intended for the Khmer Rouge, but George Bush reported that they had read the note and that it might have been relayed to the Khmer Rouge. With a diplomatic solution appearing unlikely, General David Jones, acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, presented the NSC with a range of military options. Rescue planning was complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the location of &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew. It was believed that some were still on the ship, some on Koh Tang and others were on the fishing boat bound for Kampong Som. The NSC decided to proceed with a simultaneous attack by Marines to retake &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and attack Koh Tang, together with attacking Cambodian shipping and bombing mainland targets. Kissinger emphasized they needed to &quot;impress the Koreans and the Chinese&quot; with the punitive strikes.

The NSC debated whether to assault Koh Tang on the 15th or 16th. The Pentagon&#x27;s option paper that Jones had distributed explained why a 48-hour delay was advantageous. The primary risk of military operations on the 15th was the &quot;serious disadvantage of slow insertion (270 men per wave at 4+ hour intervals).&quot; Alternatively, with the arrival of the USS &quot;Hancock&quot; in the area, a &quot;coordinated assault at first light on 16 May would &quot;carry lower military risks&quot; and &quot;enhance the prospects of quick success and minimize the loss of life.&quot; However, the paper noted that the disadvantage of going on the 16th was less chance of surprise and more time for the Cambodians to &quot;put forward preconditions for the return of the ship and/or crew.&quot;

When Ford asked for the Pentagon&#x27;s recommendation, Schlesinger deferred to Jones who said &quot;We recommend that we land [on the morning of the 15th] on the island and on the ship.&quot; He told the NSC members the island could be taken with &quot;high assurance of success.&quot; He thought, &quot;The 175 Marines can secure themselves, with gunships and tactical air... When the second group arrives, we can cut off the neck of the island and move out... With somewhat over 600 Marines by nightfall, we should have a good feel for what is there. We can perhaps withdraw the next day.&quot; Jones concluded his presentation by saying &quot;that is the operation as we recommend it, as a joint recommendation from all the Joint Chiefs.&quot;

At 10:10, despite having been hit by tear gas, the fishing boat arrived at Kampong Som. The Khmer Rouge commander at Kampong Som, apparently fearing attack by the Americans, refused to accept responsibility for &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew and so the fishing boat moved further down the coast, dropping anchor off the island of Koh Rong Sanloem. The circling fighters lost track of the fishing boat once it entered the port at Kampong Som, and so this was the location transmitted up the chain of command. At 11:29, U.S. aircraft sank another patrol boat and damaged another four.

1/4 Marines had arrived at U-Tapao from the Philippines at 05:45 on 14 May and had been waiting on standby for a helicopter assault on &quot;Mayaguez&quot;, but as the news of the arrival of the fishing boat at Kampong Som came in the helicopter assault was cancelled. At 14:00, BLT 2/9 began arriving at U-Tapao.

===The rescue plan===
On the afternoon of 14 May, Burns received the order to proceed with a simultaneous assault on Koh Tang and &quot;Mayaguez&quot; timed to begin just before sunrise (05:42) on 15 May. D Company, 1/4 Marines would retake &quot;Mayaguez&quot; while BLT 2/9 Marines would rescue the crew on Koh Tang. With minimal intelligence available regarding the geography of Koh Tang, the commander of BLT 2/9 and his staff took off in a U-21 to make an aerial reconnaissance of the island.

Arriving over Koh Tang at 16:00, they were prevented from closely approaching the island in order not to compromise the secrecy of the mission or draw ground fire, but they determined that the island was so covered in jungle that the only two viable landing zones available were beaches on the west and east shores of the northern portion of Koh Tang. The Defense Intelligence Agency had made an assessment, in part from RF-4C and U-2 reconnaissance flights, that between 150 and 200 Khmer Rouge backed by heavy weapons occupied Koh Tang. This report was conveyed to U-Tapao but was never briefed to the planners (probably due to security classification issues) who believed that only about 20 Cambodian irregulars armed with small arms were on the island.

At 21:00, the rescue plan was finalized. Six hundred Marines from BLT 2/9 — composed of E and G Companies — were assigned to conduct a combat assault in five CH-53 &quot;Knives&quot; and three HH-53 &quot;Jolly Greens&quot; to seize and hold Koh Tang. Two helicopters would make a diversionary assault on the West Beach (), while six helicopters would make the main assault on the wider East Beach (). The East Beach force would move to the nearby compound where &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew was believed to be held and then move across and link up with the West Beach force.

Two more waves of helicopters would be required to deploy all of BLT 2/9 to Koh Tang. The flight from U-Tapao to Koh Tang was a four-hour round trip. It was estimated that only 20–30 Khmer Rouge were on Koh Tang; the information regarding the heavy anti-aircraft fire coming from Koh Tang and the number of gunboats present was not passed on to the Marines. Preparatory airstrikes of the landing zones were ruled out for fear of hitting crew members who might be held nearby.

A unit of 57 Marines from D Company, 1/4 Marines together with volunteers from Military Sealift Command to get &quot;Mayaguez&quot; underway, an explosive ordnance disposal team and a Cambodian linguist would be transferred by three HH-53 &quot;Jolly Greens&quot; to the &quot;Holt&quot; which was scheduled to arrive on station at dawn for a ship-to-ship boarding of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; one hour after the assault on Koh Tang began. Two additional CH-53s (because of their superior firepower, all the HH-53s were used for troop lift) were tasked as combat search and rescue helicopters, supported by an EC-130 &quot;King&quot; airborne, command, control and communications (ABCCC) aircraft of the 56th Rescue Squadron.

USS &quot;Wilson&quot; was assigned to support the Koh Tang operation, and, after retaking &quot;Mayaguez&quot;, USS &quot;Holt&quot; would be deployed in a blocking position between Koh Tang and the Cambodian mainland with the mission of intercepting and engaging any Khmer reaction forces. U.S. Navy aircraft from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; were given the mission of striking targets on the Cambodian mainland to prevent interference with the rescue.

In the afternoon in New York City, the US ambassador to the UN, John A. Scali, delivered a request for assistance to UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim that noted the US reserved the right to act in self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. Waldheim He called the Chinese representative to the UN to his office and contacted the Cambodians via a channel used previously to secure the release of foreign citizens from Phnom Penh.

At 15:52 EDT (02:52 15 May Cambodia), Ford convened the fourth and final NSC meeting regarding &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. Jones briefed the NSC on the assault plan and plans for strikes by Guam-based B-52s on the port facilities at Kampong Som and the Ream Naval Base. Concerned that the use of B-52s might be excessive, Ford limited the bombing to attacks by carrier-based aircraft commencing at 07:45 (Cambodia) and gave the go-ahead to the rescue plan. Given the reports that the crew had probably been moved to the mainland, the NSC discussed whether any Americans were actually on Koh Tang. Kissinger pointed out there was no way to know and that &quot;taking the island if they are not there is easier to explain than failing to take it if they are.&quot; Schlesinger agreed that &quot;we have an obligation to get the Americans or to see if they are there.&quot;

At 19:00 EDT (06:00 15 May Cambodia) the UN issued a statement that the secretary-general was communicating with the Cambodians and that he encouraged all parties to refrain from further use of force.

==The Khmer Rouge on Koh Tang==
Unknown to the Americans then converging on Koh Tang, none of &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew were on the island, which was defended by over 100 Khmer Rouge. These defences were intended to counter the Vietnamese, not the Americans. The Khmer Rouge commander of Kampong Som District, Em Son, was also given responsibility for securing Koh Tang and on 1 May he took a force of 100 men to Koh Tang to defend the island against possible Vietnamese attack. Sa Mean was given responsibility for the defense of Poulo Wai.

On the East Beach, two heavy machine guns had been dug in at each end of the beach and fortified firing positions had been built every 20 metres behind a sand berm connected by a shallow zig-zag trench. Two M60 machine guns, B-40 RPGs and two DK-82 recoilless rifles were in the firing positions. On the West Beach, a heavy machine gun, an M60, B-40 RPGs and a 75 mm recoilless rifle were dug into connected firing positions. North of each beach was a 60 mm mortar and south of the beaches was an 81 mm mortar that could fire on either beach. Ammunition was stored in dug-in bunkers, one behind each beach, with a third ammunition dump located near Em Son&#x27;s command post in the jungle south of the beaches.

==&quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew on Koh Rong Sanloem ==
On their arrival at Koh Rong Sanloem Miller was taken to the senior Khmer Rouge commander where he was subject to a cursory interrogation before being asked if he could talk to the American planes from &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. The Khmer Rouge explained that they had already lost three boats and numerous men and were anxious to call off the American bombers. Miller explained that if they returned to the ship and restarted her engines they could then generate electricity to call their office in Bangkok which could then contact the U.S. military. The Khmer Rouge radioed instructions to their higher command and then gave approval for Miller and nine men to return to &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. As darkness was falling it was decided that they would return to &quot;Mayaguez&quot; the following morning, 15 May.

==Rescue operation==
===Retaking &quot;Mayaguez&quot;===

At 06:13 on 15 May, the first phase of the operation began with the transfer by three HH-53s of D/1/4 Marines to the &quot;Holt&quot;. As the &quot;Holt&quot; slowly came alongside, USAF A-7D aircraft saturated &quot;Mayaguez&quot; with tear gas munitions. Equipped with gas masks, the Marines at 07:25 hours then conducted one of the few hostile ship-to-ship boardings by the U.S. Navy since the American Civil War, securing the vessel after an hour-long search, finding her empty.

===The assault on Koh Tang===



At 06:12, the eight helicopters (five CH-53 &quot;Knives&quot; and three HH-53 &quot;Jolly Greens&quot;) of the Koh Tang assault force approached the two Landing zones (LZs) on Koh Tang. At the West Beach, the first section of two CH-53 helicopters came in at 06:20. The first helicopter; &quot;Knife 21&quot;, landed safely, but while offloading its Marines came under heavy automatic weapons fire, destroying an engine. It managed to take off, protected by suppressive fire from the second CH-53, &quot;Knife 22&quot;, and ditched 1.6 km offshore. &quot;Knife 22&quot; was damaged so severely that it turned back with its Marines (including the G Company commander) still aboard escorted by &quot;Jolly Green 11&quot; and &quot;Jolly Green 12&quot;, and crash-landed in Trat Province on the Thai coast, where its passengers were picked up by &quot;Jolly Green 12&quot; and returned to U-Tapao.

At 06:30, the CH-53s approaching the East Beach encountered intense automatic weapons and RPG fire from the entrenched Khmer Rouge. &quot;Knife 31&quot; was hit by two RPGs, which ignited its left fuel tank and ripped away the nose of the helicopter. It crashed in a fireball fifty meters offshore. The copilot, five Marines, and two Navy corpsmen were killed in the crash, another Marine drowned swimming from the wreck and three Marines were killed by gunfire trying to reach the beach. A tenth Marine died of his wounds while clinging to the burning wreckage. The surviving ten Marines and three Air Force crewmen were forced to swim for two hours before being picked up by the gig of the arriving &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot;.

Among the Marine survivors was the battalion&#x27;s Forward Air Controller, who used an Air Force survival radio while swimming to direct A-7 air strikes against the island until the battery failed. The second CH-53, &quot;Knife 23&quot;, was hit by an RPG which blew off the tail section and crash-landed on the East Beach but it offloaded its 20 Marines and crew of five. They set up a defensive perimeter and the &quot;Knife 23&quot; co-pilot used his survival radio to call in airstrikes but they were cut off from reinforcements and rescue for twelve hours.

&quot;Knife 32&quot; was inbound to the East Beach when it was hit by an RPG and aborted its landing, instead heading out over the West Beach to the &quot;Knife 21&quot; crash site where it dumped fuel and proceeded to rescue the three &quot;Knife 21&quot; crewmen. Two other sections of the first wave, consisting of the remaining four helicopters, were diverted from the East Beach to the West Beach and eventually landed all of their Marines between 06:30 and 07:00, although the final insertion by &quot;Jolly Green 41&quot; required support from an AC-130 gunship to penetrate the Khmer Rouge fire on its fifth attempt. &quot;Knife 32&quot;, &quot;Jolly Green 41&quot; and &quot;Jolly Green 42&quot; eventually landed 81 Marines on the West Beach under the command of the company Executive Officer, and &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot; landed 29 Marines of the battalion command post and mortar platoon a kilometre to the southwest.

By 07:00 109 Marines and five Air Force crewmen were on Koh Tang but in three isolated beach areas and in close contact with Khmer Rouge troops. The Marines at the northern end of West Beach attempted to move down the beach to link up with Austin&#x27;s command element to the south, but were beaten back by heavy Khmer Rouge fire which killed Lance corporal Ashton Loney.

While isolated, the Marines were able to use their 81 mm mortars for fire support and devised a makeshift communications network for controlling supporting air strikes by USAF A-7 and F-4 aircraft. It was decided that the platoon isolated on the East Beach should be extracted; following suppressive fire from an AC-130, &quot;Jolly Green 13&quot; landed there at 08:15 amid a hail of machine-gun fire. It had landed some 100 m away from the Marines who were reluctant to risk running to the helicopter, the helicopter took off again with its fuel lines ruptured and made an emergency landing in Rayong, Thailand.

Of the eight helicopters assaulting Koh Tang, three had been destroyed (&quot;Knife 21&quot;, &quot;Knife 23&quot; and &quot;Knife 31&quot;) and four others were damaged too severely to continue operations (&quot;Knife 22&quot;, &quot;Knife 32&quot;, &quot;Jolly Green 41&quot; and &quot;Jolly Green 42&quot;). Of the helicopters used in the recapture of &quot;Mayaguez&quot;, &quot;Jolly Green 13&quot; had been severely damaged in the East Beach rescue attempt. This left only three helicopters (all HH-53s – &quot;Jolly Greens 11, 12 and 43&quot;) of the original eleven available to bring in the follow-up forces of BLT 2/9, so the 2 CH-53s (&quot;Knife 51 and 52&quot;) whose mission had been search and rescue – the last available helicopters – were reassigned to carry troops.

The five helicopters picked up 127 Marines of the second wave at U-Tapao between 09:00 and 10:00. At 11:50 &quot;Knife 52&quot;, &quot;Knife 51&quot; and &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot; arrived over Koh Tang and prepared to land on the East Beach. As &quot;Knife 52&quot; approached, fire punctured its fuel tanks and the pilot aborted the landing and headed back to U-Tapao leaking fuel. &quot;Knife 51&quot; and &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot; also abandoned their landings and assumed a holding pattern.

===Release of &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew===
At 06:07 the Khmer Rouge information and propaganda minister, Hu Nim, made a radio broadcast announcing that &quot;Mayaguez&quot; would be released. The section of his communique on the release was:

The transmission was intercepted by the CIA station in Bangkok, translated and delivered to the White House by 07:15 (20:15 EDT). The White House was sceptical of the Khmer Rouge message and the lack of clarity regarding the crew and released a press statement at 08:15 (21:15 EDT) saying that U.S. military operations would continue until the crew of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; was released. At 07:44 the JCS ordered a delay to the first armed reconnaissance strike by planes from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on the Kompong Som oil storage complex and Ream airfield. Confusion over orders meant that the planes dropped their ordnance at sea and returned to the &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, when at 07:48 the JCS reinstated the order for airstrikes.

At 06:30 on Koh Rong Sanloem, the crew of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; were informed that they would be allowed to return to their ship, after having first agreed to a statement that they had not been mistreated. At 07:15 &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew was loaded aboard the Thai fishing boat, &quot;Sinvari&quot; (which had been captured by the Khmer Rouge five months earlier) escorted by a second boat with Sa Mean and other Khmer Rouge. Once away from Koh Rong Sanloem the second boat picked up the Khmer Rouge guards from &quot;Sinvari&quot; and instructed the crew to return to &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and call off the American planes.

At 09:35 a circling P-3 Orion spotted &quot;Sinvari&quot; and &quot;Wilson&quot; was ordered to intercept it, originally thinking it was a Khmer Rouge gunboat. The P-3 then identified that Caucasians were aboard and at 09:49 &quot;Mayaguez&quot;″s crew was brought aboard &quot;Wilson&quot;. Confirmation of the release of the crew was sent to the White House and at 11:27 (00:27 EDT) Ford went on U.S. national television announcing the recovery of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and the rescue of its crew, but obscuring the fact that the crew had in fact been released by the Khmer Rouge.

Ford, at Kissinger&#x27;s urging, declined to cancel the scheduled airstrikes on the Cambodian mainland until the Marines on Koh Tang had been withdrawn. At 08:45 A-6A Intruder and A-7E aircraft from VA-22, VA-94 and VA-95 escorted by F-4N fighters of VF-51 and VF-111 aboard &quot;Coral Sea&quot; began the second wave of airstrikes, bombing landing barges and oil storage facilities at Kompong Som and cargo planes and T-28 Trojan aircraft at Ream airfield. Despite receiving confirmation of the release of the crew, at 10:20 the third wave of airstrikes hit boats at Ream naval base. At 11:45 the fourth planned airstrike on the mainland was cancelled and the jets directed to support the Marines on Koh Tang.

===Extraction of U.S. Marine elements===


The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that, with the ship recaptured and the crew released, further reinforcement of Koh Tang was unnecessary and at 11:55 they ordered the U.S. forces to &quot;immediately cease all offensive operations against the Khmer Republic [and to] disengage and withdraw all forces from operating areas as soon as possible&quot;. Hearing this order, the circling EC-130 ABCCC recalled the second assault wave. The helicopters with the second wave reversed course until Austin, on the ground on Koh Tang, convinced Burns that the reinforcements were necessary to prevent his units from being overrun; the order was rescinded at 12:10.

The second wave carrying the Marines from &quot;Knife 22&quot; and a platoon from Company E had originally taken off at staggered times between 09:00 and 10:00, but with the reversal of course its arrival on Koh Tang was seriously delayed. At 12:10 &quot;Knife 51&quot;, followed by &quot;Jolly Greens 43, 11 and 12&quot; landed 100 additional Marines and evacuated nine wounded on the West Beach, making a total of 225 Marines – 205 on the West Beach and 20 Marines and five airmen on the East Beach. Around the same time Austin&#x27;s isolated command unit planned a linkup of its small contingent with the bulk of Golf Company at the northern end of the West Beach. Using mortar fire and A-7 airstrikes to clear Khmer Rouge in the jungle between the two forces, it reached the G Company perimeter at 12:45.

By 14:00 firing on the West Beach had reduced substantially as Em Son had moved most of his men back from the beaches with only three-man patrols maintaining pressure on the two Marine enclaves. Austin asked the ABCCC if he should attempt to push across the island (a distance of approximately ) to link up with the isolated unit on the East Beach, but was advised that another helicopter pickup would be attempted first. At 14:15 &quot;Jolly Greens 11&quot; and &quot;43&quot; approached East Beach, but were repulsed by heavy fire. &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot; had a fuel line damaged, but made an emergency landing aboard &quot;Coral Sea&quot; at 14:36, where it was repaired and returned to service by 17:00.

During the attempted landing by &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot;, fire was seen coming from a semi-submerged Swift Boat that had been shot up by an AC-130 the previous day, A-7 aircraft were called in to destroy the boat with their 20 mm cannon. At 16:20 hours, &quot;Nail 68&quot;, an Air Force OV-10 forward air control (FAC) aircraft, arrived and took over the direction of air support. At 16:23 &quot;Nail 68&quot; called on &quot;Wilson&quot; to use its 5-inch gun to destroy the semi-submerged Swift Boat.

This change in controllers marked a turning point in the quality of airborne firepower available to the Marines because for the first time that day they had an airborne observer exclusively dedicated to providing accurate and timely close air support. At 17:00 Em Son gathered his forces and moved back up the island to secure an ammunition dump that lay between the West and East Beaches. He was surprised to find the dump intact and no Marines lying in ambush. Now supplied, his men would be able to increase the pressure on the Marines again.

At 18:00 as the sun began to set a third attempt to rescue the East Beach force was attempted, using &quot;Jolly Green 11&quot; as the rescue ship and with gunfire support from &quot;Jolly Green 12&quot;, &quot;Knife 51&quot; and the gig from &quot;Wilson&quot; mounting four M60s. &quot;Nail 68&quot; first ordered gun runs by an AC-130 followed by F-4s and A-7s along the edge of the East Beach. As this was going on, five C-130s arrived over Koh Tang carrying BLU-82 &quot;daisy cutter&quot; bombs — a device and the largest conventional explosive weapon in the U.S. arsenal at the time. Not seeing any practical use for the BLU-82s, &quot;Nail 68&quot; ordered them dropped well south of the Marines&#x27; positions.

At 18:15 &quot;Jolly Green 11&quot; approached the East Beach, but did not actually set down because the hulk of &quot;Knife 23&quot; was sitting on the beach. Instead, the pilot (First Lieutenant Donald Backlund) skilfully hovered the helicopter several feet off the ground just north of the original beach LZ. The extraction was difficult because the helicopter would see-saw up and down. Only a few Marines at a time could board the helicopter&#x27;s rear ramp in this fashion by timing their jumps to coincide with the downward motion of the aircraft. &quot;Jolly Green 11&quot; was hit numerous times, but managed to transport its cargo of 20 Marines and five Airmen to the &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

Shortly after &quot;Jolly Green 11&quot; evacuated the East Beach, the first BLU-82 was dropped causing a huge explosion and sending a shock wave across the West Beach. Austin quickly called the ABCCC with the instruction that no more of the bombs should be dropped. A report from &quot;Jolly Green 11&quot; indicated that a Marine might be in the wreckage of &quot;Knife 31&quot; and &quot;Jolly Green 12&quot; went in to search for any survivors. &quot;Jolly Green 12&quot; hovered above the wreck, while a crewman was lowered on a rescue hoist to survey the wreckage. No Marine was recovered and &quot;Jolly Green 12&quot; suffered extensive damage in the rescue attempt and flew to &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

As a moonless night fell over Koh Tang, the remaining two helicopters, &quot;Knife 51&quot; and the hastily repaired &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot;, were joined by &quot;Jolly Green 44&quot; which had been out of service at its Nakhon Phanom base but had been repaired and flown to the area. At 18:40 this force began to withdraw the remaining 205 Marines from the West Beach, protected by AC-130 fire and naval gunfire support from &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; and its gig. The first load of 41 Marines was lifted out at 18:40 by &quot;Knife 51&quot; and flown to the &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, followed by 54 taken aboard &quot;Jolly Green 43&quot;.

As &quot;Jolly Green 44&quot; picked up a load of 44 Marines, the remaining Marines in the shrinking West Beach perimeter came under intense attack and were in danger of being overrun. The round trip to &quot;Coral Sea&quot; took thirty minutes, so the pilot, First Lieutenant Bob Blough, decided to deliver his Marines to &quot;Harold E. Holt&quot;, the nearest ship to Koh Tang, in complete darkness while hovering the helicopter over the ship with only its front wheels touching down. Within five minutes &quot;Jolly Green 44&quot; returned and picked up 34 more Marines, leaving 32 still on the island. &quot;Jolly Green 44&quot; was suffering engine trouble and this time headed for &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

At 20:00 &quot;Knife 51&quot; landed and began loading Marines in the dark, and under fire. Captain Davis and Gunnery Sergeant McNemar were joined by &quot;Knife 51&quot;″s Pararescueman Technical Sergeant Wayne Fisk outside of &quot;Knife 51&quot;. With the Marines aboard, Fisk followed Davis and McNemar in boarding &quot;Knife 51&quot;. Fisk requested permission to deplane, and as he moved to do so, two marines stumbled aboard, out of the darkness. Fisk located Davis and asked whether all his men were aboard, confirming they were. Fisk, for a final time requested and received permission to deplane &quot;Knife 51&quot;, with McNemar waiting by &quot;Knife 51&quot; as Fisk hastily searched the beach. With illumination rounds from Cambodian mortars, Fisk returned to &quot;Knife 51&quot; where McNemar jumped aboard, and &quot;Knife 51&quot;, some 10 minutes after landing, departed Koh Tang for the &quot;Coral Sea&quot;

==U.S. Marines left behind and subsequent controversy==
Due to the intense direct and indirect fire during the operation, the bodies of Marines and airmen who were killed in action were left where they fell including LCpl Ashton Loney, whose body was left behind in the darkness during the evacuation of the West Beach.

With each withdrawal, the Marines contracted their perimeter on the West Beach. Lance Corporal John S. Standfast, squad leader, 3rd Squad, 3rd Platoon, Company E and his squad covered Company G&#x27;s withdrawal during the reduction of the perimeter, and he then singlehandedly directed the pullback of his own squad. Before withdrawing to the safety of the new perimeter, Standfast and his platoon guide Sergeant Andersen moved forward to the old perimeter to ensure that no member of the company inadvertently had been left behind, each time checking every foxhole. As the Company E commander Captain Mykle E. Stahl prepared to board &quot;Jolly Green 44&quot; he informed Captain Davis that all of his men were inside the perimeter, not realising that three Marines of an M60 machine gun team had set up a firing position behind a rocky outcrop beyond the right flank of the perimeter.

Even as &quot;Knife 51&quot; left the West Beach, there was confusion as to whether any Marines remained on Koh Tang. The pilot, First Lieutenant Brims, radioed the FAC that some Marines aboard claimed there were still fellow Marines on the ground, but this was soon contradicted by Davis who said that all Marines were off Koh Tang. Two hours after the evacuation was completed, with the Koh Tang Marines dispersed among three Navy ships, Company E commander Captain Stahl discovered that three of his Marines were missing.

The Marines checked all of the Navy ships but could not locate Lance Corporal Joseph N. Hargrove, Private First Class Gary L. Hall, and Private Danny G. Marshall, members of a three-man machine gun team which had been assigned to protect the right flank of the constantly shrinking perimeter during the final evacuation. Sergeant Andersen was the last member of the Marine force to see Hall, Hargrove and Marshall alive at about 20:00 when he ordered them to move back to a new position which was located to the left of the position occupied by Captain Davis.

Just after 20:20 USAF Staff Sergeant Robert Velie on the ABCCC aircraft received a radio transmission from an American asking when the next helicopter was coming to extract them. After Velie received the authentication code from the caller to confirm this was not a Khmer Rouge ploy, Velie&#x27;s commander radioed the &quot;Holt&quot; to advise that Marines were still on the island. &quot;Holt&quot; radioed back that the Marines should swim out to sea for rescue, but when Velie passed this message back to the caller he was told this wasn&#x27;t possible because only one of the three could swim. Velie advised the caller to take cover as air strikes were about to hit the area. The caller confirmed this and no further radio contact was received.

A rescue operation was proposed using Marine volunteers aboard the only three serviceable helicopters. On &quot;Coral Sea&quot; the Commander of Task Force 73, Rear Admiral Robert P. Coogan met with Austin. Davis, McNemar and Coulter, who had just arrived from Subic Bay with a 14-man U.S. Navy SEAL team to consider possible options. Coogan asked Coulter to take &quot;Wilson&quot;″s gig ashore in daylight unarmed under a white flag with leaflets dropped and &quot;Wilson&quot; broadcasting the crew&#x27;s intentions to recover the American bodies and determine the status of the missing men if possible, but Coulter was sceptical and instead proposed taking his team ashore for a night reconnaissance, but this was refused by Coogan.

Coogan had to weigh up the order from Seventh Fleet to cease hostile actions against the Khmer Rouge against the lack of evidence that any of the men were still alive, he decided that there would be no rescue mission unless there was some confirmation that the three Marines were still alive. The following morning &quot;Wilson&quot; cruised back and forth between the West and East Beaches for three hours broadcasting messages in English, French and Khmer saying that they had no hostile intent, but simply wished to retrieve any U.S. personnel dead or alive on the Koh Tang and would send an unarmed boat ashore if the Khmer Rouge signalled them.

Half of &quot;Wilson&quot;″s crew was on deck scanning the beaches and jungle for any sign of the missing Marines, but no signal was received from the Khmer Rouge or the missing Marines. With no indication that the three Marines were still alive and the certainty that more lives would be lost in any forced rescue attempt, a return to Koh Tang was ruled out and &quot;Wilson&quot; departed the area. Hargrove, Hall and Marshall were declared Missing in Action and then on 21 July 1976 their status was changed to Killed in Action (Body Not Recovered).

In 1985, an eyewitness report indicated that a wounded American had been captured on Koh Tang after the assault and was subsequently executed. The NSA intercepted Cambodian messages which referred to &#x27;the American that was captured&#x27; with orders not to talk about this. In 1999 Em Son approached the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting (JTF-FA) on learning that they were looking for further information regarding the events on Koh Tang. Em Son advised that on the morning on 16 May he ordered his men to search the West Beach for any remaining Americans.

About 100 m from the beach one of the Khmer Rouge was hit by M16 fire. The Khmer Rouge then fired mortars and encircled the firing position, capturing one American with a leg wound. Em Son&#x27;s description of the American matched that of Joseph Hargrove. The Khmer Rouge continued their search and located an abandoned M60 machine gun, various equipment and the covered body of a black American soldier. Em Son ordered the dead American (presumably Ashton Loney) buried and the prisoner taken to his headquarters. When Em Son was advised that the Khmer Rouge hit by M16 fire had died, he ordered the American to be shot.

Approximately one week after the assault, Em Son&#x27;s men noticed that their leftover food was being disturbed and on searching they found bootprints in the mud. They set up a night ambush and on the third night they captured two Americans matching the descriptions of Gary Hall and Danny Marshall. Em Son radioed Kampong Som and was ordered to deliver the Americans to the mainland. The following morning the two Americans were taken by boat to the mainland and then driven to the Ti Nean Pagoda above Sihanoukville where they were stripped to their underwear and shackled. After one week, on orders from Phnom Penh, each American was beaten to death with a B-40 rocket launcher. Hall&#x27;s body was buried in a shallow grave near the beach. Marshall&#x27;s was dumped on the beach cove.

Recovery efforts in 1999 by the JTF-FA later found bone fragments that might have belonged to Hall and Marshall, but DNA tests proved inconclusive due to the small size of the fragments. Hargrove, Hall and Marshall all received Purple Hearts from the U.S. Marine Corps. Hargrove&#x27;s family did not receive the award until 1999, after investigative journalist and author Ralph Wetterhahn published several articles in popular magazines about his findings.

In 2007, Hargrove&#x27;s cousin, Cary Turner, began a campaign to have Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC), the successor agency to JTF-FA, return to Koh Tang to search for Hargrove&#x27;s remains. In October 2008 JPAC was reported to have found four sets of remains in an area indicated by Em Son as being where the American suspected to be Hargrove was buried. One of the sets of remains was said to be Caucasian in nature, but DNA analysis was needed before the identity could be confirmed.

In 2016 the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), the successor to JPAC, announced that it had recovered Hall&#x27;s ID card and other items from an empty grave on the island and later acknowledged having recovered a US radio and flak jacket from near where &quot;Knife 51&quot; had taken off.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
U.S. estimates of Khmer Rouge casualties were 13–25 killed on Koh Tang with an unknown number killed on Swift Boats and on the Cambodian mainland.

U.S. casualties were ten Marines, two Navy corpsmen, and an Air Force crewman killed in the crash of &quot;Knife 31&quot;; an Air Force crewman killed in the crash of &quot;Knife 21&quot;; one Marine killed in action on the West Beach; and three Marines missing in action and presumed dead. Fifty were wounded including thirty-five Marines and six airmen.
In addition, eighteen USAF Security Police and five flight crew were killed in the CH-53 crash on the way to U-Tapao.

Between 1991 and 1999, U.S. and Cambodian investigators conducted seven joint investigations, led by the JTF-FA. On three occasions Cambodian authorities unilaterally turned over remains believed to be those of American servicemen. In October and November 1995, U.S. and Cambodian specialists conducted an underwater recovery of the &quot;Knife 31&quot; crash site where they located numerous remains, personal effects and aircraft debris associated with the loss. , a U.S. Navy salvage vessel, enabled the specialists to conduct their excavation offshore. In addition to the support provided by the Cambodian government, the Government of Vietnam also interviewed two Vietnamese informants in Ho Chi Minh City who turned over remains that were later positively identified. As a result of these investigations the remains of Second Lieutenant Richard Vandegeer, Lance Corporals Gregory S Copenhaver and Andres Garcia and Privates First Class Lynn Blessing, Walter Boyd, Antonio R Sandoval and Kelton R. Turner were identified. In 2012 the remains of PFC James Jacques, PFC Richard W Rivenburgh and PFC James Maxwell were identified. A US Department of Defense Factsheet of US MIAs in Cambodia dated April 27, 2021 reports: “Witnesses have assisted in identifying recovery sites on Koh Tang, the island associated with the Mayaguez incident.

Although the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident did not occur in Vietnam, it is commonly referred to as the last battle of the Vietnam War. However, U.S. military personnel who participated in it are not eligible for the Vietnam Service Medal by virtue of participating in that battle alone. The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal is authorized instead for military members who participated in the battle. A congressional bill was introduced in 2016 to award veterans of the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; battle the medal, but the bill was referred to committee, effectively ending it.

===Impact on Kampuchea===
The U.S. air attacks destroyed a large part of the Khmer Navy and Air Force weakening them for the war with Vietnam over the disputed islands. In mid-June Vietnam attacked Poulo Wai and fought the Khmer Rouge before withdrawing in August and recognising it as Kampuchean territory. Relations between the two countries improved thereafter until early 1977 when the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army began attacking Vietnamese border provinces, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians, which eventually resulted in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War starting in December 1978.

For the Khmer Rouge leadership, the fact that the U.S. attacked them even after they had announced the release of the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and its crew, combined with memories of Operation Freedom Deal (U.S. bombing of Cambodia) prior to August 1973, reinforced their beliefs that the U.S. &quot;imperialists&quot; were determined to undermine their revolution. The increasingly paranoid Khmer Rouge presumed that any foreigners captured in the country and purged Khmer Rouge (including Hu Nim), were CIA spies and would torture them at Tuol Sleng until they obtained confessions confirming their beliefs, after which they would be executed.

===Impact on Thailand===
In discussing the possible Thai response to the operation, Kissinger told the NSC that the Thai government would be upset, &quot;but they will also be reassured&quot; and &quot;the Thai military will love it.&quot; As news of the operation reached Bangkok protests began outside the U.S. Embassy. U-Tapao air base had been used by U.S. rescue forces despite an explicit refusal of permission by the relatively new civilian Thai government of Kukrit Pramoj. After being refused by the Thai government, the US sought and obtained permission from the Thai military to proceed, resulting in considerable anger towards the United States. The Thai government called the act a violation of Thailand&#x27;s sovereignty and called for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from U-Tapao. As a result, the USAF implemented Palace Lightning, closing all USAF bases. The last USAF personnel left Thailand in June 1976.

===Impact on the United States===
The reaction of the U.S. public was favorable with President Ford&#x27;s overall approval rating rising 11 percentage points. However Ford&#x27;s public approval ratings fell off quickly and precipitously as details of the incident and casualty figures became better known.

Some congressmen were dissatisfied with the level of consultation they received under the War Powers Resolution. Senator Mike Mansfield was the most critical, saying &quot;we were informed, not consulted&quot;. In 1977 Senator Thomas Eagleton introduced an amendment to the War Powers Resolution that added the rescue of nationals to the list of situations not requiring prior approval by Congress, but also stipulating that only minimum force would be used in rescue. Eagleton&#x27;s proposed amendment did not pass and similar amendments have been proposed since but also not progressed.

On 23 June 1975, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on International Political and Military Affairs asked the General Accounting Office to review all aspects of the incident. On the War Powers Resolution, the General Accounting Office report&#x27;s assessment was &quot;The available evidence suggests less than full compliance with Section 3 [of the War Powers Resolution].&quot;

The paramount objective during the crisis, as Scowcroft later explained, &quot;was to make it clear, to everyone, to our friends, to potential opponents, that notwithstanding the fact that we had just withdrawn from Southeast Asia under fairly ignominious circumstances, if you will, that the United States understood its interests and was prepared to protect them.&quot; Schlesinger later said the same thing, acknowledging the primary reason for the use of force was “to make quite clear to all parties that the United States was still an effective force.&quot; Although the general goal was to reinforce the US reputation for defending its interests, the main concern in that regard was the Korean Peninsula. As Scowcroft related in 1980, &quot;To the extent that we were looking anywhere specifically, it was primarily probably not Southeast Asia at that time, but at Korea,&quot; where the renewal of the long-simmering conflict between the two Koreas was considered a real possibility.

In November 1975 Schlesinger was dismissed as Secretary of Defense due to his perceived insubordination during the crisis.

===Impact on U.S. military rescue planning===

The U.S. military received much criticism for its handling of the incident. In addition to the failure of intelligence to determine the whereabouts of the crew of &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and the presence of a sizable hostile force on Koh Tang, the timing of the operation was questioned until it became clear that combat had been underway four hours before the crew was released. Within the services, the Marines in particular were critical of the &quot;ad hoc&quot; nature of the joint operation and the perceived pressure from the Administration for hasty action, although the success of Operation Frequent Wind had been the basis for many decisions made during the crisis.

Vice Admiral George P. Steele, the Seventh Fleet commander, later stated that: &quot;The sad part of the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; is that we had sufficient force coming up with the Seventh Fleet, after it had been turned around from the evacuation of Vietnam stand down, to seize Southern Cambodia. I begged for another day or two, rather than commit forces piecemeal as we did ... The idea that we could use U.S. Air Force air police and Air Force helicopters as an assault force appears to me as ridiculous today as it did then.&quot;

When many of the coordination and communications problems arose again during Operation Eagle Claw, the hostage rescue mission in Iran in 1980, significant changes in joint and special operations were brought about.

===Legal action by crew===
In April 1977 some &quot;Mayaguez&quot; crew members brought lawsuits in admiralty law at the San Francisco Superior Court against Sea-Land Service Inc relating to the incident. The crew members claimed that Captain Miller was derelict in his duty by &quot;recklessly venturing into known dangerous and hostile waters of foreign sovereignty (Cambodia)&quot; inviting the capture. Evidence was provided that &quot;Mayaguez&quot; was not flying a flag, and had sailed about two nautical miles off Poulo Wai. In June 1977, a settlement was reached. In February 1979 another settlement was reached by other crew members, making a total settlement of $388,000 to the crew members taking legal action.

===Memorials===
In 1996 the &quot;Mayaguez&quot;-Marine Corps Memorial was dedicated in the grounds of the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh by then Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn and Senator John McCain. The memorial lists the names of the 18 U.S. servicemembers killed and missing at Koh Tang, along with Marine Security Guard Sergeant Charles &quot;Wayne&quot; Turberville, who was killed in a Khmer Rouge grenade attack on 26 September 1971. The former &quot;Knife 22&quot;, number 68-10928, upgraded to MH-53M Pave Low is on display at Memorial Air Park, Hurlburt Field, Florida.

<text>Contemporary fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its subgenres, Occult detective fiction, urban fantasy, low fantasy, supernatural fiction and paranormal fiction. Several authors note that in contemporary fantasy, magical or fantastic elements are separate or secret from the mundane world.

==Definition and overview==
The term is used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as &quot;consensus reality&quot;) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist but are not commonly seen or understood as such, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds.

Frances Sinclair, determining what to call fantasy set in our known world, contrasts contemporary fantasy with magical realism. She notes that in contemporary fantasy magical elements are often kept secret from most people, and notes the amount of young adult fantasy in the subgenre. In contrast, Sinclair points out that in magical realism &quot;the impossible can occur without comment&quot;, and the relationship between reader and narrator may be stronger.

Brian Stableford attempts to narrowly define the genre, excluding portal fantasy and fantasy &quot;in which the magical entity is a blatant anomaly&quot;. He arrives at a definition of fantasy set in the mundane world, often including an &quot;elaborate secret history&quot;. He notes that much contemporary fantasy is set in rural settings, but also notes the subgenre of urban fantasy, and that both children&#x27;s fiction and literary fiction often fall within this genre.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; similarly suggests that the mundane and fantastic are contrasted within the genre. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;″s definition includes &quot;portal fantasy in which transition between the two realms occurs regularly&quot;, as well as several other subgenres; it cites Peter S. Beagle&#x27;s &quot;Lila the Werewolf&quot; as a classic of the type. It also notes that in many contemporary fantasies, the fantastic &quot;colonizes&quot; the mundane home. Greg Bechtel agrees with the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, saying the sub-genre &quot;explicitly depicts the collision of the contemporary world with a world of magic and spirits&quot;. He notes the distinction between this genre and magical realism, crediting Greer Watson, but says that there can be overlap.

Grzegorz Trebicki describes &quot;contemporary&quot; fantasy works &quot;set in our &#x27;primary&#x27; world, in which the textual reality has been enriched by various fantastical elements, usually borrowed from particular mythologies or folk traditions&quot;. He says that such works are usually driven by genre conventions other than mythical archetypes.

The term has also been equated with &quot;Paranormal Fantasy&quot;, due to the frequency of &quot;paranormal characters (werewolves, vampires, wizards, fairies, etc.)&quot;

=== A broad definition ===

Camille Bacon-Smith uses the term to describe fantasy stories set in the time they were written, and provides H.P. Lovecraft and Fritz Leiber&#x27;s novel &quot;Conjure Wife&quot; as examples. She states that &quot;contemporary fantasy belongs to the Gothic tradition of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; and Poe&#x27;s &#x27;The Fall of the House of Usher&#x27;&quot;, noting also that &quot;contemporary fantasy has been a part of the genre since its beginning&quot;. She notes that the genre was less popular by the 1960s, considering it supplanted by New Wave and Celtic Twilight books. Bacon-Smith credits Terri Windling&#x27;s 1986 introduction of Borderland as a key event in improving interest in the genre, also noting the earlier influence of Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; which she says has a &quot;contemporary background&quot;.

== Style ==
In his preface to &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, one of the earlier works falling within this subgenre, C. S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about &quot;magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels&quot;, he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers:

The same is true for many later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

In an analysis of religion in modern fantasy, Sylvia Kelso notes a &quot;market shift&quot; from high fantasy toward contemporary fantasy, also explaining that &quot;paranormal&quot; subgenres have branched from contemporary fantasy, especially ones centered on vampires and werewolves. Kelso notes that contemporary fantasy is more willing to draw on religious themes than high fantasy. This has been influenced by its openness to vampires and other traditionally evil supernatural beings, which encourages writers to use Christianity to create villains such as demons. However, other books and series draw on other religions and traditions.

==Relationship with other subgenres==
Novels in which modern characters travel into other worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Also, contemporary fantasy is generally distinguished from horror fiction that mixes contemporary settings and fantastic elements by the overall tone, emphasizing joy or wonder rather than fear or dread.

The contemporary fantasy and low fantasy genres can overlap as both are set in the real world. There are differences, however. Low fantasies are set in the real world but not necessarily in the modern age, in which case they would not be contemporary fantasy.

There is a considerable overlap between contemporary fantasy and urban fantasy.
