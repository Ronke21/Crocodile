<text>In solid state physics, a particle&#x27;s effective mass (often denoted formula_1) is the mass that it &quot;seems&quot; to have when responding to forces, or the mass that it seems to have when interacting with other identical particles in a thermal distribution. One of the results from the band theory of solids is that the movement of particles in a periodic potential, over long distances larger than the lattice spacing, can be very different from their motion in a vacuum. The effective mass is a quantity that is used to simplify band structures by modeling the behavior of a free particle with that mass. For some purposes and some materials, the effective mass can be considered to be a simple constant of a material. In general, however, the value of effective mass depends on the purpose for which it is used, and can vary depending on a number of factors.

For electrons or electron holes in a solid, the effective mass is usually stated as a factor multiplying the rest mass of an electron, &quot;m&quot;e (9.11 × 10−31 kg). This factor is usually in the range 0.01 to 10, but can be lower or higher—for example, reaching 1,000 in exotic heavy fermion materials, or anywhere from zero to infinity (depending on definition) in graphene. As it simplifies the more general band theory, the electronic effective mass can be seen as an important basic parameter that influences measurable properties of a solid, including everything from the efficiency of a solar cell to the speed of an integrated circuit.

==Simple case: parabolic, isotropic dispersion relation==

At the highest energies of the valence band in many semiconductors (Ge, Si, GaAs, ...), and the lowest energies of the conduction band in some semiconductors (GaAs, ...), the band structure can be locally approximated as
:formula_2

where is the energy of an electron at wavevector in that band, is a constant giving the edge of energy of that band, and is a constant (the effective mass).

It can be shown that the electrons placed in these bands behave as free electrons except with a different mass, as long as their energy stays within the range of validity of the approximation above. As a result, the electron mass in models such as the Drude model must be replaced with the effective mass.

One remarkable property is that the effective mass can become &quot;negative&quot;, when the band curves downwards away from a maximum. As a result of the negative mass, the electrons respond to electric and magnetic forces by gaining velocity in the opposite direction compared to normal; even though these electrons have negative charge, they move in trajectories as if they had positive charge (and positive mass). This explains the existence of valence-band holes, the positive-charge, positive-mass quasiparticles that can be found in semiconductors.

In any case, if the band structure has the simple parabolic form described above, then the value of effective mass is unambiguous. Unfortunately, this parabolic form is not valid for describing most materials. In such complex materials there is no single definition of &quot;effective mass&quot; but instead multiple definitions, each suited to a particular purpose. The rest of the article describes these effective masses in detail.

==Intermediate case: parabolic, anisotropic dispersion relation==

In some important semiconductors (notably, silicon) the lowest energies of the conduction band are not symmetrical, as the constant-energy surfaces are now ellipsoids, rather than the spheres in the isotropic case. Each conduction band minimum can be approximated only by
:formula_3

where , , and axes are aligned to the principal axes of the ellipsoids, and , and are the inertial effective masses along these different axes. The offsets , , and reflect that the conduction band minimum is no longer centered at zero wavevector. (These effective masses correspond to the principal components of the inertial effective mass tensor, described later.)

In this case, the electron motion is no longer directly comparable to a free electron; the speed of an electron will depend on its direction, and it will accelerate to a different degree depending on the direction of the force. Still, in crystals such as silicon the overall properties such as conductivity appear to be isotropic. This is because there are multiple valleys (conduction-band minima), each with effective masses rearranged along different axes. The valleys collectively act together to give an isotropic conductivity. It is possible to average the different axes&#x27; effective masses together in some way, to regain the free electron picture. However, the averaging method turns out to depend on the purpose:

==General case==

In general the dispersion relation cannot be approximated as parabolic, and in such cases the effective mass should be precisely defined if it is to be used at all.
Here a commonly stated definition of effective mass is the &quot;inertial&quot; effective mass tensor defined below; however, in general it is a matrix-valued function of the wavevector, and even more complex than the band structure. 
Other effective masses are more relevant to directly measurable phenomena.

===Inertial effective mass tensor===

A classical particle under the influence of a force accelerates according to Newton&#x27;s second law, , or alternatively, the momentum changes according to . This intuitive principle appears identically in semiclassical approximations derived from band structure when interband transitions can be ignored for sufficiently weak external fields.
The force gives a rate of change in crystal momentum :

:formula_4

where is the &quot;reduced Planck constant&quot;. 

Acceleration for a wave-like particle becomes the rate of change in group velocity:

:formula_5

where is the del operator in reciprocal space. The last step follows from using the chain rule for a total derivative for a quantity with indirect dependencies, because the direct result of the force is the change in given above, which indirectly results in a change in . 
Combining these two equations yields

:formula_6

using the dot product rule with a uniform force (). formula_7 is the Hessian matrix of in reciprocal space. We see that the equivalent of the Newtonian reciprocal inertial mass for a free particle defined by has become a tensor quantity

:formula_8

whose elements are

:formula_9

This tensor allows the acceleration and force to be in different directions, and for the magnitude of the acceleration to depend on the direction of the force. 
* For parabolic bands, the off-diagonal elements of are zero, and the diagonal elements are constants
* For isotropic bands the diagonal elements must all be equal and the off-diagonal elements must all be equal.
* For parabolic isotropic bands, , where is a scalar effective mass and is the identity.
* In general, the elements of are functions of .
* The inverse, , is known as the effective mass tensor. Note that it is not always possible to invert 
For bands with linear dispersion formula_10 such as with photons or electrons in graphene, the group velocity is fixed, i.e. electrons travelling with parallel with to the force direction cannot be accelerated and the diagonal elements of are obviously zero. However, electrons travelling with a component perpendicular to the force can be accelerated in the direction of the force, and the off-diagonal elements of are non-zero. In fact the off-diagonal elements scale inversely with , i.e. they diverge (become infinite) for small . This is why the electrons in graphene are sometimes said to have infinite mass (due to the zeros on the diagonal of ) and sometimes said to be massless (due to the divergence on the off-diagonals). 

===Cyclotron effective mass===

Classically, a charged particle in a magnetic field moves in a helix along the magnetic field axis. The period &quot;T&quot; of its motion depends on its mass &quot;m&quot; and charge &quot;e&quot;,
:formula_11

where &quot;B&quot; is the magnetic flux density.

For particles in asymmetrical band structures, the particle no longer moves exactly in a helix, however its motion transverse to the magnetic field still moves in a closed loop (not necessarily a circle). Moreover, the time to complete one of these loops still varies inversely with magnetic field, and so it is possible to define a &quot;cyclotron effective mass&quot; from the measured period, using the above equation.

The semiclassical motion of the particle can be described by a closed loop in k-space. Throughout this loop, the particle maintains a constant energy, as well as a constant momentum along the magnetic field axis. By defining to be the area enclosed by this loop (this area depends on the energy , the direction of the magnetic field, and the on-axis wavevector ), then it can be shown that the cyclotron effective mass depends on the band structure via the derivative of this area in energy:
:formula_12

Typically, experiments that measure cyclotron motion (cyclotron resonance, De Haas–Van Alphen effect, etc.) are restricted to only probe motion for energies near the Fermi level.

In two-dimensional electron gases, the cyclotron effective mass is defined only for one magnetic field direction (perpendicular) and the out-of-plane wavevector drops out. The cyclotron effective mass therefore is only a function of energy, and it turns out to be exactly related to the density of states at that energy via the relation formula_13, where is the valley degeneracy. Such a simple relationship does not apply in three-dimensional materials.

===Density of states effective masses (lightly doped semiconductors) ===

In semiconductors with low levels of doping, the electron concentration in the conduction band is in general given by 
:formula_14

where is the Fermi level, is the minimum energy of the conduction band, and is a concentration coefficient that depends on temperature. The above relationship for can be shown to apply for any conduction band shape (including non-parabolic, asymmetric bands), provided the doping is weak (); this is a consequence of Fermi–Dirac statistics limiting towards Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics.

The concept of effective mass is useful to model the temperature dependence of , thereby allowing the above relationship to be used over a range of temperatures. In an idealized three-dimensional material with a parabolic band, the concentration coefficient is given by
:formula_15

In semiconductors with non-simple band structures, this relationship is used to define an effective mass, known as the density of states effective mass of electrons. The name &quot;density of states effective mass&quot; is used since the above expression for is derived via the density of states for a parabolic band.

In practice, the effective mass extracted in this way is not quite constant in temperature ( does not exactly vary as ). In silicon, for example, this effective mass varies by a few percent between absolute zero and room temperature because the band structure itself slightly changes in shape. These band structure distortions are a result of changes in electron–phonon interaction energies, with the lattice&#x27;s thermal expansion playing a minor role.

Similarly, the number of holes in the valence band, and the density of states effective mass of holes are defined by:
:formula_16

where is the maximum energy of the valence band. Practically, this effective mass tends to vary greatly between absolute zero and room temperature in many materials (e.g., a factor of two in silicon), as there are multiple valence bands with distinct and significantly non-parabolic character, all peaking near the same energy.

==Determination==

===Experimental===

Traditionally effective masses were measured using cyclotron resonance, a method in which microwave absorption of a semiconductor immersed in a magnetic field goes through a sharp peak when the microwave frequency equals the cyclotron frequency formula_17. In recent years effective masses have more commonly been determined through measurement of band structures using techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or, most directly, the de Haas–van Alphen effect. Effective masses can also be estimated using the coefficient γ of the linear term in the low-temperature electronic specific heat at constant volume formula_18. The specific heat depends on the effective mass through the density of states at the Fermi level and as such is a measure of degeneracy as well as band curvature. Very large estimates of carrier mass from specific heat measurements have given rise to the concept of heavy fermion materials. Since carrier mobility depends on the ratio of carrier collision lifetime formula_19 to effective mass, masses can in principle be determined from transport measurements, but this method is not practical since carrier collision probabilities are typically not known a priori. The optical Hall effect is an emerging technique for measuring the free charge carrier density, effective mass and mobility parameters in semiconductors. The optical Hall effect measures the analogue of the quasi-static electric-field-induced electrical Hall effect at optical frequencies in conductive and complex layered materials. The optical Hall effect also permits characterization of the anisotropy (tensor character) of the effective mass and mobility parameters.

===Theoretical===

A variety of theoretical methods including density functional theory, k·p perturbation theory, and others are used to supplement and support the various experimental measurements described in the previous section, including interpreting, fitting, and extrapolating these measurements. Some of these theoretical methods can also be used for predictions of effective mass in the absence of any experimental data, for example to study materials that have not yet been created in the laboratory.

==Significance==
The effective mass is used in transport calculations, such as transport of electrons under the influence of fields or carrier gradients, but it also is used to calculate the carrier density and density of states in semiconductors. These masses are related but, as explained in the previous sections, are not the same because the weightings of various directions and wavevectors are different. These differences are important, for example in thermoelectric materials, where high conductivity, generally associated with light mass, is desired at the same time as high Seebeck coefficient, generally associated with heavy mass. Methods for assessing the electronic structures of different materials in this context have been developed.

Certain group III–V compounds such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium antimonide (InSb) have far smaller effective masses than tetrahedral group IV materials like silicon and germanium. In the simplest Drude picture of electronic transport, the maximum obtainable charge carrier velocity is inversely proportional to the effective mass: formula_20, where formula_21 with formula_22 being the electronic charge. The ultimate speed of integrated circuits depends on the carrier velocity, so the low effective mass is the fundamental reason that GaAs and its derivatives are used instead of Si in high-bandwidth applications like cellular telephony.

In April 2017, researchers at Washington State University claimed to have created a fluid with negative effective mass inside a Bose–Einstein condensate, by engineering the dispersion relation.

<doc id="156714" wikidata="Q852908" url="?curid=156714" title="Royal Mile">
<text>The Royal Mile (; Scots: &quot;Ryal Mile&quot;) comprises Edinburgh Castle Esplanade and a succession of streets which form the main thoroughfare of the Old Town of the city of Edinburgh in Scotland. The term was first used descriptively in W. M. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1901), describing the city &quot;with its Castle and Palace and the royal mile between&quot;, and was further popularised as the title of a guidebook by R. T. Skinner published in 1920, &quot;The Royal Mile (Edinburgh) Castle to Holyrood(house)&quot;.

The Royal Mile runs between two significant locations in the royal history of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and has a total length of approximately one mile. The streets which make up the Royal Mile are (west to east) Castlehill, the Lawnmarket, the High Street, the Canongate and Abbey Strand. The Royal Mile is the busiest tourist street in the Old Town, rivalled only by Princes Street in the New Town.

The Royal Mile contains a variety of shops, restaurants, public houses, and visitor attractions. During the annual Edinburgh Fringe, the High Street becomes crowded with tourists, entertainers, and buskers. Parliament Square is at the heart of Scotland&#x27;s legal system, being the home of both the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session.

==Geography==

Retreating ice sheets, many millennia ago, deposited their glacial debris behind the hard volcanic plug of the castle rock on which Edinburgh Castle stands, resulting in a distinctive crag and tail formation. Running eastwards from the crag on which the castle sits, the Royal Mile sits upon the ridge of the tail which slopes gently down to Holyrood Palace. Steep &quot;closes&quot; (or alleyways) run between the many tall &quot;lands&quot; (or tenement buildings) off the main thoroughfare. The route runs from an elevation of above sea level at the palace to at the castle, giving an average gradient of 4.1%.

==Castle Esplanade==
The Castle Esplanade was laid out as a parade ground, in 1753, using spoil from the building of the Royal Exchange (now the City Chambers). It was formalised in 1816 when it was widened and provided with decorative railings and walls. The Esplanade with its several monuments has been A-listed by Historic Scotland. It is the venue of the annual Edinburgh Military Tattoo at which time specially designed temporary grandstands are erected. 

==Castlehill==

From the Castle Esplanade, the first building on the right is Cannonball House which has a cannonball lodged in the wall facing the Esplanade, often said to have been accidentally fired from the Castle but which actually marks the elevation of Comiston Springs, three miles to the south of the Castle, which fed a cistern on Castlehill, one of the first piped water supplies in Scotland.

Castlehill is dominated by the former Tolbooth-Highland-St John&#x27;s Church (on the south side at the foot of this section), now the headquarters of the Edinburgh International Festival society – The Hub, and on the north side by the Outlook Tower and Camera Obscura. The Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland and New College are further down on the same side. The Scottish Parliament met in the Assembly Hall between 1999 and 2004.

==Lawnmarket==
The Lawnmarket is a separately named part of the High Street. Addresses are a continuation of the High Street numbers. It runs from the West Bow to St Giles Street.

A charter of 1477 designated this part of the High Street as the market-place for what was called &quot;inland merchandise&quot; – items such as yarn, stockings, coarse cloth and other similar articles. In later years, linen was the main product sold. As a result, it became known as the Land Market which was later corrupted to Lawn Market. Located in a close on the south side, Riddle&#x27;s Court is the well-preserved 16th-century house of a merchant John MacMorran, who was shot by rioting schoolboys in 1595.

Today, the majority of shops in the street are aimed at tourists. On the north side is the preserved 17th century merchant&#x27;s townhouse Gladstone&#x27;s Land owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The lower end of the Lawnmarket is intersected by George IV Bridge on the right (south) and Bank Street on the left (north), leading to The Mound and the New Town. The view down Bank Street is closed by the baroque headquarters of the Bank of Scotland.

On the south-west corner of this intersection, with its entrance on George IV Bridge, is the Hotel Missoni, replacing the former Lothian Regional Council offices. This building is of controversial design, winning a Scottish Civic Trust award and a 2010 RIBA award, but also being nominated for (but not winning) the Carbuncle Cup in 2009.

Between Bank Street and St Giles Street, marking the end of the Lawnmarket, the High Court of Justiciary, Scotland&#x27;s supreme criminal court, is housed in the Justiciary Building.

==High Street==

On the south side, about one-third of the way down from the Castle toward the Palace is Parliament Square, named after the old Parliament House which housed both the law courts and the old Parliament of Scotland between the 1630s and 1707 (when its existence was ended by the Act of Union). Parliament House now houses the Court of Session, Scotland&#x27;s supreme civil court. St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, the High Kirk of Edinburgh, also stands in Parliament Square.

By the West Door of St Giles&#x27; is the Heart of Midlothian, a heart-shaped pattern built into the &quot;setted&quot; road, marking the site of the Old Tolbooth, formerly the centre of administration, taxation and justice in the burgh. The prison was described by Sir Walter Scott as the &quot;Heart of Midlothian&quot;, and soon after demolition the city fathers marked the site with a heart mosaic. Locals have traditionally spat upon the heart&#x27;s centre as a sign of contempt for the prison. On the north side, opposite St Giles&#x27;, stand Edinburgh City Chambers, where the City of Edinburgh Council meets. On the south side, just past the High Kirk, is the Mercat Cross from which royal proclamations are read and the summoning of Parliament announced.

The whole south side of buildings from St Giles to the Tron Kirk had to be rebuilt or refaced in the 1820s following the Great Edinburgh Fire of 1824. This was done in a Georgian style, stepping down the hill.

The central focus of the Royal Mile is a major intersection with the Bridges. North Bridge runs north over Waverley station to the New Town&#x27;s Princes Street. South Bridge (which appears at street level to be simply a road with shops on either side—only one arch is visible from below) spans the Cowgate to the south, a street in a hollow below, and continues as Nicolson Street past the Old College building of the University of Edinburgh.
At John Knox&#x27;s House the High Street narrows to a section of the street formerly known as the Netherbow, which, at its crossroads with Jeffrey Street (north) and St Mary&#x27;s Street (south), marked the former city boundary. At this point stood the Netherbow Port, a fortified gateway between Edinburgh and the Canongate (until 1856 a separate burgh), which was removed in 1764 to improve traffic flow. The Scottish Storytelling Centre is a modern extension to John Knox House, owned by the Church of Scotland. It opened in 2006, replacing the former Netherbow Arts Centre, which itself replaced the Moray-Knox Church in the 1960s. Following the English victory over the Scots at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, a city wall was built around Edinburgh known as the Flodden Wall, some parts of which survive. The Netherbow Port was a gateway in this wall and brass studs in the road mark its former position. On the corner of St Mary&#x27;s Street is the World&#x27;s End Pub which takes its name from the adjacent World&#x27;s End Close, whimsically so named because this was in former times the last close in Edinburgh before entering the Canongate.

==Entertainment for the wedding of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1558==
There was a triumph or show at the Salt Tron and other locations on the Royal Mile to celebrate the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Francis II of France, on 3 July 1558. The wedding itself took place in Paris on 24 April 1558. The Edinburgh entertainment was written and produced by William Lauder and William Adamson. Walter Binning painted the &quot;play cart&quot; for actors portraying the signs of the seven planets and Cupid. Artificial &quot;summer trees&quot; decorated with fruit made from tennis balls covered with gold foil or leaf were placed on four stages. The seven planets had been portrayed in a show in Paris after the wedding.

Other 16th-century royal entertainments at the Tron and on the Royal Mile include the Entry of Mary, Queen of Scots (1561), the Entry of James VI (1579), and the Entry of Anne of Denmark (1590). In July 1598, scholars from Edinburgh High School put on a satirical play at the Tolbooth. Costumes were made for the characters of a Pope, two Cardinals, and several friars. After the performance the costumes were donated to the poor.

==Murders of note==

Several infamous murders have taken place on the central section of the Royal Mile:

*George Lockhart, Lord Carnwath, murdered by John Chieslie in 1689.
*James Mackcoull, murdered William Begbie in 1806 in the close leading to Tweeddale Court.
*World&#x27;s End Close, double murder in 1977 by Angus Sinclair.

==Canongate==

Beyond the crossroads, the Royal Mile continues down the Canongate, meaning literally &quot;the canons&#x27; way&quot; when it was used in former times by the Augustinian canons of Holyrood Abbey. The street continues downhill past Moray House (now the main academic offices of Moray House School of Education of the University of Edinburgh), the Canongate Tolbooth (now a museum of social history called The People&#x27;s Story), the Kirk of the Canongate (the Canongate&#x27;s parish church and a thriving congregation of the Church of Scotland) and the new Scottish Parliament Building to Holyrood Palace and the ruined abbey. Until 1856 the Canongate was not merely a street, but the name of the surrounding burgh, separate from Edinburgh and outside the Flodden Wall.

==Abbey Strand==
This street is the short approach to the Palace of Holyroodhouse at the foot of the Canongate. One of the buildings On the north side, the building to the east was the house of Lucky Spence, a notorious brothel madam, remembered in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s poem, &quot;Lucky Spence&#x27;s Last Advice&quot;. The building to the west was described as a new &quot;Great Mansion&quot; in 1570. Renaissance painted ceilings were salvaged from the building in 1967. Some of the timbers were felled in the 1560s. During 20th century restorations by the Ministry of Works, other painted beams found at Midhope Castle and Caroline Park were inserted into the buildings.

On the south side is the King&#x27;s Gallery, used to exhibit items in the Royal collection, in the shell of the former Holyrood Free Church and Duchess of Gordon&#x27;s School. There are also the remains of the gatehouse of Holyrood Palace built by Walter Merlioun for James IV, with a carving of the royal coat-of-arms of James V set in the wall.

<text>Richard ap Meryk (or ap [[Meurig]]), anglicised to Richard Amerike (or Ameryk) ( 1440–1503) was a British merchant, royal customs officer and later, sheriff of Bristol. Several claims have been made for Amerike by popular writers of the late twentieth century. One was that he was the major funder of the voyage of exploration launched from Bristol by the Venetian John Cabot in 1497, and that Amerike was the owner of Cabot&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Matthew&quot;. The other claim revived a theory first proposed in 1908 by a Bristolian scholar and amateur historian, Alfred Hudd. Hudd&#x27;s theory, greatly elaborated by later writers, suggested that the continental name America was derived from Amerike&#x27;s surname in gratitude for his sponsorship of Cabot&#x27;s successful discovery expedition to &#x27;the new World&#x27;. However, neither claim is backed up by hard evidence, and the consensus view is that America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer.

==Biography==

&quot;Amerike&quot; is an anglicised spelling of the Welsh name &quot;ap Meurig&quot;, &quot;ap Meuric&quot; or &quot;ap Meryk&quot;, which means &quot;son of Meurig&quot;. It was, however, only one of the many different ways that the customs officer&#x27;s name was rendered, even in official documents. The &quot;Amerike&quot; version was noted by some modern historians because it looked like &quot;America&quot; and because this was how his name was spelled on a tomb brass created for his daughter in 1538.

Ap Meryk&#x27;s place and date of birth are unknown. One modern author suggests that Richard Amerike was born in 1445 at Meryk Court, Weston under Penyard, near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. He may have been born earlier than this, since one of Amerike&#x27;s daughters, Joan, was married to a future lawyer, John Broke, by April 1479. While there were certainly Merricks in and around Weston under Penyard, Richard Amerike&#x27;s genealogy and connection to Merrick Court have not been verified. The only contemporary document to refer to his background states that he was from Chepstow, a town in Monmouthshire, Wales.

Little is known of the first thirty years of Ap Meryk&#x27;s life. His wife, married at an unknown date, was called Lucy. The latter part of Amerike&#x27;s adult life was spent in, or near, Bristol. This was one of the largest ports of medieval England. Amerike prospered as a merchant and, after 1485, as a gentleman and an officer of the Crown. He is first found in Bristol customs accounts in 1472, trading in Irish fish. The published customs accounts of 1479–1480 show him continuing to trade to Ireland, but also participating in Bristol&#x27;s valuable trade with Portugal and Bordeaux. In other years he also traded to Spain. Amerike was a burgess of Bristol by at least the mid-1470s. Becoming a burgess would have both admitted him as a freeman of the city and marked him as a member of its political elite. By this time he was sufficiently wealthy to lend £50 towards the ransom from Breton pirates of a great-nephew of William Canynges. A Bristol tax return of 1484 records that his household servants included an Icelander. He was also buying land. By the early 1490s Amerike&#x27;s main landed estate, acquired by purchase, seems to have been in Long Ashton on the Somerset side of the River Avon.

When Amerike traded as a merchant, he would have used a distinctive merchant&#x27;s mark to identify his goods. Unfortunately when Amerike shipped on the &quot;Trinity&quot; of Bristol for a voyage to Andalucia in 1480 the purser, whose private accounts survive, failed to record the mark of Amerike, or indeed of any other merchant shipping. The mark associated with Amerike in modern times belongs to a different man, living a century later.

In 1485 Richard Amerike was appointed to the customs service in Bristol&#x27;s neighbouring port of Bridgwater, with the post of controller of customs. This should have meant that he dwelled within the confines of the port (which included Minehead and Combwich), but whether he did so is unknown. In September 1486 Amerike became one of the customs officials in Bristol, holding the post of King&#x27;s Customs Officer, known as a &quot;Customer&quot;, from 1486 until December 1502. During his period of office he was several times accused of malpractice, including false accounting, and was obliged to pay a substantial sum of money to the King, Henry VII, for his pardon. As a customs officer Amerike could not hold high civic office since this was forbidden by Statute but at the first election after he had ceased to be Customer, he was appointed as one of the city&#x27;s two sheriffs. He died in post, probably around December 1503, and was replaced as sheriff by Robert Thorne. Amerike&#x27;s precise date of death and place of burial are unknown. His heirs were his daughters, only one of whom is known. Joan (or Jane) Broke (née Amerike) (d. 1538) lies beside her husband, John Broke, in the church of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. Their tomb brass names Richard Amerike as her father, and once included the arms of both Broke and Amerike. This is now missing. Some two centuries after the armorial scutcheon disappeared, the arms of Amerike were described as &quot;paly of six, or and azure, on a fess gules, three mullets argent&quot;.

==Richard Amerike and John Cabot==
Popular interest in Amerike centres on his association with the Venetian explorer Zuan (Giovanni) Caboto, better known as John Cabot. Under the authority of King Henry VII of England John Cabot led three voyages of discovery from Bristol in search of new lands and a route to the supposed riches of the East. The first expedition, of 1496, was abortive. The second, in 1497, was the famous expedition in the &quot;Matthew&quot; of Bristol, which found &quot;new land&quot; that Cabot thought was part of Asia but was probably the modern Newfoundland. The outcome of the third voyage of 1498 is unclear, and the subject of much speculation. It has always been thought that funding for the voyages came from Bristol merchants. This made sense, since under the terms of Cabot&#x27;s letters patent from Henry VII, which gave him his authority, all trade from any new lands discovered was to pass through Bristol. However, no list of sponsors has ever been found, and the only proven funding, in amounts insufficient for a voyage, came from the London branch of the Florentine banking house of the Bardi and, in 1498, from Henry VII. Other names have been suggested.

The idea that Richard Amerike was an important supporter of Cabot gained currency in the late 20th century among popular historians, as did the notion that Amerike was owner and main funder of the &quot;Matthew&quot;, Cabot&#x27;s ship of 1497. Evan Jones and Margaret Condon, of the University of Bristol&#x27;s &quot;Cabot Project&quot; have found no documentary evidence for any of this. Indeed, they suggest that Ap Meryk may have been hostile to Cabot because the terms of the explorer&#x27;s royal patent would have made it difficult for the port&#x27;s customs officers to profit from any trade established to new lands. This may explain why the customs officers created problems for the explorer by refusing to pay the initial instalment of the pension he was granted in December 1497, despite the existence of an order from the King stating that this should happen.

Richard Amerike did have one important responsibility towards John Cabot. Amerike, and his fellow customs officer, Arthur Kemys, were the paymasters for the pension of £20 a year granted by Henry VII to John Cabot on 13 December 1497. Cabot&#x27;s grant specified that he was to be paid out of revenues arising from the customs dues payable to the Crown on goods exported and imported in the port of Bristol by way of merchandise. Amerike and Kemys were responsible for collecting those revenues and accounting for them to the Exchequer at Westminster. Local payment in Bristol made a lot of sense for the explorer and, provided all the documentation was in order, Amerike and Kemys would then be able to claim the payment to Cabot as a legitimate expense when they accounted for their revenues in the Exchequer at the end of the accounting year. In the mid-1890s Edward Scott, a &quot;Keeper&quot; or senior archivist at the British Museum, and from 1891 Keeper of the Muniments in Westminster Abbey, discovered a stray Exchequer document that showed this process and two years-worth of pension payments to Cabot by Amerike and his colleague in 1497–1499. In 1897 the document was published in transcript and facsimile by Scott and the Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd. Kemys and &quot;Richard ap Meryke&quot; or &quot;a Meryk&quot; are named at the head of every section of the account. The &quot;Cabot Roll&quot; remains an important discovery for the history of John Cabot.

==Theory of the naming of America==
In 1908, the local Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd first proposed the theory that the word &quot;America&quot; had evolved from Amerike or ap Meryk. Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot;. Hudd&#x27;s speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, who expanded Hudd&#x27;s argument with speculations about the voyages of the &quot;Matthew&quot; and later trade with the Eastern seaboard, which Amerike is known to have had financial interests in. It is proposed that as a main investor, Amerike&#x27;s name would have been noted on ships&#x27; rutters or working charts, indicating the locations where his cargo had been traded. It is further supposed that such secret documents could have been seized by Spanish explorers when a British voyage was mysteriously lost during the same period that Amerigo Vespucci was mapping the coast of Brazil -this information later reaching Waldseemüller. However, this cannot be verifiably proved unless original documents come to light. The consensus view continues to be that America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer.

Amerike&#x27;s coat of arms is coincidentally also reminiscent of the modern Flag of the United States (Stars and Stripes).

<text>Distributed Proofreaders (commonly abbreviated as DP or PGDP) is a web-based project that supports the development of e-texts for Project Gutenberg by allowing many people to work together in proofreading drafts of e-texts for errors. the site had digitized 48,000 titles.

== History ==

Distributed Proofreaders was founded by Charles Franks in 2000 as an independent site to assist Project Gutenberg. Distributed Proofreaders became an official Project Gutenberg site in 2002.

On 8 November 2002, Distributed Proofreaders was slashdotted, and more than 4,000 new members joined in one day, causing an influx of new proofreaders and software developers, which helped to increase the quantity and quality of e-text production. In July 2015, the 30,000th Distributed Proofreaders produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg. DP-contributed e-texts comprised more than half of works in Project Gutenberg, .

On 31 July 2006, the Distributed Proofreaders Foundation was formed to provide Distributed Proofreaders with its own legal entity and not-for-profit status. IRS approval of section 501(c)(3) status was granted retroactive to 7 April 2006.

== Proofreading process ==

Public domain works, typically books with expired copyright, are scanned by volunteers, or sourced from digitization projects and the images are run through optical character recognition (OCR) software. Since OCR software is far from perfect, many errors often appear in the resulting text. To correct them, pages are made available to volunteers via the Internet; the original page image and the recognized text appear side by side. This process thereby distributes the time-consuming error-correction process, akin to distributed computing.

Each page is proofread and formatted several times, and then a post-processor combines the pages and prepares the text for uploading to Project Gutenberg.

Besides custom software created to support the project, DP also runs a forum and a wiki for project coordinators and participants.

== Related projects ==

=== DP Europe ===
In January 2004, Distributed Proofreaders Europe started, hosted by Project Rastko, Serbia. This site had the ability to process text in Unicode UTF-8 encoding. Books proofread centered on European culture, with a considerable proportion of non-English texts including Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, and many others. , DP Europe had produced 787 e-texts, the last of these in November 2011.

The original DP is sometimes referred to as &quot;DP International&quot; by members of DP Europe. However, DP servers are located in the United States, and therefore works must be cleared by Project Gutenberg as being in the public domain according to U.S. copyright law before they can be proofread and eventually published at DP.

=== DP Canada ===
In December 2007, Distributed Proofreaders Canada launched to support the production of e-books for Project Gutenberg Canada and take advantage of shorter Canadian copyright terms. Although it was established by members of the original Distributed Proofreaders site, it is a separate entity. All its projects are posted to Faded Page, their book archive website. In addition, it supplies books to Project Gutenberg Canada (which launched on Canada Day 2007) and (where copyright laws are compatible) to the original Project Gutenberg.

In addition to preserving Canadiana, DP Canada is notable because it is the first major effort to take advantage of Canada&#x27;s copyright laws which may allow more works to be preserved. Unlike copyright law in some other countries, Canada has a &quot;life plus 50&quot; copyright term. This means that works by authors who died more than fifty years ago may be preserved in Canada, whereas in other parts of the world those works may not be distributed because they are still under copyright.

Notable authors whose works may be preserved in Canada but not in other parts of the world include Clark Ashton Smith, Dashiell Hammett, Ernest Hemingway, Carl Jung, A. A. Milne, Dorothy Sayers, Nevil Shute, Walter de la Mare, Sheila Kaye-Smith and Amy Carmichael.

<text>Warp Records (or simply Warp) is a British independent record label founded in Sheffield in 1989 by the record store employees Steve Beckett and Rob Mitchell and the record producer Robert Gordon. It is currently based in London. Artists signed to Warp include Flying Lotus, Plaid, Oneohtrix Point Never, Danny Brown, Brian Eno, Hudson Mohawke, Kelela and Yves Tumor. 

In the early 1990s, Warp became associated with the UK&#x27;s northern bleep techno scene, including acts such as LFO, Sweet Exorcist, Forgemasters and Nightmares on Wax. The 1992 compilation &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, a compilation of tracks by various Warp artists, helped establish the intelligent dance music genre. Subsequently, Warp became the home of influential acts such as Aphex Twin, Autechre, Squarepusher, and Boards of Canada. In 2004, Warp opened the online store bleep.com, which sells downloadable music free of digital rights management.

==History==
=== 1989–1991: Bleep techno===

Warp was founded amidst the development of Northern England&#x27;s &quot;bleep techno&quot; scene, often characterized as the first uniquely British rave style. While drawing influence from American techno and house, bleep artists also utilized electro-style synthesizer sounds and unusually heavy bass. In addition to its simple synth tones (the eponymous &quot;bleeps&quot;), sub-bass inspired by reggae sound systems, and sparse instrumentation, bleep techno also utilised breakbeat-inspired drum machine patterns.

Warp was opened in 1989 by Steve Beckett and the late Rob Mitchell, who had both gained experience working at Sheffield&#x27;s FON record shop, alongside record producer Robert Gordon. The name was chosen because the original name, &#x27;Warped Records&#x27;, was difficult to distinguish over the telephone. The first release (WAP1) was by Forgemasters (produced by Robert Gordon), whose 500 copy pressing of &quot;Track with no Name&quot; was financed by an Enterprise Allowance grant and distributed in a borrowed car. It set a trend for the early releases both in terms of sound, and the use of purple sleeves (designed by the Designers Republic). The follow-up was Nightmares on Wax&#x27;s &quot;Dextrous&quot;, which sold around 30,000 copies. This led to greater commercial success; by its fifth release the label had its first Top 20 chart entry with LFO and their eponymous single, &quot;LFO&quot;, which sold 130,000 copies and peaked at No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1990; by coincidence, that same month another Warp act, Tricky Disco, reached No. 14 in the UK chart with another eponymous single, &quot;Tricky Disco&quot;.

Warp&#x27;s third record, &quot;Testone&quot; (1990) by Sweet Exorcist (Richard H. Kirk and Richard Barratt), defined Sheffield&#x27;s bleep techno sound, by making playful use of sampled sounds from Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Computer Game&quot; (1978) and the film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). The first album released was Sweet Exorcist&#x27;s &quot;C.C.E.P.&quot; in 1991. In the same year Robert Gordon left Warp acrimoniously.

===1992–1999: &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;===
Warp went on to release a series of singles and albums from 1992 under the &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; heading, a series of experimental electronic music releases by artists such as Aphex Twin (as Diceman and later Polygon Window), Autechre, B12, the Black Dog, Richie Hawtin and Alex Paterson (of the Orb). Initially all the album releases used gatefold sleeves and coloured vinyl, often designed by the Designers Republic or Phil Wolstenholme. A VHS compilation of digitally animated music videos called &quot;Motion&quot; was released in conjunction with the second &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; compilation, and featured an early work by director David Slade.

In 1996, Warp started the Blech club night in Sheffield, also in London between 1997 and 1999, and released an accompanying compilation CD under the same name. The artwork, created by the Designers Republic, had a distinctive Japanese manga influence. Blech club nights include:
* Blech01 (31 Oct 1997): Seefeel with Boards of Canada
* Blech 02 (28 Nov 1997): Autechre with Cylob
* Blech 03 (30 Jan 1998): Plone

In 1998, Warp signed Boards of Canada, a duo that would go on to release some of the most highly revered electronic music albums of their time: &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; (1998) and &quot;Geogaddi&quot; (2002).

In 1999, the label released &quot;Warp 10: Influences, Classics, Remixes&quot;, a compilation spanning six discs, featuring early acid house and techno music that influenced the label and its artists, as well as tracks from Warp&#x27;s back catalogue, and new remixes of Warp material. The collection celebrated the label&#x27;s tenth anniversary.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In 2000, the label moved its operations to London along with its physical music and merchandise store Warpmart.

Co-founder Rob Mitchell was diagnosed with cancer in early 2001. He died later that year, aged 38.

In January 2004, Warp launched an online digital music and entertainment store, Bleep.com, notable for being the first store in the world to completely avoid all digital rights management features in the downloadable tracks, unlike other music stores such as iTunes and Rhapsody. Warpmart has now been absorbed into Bleep.com. Today Bleep sells a carefully curated selection of music from a diverse range of labels. The site has also released its own limited edition LPs The Green Series, and an annual digital release comprising the Top 100 tracks of each year.

On 27 September 2004, Warp released its second music video compilation, named &quot;WarpVision&quot;, featuring most of the videos produced from 1989 to 2004.

2005 saw the release of &quot;Warp&quot;, the first book in the Labels Unlimited series. Written by Rob Young, the book gave an illustrated history of the label, as well as offering a complete discography. The Warp website said the book was &quot;A very beautiful thing and like our very own This Is Your Life&quot;, referring to the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; UK TV series.

The label continued to expand its roster, signing acts including !!!, Battles, Born Ruffians, Maxïmo Park, Gravenhurst and Grizzly Bear.

For the label&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2009, several Warp20 concerts took place in Paris, New York City, Sheffield, Tokyo, Berlin and London. Warp also celebrated by releasing the Warp20 box set, composed of six parts:
* &quot;Warp20 (1989-2009) The Complete Catalogue&quot;: a 192-page book of artwork from every Warp release since the label began.
* &quot;Warp20 (Chosen)&quot;: a double CD album, with ten songs chosen by Warp fans and ten chosen by founder Steve Beckett
* &quot;Warp20 (Recreated)&quot;: a double CD album that included twenty brand new cover versions of Warp songs by Warp artists past and present
* &quot;Warp20 (Unheard)&quot;: a triple 10&quot; vinyl set of unheard tracks from artists such as Boards Of Canada, Autechre and Broadcast.
* &quot;Warp20 (Elemental)&quot;: a CD album featuring an hour-long piece by Osymyso, made from sections, samples and fragments of Warp music from the previous twenty years.
* &quot;Warp20 (Infinite)&quot;: a double 10&quot; vinyl of loops from Warp tracks.

=== 2010–present ===
Warp continued to release albums, from artists such as Hudson Mohawke, Flying Lotus, Mark Pritchard, Bibio, Jamie Lidell, Lonelady, Leila, and Gonjasufi. Signings included Brian Eno, Oneohtrix Point Never, Mount Kimbie, Kwes., Darkstar, Kelela, patten and Jeremiah Jae.

2013 saw the release of Broadcast&#x27;s album &quot;Berberian Sound Studio,&quot; the soundtrack to the film of the same name. Warp released a split remix 12&quot; for Record Store Day, which was a collaboration between Brian Eno, Nicolas Jaar and Grizzly Bear. In March, Autechre broadcast two 10-hour radio shows to celebrate the release of their 11th album, &quot;Exai&quot;. Boards of Canada&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Harvest&quot; charted worldwide, reaching number 7 in the UK Albums Chart, and number 13 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 – vinyl reissues of their albums and EPs followed in October and November. Nightmares on Wax (George Evelyn) released his first album in five years, entitled &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good&quot;, and followed this with one of his biggest ever international tours, with a live band.

In 2013, Warp also won Independent Label Of The Year at the AIM Awards. In October of that year, to coincide with the &quot;Universal Everything &amp; You - Drawing in Motion&quot; exhibition running at the National Media Museum&#x27;s Media Space at Science Museum, London, a 20-minute piece created by Simon Pyke (Freeform), built upon the foundations of the exhibition soundtrack, was released. In December 2013 Warp collaborated with Tate Britain to present a free evening of performance and installations, &quot;Warp x Tate&quot;, alongside artist Jeremy Deller, inspired by Deller&#x27;s work &#x27;The History of the World&#x27;, with contributions from Oneohtrix Point Never, Patten, Darkstar, Hudson Mohawke and Rustie.

In 2019, Warp celebrated their 30th anniversary (stylized as WXAXRXP, a combination of WARP, and XXX, the roman numeral for 30) with three days straight of broadcasts on NTS Radio featuring old radio performances by various artists, as well as a few new ones. In addition Warp released a 10 EP set (vinyl-only) of 20 minute radio sessions, featuring (among other things) Aphex Twin&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Peel Session 2&quot; and a version of Boards of Canada&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Peel Session&quot; that included the final track (&quot;XYZ&quot;, which was cut from almost all previous releases of the EP).

=== Music videos ===
Warp has released a number of ground-breaking and original videos that have launched their directors&#x27; careers. Much of these videos were compiled for the 2004 &quot;WarpVision: The Videos 1989-2004&quot; DVD.

Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker directed some of Warp&#x27;s earliest videos while at London&#x27;s Central Saint Martins art school, including LFO&#x27;s eponymous &quot;LFO&quot; in 1990, Nightmares On Wax&#x27;s &quot;Aftermath&quot; in 1991, and Aphex Twin&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;On&quot;.

Chris Cunningham is a frequent collaborator with Warp artists. He has directed videos for Aphex Twin&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, as well as &quot;Come On My Selector&quot; by Squarepusher and &quot;Second Bad Vilbel&quot; by Autechre. &quot;Come To Daddy&quot; was chosen by Pitchfork as the best video of the 1990s, and &quot;Windowlicker&quot; was nominated for Best British Video at the 2000 Brit Awards. Cunningham&#x27;s short film &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot;, soundtracked by Aphex Twin, was distributed by Warp Films in 2005.

In 2013, Kahlil Joseph&#x27;s short film for Flying Lotus&#x27; &quot;Until The Quiet Comes&quot; won a Short Film Special Jury Award at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and Video of the Year at the 2013 UK Music Video Awards. On 12 April, Adam Buxton hosted BUG: Warp Records Special at the BFI Southbank, London, as part of Warp Films&#x27; 10th Anniversary.

==Artists past and present==
Artists in &quot;italics&quot; are artists that are currently signed to Warp.

==Warp subsidiaries and partnerships==
Warp launched a film company, Warp Films (which also shares staff with Warp X) and digital download store Bleep in 2004. Bleep carries music from a number of smaller labels as well as Warp. In 2009, Warpmart was incorporated into Bleep, which now sells downloads, physical releases and merchandise from hundreds of record labels. Bleep also operates a record imprint of Warp.

A number of music sub labels have also been set up by Warp, namely Lex Records (now operates independently from Warp), Gift Records and Arcola.

Warp assists in the distribution of certain records released by LuckyMe and Night Slugs/Fade To Mind; the aforementioned labels are partner labels (not imprints) of Warp.

<text>Thomas Russell Jenkinson (born 17 January 1975), known professionally as Squarepusher, is an English electronic musician, record producer, bassist, multi-instrumentalist and DJ. His music spans several genres including drum and bass, IDM, acid techno, jazz fusion, and electroacoustic music. His recordings are often typified by a combination of complex drum programming, live instrumental playing, and digital signal processing. Since 1995, he has recorded for Warp Records as well as smaller labels, including Rephlex Records. He is the older brother of Ceephax Acid Crew (Andy Jenkinson).

==Early life==
Tom Jenkinson was born and grew up in Chelmsford, Essex, England. The first school he attended was affiliated with Chelmsford Cathedral, exposing him to organ music. He took an interest in this, as well as in music reproduction equipment. In 1986, Jenkinson went to the King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford. One of his formative musical experiences came from seeing guitarist Guthrie Govan playing in the school&#x27;s inter-house music competition. He developed a lasting friendship with Govan. Jenkinson joined his first band at 12, a Metallica-influenced thrash metal group consisting of several other pupils from the school. Over subsequent years Jenkinson played bass guitar in various local bands, playing numerous shows around East Anglia and London, and took part in some studio recordings.

In 1991, Jenkinson became interested in house music, hardcore, acid house and techno. He cited hearing the track &quot;LFO&quot; by LFO as an early influence.

==Career==
=== 1993–1995: Early career ===
In August 1993, Jenkinson recorded a piece named &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;; with his friend, Hardy Finn, he raised enough money to release it with additional material on a vinyl 12&quot;. Jenkinson and his friends took the copies of the record to various local record shops but found reactions disappointing. In late 1994, Jenkinson began pursuing his fascination for integrating breakbeats into electronic music. At this time, Jenkinson was becoming obsessed with bringing a &quot;dark psychedelia&quot; to drum and bass (which would eventually reach its zenith with &quot;Go Plastic&quot; from 2001). By 1995 he was playing live sets, including a performance at Eurobeat 2000 at Turnmills in 1995, and &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; was part of his setlist. In 1995, he heard future Nothing Records label-mate Luke Vibert&#x27;s track &quot;Military Jazz&quot; (released under his Plug alias) and was inspired by its approach:
&quot;This track came on and, amongst the road noise and chatter, I heard what I thought was some sort of hip-hop track being played by a band. As the track progressed, I became more intrigued, as it sounded like they were trying to play as if it had been programmed. Then the Amen [break] came in, and I was floored; it sounded like a drummer playing breakbeats, and made me totally rethink my ideas of programming breaks.&quot; 

The first recordings using Jenkinson&#x27;s new setup were released on the Spymania label. Two EPs, &quot;Conumber&quot; and &quot;Alroy Road Tracks&quot;, were released in 1995 under the pseudonyms Squarepusher and The Duke of Harringay, respectively. Jenkinson began receiving invitations from clubs to play regular sets, including The Sir George Robey in Finsbury Park. He then placed two songs on Worm Interface releases, &quot;Dragon Disc 2&quot; and the &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot; EPs. 

During this period Jenkinson also made a remix for Ninja Tune&#x27;s DJ Food, which featured on the EP &quot;Refried Food&quot;. The remix led Ninja Tune to offer Jenkinson a record contract, which along with an offer from Belgium&#x27;s R&amp;S records he declined in favor of a contract offered by Warp Records, which was partially instigated by Richard D. James, known professionally as Aphex Twin. Correspondence between James and Jenkinson sprung up after meeting at The George Robey. The resulting meeting led to Jenkinson&#x27;s first hearing of the &quot;Hangable Auto Bulb&quot; EP which Richard had brought with him. But the meeting also facilitated James&#x27; initial selection of Jenkinson&#x27;s tracks that went on to form the &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot; album, released on Rephlex Records in 1996.

===1995–1999: Warp===
Jenkinson accepted a five-album record contract with Warp Records in December 1995. This led him to defer his studies at Chelsea Art College. Early in 1996, James completed the compilation process for &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot;, which was made from over 50 tracks that Jenkinson had given him on DAT, which were recorded from late 1994 to 1995. Around the same time James and Jenkinson recorded two tracks together, one of which was subsequently edited by Jenkinson and released as &quot;Freeman Hardy &amp; Willis Acid&quot; on the &quot;We Are Reasonable People&quot; compilation album in 1998. Jenkinson&#x27;s contribution to the other track was reinterpreted and released as &quot;Happy Little Wilberforce&quot; on the &quot;Alt. Frequencies&quot; compilation released on Worm Interface in 1996. 1996 saw Jenkinson starting to be offered performances both in the UK and in continental Europe.

Early that year Jenkinson made the acquaintance of Talvin Singh who offered him a slot at his club night &quot;Anokha&quot; held at the Blue Note Club in Hoxton Square, London. Jenkinson and Singh went on to play together on several occasions during this period, including improvised sessions at the end of the night at Anokha, one of which featured guitarist Guthrie Govan, and also at the first Big Chill Festival in 1996.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot; came &quot;Port Rhombus&quot; which was Jenkinson&#x27;s (by now known as Squarepusher) first release on Warp Records. The title track was initially a remix of a track by Ken Ishii, commissioned by R&amp;S Records in Belgium. However, the remix was rejected on the basis of it having insufficient similarity to Ishii&#x27;s piece. &quot;Significant Others&quot; used the DR660 drum machine running through a spring reverb, that Squarepusher found at a jumble sale.

Using the same equipment from the sessions that produced the majority of &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot;, Squarepusher now set about working on the material for his first album for Warp, &quot;Hard Normal Daddy&quot;. His broad conception for this record was &quot;to push away from the jazz influence that was being felt at the time to a more soundtrack-type of sound&quot;. According to Squarepusher, he was listening to—amongst other things—early Lalo Schifrin and the &quot;Deathwish&quot; soundtrack by Herbie Hancock around this time. However, the album also contains some abrupt diversions into quite different musical territory, evidenced in what Squarepusher calls the &quot;Industrial Psychedelia&quot; of &quot;Chin Hippy&quot; and &quot;Rustic Raver&quot;.

Squarepusher&#x27;s electric bass work becomes apparent on this record. He states that he was &quot;still battling with the influence of (Jaco) Pastorius.&quot; He wanted to &quot;make the styles interrogate each other, such that one track would question the premises of another and vice versa. As such I suppose it might indicate tentativeness, but in my mind at the time I liked the idea of bringing musical assumptions into question by smashing stylistically divergent elements into each other&quot;. In this he follows a precedent set by Frank Zappa, who Squarepusher claimed is &quot;always hovering in the background&quot; for him.

The sleeve artwork was generated from a set of images taken by Squarepusher wandering about Chelmsford town centre. The front cover image is based on a view of the gasometers situated at Wharf Road, near where he lived as a teenager. The 8-bit graphics reflected Squarepusher&#x27;s resurgence of interest in old video consoles and home computers at that time. This location was subsequently used in some of the press shots in the &quot;Hello Everything&quot; promotional campaign.

In January 1997, Squarepusher moved to a flat on Albion Road in Stoke Newington, London. This particular residence was shown in the Jockey Slut &quot;All Back to Mine&quot; article from that year, and it was also where Squarepusher&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;xxx&quot; documentary was filmed.

&quot;Journey To Reedham&quot; brings the 8-bit computer influence right into the foreground. The piece was the first to be recorded of the set and was originally commissioned to be used in a computer game, but Squarepusher decided it was too important to hand over to somebody else&#x27;s project. The track immediately became a favourite at live performances and was still making appearances as an encore in Tom&#x27;s run of live shows in 2013. &quot;The Body Builder&quot; was Tom&#x27;s favourite of the set. This exemplifies a more abstract take on the 8-bit aesthetic, with sounds constructed to deliberately resemble computer game sound effects. &quot;Come on My Selector&quot; has become one of Squarepusher&#x27;s most well-known tracks, partly due to it having a video by director Chris Cunningham. Doing the video led Squarepusher to develop a friendship with Chris Cunningham.

This period also saw the release of the &quot;Burningn&#x27;n Tree&quot; album, which was a compilation of Tom&#x27;s Spymania releases. The set includes three pieces that were recorded in late 1995 during the &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot; sessions that were not originally released on Spymania.

Squarepusher started considering new ideas about how to put music together. At this time James introduced Squarepusher to the music of Tod Dockstader, an American composer who had worked extensively in the 1960s, principally realising his compositions by tape editing. Alongside this Squarepusher was becoming interested in the work of 20th Century composers such as Stockhausen and Ligeti, specifically their electronic and electroacoustic works.

After &quot;Budakhan Mindphone&quot; was completed in May 1998, Squarepusher went to South East Asia for two months, and on this trip acquired a selection of Gamelan instruments. He stated that he was keen to carry on with the method of making music he had developed making the &quot;abstract jazz&quot; elements of &quot;Music Is Rotted One Note&quot;. Given that the &quot;abstract jazz/musique concrète&quot; idea had in Tom&#x27;s view been proven by &quot;Music Is Rotted One Note&quot;. He decided to switch focus slightly and approach the following phase with a less rigorous aesthetic in mind.

This is the first record where Squarepusher started using effects processors in such a way that values for the available parameters would all vary as the piece progressed.
Squarepusher relates that &quot;Iambic 5 Poetry&quot; is &quot;apparently one of Björk&#x27;s favourite songs&quot;. This period also produced the &quot;Maximum Priest&quot; EP. &quot;Our Underwater Torch&quot; was partially inspired by a developing obsession he had for the sounds of water. He stated that this piece was obliquely inspired by the films &quot;Solaris&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot; by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. The organ in this piece is triggered directly from an electric bass. &quot;Decathlon Oxide&quot; carried on the ideas initiated in &quot;Fly Street&quot; and &quot;Varkatope&quot; from &quot;Budakhan Mindphone&quot; and features a Gamelan gong. The record also contains remixes by Luke Vibert, Autechre and Matthew Yee-King.
Very few live shows happened around this time, although Squarepusher claims he did in fact do quite a few performances unannounced:
He did organise two shows for an ephemeral organisation known as the &quot;Squarepusher Ensemble&quot; which amongst others featured Jamie Lidell on vocals, Mick Beck on saxophone and Squarepusher on bass. The idea of the group was to try to approximate some of the aesthetic of &quot;Music Is Rotted One Note&quot; and &quot;Budakhan Mindphone&quot;. The improvisation took place with no guidelines.

In March 1999, with the &quot;Budakhan Mindphone&quot; and &quot;Maximum Priest&quot; sessions wrapped up, he found himself in quite changed circumstances. He had made new friends in Sheffield and found himself a regular DJ and punter at various club nights around Sheffield. At this point he became quite skilled at tape editing. Another element that he was keen to bring back was the usage of sampled breakbeats. At this time, Squarepusher was frequenting a Manchester-based club night called &quot;Schizm&quot;. It was run by friends of Sean Booth and Rob Brown from Autechre who themselves had played there on occasion.

===2000–2013: &quot;Go Plastic&quot; to &quot;Ufabulum&quot;===
Early 2000 saw Squarepusher consider &quot;radical tactics&quot;. He states it became clear that it was high time return to sequencers and leave behind the live-playing approach, which he had adopted since late 1997. Around this time, he started seeing more of Chris Cunningham.

He was also revisiting a lot of the mid-1990s drum and bass that had so inspired his early releases. He describes the set-up for &quot;Go Plastic&quot; as follows: &quot;It was the next stage in the &quot;liquid effects processing&quot; idea. &quot;To me it was all about trying to make it sound totally liquid and psychedelic, like liquid LSD. Not evil though, &quot;evil&quot; music just sounds daft and theatrical to me. I&#x27;ve always had a Frankenstein-thing going on, ever since I was kid when I was playing around with electronics. I love the idea of the set-up having such a complex level of internal activity that it begins to resemble a living being.&quot; &quot;My Red Hot Car&quot; is his most well known piece. That and &quot;Boneville Occident&quot; were two of the earliest pieces from these sessions. The piece &quot;Tommib&quot; was so named after Squarepusher recalls that: &quot;Aphex [Twin] was helping me edit a track for Vic Acid and he named the project &#x27;Tommib&#x27; and I always remembered that for some reason.&quot; Squarepusher claims that &quot;My Fucking Sound&quot; was written specifically with Chris Cunningham in mind: &quot;We had talked a lot in that period about working together, loads of ideas were flying around. That track was intended for Chris to use, and that project was called &quot;Spectral Musicians.&quot; He recalls that &quot;Aphex [Twin] rang up when I was finishing off the track. He asked what I was up to and I said something like &quot;I&#x27;ve got 31 bars left to write on this track I&#x27;m doing.&quot; He just started laughing and said he never thought of music like that. I suppose it does sound a bit strange and clinical.&quot;

After the sessions were completed in December 2000, he rang Steve Beckett to play him the record: &quot;We hadn&#x27;t talked since he left Sheffield more than a year before. I told him to come round and it totally blew his head off.&quot; Squarepusher started playing live again at this point: &quot;I played all of this new stuff supporting Tortoise at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. I did a gig at The 100 Club and I had Chris [Cunningham] supporting me doing a DJ set.&quot;

He played his first shows in America at this point, one of which was at the Coachella Festival. The plans to collaborate with Chris Cunningham were duly interrupted as well.

In the Summer of 2001, Warp cut a one-sided promo of the track &quot;Do You Know Squarepusher&quot;. After a brief during the latter half of 2001, he set up the studio at his new residence. Around this time, he started to work with computer-based synthesis and signal processing.

The cover version of &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; has a particular story to it: &quot;It was around this time that Rob Mitchell at Warp died. I was really fond of Rob. The last evening I spent with him was in Sheffield and he had been playing me some music by Joy Division. I decided to record that song as a memorial to him, but at the same time I really didn&#x27;t want to try and divert attention from the tragedy of his death to my record, that would have been repulsive. So I kept the story to myself&#x27;. Also included in this set is an edited recording of Tom&#x27;s appearance at Fuji Rock Festival in Japan in Summer 2001. He spent the remainder of 2002 working on software patches and recorded many pieces in that period that were to feature in his show at Warp&#x27;s 20th anniversary party in Sheffield in 2009.

2003 saw two of Squarepusher&#x27;s pieces being performed by the London Sinfonietta as part of the South Bank&#x27;s Ether Festival: &quot;It was an interesting idea. They chose &quot;Port Rhombus&quot; and &quot;The Tide&quot;.

He claims the idea that had been initiated with &quot;Mutilation Colony&quot;, namely to combine the DSP algorithmic approach with the live instrumentation based approach of &quot;Music Is Rotted One Note&quot; was now at the forefront of his mind. His studio set-up at that time incorporated all of the equipment he had amassed so far.
Parts of certain tracks on &quot;Ultravisitor&quot; and four entire pieces were recorded at shows in the UK and the US in summer of 2003. As such, Squarepusher says &quot;The start of &quot;Ultravisitor&quot; features ambient sound from the very same piece being played at a show in L.A. and the outro features ambient sound from a gig at the Leadmill in Sheffield. &quot;Menelec&quot; features an introduction from a show in Nottingham and the outro comes from Toronto I think. The start of &quot;Steinbolt&quot; was recorded in L.A. and the lots of Tetra-Sync including the live electric bass was recorded at the Bowery Ballroom in New York, apart from the intro which comes from Montreal.&quot;

He states that &quot;&quot;Ultravisitor&quot; seems like a big argument to me. In fact I&#x27;ve always liked that idea, that the way you structure albums and songs is that one element raises questions about other elements. That feels interesting to me, but Ultravisitor seems to do that to the extent that it risks being completely incoherent. But that is also the fun of it. I am fond of it.&quot;

The sleeve artwork, the first to contain a portrait of Squarepusher. He toured with the London Sinfonietta, performing the piece &quot;Tundra 4&quot; live. After the Sinfonietta tour, he toured America and Japan.
He states that at this point he had no immediate plans to make a record and that it seemed entirely possible that he would not make another. Nevertheless, some pieces were made in this period. A series of acid tracks were made, some of which were used in Tom&#x27;s appearance at Warp&#x27;s 20th anniversary in Sheffield 2009. &quot;Welcome To Europe&quot; and &quot;The Modern Bass Guitar&quot; were also made in this period using the same software system that Squarepusher had designed when he made &quot;Ultravisitor&quot;. The synth bassline in &quot;The Modern Bass Guitar&quot; was triggered from an electric bass using the midi bass system.
January 2005 saw the re-establishment of the studio at Tom&#x27;s residence in Essex. The pieces &quot;Theme From Sprite&quot;, &quot;Bubble Life&quot;, &quot;Vacuum Garden&quot;, &quot;Circlewave 2&quot; and &quot;Orient Orange&quot; were all made in early 2005.

All of these tracks are based on live drumming tracks, which Squarepusher had planned out quite meticulously beforehand, in contrast to similarly realised tracks on &quot;Music Is Rotted One Note&quot;.
&quot;Hello Meow&quot;, &quot;Planetarium&quot;, &quot;Rotate Electrolyte&quot; and &quot;Plotinus&quot; were made over the Summer and Autumn of 2005. The track &quot;Hello Meow&quot; was filmed at Koko in November 2005 and was edited into a promotional video for &quot;Hello Everything&quot; in 2006. &quot;Planetarium&quot; samples a particular variant of the Amen breakbeat which came from &quot;a dodgy bootleg 12&quot; from 1991 called &quot;Rave Masters Volume One&quot;.

Regarding the overall process of making &quot;Hello Everything&quot;, he states &quot;There never really were any &quot;Hello Everything&quot; sessions, unlike a lot of the things I&#x27;d done before&quot;.
Some editions of the album came with an extra CD entitled &quot;Vacuum Tracks&quot;.

Squarepusher appeared at Glastonbury and Glade Festival in the summer of 2005. Then in November 2005 he toured the UK with Luke Vibert and Cassette Boy featuring dates in London, Norwich, Falmouth, Birmingham, Newcastle, Leeds and Glasgow amongst others. This tour marked the first occasion when he had appeared in concert using live visuals.

At the time of the release of &quot;Hello Everything&quot;, Squarepusher appeared on the BBC&#x27;s Culture Show and was interviewed by Lauren Laverne, and also performed a short version of what was to become one of the pieces on &quot;Solo Electric Bass&quot;. It also became apparent that one of the reasons for him being requested to appear was that Andre 3000, who was also appearing on the show, had expressed such admiration for Tom&#x27;s work that he would like to work with him. He also appeared at the John Peel tribute event at the Electric Ballroom in Camden around the time of the release of the record. Late 2006 saw him generate the material that was eventually to be issued in 2009 as &quot;Numbers Lucent&quot;.

After the material that went to comprise &quot;Numbers Lucent&quot; was finished at the end of 2006, Tom exhausted his interest in making electronic music: &quot;At that point, I&#x27;d been working on electronic music in some shape or form for around fifteen years and without hardly any breaks. As I&#x27;ve said, one of my problems is that once I&#x27;ve established that an idea is in some way valid, that&#x27;s generally enough for me. I&#x27;m just acutely aware of how limited time is and I think I&#x27;d rather spend it doing what I do best which is taking risks and making experiments.&quot;
&quot;I was interested to see if I could develop a way of making music that was less destructive, because I was aware of how much I had brutalised myself living such an insane life over the last twelve years or so, how little I&#x27;d slept and so on. I started thinking again about doing more playing, more bass stuff again. It&#x27;s always been hard to give my bass playing any kind of priority when all of the mayhem is happening in the studio.&quot; So Tom chose to switch all of his attention to bass and to shut down the studio.

&quot;Glenn Max, curator at the South Bank, was really encouraging and offered me a nice gig in the Queen Elizabeth Hall to showcase it.&quot; Tom went on to spend every day playing the solo pieces, re-writing them and practising them: &quot;It became a lifestyle in the end and that was what I wanted. Tom also says that &quot;I&#x27;ve never been entirely comfortable with the whole virtuoso thing. They are so many dangers associated with it. It&#x27;s odd because it&#x27;s so effortless for me to play that I end up falling into that virtuoso camp by default. But if that&#x27;s where I am, I&#x27;m going to make some trouble in there. So I started to play around with the pieces in a way, playing them too fast. Sort of trying to make it a bit more punk and messy rather than like a spotless article of refinement.&quot;

The solo bass recording from Cité de la Musique is presented unedited as it was played on the night. The recording was released in 2009.
Tom went on to sell out the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Cité de la Musique in Paris with his Solo Electric Bass shows. Both were recorded and featured the saxophonist Evan Parker.

At the end of 2007, Squarepusher found himself at the close of the solo bass project. &quot;I was still playing all the time every day. So it seemed logical to get recording again, but make it live playing-centred.&quot; He claims he was fed up with the unprocessed sound of the bass that was tied up in the concept of the solo bass material, so he started experimenting with new DSP algorithms specifically for the bass. Also he had become a fan of the band Lightning Bolt over the last few years and was inspired to develop an electric bass sound with &quot;absolutely face-ripping distortion.&quot;

When Squarepusher came to tour this album, he decided he would need a drummer: &quot;I called Glenn [Max] at the South Bank and asked him if he knew any good drummers. He suggested Alex Thomas. I checked him out and he was amazing so we went for it.&quot; Squarepusher and Thomas went on to tour in November and December 2008, and then from April 2009 through the summer playing various festivals. This tour also saw Squarepusher develop the LED aspect to his show to the extent that on stage he had a massive screen behind Alex&#x27;s drum kit showing visual content triggered by his electric bass.

Regarding this album being an abrupt stylistic departure from earlier releases Toms says that: &quot;On an instinctive level, I just can&#x27;t resist seeing what happens when you press certain buttons, and especially the ones that the grown-ups tell you not to press. And as I&#x27;ve said, to me it&#x27;s all about the experiments.&quot;
In April 2011, Squarepusher played at a benefit concert for the Japanese Red Cross in the wake of the tsunami which devastated Japan on 11 March 2011.

Of the general direction, he says: &quot;I&#x27;ve reached guitar overload. I&#x27;ve started thinking about pure electronic music again. Something very melodic, very aggressive.&quot; He used a custom LED mask as part of the live presentation of this material. At the time, he made several appearances in festivals across the world including his first show in Brazil and during the Sónar Festival in Barcelona in June.

===2013–2024: &quot;Music for Robots&quot; to &quot;Dostrotime&quot;===
On 13 February 2014, an EP entitled &quot;Music for Robots&quot; was announced, a collaborative project composed by him and performed by the three robots that comprise the Z-Machines. Squarepusher first started working with the team of Japanese roboticists behind the Z-Machines in 2013, who had commissioned him to write music for robots that were capable of playing beyond the capabilities of the most advanced musicians. Following the success of the first piece of music, entitled &quot;Sad Robot Goes Funny&quot;, Squarepusher went on to compose four more pieces for the robots, which comprise the EP &quot;Music for Robots&quot;, released on April 7 (8 April in North America) 2014.

On 20 April 2015, a new LP entitled &quot;Damogen Furies&quot; was released. Reviewers commented that it is &quot;less funky but more clearly structured&quot; than past work. All the recordings on &#x27;Damogen Furies&#x27; were done in one take and were born out of Squarepusher&#x27;s development of his own software, which was designed for a spontaneous, streamlined, efficient way of performing live and, in turn, making the record. All this makes for Damogen Furies being an ideal work to hear in concert, as genuinely live electronic music, with the capacity for change a primary objective. The release of this saw him performing at his largest-ever London show at the Troxy, and headlining The White stage at Fuji Rocks Festival, Japan. The EP was made using software that Squarepusher programmed by himself.

In 2016, Squarepusher once again took his Shobaleader One band on the road, and is continuing to tour the project. He also wrote a suite of short organ pieces which were performed by James McVinnie as part of 2016 national tour &quot;The Secret Life of Organs&quot; celebrating the county&#x27;s great organs as the first &#x27;synthesisers&#x27; invented centuries before their electronic counterparts.

In 2018, he provided the ambient soundtrack for CBeebies hour long wind-down programme &quot;Daydreams&quot;, narrated by Olivia Colman. The same year, Jenkinson broke his wrist in Norway and was forced to temporarily stop playing guitar. The incident caused him to re-explore instruments he had previously played in the 1990s which informed his subsequent album, &quot;Be Up a Hello&quot;. Squarepusher was also influenced by the death of Chris Marshall, his childhood friend to whom he dedicated the album. Featuring a return to his acidic drum and bass roots the album was released on 31 January 2020. &quot;Vortrack&quot;, &quot;Vortrack&quot; (Fracture Remix), and &quot;Nervelevers&quot; were released in the weeks leading up to the album&#x27;s release.

On January 21, 2024, Squarepusher sent out an email to his subscribers on the Warp Records email list, linking to a download for a WAV file named &quot;XY.wav&quot;. Plugging the WAV file into an oscilloscope and plotting the signal as an XY plot revealed the word &quot;Dostrotime&quot;. &quot;Dostrotime&quot; was released on CD, LP, and digital download on 1 March 2024. The single &quot;Wendorlan&quot; was released to promote the album.

<text>The National Film Board of Canada (NFB; ) is a Canadian public film and digital media producer and distributor. An agency of the Government of Canada, the NFB produces and distributes documentary films, animation, web documentaries, and alternative dramas. In total, the NFB has produced over 13,000 productions since its inception, which have won over 5,000 awards. The NFB reports to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister of Canadian Heritage. It has bilingual production programs and branches in English and French, including multicultural-related documentaries.

==History==
===Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau===

The Exhibits and Publicity Bureau was founded on 19 September 1918, and was reorganized into the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau in 1923. The organization&#x27;s budget stagnated and declined during the Great Depression. Frank Badgley, who served as the bureau&#x27;s director from 1927 to 1941, stated that the bureau needed to transition to sound films or else it would lose its access to theatrical releases, but the organization did not gain the equipment until 1934, and by then it had lost its theatrical distributors. Badgley was able to get a 16 mm film facility for the bureau in 1931. The bureau was reorganized into the National Film Board of Canada on 11 June 1941, following John Grierson&#x27;s recommendation.

===Foundation and early history===

Ross McLean was working as the secretary to High Commissioner Vincent Massey when he met Grierson, and asked for Grierson to come to Canada to aide in the governmental film policy. Grierson made a report on the Canadian film industry in 1938, and the &quot;National Film Act&quot;, which he drafted, was passed on 2 May 1939 causing the creation of the NFB. The position of Film Commissioner was left vacant for months, as Ned Corbett declined the appointment, until Grierson, who proposed Badgley and Walter Turnbull for the position, accepted the position for six months in October 1939, but served until 1945. Grierson selected McLean to work as assistant commissioner and Stuart Legg to oversee the productions. Grierson sent in a letter of resignation on 27 November 1940, in protest of the CGMPB and NFB not being merged, but agreed to stay on for another six months and the merger happened. Employment rose from 55 to 787 from 1941 to 1945, although it was cut by 40% after the war ended.

&quot;The Case of Charlie Gordon&quot; was the NFB&#x27;s first English-language film and &quot;Un du 22e&quot; was its first French-language film. In 1944, Grierson established twelve units to handle production; &quot;The World in Action&quot; and &quot;Canada Carries On&quot;, Industrial Relations, Health and Rehabilitation, Newsreel and Armed Forces, Animation, Dominion-Provincial, Travel and Outdoors, Armed Services, Foreign Language Programme, French Language Programme, Agriculture, and Education. Employees were contracted for three months as Grierson believed that job security hurt organizational creativity, but most employees worked longer than three months.

Grierson made efforts to increase the theatrical distribution of NFB films, primarily its war-related films, as he was coordinating wartime information for the United Kingdom in North America. Famous Players aided in distribution and the Canadian Motion Picture War Services Committee, which worked with the War Activities Committee of the Motion Pictures Industry, was founded in 1940. NFB productions such as &quot;The World in Action&quot; was watched by 30-40 million people per month in the United Kingdom and United States in 1943, and &quot;Canada Carries On&quot; was watched by 2.25 million people by 1944. The audience for NFB newsreels reached 40-50 million per week by 1944.

Grierson opposed feature film production as he believed that Canada did not have a large enough market for an independent feature film industry. He supported working with American film companies and stated that &quot;the theatre film business is an international business, dependent when it comes to distribution on an alliance or understanding with American film interests&quot;. He travelled to Hollywood in 1944, and the NFB sent scripts to American companies for consideration.

Norman McLaren founded the NFB&#x27;s animation unit in 1942, and had George Dunning, René Jodoin, Wolf Koenig, Jean-Paul Ladouceur, Evelyn Lambart, Colin Low, Grant Munro, and Robert Verrall working there within a decade of its creation.

===Ross McLean administration===

Grierson lacked strong support in the Canadian government and some of his films received opposition from members of the government. &quot;Inside Fighting Russia&quot; was criticized for its support of the Russian Revolution and &quot;Balkan Powderkeg&quot; for criticizing the United Kingdom&#x27;s policy in the Balkans. Grierson and the NFB were attacked during the onset of the Cold War. The Federal Bureau of Investigation created a file on Grierson in 1942, due to the &quot;World in Action&quot; newsreel being considered too left-wing. Leo Dolan, an ally of Hepburn and the head of the Canadian Government Travel Bureau, accused Grierson of being Jewish and a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation supporter. The Gouzenko Affair implicated Freda Linton, one of Grierson&#x27;s secretaries, and the organization was criticized by the Progressive Conservative Party for subversive tendencies, financial waste, and being a monopoly. Grierson was also accused of being involved, but was proven not to be.

During McLean&#x27;s tenure film production was divided into four units in 1948. Unit A dealt with agriculture, non-English, and interpretative films, Unit B dealt with sponsored, scientific, cultural, and animated films, Unit C dealt with theatrical, newsreels, tourist, and travel films, and Unit D dealt with international affairs and special projects. This system continued until its abolition on 28 February 1964 when it had seven units, five English-language and two French-language.

In 1947, Grant McLean, the cousin of the NFB commissioner, shot &quot;The People Between&quot; and the Secretary of State for External Affairs&#x27;s department stated that some parts of the film were too favorable towards the Chinese Communist Party. Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis had NFB films removed from schools using accusations of communism.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police discovered that an employee for the NFB&#x27;s Production Division, who was a communist, took photos of top-secret military equipment. The Department of National Defence prohibited the NFB from making films for it. Ross McLean followed the recommendations of the department and declared the NFB a vulnerable agency and the RCMP requested the firing of 36 employees. The RCMP requested him to fire a list of employees, McLean refused to fire any employees without their disloyalty being proven. He was not reappointed as commissioner and replaced by William Arthur Irwin in 1950. Irwin reduced the demand and only three were fired.

===Irwin administration===

Irwin, the editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, was selected to replace McLean as commissioner of the NFB. The &quot;Financial Post&quot;, one of the NFB&#x27;s leading critics and the sister publication of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, stopped its criticism following Irwin&#x27;s selection and Kenneth Wilson, one of the NFB&#x27;s strongest critics, died in a plane crash although Floyd Chalmers, the president of Maclean-Hunter, criticized Irwin for leaving &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;.

Film production was centralized under Irwin by having one person oversee the four film units. He selected Donald Mulholland over James Beveridge and Mulholland was criticized for ignoring French-language film production. Unit E, dealing with sponsored work, and Unit F, dealing with French-language films, were created in 1951.

The Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, with Massey as its chair, was formed in 1949. The NFB submitted a brief asking to have a headquarters constructed, budget increases, and to become a Crown corporation. Robert Winters, whose ministry oversaw the NFB, stated that its brief did not represent government policy. The Association of Motion Picture Producers and Laboratories of Canada submitted a brief criticizing a government monopoly, with the NFB&#x27;s crown corporation request being referred to as an &quot;expansionist, monopolistic psychology&quot;, and that they were unable to compete with the NFB as it paid no taxes and was exempt from tariffs. The commission&#x27;s report supported the NFB and its requests for Crown corporation status and a headquarters were accepted.

In 1950, Irwin wrote to Robert Winters about a report on restructuring the NFB and Winters told Irwin to rewrite the 1939 &quot;Film Act&quot; as it was outdated by then. The &quot;National Film Act&quot; was passed in June, and took effect on 14 October.

A Canadian tour by Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip was filmed using 35 mm Eastman colour-film stock, which was not available to the public yet. The film was initially meant to be two reels, worth twenty minutes, but grew to five reels as they could not determine what to cut. Irwin met with Harvey Harnick, the NFB&#x27;s Columbia theatrical distributor, and J.J. Fitzgibbons, the president of Famous Players, and Fitzgibbons told Irwin that he would screen all five reels if the film was completed for a Christmas release. &quot;Royal Journey&quot; opened in seventeen first-run theatres and over course of the next two years it was screened in 1,249 Canadian theatres where it was watched by a record two million people and the film was also screened in forty other countries. The film cost $88,000, but the NFB gained a profit of $150,000 and the film&#x27;s success was one of the reasons Grierson stated that Irwin &quot;saved the Film Board&quot;.

The NFB created its first television series, &quot;Window on Canada&quot; and &quot;On the Spot&quot;, with the CBC in 1953. However, the CBC opposed increasing the amount of NFB productions as they believed it was hurting CBC&#x27;s growth. The majority of the filmmakers in the NFB opposed moving into television. Sydney Newman and Gordon Burwash, who supported moving into television, were sent to the United States in 1948 to learn about TV production and NBC was given the right to air NBC productions in exchange. When Newman and Burwash returned they joined the CBC as the NFB was unable to move into television. Half of all productions by the NFB were made to air on television by 1955. In 1956, the CBC&#x27;s exclusion grew to them making &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot; with the expressed prohibition of NFB involvement and rejecting a show by the NFB based on &quot;Jake and the Kid&quot;.

===Trueman administration===
Irwin resigned as commissioner in May 1953, and later stated that he wanted to be more involved in film production, but his time was being taken up by administrative purposes. Albert Trueman, president of the University of New Brunswick and a member of the board of governors of the NFB and CBC, was selected by Winters to replace Irwin. A reshuffling of the cabinet had Walter Edward Harris become the new minister responsible for the NFB.

Since the foundation of the NFB its offices were divided across multiple locations in Ottawa and plans created during World War II to construct a single headquarters were not acted upon. Montreal was selected during Irwin&#x27;s administration due to it bilingualism and two Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television stations being created there. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent reached an agreement with Duplessis to allow the move. Donald Mulholland, the director of production, ended his support for the relocation to Montreal after Irwin&#x27;s resignation and argued against it. Trueman did not take a position and instead sent the information to Harris. St. Laurent was angered by this and asked Winters if Trueman was attempting to sabotage the relocation and Trueman told Winters that he was just giving Harris information about the situation. The Conservatives criticized the rising cost of the headquarters&#x27; construction and attempted to block it, but failed. The building was constructed from 1953 to 1956, at a cost of $5.25 million and served as the NFB&#x27;s headquarters until 2019.

In September 1954, Quebec censors demanded that the NFB pay a censorship fee of $20,500 per year and Trueman wanted to accept it in order to avoid controversy. However, a compromise was reached where the Quebec censors were given one print of each film and if they censored it then all versions would be also censored while the NFB would pay an annual fee between $2,500-3,000.

Pierre Juneau, who was sent to the United Kingdom by Irwin, was brought by Trueman to the NFB as an adviser and secretary in 1953. The creation of two assistant commissioners, one English and one French, with Juneau as the French assistant commissioner was proposed in November 1954, but was rejected by Jack Pickersgill, who replaced Harris, over the course of the next three years. André Laurendeau criticized the NFB for not creating a French-language side. In February 1957, Pickersgill allowed for Juneau to become the executive director and be in charge of financial administration and distribution. This was criticized by &quot;Montréal-Matin&quot;, &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Action catholique&quot;, and other French-language media and Juneau was criticized for demoting Roger Blais, who claimed it was for him criticizing the salary inequality between French and English speakers.

===Roberge administration===

Trueman accepted the position of commissioner with the promise that he would later be given a more prestigious position. He resigned during the French media criticism to become head of the Canada Council in 1957. He suggested Gérard Pelletier as his successor, but Guy Roberge, a former Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec who had written sections of the Massey report, was selected instead as the first French-Canadian commissioner. &quot;Le Devoir&quot; supported his selection and the French media ended its criticism of the NFB.

Ellen Fairclough, who became the minister responsible for the NFB in May 1958, was not interested with the organization and never saw a film created by the NFB. She declined to interfere in NFB matters despite criticism from Pickersgill, who believed that the minister was responsible for whatever went on at the NFB.

Upon his arrival at the NFB in 1953, Juneau saw the difficulties of communication between French and English speakers and supported creating separate English and French production units. Additional units for French-language film production were created in 1958. A French-language branch of the NFB that was independent of its English-language productions was formed on 1 January 1964, under the leadership of Pierre Juneau. One-third of the NFB&#x27;s budget was given to French-language productions.

&quot;Drylanders&quot;, the organization&#x27;s first English language feature-length fiction film, was released in 1963. In February 1964, the English-language production units were replaced by a talent pool system where producers had less power and directors had more power. The French-language production units were replaced in September 1968. The pool system lasted until its replacement by the studio system in 1971.

In 1962, Roberge proposed the creation of an organization to aid in film finance based on the National Film Finance Corporation and Centre national du cinéma et de l&#x27;image animée. The Interdepartmental Committee on the Possible Development of a Feature Film Industry in Canada, under Roberge&#x27;s leadership, was formed by the secretary of state. The committee submitted a report to the 19th Canadian Ministry for the creation of a loan fund to aid the development of the Canadian film industry. The proposal was approved in October 1965, and legislation, the &quot;Canadian Film Development Corporation Act&quot; of 1966-67, for its creation was introduced in June 1966, before being approved on 3 March 1967, establishing the Canadian Film Development Corporation.

Denys Arcand, Gilles Carle, Jacques Godbout, Gilles Groulx, and Clément Perron criticized the NFB and its productions in articles written for the &quot;Cité Libre&quot;. Juneau stated that the articles were a watershed moment in the NFB&#x27;s history. The men were reprimanded by Roberge. Many employees left the NFB following the reprimands including Michel Brault, Carle, Bernard Gosselin, Groulx, and Arthur Lamothe.

Juneau left the NFB in March 1966, and worked at the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission before becoming president of the CBC. Roberge created the positions of Assistant Government Film Commissioner, held by Grant McLean and Roland Ladouceur, Director of Production for English, held by Julian Biggs, and French, held by Marcel Martin, productions.

===Grant McLean administration===
Roberge resigned as commissioner on 1 April 1966, and declined to be involved with the selection of his successor. Grant was appointed as the acting commissioner by Judy LaMarsh. LaMarsh was slow on the selection of a permanent commissioner. Grierson supported Grant&#x27;s selection, but also put forward Newman. Hugo McPherson was selected to become commissioner in April 1967.

Maurice Lamontagne selected Gordon Sheppard, a film producer, to review Canada&#x27;s cultural policy and his report, Sheppard&#x27;s Special Report on the Cultural Policy and Activities of the Government of Canada, was critical of the NFB. It criticized the NFB&#x27;s preference for aesthetics and cultural films instead of informational films. The report called for a reduction in NFB productions and that it should eventually be entirely replaced by private production. The External Affairs Ministry criticized Sheppard stating that he was serving his own interests.

Prior budgets were created by having the commissioner meet with the secretary of state and representatives of the Treasury before being voted on in parliament, but it was changed to having members of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting, Films and Assistance to the Arts question the commissioner and Grant was the first commissioner to go through it.

There had been multiple attempts by the NFB to create a film school and the idea received support from the External Affairs Ministry and the Sheppard Report. However, the Treasury Board of Canada had rejected efforts to fund its creation. Grierson was invited by Grant to report on the possibility of creating a film school. Grierson supported creating a school, if the External Affairs Ministry recommended that production be reduced to free up creative teachers.

The CBC terminated its contracts with the NFB in 1966. The CBC and NFB&#x27;s relations soured due to the NFB&#x27;s demand that no commercials be played during their films and the NFB charging $10,000–$15,000 for 30 minute films while a commercial network had received it for $800. The CBC and NFB also co-produced &quot;The Ernie Game&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Caroline&quot; which went overbudget by $50,000 and $200,000 respectively.

===McPherson administration===
In 1967, the Treasury Board limited the NFB&#x27;s expenditures to $10 million and over the course of two years it was forced to pay for built-in higher salary costs and another salary increase due to an agreement with the union using existing funds. McPherson asked Pelletier to allow the NFB to spend over $500,000 more than its budget in order to avoiding firing 10% of the NFB&#x27;s employees, and later asked the Cabinet and Treasury for more funding, but was unsuccessful. McPherson later stated that after his failure with the Treasury he waited for the perfect time to resign.

In 1969, an agreement was reached between the CBC and NFB in which the CBC would be allowed to air commercials during NFB programs. Revenue from sponsored films declined from $2.2 million to $1.6 million by August 1969.

McPherson announced that 10% of the employees would be laid off by 1 January 1970. The employees formed a Crisis Committee under John Howe&#x27;s leadership and film production was stopped although a strike was not officially called. The committee suggested allowing government sponsors to choose between using the NFB or private companies, allowing outsiders to pay for NFB technical services, creating a unit system where 5-15 people would work together, and creating fees for distribution. McPherson supported the idea of distribution fees and thought that it was the only viable option for the NFB. Pelletier approved the NFB charging $3–12 per day for its films, but they were later removed as being in violation of anti-inflation guidelines. Fees would be instituted in 1988.

The Treasury had granted $1 million, $250,000 less than what was requested, in August to cover NFB&#x27;s salary increases, but McPherson was not informed as ministers hoped he would institute larger budget cuts. An additional $500,000 was free due to lowered production following the Crisis Committee&#x27;s formation. 63 layoffs were proposed and it was reduced by 17 due to union opposition.

The NFB&#x27;s computer animation program was suspended due to budget cuts although the NFB&#x27;s French Animated Studio, founded by René Jodoin in 1966, created Peter Foldes&#x27;s &quot;Metadata&quot; in 1971, and the &quot;Hunger&quot; in 1973. The NFB returned to computer animation in the 1980s. The first usage of videotape by the NFB occurred in 1967, when Claude Jutra and Robert Forget used it for research with children.

===Newman and Lamy administrations===
Newman, a former NFB director who spent the previous twelve years working on television shows in the United Kingdom, was selected to replaced McPherson as commissioner in 1970, and he selected André Lamy as his assistant commissioner. Faulkner opposed Newman and worked to have Newman not reappointed in July 1975, and he was replaced by Lamy.

Lamy criticized multiple French productions, such as &quot;Cotton Mill, Treadmill&quot;, &quot;24 heures ou plus&quot;, and &quot;Un pays sans bon sens!&quot;, as being too biased or separatist and were ordered to not be released in 1970. Robin Spry was initially denied the ability to film the events of the October Crisis by the English side of the NFB, but was given permission by the French side and the footage was turned into &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; with some elements censored by Newman. French films banned under Newman&#x27;s tenure were later released during Lamy&#x27;s tenure.

Kathleen Shannon attempted to have a division created to focus on films made by and about women due to the coming International Women&#x27;s Year. Newman and Robert Verrall supported Shannon&#x27;s attempt to get a $1.3 million budget for a women&#x27;s department, but it was rejected by the Treasury. Verrall gave Shannon permission to organize Studio D, the first publicly funded feminist film-production unit in the world, in 1974. However, there would be no French version of Studio D until the formation of Studio B in 1986. Studio D produced 125 films before its closure in 1996.

In 1970, Pelletier called for the creation of a Canadian Film Commission, made up of private and governmental interests, but it was opposed by the NFB, CBC, CFDC, and Library and Archives Canada. However, they did agree to form the Advisory Committee on Film as an ad hoc committee. Pelletier later proposed the Global Film Policy in which the NFB would regionalize and share sponsored productions with the private sector. Pelletier&#x27;s successor, Hugh Faulkner, replaced the Global Film Policy with the Capital Cost Allowance in which investors could get a 100% tax deduction.

Faulkner proposed to shift the responsibility of sponsored films to the Department of Supply and Services and only give the NFB 30% of the work. However, he was replaced by John Roberts during a shuffling of the cabinet in September 1976. Roberts believed that the CCA resolved the funding problems for the private industry, accepted Lamy&#x27;s recommendations for interactions with private companies, and declined to have the Department of Supply and Services manage sponsored films. However, 70% of the sponsored work were given to private companies by the end of Lamy&#x27;s tenure.

A $500,000 budget cut and 2.5% decrease in salaries over two years were implemented in 1975, after initially being threatened with a $1 million cut, as part of a government attempt to save $1 billion. The Public Service Staff Relations Board ruled in 1977 that 99% of the freelance workers at the NFB were employees and the board of governors later recommended the firing of sixty-five people. Federal budget cuts caused Roberts to plan for the NFB&#x27;s budget to decrease by 10% between 1979 and 1981.

===Domville administration===
Lamy left the NFB and the board of Governors selected James de Beaujeu Domville, who served as deputy film commissioner for seven years, after four months. Domville selected François N. Macerola, the director of French production, as his deputy commissioner. Domville offered to continue on as commissioner for another term after 1984, and his demands were accepted by the board of governors, but chose to leave after Francis Fox declined to accept or deny his renewal.

After the 1979 election Prime Minister Joe Clark changed the ministry responsible for the NFB from the Secretary of State, which managed it since 1963, to the Minister of Communications, then led by David MacDonald. MacDonald supported giving 80% of the sponsored work to private companies and that the NFB only make films that the private companies could not. Domville offered a three-year phase out of NFB doing sponsored work during a meeting with representatives of the Canadian Film and Television Association and Association des Producteurrs de Films du Quebec in 1979. He stated that &quot;sponsored film had become a monkey on the back of English production&quot;.

Encyclopædia Britannica reportedly offered to buy the NFB for $100 million () in 1979.

During Derek Lamb&#x27;s leadership of the English language animation studio produced multiple critical acclaimed works, including the Academy Award-winning &quot;Every Child&quot;. Lamb resigned in 1982, and was replaced by Doug McDonald, whose tenure was criticized by animators such as David Fine&#x27;s statement that &quot;Norman McLaren would be turning in his grave if he knew how the place was being run&quot;.

Fox organized the Applebaum-Hébert Committee under the leadership of Louis Applebaum and Jacques Hébert in 1981. It was the first review of cultural institutions and policies since the Massey Commission. The committee released its report on 15 November 1980, in which it called for the elimination of the government&#x27;s role in producing and distributing cultural products and to instead give it to the private industry. They believed that the private industry could create an export market to compete with the United States. Fox later decided to allow the NFB continue producing content, but ended their involvement in sponsored content, along with their executive production of sponsored work given to private companies.

===Macerola administration===
Domville suggested Patrick Watson as his successor and the board of governors accepted him, but Fox declined as he wanted his Film and Video Policy to be considered by the cabinet first. Macerola became the acting commissioner of the NFB. Watson was instead appointed to the board of governors and became president of the CBC in 1989. Macerola left the NFB six months before the expiration of his term in order to join Lavalin in December 1988, and Joan Pennefather became the acting commissioner.

Macerola oversaw a reorganization of the NFB which decreased its distribution offices from twenty-six to twelve and international offices to three. The NFB attempted to create a television channel in the 1980s. Marcel Masse gave them permission to attempt to create Young Canada Television (Tèlè-Jeunesse Canada), but the channel failed in June 1987, as the Department of Communications withdrew its financial support leading to the banks to also withdraw their support. Macerola&#x27;s Five-Year Operational Plan saw the permanent staff of the NFB fall from 1,085 in 1982, to 728 in 1989, and the amount of work given to freelancers by 1986 was 67% for English productions and 57% for French productions.

The NFB was given a honorary Oscar at the 61st Academy Awards in honour of its fiftieth anniversary.

===Pennefather administration===
In 1990, Wil Champbell and Roger Trottier asked Graydon McCrea about holding a meeting about the participation of First Nations people in the film industry. The NFB aided in the organization of the Aboriginal Film and Video Symposium in April 1991. The Aboriginal Film and Video Art Alliance (AFVAA) was formed as a result of this meeting. Studio One, meant for First Nations filmmakers, was formed on 9 June 1991, with a $250,000 budget and under McCrea&#x27;s supervision. The studio&#x27;s first film, &quot;Tlaxwes Wa: Strength of the River&quot;, was released in 1995. However, funding for the studio was ended on 31 March 1996.

==Documentary==
===Cinéma vérité and Direct Cinema===
In the post-war era, the NFB became a pioneer in new developments in documentary film. The NFB played a key role in both the cinéma vérité and direct cinema movements, working on technical innovations to make its 16 mm synchronized sound equipment more light-weight and portable—most notably the &quot;Sprocketape&quot; portable sound recorder invented for the film board by Ches Beachell in 1955. Influenced by the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, the NFB&#x27;s Studio B production unit experimented with cinema verite in its 1958 &quot;Candid Eye&quot; series. &quot;Candid Eye&quot; along with such NFB French-language films as &quot;Les Raquetteurs&quot; (1958) have been credited as helping to inspire the cinéma vérité documentary movement. Other key cinéma vérité films during this period included &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; (1961) and &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen&quot; (1965).

===&quot;Challenge for Change&quot;/&quot;Societé Nouvelle&quot;===

Running from 1967 to 1980, &quot;Challenge for Change&quot; and its French-language equivalent &quot;Societé Nouvelle&quot; became a global model for the use of film and portable video technology to create community-based participatory documentary films to promote dialogue on local issues and promote social change. Over two hundred such films were produced, including 27 films about Fogo Island, Newfoundland, directed by Colin Low and early NFB efforts in Indigenous filmmaking, such as Willie Dunn&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Crowfoot&quot; (1968).

====Indian Film Crew====
The Indian Film Crew was an early effort in First Nations filmmaking at the NFB, through its Challenge for Change program, initially proposed by the associate director of the CYC, Jerry Gambill, according to Noel Starblanket. George Stoney was brought in as the first executive producer of Challenge for Change. It was jointly sponsored by the Company of Young Canadians and the Department of Indian Affairs. Barbara Wilson, Tom O’Connor, Noel Starblanket, Roy Daniels, Morris Isaac, Willie Dunn, and Mike Kanentakeron Mitchell were on Canada’s first all-Indigenous production unit, making groundbreaking work that helped galvanize Indigenous movements across the continent.

===Giant-screen cinema===
NFB documentarians played a key role in the development of the IMAX film format, following the NFB multi-screen experience &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;, created for Expo 67 in Montreal. The film was the centrepiece of a $4.5 million pavilion, which attracted over 1.3 million visitors in 1967, and was co-directed by Roman Kroitor, Colin Low and Hugh O&#x27;Connor, and produced by Tom Daly and Kroitor. After Expo, Kroitor left the NFB to co-found what would become known as IMAX Corporation, with Graeme Ferguson and Robert Kerr. The NFB continued to be involved with IMAX breakthroughs at subsequent world&#x27;s fairs, with NFB director Donald Brittain directing the first-ever IMAX film &quot;Tiger Child&quot; for Expo 70 in Osaka, and with the NFB producing the first full-colour IMAX-3D film &quot;Transitions&quot; for Expo 86 in Vancouver and the first 48 fps IMAX HD film &quot;Momentum&quot; for Seville Expo &#x27;92.

===Alternative drama===
In the 1980s, the National Film Board also produced a number of &quot;alternative drama&quot; films, which combined documentary and narrative fiction filmmaking techniques. Generally starring non-professional actors, these films used a documentary format to present a fictionalized story and were generally scripted by the filmmakers and the cast through a process of improvisation, and are thus classified as docufiction.

The alternative drama films were &quot;The Masculine Mystique&quot; (1984), &quot;90 Days&quot; (1985), &quot;Sitting in Limbo&quot; (1986), &quot;The Last Straw&quot; (1987), &quot;Train of Dreams&quot; (1987), &quot;Welcome to Canada&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Company of Strangers&quot; (1990).

==Animation==
When Norman McLaren joined the organization in 1941, the NFB began production of animation. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized experimental filmmaker. The NFB&#x27;s French-language animation unit was founded in 1966 by René Jodoin.

===Drawn-on-film animation===
When McLaren joined the NFB, his first film at the film board was the drawn-on-film short, &quot;Mail Early&quot;. He would go on to refine his technique make a series of hand-drawn films at the NFB during and after the Second World War, most notably &quot;Boogie-Doodle&quot; (1940), &quot;Hen Hop&quot; (1942), &quot;Begone Dull Care&quot; (1949) and &quot;Blinkity Blank&quot; (1955).

===Pinscreen animation===
The NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as pinscreen animation, and as of June 2012, the NFB is reported to have the only working animation pinscreen in the world.

===Stop-motion animation===
McLaren&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Neighbours&quot; popularized the form of character movement referred to as pixilation, a variant of stop motion. The term pixilation itself was created by NFB animator Grant Munro in an experimental film of the same name. In 2015, the NFB&#x27;s animation studios were credited as helping to lead a revival in stop-motion animation in Canada, building on the tradition of NFB animators such as McLaren and Co Hoedeman.

===Computer animation===
The NFB was a pioneer in computer animation, releasing one of the first CGI films, the Oscar-nominated &quot;Hunger&quot;, in 1974, then forming its Centre d&#x27;animatique in 1980 to develop new CGI technologies. Staff at the Centre d&#x27;animatique included Daniel Langlois, who left in 1986 to form Softimage.

The NFB was licensed by IMAX Corporation to develop new artistic applications using its SANDDE system for hand-drawn stereoscopic computer animation, with the NFB producing a number of films including &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (2003) and &quot;Subconscious Password&quot; (2013).

===Traditional animation===
Traditional animators included Richard Condie, John Weldon, Alison Snowden, Janet Perlman, Cordell Barker, Brad Caslor, Michael Mills, Paul Driessen among others (some draw on paper rather than cels).

===Sand animation===
Caroline Leaf used this technique on films such as &quot;The Metamorphosis Of Mr. Samsa&quot; and &quot;The Owl Who Married A Goose&quot;. &quot;The Sand Castle&quot; was the first (and so far only) sand animation to win an Oscar.

===Paint on glass animation===
Wendy Tilby animated &quot;Strings&quot; using paint (gouache mixed with glycerine) on glass. This ‘under the camera’ technique was invented and perfected by Caroline Leaf in her film &quot;The Street&quot;.

==Interactive==
===Works===
As of March 2013, the NFB devotes one quarter of its production budget to interactive media, including web documentaries. The NFB is a pioneer in interactive web documentaries, helping to position Canada as a major player in digital storytelling, according to transmedia creator Anita Ondine Smith, as well as Shari Frilot, programmer for Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s New Frontier program for digital media.

&quot;Welcome to Pine Point&quot; received two Webby Awards while &quot;Out My Window&quot;, an interactive project from the NFB&#x27;s &quot;Highrise&quot; project, won the IDFA DocLab Award for Digital Storytelling and an International Digital Emmy Award.

Rob McLaughlin is the executive producer responsible for NFB English-language digital content and strategy, based in the Woodward&#x27;s Building in Vancouver. Jeremy Mendes is an interactive artist producing English-language interactive works for the NFB, whose projects include a collaboration with Leanne Allison (&quot;Being Caribou&quot;, &quot;Finding Farley&quot;) on the webdoc &quot;Bear 71&quot;.

====Virtual reality====
The NFB is also recognized as a leader in virtual reality, with works such as the Webby Award-winning &quot;The Unknown Photographer&quot;, &quot;Way to Go&quot; and &quot;Cardboard Crash&quot;.

===Platforms===
In January 2009, the NFB launched its online Screening Room, NFB.ca, offering Canadian and international web users the ability to stream hundreds of NFB films for free as well as embed links in blogs and social sites. By mid-2013, the NFB&#x27;s digital platforms had received approximately 41 million views.

In October 2009, the NFB launched an iPhone application that was downloaded more than 170,000 times and led to more than 500,000 film views in the first four months. In January 2010, the NFB added high-definition and 3D films to the over 1400 productions available for viewing online. The NFB introduced a free iPad application in July 2010, followed by its first app for the Android platform in March 2011. When the BlackBerry PlayBook launched on April 19, 2011, it included a pre-loaded app offering access to 1,500 NFB titles. In January 2013, it was announced that the NFB film app would be available for the BlackBerry 10, via the BlackBerry World app store.

In September 2011, the NFB and the Montreal French-language daily &quot;Le Devoir&quot; announced that they would jointly host three interactive essays on their websites, ONF.ca and ledevoir.com. The NFB is a partner with China&#x27;s ifeng.com on NFB Zone, the first Canadian-branded web channel in China, with 130 NFB animated shorts and documentary films available on the company&#x27;s digital platforms. NFB documentaries are also available on Netflix Canada.

In April 2013, the NFB announced that it was &quot;seeking commercial partners to establish a subscription service for Internet television and mobile platforms next year. The service would be available internationally and would feature documentaries from around the world as well as the NFB’s own catalogue.&quot; As of April 2015, NFB.ca offered VOD films from partners Excentris and First Weekend Club along with NFB productions, with over 450 English and French VOD titles scheduled to be added in 2015.

==Indigenous production==
On June 20, 2017, the NFB announced a three-year plan entitled &quot;Redefining the NFB&#x27;s Relationship with Indigenous Peoples&quot; that commits the organization to hiring more Indigenous staff, designating 15% of its production spending for Indigenous works and offering cross-cultural training to all employees. The plan also sees the NFB building on its relationships with Canadian schools and organizations to create more educational materials about Indigenous peoples in Canada.

One of the most notable filmmakers in the history of the NFB is Alanis Obomsawin, an Abenaki director who will be completing her 50th film with the NFB in 2017.

=== Programs ===
One of the earliest programs were the Indian Film Crews (1968–1970, 1971–1973) under the Challenge for Change program, also mentioned above.

====Inuit film and animation====
In November 2011, the NFB and partners including the Inuit Relations Secretariat and the Government of Nunavut introduced a DVD and online collection entitled &quot;&quot;, makes over 100 NFB films by and about Inuit available in Inuktitut and other Inuit languages, as well as English and French.

In November 2006, the National Film Board of Canada and the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation announced the start of the Nunavut Animation Lab, offering animation training to Nunavut artists. Films from the Nunavut Animation Lab include Alethea Arnaquq-Baril&#x27;s 2010 digital animation short &quot;Lumaajuuq&quot;, winner of the Best Aboriginal Award at the Golden Sheaf Awards and named Best Canadian Short Drama at the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival.

====First Stories and Second Stories====
In 2005, the NFB introduced its &quot;First Stories&quot; program for emerging Indigenous directors from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Twelve five-minute films were produced through the program, with four from each province. First Stories was followed by &quot;Second Stories,&quot; in which three filmmakers from the previous program—Gerald Auger, Tessa Desnomie and Lorne Olson—were invited back to create 20 minute films.&lt;

==== Wapikoni Mobile ====
The NFB was a founding partner in Wapikoni Mobile, a mobile film and media production unit for emerging First Nations filmmakers in Quebec.

==Women&#x27;s production==
The NFB has been a leader in films by women, with the world&#x27;s first publicly funded women&#x27;s film&#x27;s studio, Studio D, followed subsequently by its French-language equivalent, Studio des femmes. Beginning on March 8, 2016, International Women&#x27;s Day, the NFB began introducing a series of gender parity initiatives.

===Studio D===

In 1974, in conjunction with International Women&#x27;s Year, the NFB created Studio D on the recommendation of long-time employee Kathleen Shannon. Shannon was designated as Executive Director of the new studio—the first government-funded film studio dedicated to women filmmakers in the world—which became one of the NFB&#x27;s most celebrated filmmaking units, winning awards and breaking distribution records.

Notable films produced by the studio include three Academy Award-winning documentaries &quot;I&#x27;ll Find a Way&quot; (1977), &quot;If You Love This Planet&quot; (1982) and &quot;Flamenco at 5:15&quot; (1983), as well as &quot;Not a Love Story&quot; (1982) and &quot;Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives&quot; (1992). Studio D was shut down in 1996, amidst a sweeping set of federal government budget cuts, which impacted the NFB as a whole.

As of March 8, 2016, researchers and librarians at the University of Calgary announced an archival project to preserve records of Studio D.

===Gender parity initiatives===
On March 8, 2016, NFB head Claude Joli-Coeur announced a new gender-parity initiative, with the NFB committing that half of all its production spending will be earmarked for films directed by women. The following year, the NFB announced that it also plans to achieve gender balance by 2020 in such creative positions as editing, scriptwriting, musical composition, cinematography and artistic direction. As of 2017, 53% of its producers and executive producers are women, as well as half of its administrative council.

While it is claiming success, directing credits and budget shares have barely changed. In 2016–2017, 44 per cent of NFB productions were directed by women (compared to 51 per cent directed by men and five per cent by mixed teams). Budget-wise, 43 per cent of production funds were given to projects led by women (vs. 40 per cent to projects directed by men and 15 per cent to ones overseen by mixed teams). In 2018–2019, 48% of NFB works were directed by women (38% by men and 14% by mixed teams), and 44% of the NFB production budget was allocated to works created by women (41% for works by men and 15% for works by mixed teams). Production personnel are between 10 and 25%.

==Training==
NFB training programs include:

===Animation===
Hothouse, a program for emerging animators that marked its tenth anniversary in 2015. Notable Hothouse alumni include Academy Award nominee Patrick Doyon, part of its 2006 edition. Cinéaste recherché(e) is a similar program for French-language emerging animators. Past graduates include Michèle Cournoyer, who took part in the program&#x27;s 9th edition in 1989.

===Theatrical documentaries===
A collaboration with the Canadian Film Centre on a theatrical documentary development program. First launched in January 2009, the program has led to the production of Sarah Polley’s &quot;Stories We Tell&quot;, Yung Chang‘s &quot;The Fruit Hunters&quot; and Su Rynard’s &quot;The Messenger&quot;. In May 2015, the CFC and NFB announced a new version of the program entitled the NFB/CFC Creative Doc Lab.

===Former studios and departments===

====Still Photography Division====
Upon its merger with the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau in 1941, the NFB&#x27;s mandate expanded to include motion as well as still pictures, resulting in the creation of the Still Photography Division of the NFB.
From 1941 to 1984, the division commissioned freelance photographers to document every aspect of life in Canada. These images were widely distributed through publication in various media.

In 1985, this division officially became the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography.

The division&#x27;s work is the subject of a 2013 book by Carleton University art professor Carol Payne entitled &quot;The Official Picture: The National Film Board of Canada’s Still Photography Division and the Image of Canada, 1941-1971&quot;, published by the McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press.

====Facilities in Montreal and Toronto====
As part of the 2012 budget cuts, the NFB announced that it was forced to close its Toronto Mediatheque and Montreal CineRobotheque public facilities. They ceased to operate as of September 1, 2012.

====Others====

==Controversy==
In addition to &quot;Neighbours&quot;, other NFB productions have been the source of controversy, including two NFB productions broadcast on CBC Television that criticized the role of Canadians in wartime led to questions in the Senate of Canada.

In the early 1970s, two Quebec political documentaries, Arcand&#x27;s &quot;On est au coton&quot; and Gilles Groulx&#x27;s &quot;24 heures ou plus&quot;, were initially withheld from release by the NFB due to controversial content.
&quot;The Kid Who Couldn&#x27;t Miss&quot; (1982) cast doubt on the accomplishments of Canadian World War I flying ace Billy Bishop, sparking widespread outrage, including complaints in the Senate subcommittee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs.

A decade later, &quot;The Valour and the Horror&quot; outraged some when it suggested that there was incompetence on the part of Canadian military command, and that Canadian soldiers had committed unprosecuted war crimes against German soldiers. The series became the subject of an inquiry by the Senate.

Other controversial productions included the 1981 film &quot;Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography&quot;, a 1981 Studio D documentary critiquing pornography that was itself banned in the province of Ontario on the basis of pornographic content. Released the following year, &quot;If You Love This Planet&quot;, winner of the Academy Award for best documentary short subject, was labelled foreign propaganda under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 in the United States.

==NFB on TV==
The NFB is a minority owner of the Canadian digital television channel Documentary Channel. The NFB-branded series &quot;Retrovision&quot; aired on VisionTV along with the French-language &quot;Carnets ONF&quot; series on APTN. Moreover, in 1997, the American cable channel Cartoon Network created a weekly 30-minute show called &quot;O Canada&quot;, which specifically showcased a compilation of NFB-produced works; the segment was later discontinued in favour of Adult Swim.

==Logo==

The Board&#x27;s logo consists of a standing stylized figure (originally green) with its arms wide upward (designed similarly to the CBS logo). The arms are met by an arch that mirrors them. The round head in between then resembles a pupil, making the entire symbol appear to be an eye with legs. Launched in 1968, the logo symbolized a vision of humanity and was called &quot;Man Seeing / L&#x27;homme qui voit&quot;. It was designed by Georges Beaupré. It was updated in 2003 by the firm of Paprika Communications.

==In popular media==
*The Scottish music act Boards of Canada takes its name from the NFB.
*George Lucas, who had attributed the origins of &quot;the Force&quot; to a 1963 abstract NFB film by Arthur Lipsett entitled &quot;21-87&quot;, went on to use the number 2187 as the cell number where Princess Leia was being detained in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He has also cited Norman McLaren as an influence.
*Two NFB shorts, the Oscar-nominated &quot;Christmas Cracker&quot; and &quot;David and Hazel: A Study in Communication&quot;, were each spoofed by RiffTrax.
*&quot;The Big Snit&quot; inspired a Scrabble scene in the second episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ first season, &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;.

<doc id="156733" wikidata="Q339291" url="?curid=156733" title="Wuchang Uprising">
<text>The Wuchang Uprising was an armed rebellion against the ruling Qing dynasty that took place in Wuchang (now Wuchang District of Wuhan) in the Chinese province of Hubei on 10 October 1911, beginning the Xinhai Revolution that successfully overthrew China&#x27;s last imperial dynasty. It was led by elements of the New Army, influenced by revolutionary ideas from Tongmenghui. The uprising and the eventual revolution directly led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty with almost three centuries of imperial rule, and the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC), which commemorates the anniversary of the uprising&#x27;s outbreak on 10 October as the National Day of the Republic of China.

The uprising originated from popular unrest about a railway crisis, and the planning process took advantage of the situation. On 10 October 1911, the New Army stationed in Wuchang launched an assault on the residence of the Viceroy of Huguang. The viceroy Ruicheng quickly fled from the residence, and the revolutionaries soon took control of the entire city.

== Background ==
=== Tongmenghui ===

In 1895, China was decisively defeated by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War. Intellectuals in China were divided into several factions. Constitutional monarchist reformers led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao took control initially, and orchestrated the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in the Qing government. The reforms failed due to the Wuxu Coup by Empress Dowager Cixi. Disillusioned with the monarchy and the Qing government, many revolutionary groups began emerging across the country. In 1905, revolutionary leaders such as Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren met in Tokyo to discuss a merger between different revolutionary groups. A new group known as Tongmenghui was formed after this meeting.

=== Railway Protection Movement ===
After the Boxer Rebellion, many Western powers saw railway investments as part of the consolidation in their spheres of influence over China. Railway constructions took place across Shandong, Yangtze Valley, Kunming and Manchuria. Provincial governments, with permission from the Qing court, also began to construct their own railways. The Canton-Hankou Railway and Sichuan-Hankou Railway were under the oversight of Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei and Sichuan. Faced with ongoing financial struggles, partly due to ongoing indemnity payments from the Boxer Protocol, the Qing court turned to Sheng Xuanhuai in 1910, a &quot;classic bureaucratic capitalist&quot;, and adhered to his policy of securing foreign loans through the nationalization of all railway lines. This policy was met with stiff resistance, particularly in Sichuan, and the resistance quickly turned into a movement known as the &quot;Sichuan Railway Protection Movement&quot;. In response, the Qing court suppressed the unrest by force, contributing to the declining popularity of its government. By August 11 there were massive strikes and rallies in Chengdu. On 7 September the Viceroy of Sichuan, Zhao Erfeng, was asked to &quot;intervene vigorously&quot;, and he ordered the arrest of key leaders in the Railway Protection League, then ordered troops to open fire on the protesters. Subsequent fighting around Chengdu prompted the diversion of troops to Sichuan from central China, which later became an important factor in the Wuchang Uprising&#x27;s success.

Meanwhile, inaction toward nationalization of railway lines in both Hunan and Hubei were criticized by the local press. Confidence in the Qing government among the populace continued to deteriorate in response to the escalation of the railway crisis.

== Prelude ==
There were two revolutionary groups in the Wuhan area, the Literary Society () and the Progressive Association (). These groups, led by Jiang Yiwu () and Sun Wu () respectively, worked closely together as commander and chief of staff of the revolutionary efforts in Wuhan. Beginning in September, 1911, these two groups began negotiating with the Tongmenghui () for possible collaboration in the next uprising. The date was originally set for 6 October, on the Mid-Autumn festival. The date was later postponed, due to inadequate preparations. On 9 October, while Sun Wu was supervising the making of explosive devices in the Russian concession in Hankou, one of the devices exploded unexpectedly, inflicting serious injuries on Sun. When he was hospitalized, the hospital staff discovered his identity and alerted the Qing authorities.

== New Army mutiny ==
With their identities revealed, the revolutionaries in the New Army stationed in Wuchang were facing imminent arrest by the Qing authorities. The decision was made by Jiang Yiwu of the Literary Society to immediately launch the uprising, but the plot was leaked to the Viceroy of Huguang, and he ordered a crackdown of the revolutionaries, arresting and executing several prominent members.

On the evening of 10 October, Wu Zhaolin () as provisional commander led the revolutionary elements of the New Army staged a mutiny against the Qing garrison in Huguang, capturing the residence of the Viceroy in the process along with securing strategic points in the city after intense fighting. As the Viceroy escaped, the Qing garrison fell into disarray. Between the night of 10 October and noon of 11th, &quot;more than 500 Manchu soldiers were killed&quot; with &quot;over 300 captured&quot;.

== Establishment of Hubei military government ==

On 11 October, the mutineers established a military government representing the Hubei province, and persuaded one of the high-ranking officers in the New Army, Li Yuanhong, to be the temporary leader. Li was initially resistant to the idea, but he was eventually convinced by the mutineers after they approached him. The newly established military government were able to confirm that foreign powers would not intervene in the uprising, and they went on to raise the &quot;iron blood 18-star flag&quot; while signaling for the other provinces to follow their suit. On 12 October, the revolutionaries marched toward the rest of the province, capturing Hankou and Hanyang in the process.

== Battle of Yangxia ==

In response to the uprising, the Qing government called for the help of Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang Army to march toward Wuchang. For the revolutionaries, Huang Xing would arrive at Wuhan in early November to take over the command. Positions of revolutionary forces in Wuhan were subsequently attacked by the Beiyang Army, and the imperial troops were soon able to recapture Hankou on 1 November and Hanyang on 27 November. The offensive was halted after the capture of these two positions, as Yuan Shikai began to secretly negotiate with the revolutionaries.

== Aftermath ==

The Wuchang Uprising took many revolutionary leaders by surprise; Huang Xing and Song Jiaoren were unable to reach Wuchang in time. Sun Yat-sen was traveling in the United States speaking to overseas Chinese to appeal for financial support when the uprising took place. Although Sun received a telegram from Huang Xing, he was unable to decipher it, and found out about the uprising the next morning in the newspaper. After the successful uprising in Wuchang, the revolutionaries sent telegraphs to other provinces and asked them to follow in their suit, upon which eighteen provinces in Southern and Central China agreed to secede from the Qing government by the end of December, 1911.

As part of the resolution of the uprising, the Qing government agreed to a general amnesty for political prisoners. Wang Jingwei was among those released.

In the same month, Sun returned to China to participate in the provisional presidential election and was elected. Representatives from the seceding provinces met on 1 January 1912, and declared the founding of the Chinese Republic as Sun was sworn in as the first president. The new republic then negotiated with Yuan Shikai to pressure the Qing government to surrender, offering the presidency in the process. On 12 February 1912, Empress Dowager Longyu, on behalf of Aisin Gioro Puyi, the Xuantong emperor, announced the abdication of the Qing throne, marking the end of the dynasty.

<text>The Open Publication License (OPL) was published by the Open Content Project in 1999 as a public copyright license for documents. It superseded the Open Content License, which was published by the Open Content Project in 1998. Starting around 2002–2003, it began to be superseded, in turn, by the Creative Commons licenses.

== History ==
In 1998, the Open Content Project published a licence called the Open Content License, which was among the first (perhaps &quot;the&quot; first) public copyright licenses intended for &quot;content&quot; (i.e. documents) rather than for &quot;software&quot;. The following year, it published the Open Publication License, which was intended to be an improvement upon the Open Content License.

The two licenses differ substantially: the Open Publication License is not a share-alike license while the Open Content License is; and the Open Publication License can optionally restrict the distribution of derivative works or restrict the commercial distribution of paper copies of the work or derivatives of the work, whereas the Open Content License forbids copying for profit altogether.

In June 2003, David A. Wiley, the founder of the Open Content Project, indicated that the Creative Commons licenses, which were developed in collaboration with lawyers, would be &quot;more likely to stand up in court&quot; than the Open Content Project licenses, which were not. He also announced that for this reason, he was joining Creative Commons and shutting down the Open Content Project, and that users thinking of using an Open Content Project license would be &quot;far better off using a Creative Commons license&quot;.

==Nomenclature==
Confusingly, the Open Content License gives its abbreviation as &quot;OPL&quot; rather than &quot;OCL&quot;, and that license is sometimes referred to by the former initialism. (&quot;OPL&quot;, as used by the Open Content Project in 1998, stood for OpenContent Principles and License.) Nevertheless, the license&#x27;s author has subsequently referred to that license as the &quot;OCL&quot;, and to the Open Publication License as the &quot;OPL&quot;. This ambiguity about the initialism &quot;OPL&quot; risks confusion, and the only sure way to know which of the two licenses is being referred to, in a given context, is to look for the full name.

== Reception ==
According to the Free Software Foundation, the Open Publication License &quot;can be used as a free documentation license&quot; and is &quot;a copyleft free documentation license provided the copyright holder does not exercise any of the &#x27;LICENSE OPTIONS&#x27; listed in Section VI of the license.&quot; It is not, however, compatible with the GNU FDL.

In March 2004, the OPL v1.0 was determined by the Debian legal team to be incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

In October 2004, an analysis of the Open Public License was published by Andrew M. St. Laurent, the author of &quot;Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing&quot;.

== Adoption ==
Eric S. Raymond&#x27;s book &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; (1999) was published under the Open Publication License. Bruce Perens used the license for the Bruce Perens&#x27; Open Source Series of books. The Linux Gazette used the Open Publication License. Additionally, the Fedora project used the license for their documentation until approximately 2009-2010 when the project switched to a CC BY-SA license.

<doc id="156739" wikidata="Q217584" url="?curid=156739" title="Hinny">
<text>A hinny is a domestic equine hybrid, the offspring of a male horse (a stallion) and a female donkey (a jenny). It is the reciprocal cross to the more common mule, which is the product of a male donkey (a jack) and a female horse (a mare). The hinny is distinct from the mule both in physiology and temperament as a consequence of genomic imprinting and is also less common.

== Description ==

The hinny is the offspring of a stallion and a jenny or female donkey, and is thus the reciprocal cross to the more common mule foaled by a jack (male donkey) out of a mare. Like the mule, the hinny displays hybrid vigour (heterosis).

In general terms, in both these hybrids the foreparts and head of the animal are similar to those of the sire, while the hindparts and tail are more similar to those of the dam. A hinny is generally smaller than a mule, with shorter ears and a lighter head; the tail is tasselled like that of its donkey mother.

The distinct phenotypes of the hinny and the mule are partly attributable to genomic imprinting – an element of epigenetic inheritance. Hinnies and mules differ in temperament despite sharing nuclear genomes; this too is believed to be attributable to the action of imprinted genes.

== Fertility, sterility and rarity ==

According to most reports, hinnies are sterile and are not capable of reproduction. The male hinny can mate, but has testicles that will only produce malformed spermatozoa. The dam of a foal carried to term in Henan Province of China in 1981 is variously reported to have been a mule or a hinny. Many supposed examples of the jumart, a supposed hybrid between a horse and a cow in European folklore, were found to be hinnies.

<text>Pretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall, from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features Héctor Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles. The film&#x27;s story centers on Hollywood escort Vivian Ward and wealthy corporate raider Edward Lewis. Vivian is hired to be Edward&#x27;s escort for several business and social functions, and their relationship develops during her week-long stay with him. The film&#x27;s title &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; is based on the 1964 song &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; by Roy Orbison. The original screenplay was titled &quot;3,000,&quot; and was written by then-struggling screenwriter J. F. Lawton.

Originally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and sex work in Los Angeles, the film was re-conceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release, but widespread praise was directed towards Roberts&#x27; performance and her chemistry with Gere. It saw the highest number of ticket sales in the US ever for a romantic comedy, with Box Office Mojo listing it as the number-one romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets. The film grossed million worldwide and at the time of its release, was the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide, behind only &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; ( million at the time), &quot;Star Wars&quot; ($530 million at the time), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; ( million at the time), and &quot;Jaws&quot; ($470 million at the time). It was also the highest grossing R-rated film released by Walt Disney Studios, holding the record for 34 years until Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; surpassed it in 2024.

&quot;Pretty Woman&quot; catapulted Roberts to superstardom, earning her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, in addition to her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The film also received nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

== Plot ==

One night while leaving a business party in the Hollywood Hills, corporate raider Edward Lewis takes his lawyer Philip&#x27;s Lotus Esprit and finds himself in the red-light district on Hollywood Boulevard, where he meets call girl Vivian Ward. Lost and struggling to operate the stick-shift, Edward accepts Vivian&#x27;s offer to drive him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Impulsively, he hires her for the whole night and, despite initial awkwardness, finds her charming, and they have sex in his penthouse suite. The following day, Edward asks Vivian to stay for the week, as he must attend a series of business events while attempting to acquire Jim Morse&#x27;s shipbuilding company. After negotiating, Edward and Vivian agree on $3,000. He also gives her money to buy appropriate clothes.

However, when Vivian tries to shop on Rodeo Drive, snobbish and rude saleswomen turn her away. She asks hotel manager Barney for assistance. He gets upscale store saleslady Bridget, who is very kind, to find her a cocktail dress for that evening&#x27;s business dinner. Later, she gets Barney to teach her table etiquette. Edward is astounded by Vivian’s transformation. At dinner, he introduces Vivian to Morse and his grandson David, who is to take over the company. The Morses are charmed by her, but ultimately the dinner does not go well, as they are unhappy with Edward&#x27;s plan to dismantle their company. Edward opens up to the transformed Vivian. He reveals details about his personal and business life, including his estranged relationship with his late father.

Edward takes Vivian along as his date to a polo match. When Philip sees Vivian talking to David Morse, he tells Edward his suspicions that she is a corporate spy. Edward dismisses Philip&#x27;s concerns by explaining their arrangement. With the knowledge of Vivian&#x27;s true background, the married Philip talks to her alone and crudely propositions her for her services. Back in Edward&#x27;s suite, Vivian gets upset with Edward for exposing her in that way. He apologizes, admitting that he was jealous of Vivian talking to David and acknowledging that her directness is having a positive effect on him. Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see &quot;La traviata&quot; at the San Francisco Opera, a story about a prostitute who falls in love with a wealthy man. She is moved, and she breaks her &quot;no kissing&quot; rule before having sex with him. Believing Edward has fallen asleep, Vivian says she loves him.

As the week is almost finished, Edward offers to get Vivian a condominium and an allowance, promising to visit her regularly. However, Vivian is offended, feeling he is now treating her like a prostitute. She shares her childhood fantasy of being rescued by a knight on a white steed. Edward meets with Morse but, influenced by Vivian, chooses to work with him to save his company instead of dismantling it. Meanwhile Philip, furious that Edward&#x27;s new direction has cost him a fortune, goes to the Beverly Wilshire to confront him. However, he finds Vivian. Blaming her for Edward&#x27;s changes and angry at his business decision, Philip hits her and attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, pulls Philip off of Vivian, punches him and fires him. After completing his business in Los Angeles, Edward asks Vivian to stay with him for one more night, but only if she wants to, not because he is paying her. She gently refuses and leaves after telling him she thinks he has &quot;lots of special gifts.&quot;

Vivian returns to her apartment hotel to pack for her move to San Francisco to get a new job and a high school diploma. She gives her roommate, fellow prostitute Kit De Luca, some money and tells her she has &quot;a lot of potential.&quot; Kit leaves sex work and enrolls in beauty classes. Vivian then waits in her apartment for the bus. Vivian&#x27;s rejection prompts Edward to re-evaluate his life, so he reroutes the chauffeur to her apartment instead of the airport. He climbs out of the white limousine&#x27;s sunroof and ascends the fire escape to &#x27;rescue&#x27; Vivian, just like the knight in her childhood fantasy. When he asks her what happens after the knight rescues her, she responds &quot;She rescues him right back&quot;, and kisses him.

== Production ==

=== Development === 
The film was initially conceived as a dark drama about prostitution in Los Angeles in the 1980s. The relationship between Vivian and Edward also originally included Vivian being addicted to drugs; part of the deal was that she had to stay off cocaine for a week. Edward eventually throws her out of his car and drives off. The original script by J.F.Lawton, called &quot;3000&quot;, ended with Vivian and her prostitute friend on the bus to Disneyland. Producer Laura Ziskin considered these elements detrimental to a sympathetic portrayal of Vivian, and they were removed or assigned to Kit. The deleted scenes have been found, and some were included on the DVD released for the film&#x27;s 15th anniversary. In one, Vivian tells Edward, &quot;I could just pop ya good and be on my way,&quot; indicating her lack of interest in &quot;pillow talk.&quot; In another, she is confronted by a drug dealer, Carlos, then rescued by Edward when the limo driver Darryl gets his gun out.

Though inspired by such films as &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, the film bears a resemblance to Pygmalion myths: particularly George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play of the same name, which also formed the basis for the Broadway musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. It was Walt Disney Studios then-president Jeffrey Katzenberg who insisted the film be re-written as a modern-day fairy tale and love story, as opposed to the original dark drama. It was pitched to Touchstone Pictures and re-written as a romantic comedy. The title &quot;3000&quot; was changed because Disney executives thought it sounded like a title for a science fiction film.

=== Casting === 
The casting of the film was a rather lengthy process. Marshall had initially considered Christopher Reeve, Daniel Day-Lewis, Kevin Kline, and Denzel Washington for the role of Edward, and Albert Brooks, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Lambert, Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds turned it down. Pacino went as far as doing a casting reading with Roberts before rejecting the part. Sam Neill, Tom Conti and Charles Grodin tested for the part along with Roberts. Gere initially refused but when he met with Roberts, she persuaded him and he eventually agreed to play Lewis. He reportedly started off much more active in his role; but Garry Marshall took him aside and said &quot;No, no, no, Richard. In this movie, one of you moves and one of you does not. Guess which one you are?&quot;

Julia Roberts was not the first choice for the role of Vivian, and was not wanted by Disney. Many other actresses were considered. Marshall originally envisioned Karen Allen for the role; when she declined, auditions went to many better-known actresses of the time including Molly Ringwald, who turned it down as she didn&#x27;t like the story as she felt &quot;there was something icky about it&quot;. Winona Ryder auditioned, but was turned down because Marshall felt she was &quot;too young.&quot; Jennifer Connelly was also dismissed for the same reason. Emily Lloyd turned it down as it conflicted with her shooting for the film &quot;Mermaids&quot;. Drew Barrymore, Patricia Arquette, Brooke Shields, Uma Thurman, and Kristin Davis also auditioned for the role of Vivian. Meg Ryan, who was the studio and Marshall&#x27;s top choice, turned it down as well. According to a note written by Marshall, Mary Steenburgen was also among the first choices. Diane Lane came very close to being cast (the script was much darker at the time); they had gone as far as costume fittings, but due to scheduling conflicts she could not accept. Michelle Pfeiffer turned the role down, saying she did not like the script&#x27;s &quot;tone.&quot; Daryl Hannah was also considered but believed the role was &quot;degrading to women.&quot; Valeria Golino was in consideration, but was not selected because of her thick Italian accent, and Jennifer Jason Leigh had auditioned. Lea Thompson unsuccessfully auditioned for the role as she thought the film was a drama.

When all the other actresses turned down the role, 21-year-old Julia Roberts, a relative unknown, with only the sleeper hit &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; (1988) and the yet-to-be-released &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), for which she would be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, won the role of Vivian. Her performance made her a star. J.F.Lawton, writer of the original screenplay, has suggested that the film was ultimately given a happy ending because of the chemistry of Gere and Roberts.

Veteran actor Ralph Bellamy, who plays James Morse, appears in his final acting performance before his death in 1991. Jason Alexander, who had also recently been cast for his role as the bumbling George Costanza in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, was cast as Philip Stuckey. A VHS copy of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; would appear in Seinfeld&#x27;s apartment in later seasons of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as a homage to Alexander&#x27;s participation in the film.

=== Filming === 
The film&#x27;s budget was substantial, at  million, so producers could shoot in many locations. Most filming took place in Los Angeles, California, specifically in Beverly Hills, and inside soundstages at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The escargot scene at the restaurant was shot at Rex II Ristorante, now named Cicada. Scenes set in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lobby were shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Filming commenced on July 24, 1989, but was immediately plagued by problems. These included Ferrari and Porsche declining the product placement opportunity for the car Edward drove, as neither firm wished to be associated with prostitutes. Lotus Cars saw the placement value and supplied a Silver Esprit SE (which was later sold).

Filming was a generally pleasant, easygoing experience, as the budget was broad and the shooting schedule was not tight. While shooting the scene where Vivian is lying down on the floor of Edward&#x27;s penthouse, watching reruns of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Garry Marshall had to tickle Roberts&#x27; feet (out of camera range) to get her to laugh. The scene in which Gere playfully snaps the lid of a jewelry case on her fingers was improvised, and her surprised laugh was genuine. The red dress Vivian wears to the opera has been listed among the most unforgettable dresses of all time.

During the scene in which Roberts sang a Prince song in the bathtub, slid down, and submerged her head under the bubbles; she emerged to find the crew had left except for the cameraman, who captured the moment on film. In the love scene, she was so stressed that a vein became noticeable on her forehead and had to be massaged by Marshall and Gere. She also developed a case of hives, and calamine lotion was used to soothe her skin until filming resumed. 

Shelley Michelle acted as body double for Roberts in risqué scenes and the film&#x27;s publicity poster. Filming wrapped on October 18, 1989.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Pretty Woman&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with positive reviews praising the stars&#x27; chemistry and the dialogue. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Pretty Woman&quot; may be a yuppie fantasy, but the film&#x27;s slick comedy, soundtrack, and casting can overcome misgivings.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. 

The film&#x27;s detractors criticized the overuse of the &quot;hooker with a heart of gold&quot; trope. Others opined that the film sugarcoats the realities of sex work. Gary Giddins wrote, &quot;In the insidious &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, all women who aren&#x27;t explicitly identified as tramps are gold-digging wives or snooty shopkeepers. It&#x27;s the kind of working-class fantasy that wants the men in the audience to identify with a ruthless corporate pirate (Richard Gere) and the woman to identify with a simple but grandhearted streetwalker (Julia Roberts), who, given a chance, could be a lady&#x27;s lady...The attempted laughs (few succeed) are at her expense.&quot; 

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;D,&quot; saying it &quot;starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy&quot; and becomes a &quot;plastic screwball soap opera&quot;, with the &quot;kinds of characters who exist nowhere but in the minds of callowly manipulative Hollywood screenwriters&quot;. Gleiberman conceded that with the film&#x27;s &quot;tough-hooker heroine, it can work as a feminist version of an upscale princess fantasy.&quot; He also said it &quot;pretends to be about how love transcends money,&quot; but &quot;is really obsessed with status symbols.&quot; On the film&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, Gleiberman wrote another article addressing his original review, saying that while he felt some of his criticisms were valid, he would have given it a &quot;B&quot; today. 

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave a positive review, praising how the film is about &quot;a particularly romantic kind of love, the sort you hardly see in the movies these days&quot;. He added it &quot;protects its fragile love story in the midst of cynicism and compromise. The performances are critical for that purpose. Gere plays new notes here; his swagger is gone, and he&#x27;s more tentative, proper, even shy. Roberts does an interesting thing; she gives her character an irrepressibly bouncy sense of humor and then lets her spend the movie trying to repress it. Actresses who can do that and look great can have whatever they want in Hollywood.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;Despite this quintessentially late 80&#x27;s outlook, and despite a covetousness and underlying misogyny that bring Mr. Marshall&#x27;s earlier &#x27;Overboard&#x27; to mind, &#x27;Pretty Woman&#x27; manages to be giddy, lighthearted escapism much of the time. Ms. Roberts, as noted, is a complete knockout, and this performance will make her a major star...Mr. Gere is mildly constrained by the button-down aspects of Edward&#x27;s character, but he manages to be dapper, amusing, and the perfect foil. Though it has not been that long since he himself was on the other side of the Hollywood gigolo equation, he conveys a dignity and presence well suited to a soon-to-be-radicalized captain of industry.&quot;

Carina Chocano of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the movie &quot;wasn&#x27;t a love story, it was a money story. Its logic depended on a disconnect between character and narrative, between image and meaning, between money and value, and that made it not cluelessly traditional but thoroughly postmodern.&quot; In a 2019 interview, Roberts expressed uncertainty over whether the film could be made today due to its controversial premise, commenting, &quot;So many things you could poke a hole in, but I don&#x27;t think it takes away from people being able to enjoy it&quot;.

<text>A news presenter – also known as a newsreader, newscaster (short for &quot;news broadcaster&quot;), anchorman or anchorwoman, news anchor or simply an anchor – is a person who presents news during a news program on TV, radio or the Internet. They may also be a working journalist, assisting in the collection of news material and may, in addition, provide commentary during the program. News presenters most often work from a television studio or radio studio, but may also present the news from remote locations in the field related to a particular major news event.

==History==
The role of the news presenter developed over time. Classically, the presenter would read the news from news &quot;copy&quot; which they may or may not have helped write with a news writer. This was often taken almost directly from wire services and then rewritten. Prior to the television era, radio-news broadcasts often mixed news with opinion and each presenter strove for a distinctive style. These presenters were referred to as commentators. The last major figure to present commentary in a news broadcast format in the United States was Paul Harvey.

With the development of the 24-hour news cycle and dedicated cable news channels, the role of the anchor evolved. Anchors would still present material prepared for a news program, but they also interviewed experts about various aspects of breaking news stories, and themselves provided improvised commentary, all under the supervision of the lead (or main) producer, who coordinated the broadcast by communicating with the anchor through an earphone. Many anchors help write or edit news for their programs, although modern news formats often distinguish between anchor and commentator in an attempt to establish the &quot;character&quot; of a news anchor. The mix of &quot;straight&quot; news and commentary varies depending on the type of program and the skills and knowledge of the particular anchor.

==Origin of the term &quot;anchor&quot;==
The terms &quot;anchor&quot;, &quot;anchorman&quot;, or &quot;anchorwoman&quot; are derived from the usage common in relay racing, specifically the anchor leg, where the position is typically given to the fastest or most experienced competitor on a team. In 1948, &quot;anchor man&quot; was used in the game show &quot;Who Said That?&quot; to refer to John Cameron Swayze, who was a permanent panel member of the show, in what may be the first usage of this term on television. The &quot;anchor&quot; term then became commonly used by 1952 to describe the most prominent member of a panel of reporters or experts. The term &quot;anchorman&quot; also was used to describe Walter Cronkite&#x27;s role at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, where he coordinated switches between news points and reporters.

The widespread claim that news anchors were called &quot;cronkiters&quot; in Swedish has been debunked by linguist Ben Zimmer.

==Criticisms==
Anchors occupy a contestable role in news broadcasts. Some argue anchors have become sensationalized characters whose identities overshadow the news itself, while others cite anchors as necessary figureheads of &quot;wisdom and truth&quot; in the news broadcast. The role of the anchor has changed in recent years following the advent of satirical journalism and citizen journalism, both of which relocate the interpretation of truth outside traditional professional journalism, but the place anchormen and anchorwomen hold in American media remains consistent. &quot;Just about every single major news anchor since the dawn of the medium after World War II has been aligned with show business,&quot; says Frank Rich, writer-at-large for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, in a polemic against commoditized news reporting, &quot;reading headlines to a camera in an appealing way is incentivized over actual reporting&quot;. 

Brian Williams, a former anchor for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, evidences this lapse in credibility generated by the celebration of the role of the anchor. In early 2015, Williams apologized to his viewers for fabricating stories of his experiences on the scene of major news events, an indiscretion resulting in a loss of 700,000 viewers for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. David Folkenflik of NPR asserted that the scandal &quot;corrodes trust in the anchor, in NBC and in the greater profession&quot;, exhibiting the way in which the credibility of the anchor extends beyond their literal place behind the news desk and into the expectation of the news medium at large. CBS&#x27;s long-running nighttime news broadcast &quot;60 Minutes&quot; displays this purported superfluousness of anchors, insofar as it has no central figurehead in favor of many correspondents with similarly important roles. Up-and-coming news networks like &quot;Vice&quot; magazine&#x27;s documentary-style reporting also eschew traditional news broadcast formatting in this way, suggesting an emphasis on on-site reporting and deemphasizing the importance of the solitary anchor in the news medium. In her essay, &quot;News as Performance&quot;, Margaret Morse posits this connection between anchor persona newsroom as an interconnected identity fusing many aspects of the newsroom dynamic:

For the anchor represents not merely the news &quot;per se&quot;, or a particular network or corporate conglomerate that owns the network, or television as an institution, or the public interest; rather, he represents the complex nexus of all of them. In this way, the network anchor position is a &quot;symbolic representation of the institutional order as an integrated totality&quot; (Berger and Luckmann 1967, p. 76), an institutional role on par with that of the president or of a Supreme Court justice, although the role originates in corporate practices rather than political or judicial processes. [...]

Despite the anchor&#x27;s construction of a commodified, aestheticized version of the news, some critics defend the role of the anchor in society, claiming that they function as a necessary conduit of credibility. The news anchor&#x27;s position as an omnipotent arbiter of information results from their place behind a typically elevated desk, wherefrom they interact with reporters through a screen-within-screen spatial setup. A criticism levied against the role of anchor stems from this dynamic, insofar as anchors simply &quot;... regurgitat[e] or reproduc[e] the report of others...&quot;, differentiating them from the productive occupations of journalists and on-site reporters. However, journalism professor Elly Alboim articulates the pro-anchor position by characterizing the anchor&#x27;s nightly presence as a necessary way to build familiarity and trust between the network and its viewers: &quot;People tend to want to believe and trust in television news and start, really, from the anchor&quot;. Beneficial or not, the anchor fits snugly into the &quot;personality cult&quot; engendered within American society that encourages celebrity that demands a hierarchy of authority, evidenced by the negligible change in ratings following implementation of new anchors in broadcast lineups. The identity of a particular anchor seems to influence viewer perception less than the presence of an anchor in general.

The role of the anchor correlates with the analogous, authority- and information-bearing positions already well-established in American politics, and the benefits it confers upon the political realm elucidate the compatibility between these two systems of information. Once again, Morse outlines this relationship between the anchor and the larger context in which they operate: &quot;[s]ince there are few other organs for inclusive and substantial discourse on social and cultural values in American life, the responsibility for interpreting the world and posing a political course of action and a social agenda falls on a very limited number of public personas, including such news personalities and the president&quot;. She levies a criticism against the anchor in this case, claiming that by decreasing the number of people responsible for delivering the news, American viewers receive a bottlenecked stream of information about their surroundings. The choreography and performativity involved in the construction of the news broadcast dramatizes political processes, but in doing so, exposes its flattening of subjectivity and insistence upon itself as the final word of truth. More specifically, &quot;the news media may do &#x27;an important social good when using the techniques of dramaturgy to make governance more interesting to people than would be the case otherwise.&#x27; At the same time, however, &#x27;there is an important difference between drama and democracy, with the former requiring spectators and the latter participants.&#x27;&quot; 

In contrast to perceptions of the news as a one-sided relationship with its viewers, some believe that the news works in conjunction with its audience to produce the most efficient picture possible of the world. Tom Brokaw, in speaking about his experiences as a news anchor for NBC, explained how news stories for the length of their duration tend to feed off viewers&#x27; demands, and that news is inherently a &quot;populist medium&quot;, and that &quot;[p]eople are not going to turn to television networks for a historically accurate and detailed description of what happened.&quot;

<doc id="156751" wikidata="Q121886686" url="?curid=156751" title="Murder of Samantha Runnion">
<text>Samantha Bree (Jackson) Runnion (July 26, 1996 – July 15, 2002) was a five-year-old girl abducted from outside her home in Stanton, California, and murdered.

==Kidnapping and murder==
On July 15, 2002, Runnion was playing with a friend in her front yard when a man approached them asking for help in finding a lost dog. After a short conversation, he grabbed Samantha, forced her into his car, and drove away. A day later, her nude body was found 50 miles south in Cleveland National Forest. Runnion had been sexually assaulted anally and vaginally and strangled. Police said that the killer was &quot;extremely sloppy&quot; and had left behind &quot;mountains of physical evidence connecting him to the crime&quot;.

Alejandro Avila of Lake Elsinore, California, was arrested three days after the abduction. His DNA was found on Samantha&#x27;s body, and her DNA was found in his car. Avila had previously visited his girlfriend in the condominium complex where Samantha lived and had been acquitted of molesting his girlfriend&#x27;s daughter and niece. Police found child pornography on Avila&#x27;s laptop computer, and he had booked a motel room on the day of the murder, where it was believed that Samantha was killed. Avila&#x27;s public defender argued during the trial that he couldn&#x27;t have kidnapped the girl, abused, murdered, and then dumped her body 50 miles away in one day as the prosecution believed.

On May 16, 2005, a jury returned a guilty verdict, and Avila was sentenced to death. He is incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison on death row. Samantha&#x27;s mother, Erin Runnion, launched a foundation called &quot;The Joyful Child Foundation,&quot; whose mission is &quot;Preventing crimes against children through programs that educate, empower, and unite families and communities.&quot; Avila has filed multiple appeals since the initial verdict, but none have been successful.

<doc id="156754" wikidata="Q13317" url="?curid=156754" title="Yogurt">
<text>Yogurt (; , from ; also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. Cow&#x27;s milk is most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt. The milk used may be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially different results.

Yogurt is produced using a culture of &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot; bacteria. Other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt. Some countries require yogurt to contain a specific amount of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria; for example, in China the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million CFU per milliliter. Some countries also regulate which bacteria can be used: for example, in France, a product can only be labeled as &quot;yaourt&quot; or &quot;yoghourt&quot; if it has been fermented exclusively by &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot;, a requirement that aligns with the international definition of yogurt in the Codex Alimentarius on fermented milk (CXS 243-2003. 

The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a warm temperature of is maintained for 4 to 12 hours to allow fermentation to occur, with the higher temperatures working faster but risking a lumpy texture or whey separation.

==Etymology and spelling==
The word for yogurt is derived from the , and is usually related to the verb , &quot;to knead&quot;, or &quot;to be curdled or coagulated; to thicken&quot;. It may be related to , meaning thick or dense. The sounds historically represented by the Arabic letter ghayn in the Turkish language ranging from a voiced velar fricative to a voiced velar plosive were traditionally romanized as &quot;gh&quot; prior to the introduction of a new Latin-based Turkish alphabet and the letter &quot;ğ&quot; in 1929, thus &quot;yoghurt&quot; spelled with a &quot;gh&quot; is first attested in sources from 1615 to 1625.

In English, spelling variations include &quot;yogurt&quot;, &quot;yoghurt&quot;, and to a lesser extent &quot;yoghourt&quot; or &quot;yogourt&quot;. In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa the word is usually spelled &quot;yoghurt&quot;, while in the United States the spelling is &quot;yogurt&quot;. Canada has its own spelling, &quot;yogourt&quot;, a minority variant of the French , although &quot;yogurt&quot; and &quot;yoghurt&quot; are also used.

==History==

Analysis of the &quot;L. delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;bulgaricus&quot; genome indicates that the bacterium may have originated on the surface of a plant. Milk may have become spontaneously and unintentionally exposed to it through contact with plants, or bacteria may have been transferred from the udder of domestic milk-producing animals. The origins of yogurt are unknown but it was probably discovered first by Neolithic people in Central Asia and Mesopotamia around 5000 BC, when the first milk-producing animals were domesticated. They most likely found out how to ferment milk by chance and in all likelihood, yogurt was discovered independently in this way in many different places at different times. 
The cuisine of ancient Greece included a dairy product known as oxygala () which was a form of yogurt. Galen (AD 129 – /) mentioned that oxygala was consumed with honey, similar to the way thickened Greek yogurt is eaten today. The oldest writings mentioning yogurt are attributed to Pliny the Elder, who remarked that certain &quot;barbarous nations&quot; knew how &quot;to thicken the milk into a substance with an agreeable acidity&quot;. The use of yogurt by medieval Turks is recorded in the books &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot; by Mahmud Kashgari and &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot; by Yusuf Has Hajib written in the 11th century. Both texts mention the word &quot;yogurt&quot; in different sections and describe its use by nomadic Turks. The earliest yogurts were probably spontaneously fermented by wild bacteria in goat skin bags.

Some accounts suggest that Mughal Indian emperor Akbar&#x27;s cooks would flavor yogurt with mustard seeds and cinnamon. Another early account of a European encounter with yogurt occurs in French clinical history: Francis I suffered from a severe diarrhea which no French doctor could cure. His ally Suleiman the Magnificent sent a doctor, who allegedly cured the patient with yogurt. The grateful king told many of the food that had cured him.

Until the 1900s, yogurt was a staple in diets of people in the Russian Empire (and especially Central Asia and the Caucasus), Western Asia, South Eastern Europe/Balkans, Central Europe, and the Indian subcontinent. Stamen Grigorov (1878–1945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the microflora of the Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905, he described it as consisting of a spherical and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907, the rod-like bacterium was called &quot;Bacillus bulgaricus&quot; (now &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;bulgaricus&quot;). The Russian biologist and Nobel laureate Ilya Mechnikov, from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov&#x27;s work and hypothesized that regular consumption of yogurt was responsible for the unusually long lifespans of Bulgarian peasants. Believing &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; to be essential for good health, Mechnikov worked to popularize yogurt as a foodstuff throughout Europe.

Industrialization of yogurt production is credited to Isaac Carasso, who, in 1919, started a small yogurt business in Barcelona, Spain, naming the business Danone (&quot;little Daniel&quot;) after his son. The brand later expanded to the United States under an Americanized version of the name, Dannon. Yogurt with added fruit jam was patented in 1933 by the Radlická Mlékárna dairy in Prague.

Yogurt was introduced to the United States in the first decade of the twentieth century, influenced by Élie Metchnikoff&#x27;s &quot;The Prolongation of Life; Optimistic Studies&quot; (1908); it was available in tablet form for those with digestive intolerance and for home culturing. It was popularized by John Harvey Kellogg at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where it was used both orally and in enemas, and later by Armenian immigrants Sarkis and Rose Colombosian, who started &quot;Colombo and Sons Creamery&quot; in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1929.

Colombo Yogurt was originally delivered around New England in a horse-drawn wagon inscribed with the Armenian word &quot;madzoon&quot; which was later changed to &quot;yogurt&quot;, the Turkish language name of the product, as Turkish was the lingua franca between immigrants of the various Near Eastern ethnicities who were the main consumers at that time. Yogurt&#x27;s popularity in the United States was enhanced in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was presented as a health food by scientists like Hungarian-born bacteriologist Stephen A. Gaymont. Plain yogurt still proved too sour for the American palate and in 1966 Colombo Yogurt sweetened the yogurt and added fruit preserves, creating &quot;fruit on the bottom&quot; style yogurt. This was successful and company sales soon exceeded $1 million per year. By the late 20th century, yogurt had become a common American food item and Colombo Yogurt was sold in 1993 to General Mills, which discontinued the brand in 2010.

==Nutrition==
Yogurt (plain yogurt from whole milk) is 81% water, 9% protein, 5% fat, and 4% carbohydrates, including 4% sugars (table). A 100-gram amount provides of dietary energy. As a proportion of the Daily Value (DV), a serving of yogurt is a rich source of vitamin B12 (31% DV) and riboflavin (23% DV), with moderate content of protein, phosphorus, and selenium (14 to 19% DV; table).
Tilde (~) represents missing or incomplete data. 
The above shows little difference exists between whole milk and yogurt made from whole milk with respect to the listed nutritional constituents.

==Health research==

Because it may contain live cultures, yogurt is often associated with probiotics, which have been postulated as having positive effects on immune, cardiovascular or metabolic health.

As of the early 21st century, high-quality clinical evidence was insufficient to conclude that consuming yogurt lowers the risk of diseases or otherwise improves health. Meta-analyses found that consuming 80 grams per day of low-fat yogurt was associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a lower incidence of hip fracture in post-menopausal women. A 2021 review found a cause-and-effect relationship between yogurt consumption and improved lactose tolerance and digestion, and that potential associations exist between yogurt consumption and improving bone health, as well as lowering the risk of some diseases, including cancers and metabolic syndrome.

==Safety==
Yogurt made with raw milk can be contaminated with bacteria that can cause significant illness and even result in death, including &quot;Listeria&quot;, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Brucella&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Yogurts can also be contaminated with aflatoxin-producing &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus nomius&quot;.

Contamination occurs in traditionally prepared yogurts more often than industrially processed ones, but may affect the latter as well if manufacturing and packaging practices are suboptimal.

When mold forms on yogurt it can not be scraped away. The consistency of yogurt allows the mold to penetrate deeply under the surface where it spreads.

==Varieties and presentation==
&quot;Dahi&quot; is a yogurt from the Indian subcontinent, known for its characteristic taste and consistency. The word &quot;dahi&quot; seems to be derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;dadhi&quot; (&quot;sour milk&quot;), one of the five elixirs, or panchamrita, often used in Hindu ritual. Sweetened dahi (&quot;mishti doi&quot; or &quot;meethi dahi&quot;) is common in eastern parts of India, made by fermenting sweetened milk. While cow&#x27;s milk is currently the primary ingredient for yogurt, goat and buffalo milk were widely used in the past, and valued for the fat content (see buffalo curd).

Dadiah or dadih is a traditional West Sumatran yogurt made from water buffalo milk, fermented in bamboo tubes. Yogurt is common in Nepal, where it is served as both an appetizer and dessert. Locally called &quot;dahi&quot;, it is a part of the Nepali culture, used in local festivals, marriage ceremonies, parties, religious occasions, family gatherings, and so on. One Nepalese yogurt is called &quot;juju dhau&quot;, originating from the city of Bhaktapur. In Tibet, yak milk (technically dri milk, as the word yak refers to the male animal) is made into yogurt (and butter and cheese) and consumed.

In Northern Iran, &quot;Mâst Chekide&quot; is a variety of kefir yogurt with a distinct sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Common appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, &quot;Mâst-o-Khiâr&quot; with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and &quot;Mâst-Musir&quot; with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread and served as a cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, spinach and lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour cream sauce called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.

Matsoni is a Georgian yogurt in the Caucasus and Russia. Tarator and are cold soups made from yogurt during summertime in eastern Europe. They are made with ayran, cucumbers, dill, salt, olive oil, and optionally garlic and ground walnuts. Tzatziki in Greece and milk salad in Bulgaria are thick yogurt-based salads similar to tarator.

Khyar w Laban (cucumber and yogurt salad) is a dish in Lebanon and Syria. Also, a wide variety of local Lebanese and Syrian dishes are cooked with yogurt like &quot;Kibbi bi Laban&quot; Rahmjoghurt, a creamy yogurt with much higher fat content (10%) than many yogurts offered in English-speaking countries. Dovga, a yogurt soup cooked with a variety of herbs and rice, is served warm in winter or refreshingly cold in summer. Jameed, yogurt salted and dried to preserve it, is consumed in Jordan. Zabadi is the type of yogurt made in Egypt, usually from the milk of the Egyptian water buffalo. It is particularly associated with Ramadan fasting, as it is thought to prevent thirst during all-day fasting.

===Sweetened and flavored===

To offset its natural sourness, yogurt is also sold sweetened, sweetened and flavored or in containers with fruit or fruit jam on the bottom. The two styles of yogurt commonly found in the grocery store are set-style yogurt and Swiss-style yogurt. Set-style yogurt is poured into individual containers to set, while Swiss-style yogurt is stirred prior to packaging. Either may have fruit added to increase sweetness.

Lassi is a common Indian beverage made from stirred liquified yogurt that is either salted or sweetened with sugar commonly, less commonly honey and combined with fruit pulp to create flavored lassi. Consistency can vary widely, with urban and commercial lassis having uniform texture through being processed, whereas rural and rustic lassi has discernible curds or fruit pulp.

Large amounts of sugar – or other sweeteners for low-energy yogurts – are often used in commercial yogurt. Some yogurts contain added modified starch, pectin (found naturally in fruit) or gelatin to create thickness and creaminess. This type of yogurt may be marketed under the name Swiss-style, although it is unrelated to conventional Swiss yogurt. Some yogurts, often called &quot;cream line&quot;, are made with whole milk which has not been homogenized so the cream rises to the top. In many countries, sweetened, flavored yogurt is common, typically sold in single-serving plastic cups. Common flavors may include vanilla, honey, and toffee, and various fruits. In the early 21st century, yogurt flavors inspired by desserts, such as chocolate or cheesecake, became common. There is concern about the health effects of sweetened yogurt due to its high sugar content, although research indicates that use of sugar in yogurt manufacturing has decreased since 2016 in response to WHO and government initiatives to combat obesity.

===Straining===
Strained yogurt has been strained through a filter, traditionally made of muslin and more recently of paper or non-muslin cloth. This removes the whey, giving a much thicker consistency. Strained yogurt is made at home, especially if using skimmed milk which results in a thinner consistency. Yogurt that has been strained to filter or remove the whey is known as Labneh in Middle Eastern countries. It has a consistency between that of yogurt and cheese. It may be used for sandwiches in Middle Eastern countries. Olive oil, cucumber slices, olives, and various green herbs may be added. It can be thickened further and rolled into balls, preserved in olive oil, and fermented for a few more weeks. It is sometimes used with onions, meat, and nuts as a stuffing for a variety of pies or kibbeh balls.

Some types of strained yogurts are boiled in open vats first, so that the liquid content is reduced. The East Indian dessert, a variation of traditional dahi called mishti dahi, offers a thicker, more custard-like consistency, and is usually sweeter than western yogurts. In western Indian (Marathi and Gujarati) cuisine, strained yogurt is macerated with sugar and spices such as saffron, cardamom and nutmeg to make the dessert &quot;shrikhand&quot;. Strained yogurt is also enjoyed in Greece and is the main component of &quot;tzatziki&quot; (from Turkish &quot;&quot;), a well-known accompaniment to gyros and souvlaki pita sandwiches: it is a yogurt sauce or dip made with the addition of grated cucumber, olive oil, salt and, optionally, mashed garlic. Srikhand, a dessert in India, is made from strained yogurt, saffron, cardamom, nutmeg and sugar and sometimes fruits such as mango or pineapple.

In North America, strained yogurt is commonly called &quot;Greek yogurt&quot;. Powdered milk is sometimes added in lieu of straining to achieve thickness. In Britain, the name &quot;Greek&quot; may only be applied to yogurt made in Greece.

===Beverages===

Ayran, doogh (&quot;dawghe&quot; in Neo-Aramaic) or dhallë is a yogurt-based, salty drink. It is made by mixing yogurt with water and (sometimes) salt.

Borhani (or burhani) is a spicy yogurt drink from Bangladesh. It is usually served with kacchi biryani at weddings and special feasts. Key ingredients are yogurt blended with mint leaves (mentha), mustard seeds and black rock salt (Kala Namak). Ground roasted cumin, ground white pepper, green chili pepper paste and sugar are often added.

Lassi is a yogurt-based beverage that is usually slightly salty or sweet, and may be commercially flavored with rosewater, mango or other fruit juice. Salty lassi is usually flavored with ground, roasted cumin and red chilies, and may be made with buttermilk.

An unsweetened and unsalted yogurt drink usually called simply &quot;jogurt&quot; is consumed with &quot;burek&quot; and other baked goods in the Balkans. Sweetened yogurt drinks are the usual form in Europe (including the UK) and the US, containing fruit and added sweeteners. These are typically called &quot;drinkable yogurt&quot;. Also available are &quot;yogurt smoothies&quot;, which contain a higher proportion of fruit and are more like smoothies.

==Production==

Yogurt production involves preparing warm milk to a temperature () that will not kill the live microorganisms that turn the milk into yogurt, inoculating certain bacteria (starter culture), usually &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot;, into the milk, and finally keeping it warm for several hours (4–12 hours).

Milk with a higher concentration of solids than normal milk may be used; the higher solids content produces a firmer yogurt. Solids can be increased by adding dried milk. The yogurt-making process provides two significant barriers to pathogen growth, heat and acidity (low pH). Both are necessary to ensure a safe product. Acidity alone has been questioned by recent outbreaks of food poisoning by &quot;E. coli O157:H7&quot; that is acid-tolerant. &quot;E. coli O157:H7&quot; is easily destroyed by pasteurization (heating); the initial heating of the milk kills pathogens as well as denaturing proteins. The microorganisms that turn milk into yogurt can tolerate higher temperatures than most pathogens, so that a suitable temperature not only encourages the formation of yogurt, but inhibits pathogenic microorganisms. Once the yogurt has formed it can, if desired, be strained to reduce the whey content and thicken it.

==Commerce==

Two types of yogurt are supported by the Codex Alimentarius for import and export.
* Pasteurized yogurt (&quot;heat treated fermented milk&quot;) is yogurt pasteurized to kill bacteria.
* Probiotic yogurt (labeled as &quot;live yogurt&quot; or &quot;active yogurt&quot;) is yogurt pasteurized to kill bacteria, with &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; added in measured units before packaging.
* Yogurt probiotic drink is a drinkable yogurt pasteurized to kill bacteria, with &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; added before packaging.

Under US Food and Drug Administration regulations, milk must be pasteurized &quot;before&quot; it is cultured, and may optionally be heat treated after culturing to increase shelf life. Most commercial yogurts in the United States are not heat treated after culturing, and contain live cultures.

Yogurt with live cultures is more beneficial than pasteurized yogurt for people with lactose malabsorption.

==Lactose intolerance==

Lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have symptoms due to the decreased ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. In 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) determined that lactose intolerance can be alleviated by ingesting live yogurt cultures (lactobacilli) that are able to digest the lactose in other dairy products. The scientific review by EFSA enabled yogurt manufacturers to use a health claim on product labels, provided that the &quot;yogurt should contain at least 108 CFU live starter microorganisms (&quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot;) per gram. The target population is individuals with lactose maldigestion&quot;. A 2021 review found that yogurt consumption could improve lactose tolerance and digestion.

==Plant-based products==
A variety of plant-based yogurt alternatives appeared in the 2000s, using soy milk, rice milk, and nut milks such as almond milk and coconut milk fermented with cultures. These products may be suitable for people with lactose intolerance or those who prefer plant-based foods such as vegetarians or vegans. Plant-based milks have different structures and components than dairy milk. Though they can be used to make many products similar to those made from dairy, there are differences in taste and texture, and some consumers may feel that they lack the &quot;delicate and smooth structure&quot; of &quot;conventional yogurts&quot;. Since plant-based milks do not contain lactose (the food of &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot;), plant-based products usually contain different bacterial strains than yogurt, such as &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&quot;, and &quot;Bifidobacterium bifidum&quot;. Plant-based products also vary considerably in their nutrition and ingredients and may contain gums, stabilizers, high-intensity sweeteners, and artificial colors.

In Europe, companies may not market their plant-based products using the word &quot;yogurt&quot; since that term is reserved for products of animal origin only – per European Union regulation 1308/2013 and a 2017 ruling in the Court of Justice of the European Union. Reaffirmed in 2021, per the US FDA&#x27;s Standard of Identity regulations, the word &quot;yogurt&quot; has been reserved for a product made from lactation and is a product of &quot;milk-derived ingredients&quot;.

<text>Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (; – 15 July 1916), also spelled Élie Metchnikoff, was a zoologist from the Russian Empire of Moldavian noble ancestry best known for his research in immunology (study of immune systems) and thanatology (study of death). He and Paul Ehrlich were jointly awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;in recognition of their work on immunity&quot;.

Mechnikov was born in a region of the Russian Empire that is today part of modern-day Ukraine to a Moldavian noble father and a Ukrainian-Jewish mother, and later on continued his career in France. Given this complex heritage, five different nations and peoples lay claim to Metchnikoff. Despite having a mother of Jewish origin, he was baptized Russian Orthodox, although he later became an atheist.

Honoured as the &quot;father of innate immunity&quot;, Metchnikoff was the first to discover a process of immunity called phagocytosis and the cell responsible for it, called phagocyte, specifically macrophage, in 1882. This discovery turned out to be the major defence mechanism in innate immunity, as well as the foundation of the concept of cell-mediated immunity, while Ehrlich established the concept of humoral immunity to complete the principles of immune system. Their works are regarded as the foundation of the science of immunology.

Metchnikoff developed one of the earliest concepts in ageing, and advocated the use of lactic acid bacteria (&quot;Lactobacillus&quot;) for healthy and long life. This became the concept of probiotics in medicine. Mechnikov is also credited with coining the term gerontology in 1903, for the emerging study of aging and longevity. In this regard, Ilya Mechnikov is called the &quot;father of gerontology&quot; (although, as often happens in science, the situation is ambiguous, and the same title is sometimes applied to some other people who contributed to aging research later).

Supporters of life extension celebrate 15 May as Metchnikoff Day, and used it as a memorable date for organizing activities.

==Early life, family and education==
Metchnikoff was born in the village of , Kharkov Governorate, in the Russian Empire, now located in Kupiansk Raion, Kharkiv Oblast in Ukraine. He was the youngest of five children of Ilya Ivanovich Mechnikov, an officer of the Imperial Guard. His mother, Emilia Lvovna (Nevakhovich), the daughter of the writer Leo Nevakhovich, largely influenced him on his education, especially in science. The Nevakhovich family was Jewish.

The family name Mechnikov is a translation from Romanian, since his father was a descendant of the Chancellor Yuri Stefanovi, the grandson of Nicolae Milescu Spătarul. Yuri Stefanovich immigrated to Russia together with Dimitrie Cantemir in 1711 after the unsuccessful campaign of Peter I on the Danubian Principalities. For two and a half centuries, the Mechnikov family lived in St. Petersburg, where it became connected by family ties with many Russian princely families. The word &quot;mech&quot; is a Russian translation of the Romanian &quot;spadă&quot; (sword), which originated with Spătar (Sword-bearer). His elder brother Lev became a prominent geographer and sociologist.

In 1856, Metchnikoff entered the Kharkov Lycée, where he developed his interest in biology. Convinced by his mother to study natural sciences instead of medicine, in 1862 he tried to study biology at the University of Würzburg, but the German academic session would not start by the end of the year. Metchnikoff thus enrolled at Kharkov Imperial University for natural sciences, completing his four-year degree in two years.

In 1864, he traveled to Germany to study marine fauna on the small North Sea island of Heligoland. He was advised by the botanist Ferdinand Cohn to work with Rudolf Leuckart at the University of Giessen. It was in Leuckart&#x27;s laboratory that he made his first scientific discovery of alternation of generations (sexual and asexual) in nematodes (Chaetosomatida) and then at the University of Munich. In 1865, while at Giessen, he discovered intracellular digestion in flatworm, and this study influenced his later works. Moving to Naples the next year he worked on a doctoral thesis on the embryonic development of the cuttle-fish &quot;Sepiola&quot; and the crustacean &quot;Nebalia&quot;. A cholera epidemic in the autumn of 1865 made him move to the University of Göttingen, where he worked briefly with W. M. Keferstein and Jakob Henle.

In 1867, he returned to Russia to receive his doctorate with Alexander Kovalevsky from the University of Saint Petersburg. Together they won the Karl Ernst von Baer prize for their theses on the development of germ layers in invertebrate embryos.

==Career and achievements==
Metchnikoff was appointed docent at the newly established Imperial Novorossiya University (now Odesa University). Only twenty-two years of age, he was younger than his students. After being involved in a conflict with a senior colleague over attending scientific meetings, he transferred to the University of Saint Petersburg in 1868, where he experienced a worse professional environment. In 1870 he returned to Odessa to take up the appointment of Titular Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy.

In 1882 he resigned from Odessa University due to political turmoils after the assassination of Alexander II. He went to Sicily to set up his private laboratory in Messina. He returned to Odessa as director of an institute set up to carry out Louis Pasteur&#x27;s vaccine against rabies; due to some difficulties, he left in 1888 and went to Paris to seek Pasteur&#x27;s advice. Pasteur gave him an appointment at the Pasteur Institute, where he remained for the rest of his life.
Metchnikoff became interested in the study of microbes, and especially the immune system. At Messina he discovered phagocytosis after experimenting on the larvae of starfish. In 1882 he first demonstrated the process when he inserted small citrus thorns into starfish larvae, then found unusual cells surrounding the thorns. He realized that in animals which have blood, the white blood cells gather at the site of inflammation, and he hypothesised that this could be the process by which bacteria were attacked and killed by the white blood cells. He discussed his hypothesis with Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Claus, Professor of Zoology at the University of Vienna, who suggested to him the term &quot;phagocyte&quot; for a cell which can surround and kill pathogens. He delivered his findings at Odessa University in 1883.

His theory, that certain white blood cells could engulf and destroy harmful bodies such as bacteria, met with scepticism from leading specialists including Louis Pasteur, Emil von Behring, and others. At the time, most bacteriologists believed that white blood cells ingested pathogens and then spread them further through the body. His major supporter was Rudolf Virchow, who published his research in his &quot;Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medicin&quot; (now called the &quot;Virchows Archiv&quot;). His discovery of these phagocytes ultimately won him the Nobel Prize in 1908. He worked with Émile Roux on calomel (mercurous chloride) in ointment form in an attempt to prevent people from contracting the sexually transmitted disease syphilis.

In 1887, he observed that leukocytes isolated from the blood of various animals were attracted towards certain bacteria. The first studies of leukocyte killing in the presence of specific antiserum were performed by Joseph Denys and Joseph Leclef, followed by Leon Marchand and Mennes between 1895 and 1898. Almoth E. Wright was the first to quantify this phenomenon and strongly advocated its potential therapeutic importance. The so-called resolution of the humoralist and cellularist positions by showing their respective roles in the setting of enhanced killing in the presence of opsonins was popularized by Wright after 1903, although Metchnikoff acknowledged the stimulatory capacity of immunosensitized serum on phagotic function in the case of acquired immunity.

This attraction was soon proposed to be due to soluble elements released by the bacteria (see Harris for a review of this area up to 1953). Some 85 years after this seminal observation, laboratory studies showed that these elements were low molecular weight (between 150 and 1500 Dalton (unit)s) N-formylated oligopeptides, including the most prominent member of this group, N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine, that are made by a variety of replicating gram positive bacteria and gram negative bacteria. Metchnikoff&#x27;s early observation, then, was the foundation for studies that defined a critical mechanism by which bacteria attract leukocytes to initiate and direct the innate immune response of acute inflammation to sites of host invasion by pathogens.

Metchnikoff discovered fungal infections causing insect death in 1879 and became involved in the biological control of insect pests through his student Isaak Krasilschik. They were able to make use of green muscardine for control of insects in agricultural fields.

Metchnikoff also self-experimented with cholera that initially supported the probiotic notion. During the 1892 cholera epidemic in France, he was surprised by the fact that the disease affected only some people but not others when they were equally exposed to the infection. To understand the differences in susceptibility to the disease, he drank a sample of cholera but never got sick. He tested on two volunteers of which one was not affected while the other almost died. He hypothesised that the difference in cholera infection was due to differences in intestinal microbes, speculating that those who have plenty of beneficial ones would be healthier.

The issues of aging occupied a significant place in Metchnikoff&#x27;s works. Metchnikoff developed a theory that aging is caused by toxic bacteria in the gut and that lactic acid could prolong life. He attributed the longevity of Bulgarian peasants to their yogurt consumption that contained what was called the Bulgarian bacteria (now called &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;bulgaricus&quot;). To validate his theory, he drank sour milk every day throughout his life. His scientific reasonings on the subject were written in his books &quot;The Nature of Man: Studies in Optimistic Philosophy&quot; (1903) and more expressively in &quot;The Prolongation of Life: Optimistic Studies&quot; (1907). He also espoused the potential life-lengthening properties of lactic acid bacteria such as &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus&quot;. This concept of probiotics, which he termed &quot;orthobiosis,&quot; was influential in his lifetime, but became ignored until the mid-1990s when experimental evidence emerged.

==Awards and recognitions==
Metchnikoff won the Karl Ernst von Baer prize in 1867 with Alexander Kovalevsky on the basis of their doctoral research. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1908 with Paul Ehrlich . He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, UK, and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1906. He was given honorary memberships of the Academy of Medicine in Paris and of the Academy of Sciences and Medicine in Saint Petersburg.

* The forms part of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine.

==Personal life and views==

Metchnikoff married his first wife, Ludmila Feodorovitch, in 1869. She died from tuberculosis on 20 April 1873. Her death, combined with other problems, caused Metchnikoff to attempt suicide, taking a large dose of opium. In 1875, he married his student Olga Belokopytova. In 1885 Olga suffered from severe typhoid and this led to his second suicide attempt. He injected himself with the spirochete of relapsing fever. (Olga died in 1944 in Paris from typhoid.)

Despite being baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church, Metchnikoff was an atheist.

He was greatly influenced by Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. He first read Fritz Müller&#x27;s &quot;Für Darwin&quot; (&quot;For Darwin&quot;) in Giessen. From this he became a supporter of natural selection and Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s biogenetic law. His scientific works and theories were inspired by Darwinism.

Metchnikoff died in 1916 in Paris from heart failure. According to his will, his body was used for medical research and afterwards cremated in Père Lachaise Cemetery crematorium. His cinerary urn has been placed in the Pasteur Institute library.

Metchnikoff wrote notable books and papers, including:
* &quot;Leçons sur la pathologie comparée de l’inflammation&quot; (1892; &quot;Lectures on the Comparative Pathology of Inflammation&quot;)
* &quot;L’Immunité dans les maladies infectieuses&quot; (1901; &quot;Immunity in Infectious Diseases&quot;)

However, on February 27, 2020, the music video and audio of the song were leaked on the internet and became the trending topic to all of her fans, though the song is yet to be released on digital platforms. Still focusing on work for her fifth album, Belinda was forced to postpone the shooting of two music videos in Spain, due to the Coronavirus disease that prompted the cancellation of all flights for that country. One of the songs features Spanish singer Juan Magán, who she has previously collaborated with in past projects. Belinda finally talked about the leaking of her music video &quot;Bailalo&quot;, describing it as &quot;a video full of colors, talent and Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas&quot;.

<doc id="156765" wikidata="Q56436" url="?curid=156765" title="Nüshu">
<text>Nüshu (; ; ; ) is a syllabic script derived from Chinese characters that was used by ethnic Yao women for several centuries in Jiangyong, a county within the southern Chinese province of Hunan. From the early 21st century there have been official efforts to revitalise the script, as well as indications of renewed interest among the wider public.

Nüshu is phonetic, with each of its approximately 600–700 characters representing a syllable. Nüshu works were a way for women to lament by communicating sorrows, commiserating over Chinese patriarchy, and establishing connections with an empathetic community. Typically a group of three or four young, non-related women would pledge friendship by writing letters and singing songs in Nüshu to each other.

It is not known when Nüshu came into being, but it seems to have reached its peak during the latter part of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). To preserve the script as an intangible cultural heritage, Chinese authorities established a Nüshu museum in 2002 and designated &quot;Nüshu transmitters&quot; starting in 2003. Fears that the features of the script are being distorted by the effort of marketing it for the tourist industry were highlighted by the 2022 documentary &quot;Hidden Letters&quot;.

==Features and adoption==
Nüshu was used to write a distinct Chinese variety known as Xiangnan Tuhua that is spoken by the sinicized Yao people of the Xiao River and Yongming River region of northern Jiangyong, Hunan. This dialect, which differs enough from those of other parts of Hunan that there is little mutual intelligibility, is known to its speakers as &#x27;Dong language&#x27;. There are differing opinions on the classification of Xiangnan Tuhua, as it has features of several different Chinese varieties. Some scholars classify it under Xiang Chinese or Pinghua, and other scholars consider it a hybrid dialect. Most Jiangyong residents are bilingual in Xiangnan Tuhua and the Hunan dialect of Southwestern Mandarin. Xiangnan Tuhua was only written using Nüshu, and it was not used to write other languages, such as the Southwestern Mandarin spoken in Hunan, or the local Yao language. 

Unlike standard written Chinese, where each Chinese character is logographic, representing a word or part of a word, Nüshu is phonetic, with approximately 600–700 characters representing Xiangnan Tuhua&#x27;s spoken syllables. This is about half the number required to represent all the syllables in the language, as tonal distinctions are frequently ignored, making it &quot;the most revolutionary and thorough simplification of Chinese characters ever attempted&quot;. Zhou Shuoyi, described as the only male to have mastered the script, compiled a dictionary listing 1,800 variant characters and allographs.

It has been suggested that Nüshu characters derived from be italic variant forms of regular script Chinese characters, as can be seen in the name of the script, though some have been substantially modified to better fit embroidery patterns. The strokes of the characters are in the form of dots, horizontals, virgules, and arcs. The script is traditionally written in vertical columns running from right to left, but in modern contexts it may be written in horizontal lines from left to right, just like modern-day Chinese. Unlike in standard Chinese, writing Nüshu script with very fine, almost threadlike, lines is seen as a mark of fine penmanship.

About half of Nüshu are modified Chinese characters used logographically. In about 100, the entire character is adopted with little change apart from skewing the frame from square to rhomboid, sometimes reversing them (mirror image), and often reducing the number of strokes. Another hundred have been modified in their strokes, but are still easily recognisable, as is &quot;nü&quot; () above. About 200 have been greatly modified, but traces of the original Chinese character are still discernible. The rest of the characters are phonetic. They are either modified characters, as above, or elements extracted from characters. They are used for 130 phonetic values, each used to write on average ten homophonous or nearly homophonous words, though there are allographs as well; women differed on which Chinese character they preferred for a particular phonetic value.

== History ==

=== Origins of Nüshu ===
The exact origins of Nüshu remain uncertain, as no written records document the genesis of this script. Gong Zhebing, a pioneer researcher of Nüshu, collected oral traditions and stories passed down through generations in Jiangyong County. These accounts reveal that the genesis of Nüshu is deeply rooted in local folklore and cultural traditions, blending myth and history.

==== A Palace Maiden&#x27;s Creation ====
One tale tells of a talented and beautiful woman from Jiangyong who excelled in singing and embroidery. Her idyllic life with her sworn sisters was disrupted when she was chosen to serve as a palace maiden in the emperor&#x27;s court. Isolated and yearning for her home and companions, she invented Nüshu based on embroidery patterns to express her feelings. She sent letters written in this new script back to her sisters, teaching them how to interpret it. The script eventually spread among women in Jiangyong, becoming a cherished tool for communication.

==== Pan Qiao&#x27;s Creation ====
Another popular tale features Pan Qiao, a remarkably skilled young woman from Tongshan Village. By the age of three, she could sing; by seven, she mastered embroidery; and by eighteen, she excelled in every feminine craft. Pan Qiao was beloved by the women around her, who frequently formed sworn sisterhoods with her.

One day, while gathering grass in the mountains, Pan Qiao was captured by an imperial hunting party and taken to a distant county. Living in harsh servitude, she yearned for rescue. She eventually came up with an idea to devise a new script based on the patterns she used in weaving lace and creating shoe designs. She crafted one character daily over three years, ultimately producing 1,080 symbols. She used this script to write a letter, which was delivered back to her village. Her sisters decoded the message, discovered her whereabouts, and organized her rescue. Pan Qiao’s script was passed down through generations and is believed to have evolved into Nüshu.

==== The Nine-Jin Maiden’s Creation ====
In another account, the inventor of Nüshu was a woman from Tongkou Village nicknamed the &quot;Nine-Jin Maiden&quot; (or &quot;Nine-Pound Maiden&quot;) due to her unusually heavy birth weight. Renowned for her intelligence, singing, and embroidery, she created Nüshu as a way for her sworn sisters to communicate, as they were unable to read traditional Chinese characters. This script became their means of exchanging messages and nurturing their bonds of sisterhood.

==== Evaluating the Legends ====
While these stories vary in detail, they share recurring themes of hardship, ingenuity, and the cultural traditions of Jiangyong women. Gong Zhebing speculated that Pan Qiao and the Nine-Jin Maiden may represent the same individual, as both stories originate from Tongkou Village and share similar elements. The palace maiden tale, while romantic, is often considered less historically plausible.

Scholars generally agree that Nüshu was likely created by a local woman skilled in embroidery and song, inspired by the artistic patterns in traditional needlework. The script played a crucial role in the lives of Jiangyong women, fostering emotional connections and serving as a medium for communication in a patriarchal society where literacy was often inaccessible to women.

=== Evolution and Cultural Context of Nüshu ===
It is not known when Nüshu came into being. The difficulty in dating Nüshu is due to local customs of burning or burying Nüshu texts with their owners and the difficulty in textiles and paper surviving in humid environments. However, many of the simplifications found in Nüshu had been in informal use in other vernaculars of Chinese since the Southern Song and Yuan dynasties (1127–1368). Use seemingly reached its peak during the latter part of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).

Before 1949, Jiangyong operated under an agrarian economy and women had to abide by patriarchal Confucian practices such as the Three Obediences. Women were confined to the homes (through foot binding) and were assigned roles in housework and needlework instead of fieldwork, which allowed the practice of Nüshu to develop. Specifically, unmarried women, also known as &quot;upstairs girls&quot;, often gathered in groups in upstairs chambers to embroider and sing. The practice of singing &quot;nüge&quot; () allowed young women to learn Nüshu.

=== &quot;Jiebai&quot; ===
One of the primary methods in which Nüshu use was perpetuated was through &quot;jiebai&quot; (). &quot;Jiebai&quot; formed a sisterhood, and enabled women to have companions. Unmarried girls often interacted with one another daily. Whether during group needlework, embroidering, or shoemaking, these girls worked together in an upstairs chamber. It was typical that they slept there together as well. &quot;This arrangement led to the building of more intimate bonds through conversation, signing, and playing.&quot; Their poems and songs &quot;embody their testimony to sisterhood&quot;. As they approached marriage, they wrote Nüshu wedding texts, also known as &quot;sanshaoshu&quot;, to the bride. Even after marriage, they kept in touch through letters.

=== &quot;Su kelian&quot; ===
&quot;Su kelian&quot; () is a genre of writing that &quot;gave voice to Jiangyong peasant women&#x27;s existence as vulnerable beings&quot;. To combat the feelings of powerlessness and helplessness, they turned to writing poetry. These feelings were often the subject of the poems written by the Nüshu women. By creating Nüshu, they were now able to communicate their emotions. Expressing their feelings through folk stories, songs, prayers, and more, gave women an outlet. The poems and songs are &quot;filled with examples of women&#x27;s hardships and misfortune&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
During the latter part of the 20th century, owing more to wider social, cultural and political changes than the narrow fact of greater Chinese character literacy, younger girls and women stopped learning Nüshu, and it began falling into disuse, as older users died. The script was suppressed by the Japanese during their invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s, because they feared that the Chinese could use it to send secret messages. Nüshu was further censored during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), where it was seen as occult.

It is no longer customary for women to learn Nüshu, and literacy in Nüshu is now limited to a few scholars who learned it from the last women who were literate in it. However, after Yang Yueqing made a documentary about Nüshu, the Chinese government started to popularise the effort to preserve the increasingly endangered script, and some younger women are beginning to learn it.

=== 21st century ===

Yang Huanyi, an inhabitant of Jiangyong and the last person proficient in this writing system, died on 20 September 2004, at the age of 98.

To preserve Nüshu as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, a Nüshu museum was established in 2002 and &quot;Nüshu transmitters&quot; were created in 2003. The language and locale has also attracted foreign investment for infrastructure surrounding possible tourist sites, including a $209,000 grant from the Ford Foundation in 2005 ($ in 2023) to build a Nüshu museum, originally scheduled to open in 2007. However, with the line of transmission now broken, there are fears that the features of the script are being distorted by the effort of marketing it for the tourist industry.

The title of a Nüshu transmitter is given to someone who is proficient in Nüshu writing and singing and needlework, knowledgeable on local customs, practices civil virtues, and loyal to the Center for Nüshu Cultural and Research Administration. As of 2010, they are paid a monthly stipend of ( in 2023) in exchange for creating Nüshu works for the government and providing free copies of Nüshu works to local authorities. While recent academic interest in Nüshu has allowed for efforts in its preservation, it comes with the loss of women&#x27;s agency over the presentation of their Nüshu works and their inability to directly control who the audience is.

== Works ==
A large number of the Nüshu works were . They were cloth-bound booklets created by &quot;laotong&quot;, &quot;jiebai&quot; and mothers—and given to their &quot;jiebai&quot; counterparts or daughters upon marriage. They wrote down songs in Nüshu, which were delivered on the third day after the young woman&#x27;s marriage. This way, they expressed their hopes for the woman&#x27;s happiness after leaving the village, and their sorrow for having to part with them.

Other works, including poems and lyrics, were handwoven into belts and straps or embroidered onto everyday items and clothing. Other types of Nüshu works included ballads, autobiographies, biographies, and prayers.

==Cultural influence==
As Nüshu was often practised in the private sphere, patriarchal ideas prevented it from being acknowledged in the public domain. These ideas deemed Nüshu irrelevant in the public world due to its perceived importance only being relevant in personal contexts while also asserting that culture in the public sphere was dominated by men. Contemporary artists have attempted to commemorate Nüshu through its translation. Yuen-yi Lo, a Hong Kong–Macau artist, uses drawings as a way to critique the modern separation between writing and drawing and translate the cultural practice of Nüshu into a visual art practice by and for women. Hong Kong based choreographer Helen Lai uses dance as a medium to critique the patriarchal media representation of Nüshu. She suggests that Nüshu is an innovative art form despite the media portrayal of it being a secret.

Chinese composer Tan Dun has created a multimedia symphony entitled &quot;Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women&quot; for harp, orchestra, and 13 microfilms. Tan Dun spent five years conducting field research in Hunan Province, documenting on film the various songs the women use to communicate. Those songs become a third dimension to his symphony, and are projected alongside the orchestra and harp soloist.

Lisa See describes the use of Nüshu among 19th-century women in &quot;Snow Flower and the Secret Fan&quot;.

==In Unicode==

Nüshu was encoded in &quot;The Unicode Standard&quot; in version 10.0 published in June 2017, as part of the Nushu block (U+1B170–U+1B2FF). 396 syllabograms are defined. In addition, an iteration mark for Nüshu is in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block.

<doc id="156766" wikidata="Q828812" url="?curid=156766" title="Professional development">
<text>Professional development, also known as professional education, is learning that leads to or emphasizes education in a specific professional career field or builds practical job applicable skills emphasizing praxis in addition to the transferable skills and theoretical academic knowledge found in traditional liberal arts and pure sciences education. It is used to earn or maintain professional credentials such as professional certifications or academic degrees through formal coursework at institutions known as professional schools, or attending conferences and informal learning opportunities to strengthen or gain new skills.

Professional education has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage. There is a variety of approaches to professional development or professional education, including consultation, coaching, communities of practice, lesson study, case study, capstone project, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.

== Participants ==
A wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, architects, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. Individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements. In the training of school staff in the United States, &quot;[t]he need for professional development ... came to the forefront in the 1960s&quot;. Many American states have professional development requirements for school teachers. For example, Arkansas teachers must complete 60 hours of documented professional development activities annually. Professional development credits are named differently from state to state. For example, teachers in Indiana are required to earn 90 Continuing Renewal Units (CRUs) per year; in Massachusetts, teachers need 150 Professional Development Points (PDPs); and in Georgia, teachers must earn 10 Professional Learning Units (PLUs). American and Canadian nurses, as well as those in the United Kingdom, have to participate in formal and informal professional development (earning credit based on attendance of education that has been accredited by a regulatory agency) in order to maintain professional registration.

==Approaches==
In a broad sense, professional development may include &quot;formal&quot; types of vocational education, typically post-secondary or poly-technical training leading to qualification or credential required to obtain or retain employment. Professional development may also come in the form of pre-service or in-service professional development programs. These programs may be formal, or informal, group or individualized. Individuals may pursue professional development independently, or programs may be offered by human resource departments. Professional development on the job may develop or enhance process skills, sometimes referred to as leadership skills, as well as task skills. Some examples for process skills are &#x27;effectiveness skills&#x27;, &#x27;team functioning skills&#x27;, and &#x27;systems thinking skills&#x27;.

Professional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences. Some examples of approaches to professional development include:
* Case Study Method – The case method is a teaching approach that consists in presenting the students with a case, putting them in the role of a decision maker facing a problem – See Case method.
* Consultation – to assist an individual or group of individuals to clarify and address immediate concerns by following a systematic problem-solving process.
* Coaching – to enhance a person&#x27;s competencies in a specific skill area by providing a process of observation, reflection, and action.
* Communities of Practice – to improve professional practice by engaging in shared inquiry and learning with people who have a common goal
* Lesson Study – to solve practical dilemmas related to intervention or instruction through participation with other professionals in systematically examining practice
* Mentoring – to promote an individual&#x27;s awareness and refinement of his or her own professional development by providing and recommending structured opportunities for reflection and observation
* Reflective Supervision – to support, develop, and ultimately evaluate the performance of employees through a process of inquiry that encourages their understanding and articulation of the rationale for their own practices
* Technical Assistance – to assist individuals and their organization to improve by offering resources and information, supporting networking and change efforts.

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on the future of work argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

==Initial==
Initial professional development (IPD) is defined as &quot;a period of development during which an individual acquires a level of competence necessary in order to operate as an autonomous professional&quot;. Professional associations may recognise the successful completion of IPD by the award of chartered or similar status. Examples of professional bodies that require IPD prior to the award of professional status are the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, the Institution of Structural Engineers, and the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health.

==Continuing==
Continuing professional development (CPD) or continuing professional education (CPE) is continuing education to maintain knowledge and skills. Most professions have CPD obligations. Examples are the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, American Academy of Financial Management, safety professionals with the International Institute of Risk &amp; Safety Management (IIRSM) or the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to continuing medical education or continuing legal education requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.

CPD authorities in the United Kingdom include the CPD Standards Office who work in partnership with the CPD Institute, and also the CPD Certification Service. For example, CPD by the Institute of Highway Engineers is approved by the CPD Standards Office, and CPD by the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation is approved by the CPD Certification Service.

A systematic review published in 2019 by the Campbell Collaboration found little evidence of the effectiveness of continuing professional development (CPD).

<doc id="156767" wikidata="Q1139661" url="?curid=156767" title="Queen Beatrix International Airport">
<text>Queen Beatrix International Airport (; ) is an international airport located in Oranjestad, in the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba . It has flight services to the United States, Canada, several countries in the Caribbean, the northern coastal countries of South America, as well as some parts of Europe, notably the Netherlands. It is named after Beatrix of the Netherlands, who was Queen of the Netherlands from 1980 to 2013.

==Overview==

The airport offers United States border preclearance facilities. Unlike other preclearance airports, the airport does not have special provisions for avoiding the traditional US domestic procedure of physically walking baggage through customs inspection. Thus, US-bound travelers must first check baggage, pass through Aruba immigration to formally exit Aruba, collect baggage, pass through US CBP preclearance immigration and customs inspection, recheck baggage, and head to their gates.

A terminal for private aircraft opened in 2007. The airport used to serve as the hub for bankrupt airline Air Aruba, which was for many years an international airline. Before Aruba&#x27;s separation from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 it was also one of three hubs for ALM Antillean Airlines as well as a home base for Tiara Air until 2016.

Since 2013 the airport is home to Aruba Airlines, a local airline. The airline has three Airbus A320 family aircraft and two Bombardier CRJ200. The main focus of Aruba Airlines is connecting the region through its hub.

==History==
In 1934, Manuel Viana launched a weekly mail and passenger service between Aruba and Curaçao, with A.J. Viccellio piloting Loening C-2H Air Yacht PJ-ZAA from a mud-flat runway. Commercial services were taken over by KLM from 24 December 1934. Later they were transferred to a graded runway known as the KLM field. KLM&#x27;s Snip, the PJ-AIS a Fokker tri-motor, ushered in the scheduled flying age in Aruba on 19 January 1935. Together with the KLM&#x27;s “Oriol”, the PJ-AIO, also a three-engine Fokker, they flew until 1946, after which they were scrapped.
On its bi-weekly Aruba-Curaçao operations, KLM transported 2,695 passengers on 471 flights.

During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force defending Caribbean shipping and the Panama Canal against German submarines. The airfield was renamed Dakota Field; the terminal facilities became Dakota Airport. Flying units assigned to the airfield were:

* 59th Bombardment Squadron (9th Bombardment Group) 14 January-24 September 1942 (A-20 Havoc)
* 12th Bombardment Squadron (25th Bombardment Group) 10 October 1942 – 23 November 1943 (B-18 Bolo)
* 22d Fighter Squadron (36th Fighter Group) 2 September 1942 – April 1943 (P-40 Warhawk)
* 32d Fighter Squadron (Antilles Air Command) 9 March 1943 – March 1944 (P-40 Warhawk)

On 22 October 1955, the airport was named after Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands during a royal visit. It was renamed in 1980 after her accession to the throne.

On 3 March 2021, American Airlines celebrated its 50 years flying to and from Aruba.

*On 13 January 2010, an Arkefly Boeing 767-300 (registration PH-AHQ), operating Flight 361 from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Queen Beatrix International Airport, declared an emergency after a man claimed to have a bomb on board. A struggle with the flight crew ensued, and the aircraft made an emergency landing at Shannon Airport, Ireland. Gardaí stormed the plane and arrested the man; he was taken to Shannon Garda police station. A passenger who had recently had surgery collapsed in the terminal while waiting for the continuation of the flight, and had to be taken to a local hospital. The replacement aircraft, PH-AHY, also a Boeing 767-300, continued the flight to Aruba.

<text>The African Renaissance is the concept that the African people shall overcome the current challenges confronting the continent and achieve cultural, scientific, and economic renewal. This concept was first articulated by Cheikh Anta Diop in a series of essays between 1946 and 1960, later collected in a book titled &quot;Towards the African Renaissance.&quot; Diop&#x27;s ideas were further popularized by former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki during his tenure as Deputy President, where the African Renaissance continues to play a key role in the post-apartheid intellectual agenda.

==Description==
The African Renaissance is a philosophical and political movement to end the violence, elitism, corruption, and poverty believed to plague the African continent, and to replace them with a more just and equitable order. For Noel Moukala, however, the African Renaissance cannot exist without first achieving African Unity.

Okumu compiled a list of perceived African traits that he believes are worthy of preservation and continuation. These include aspects of interpersonal relations, such as &quot;social inclusion, hospitality, and generous sharing,&quot; as well as attentive and perceptive listening. He additionally argues that social acceptance is not based on wealth, but on the basis of relationships to others.

==Origins==
As a student in Paris between 1946 and 1960, Senegalese historian Cheikh Anta Diop wrote a series of essays charting the development of Africa. Diop&#x27;s work was later seen as a blueprint for former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki. When giving his famous &quot;I Am an African&quot; speech at Cape Town, celebrating the adoption of a new Constitution of South Africa, Mbeki said:
I am born of a people who are heroes and heroines [...] Patient because history is on their side, these masses do not despair because today the weather is bad. Nor do they turn triumphalist when, tomorrow, the sun shines. [...] Whatever the circumstances they have lived through and because of that experience, they are determined to define for themselves who they are and who they should be.

In April 1997, Mbeki articulated the elements that comprise the African Renaissance: social cohesion, democracy, economic rebuilding and growth, and the establishment of Africa as a significant player in geopolitical affairs. Two months later, Vusi Maviembela, an advisor to Mbeki, wrote that the African Renaissance was the &quot;third moment&quot; in post-colonial Africa, following decolonization and the spread of democracy across the continent in the early 1990s. Deputy President Mbeki codified his beliefs, and the reforms that would comprise them, in the &quot;African Renaissance Statement&quot; given August 13, 1998.

In March 1998, United States President Bill Clinton visited Botswana, Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, and Uganda in a 12-day tour, which he proclaimed as the &quot;beginning of a new African renaissance&quot; following apartheid, colonialism, and the Cold War. While Clinton praised the continent&#x27;s increase in democratically elected governments, news outlets countered that many African leaders operated in one-party states. The outbreak of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War in May 1998 and Second Congo War in August 1998 led to further doubts of a peaceful future. By August 2000, the United States&#x27; National Intelligence Estimate argued that the movement had failed due to democratic backsliding, corruption, and disease outbreaks.

The weekend of September 28, 1998, some 470 participants attended the African Renaissance Conference in Johannesburg. The next year, a book titled &quot;African Renaissance&quot; was released, with thirty essays arranged under topics corresponding to the conference&#x27;s breakout sessions: &quot;culture and education, economic transformation, science and technology, transport and energy, moral renewal and African values, and media and telecommunications.&quot; Mbeki, the keynote speaker at the opening plenary session of the conference, wrote the book&#x27;s prologue.

Other figures associated with the African Renaissance and the new generation of African leaders are President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda.

==African Renaissance Institute==
On October 11, 1999, the African Renaissance Institute (ARI) was founded in Pretoria. Its initial focuses were on the development of African human resources, science and technology, agriculture, nutrition and health, culture, business, peace, and good governance. In his book &quot;The African Renaissance&quot;, Washington Aggrey Jalang&#x27;o Okumu wrote that,

&quot;The most important and primary role of the African Renaissance Institute now and in the coming years is to gather a critical mass of first-class African scientists and to give them large enough grants on a continuing basis, as well as sufficient infrastructure, to enable them to undertake meaningful problem-solving R&amp;D applied to industrial production that will lead to really important results of economic dimensions.&quot;

== Revival ==
The African Renaissance has been taken up as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent from 2015 to 2024, in which the Door of Return Initiative seeks to bring members of the African diaspora back to the continent. The initiative is spearheaded by the historical Maroon community of Accompong, Jamaica, in cooperation with Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe.

<doc id="156777" wikidata="Q741235" url="?curid=156777" title="Standard Template Library">
<text>The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library originally designed by Alexander Stepanov for the C++ programming language that influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library. It provides four components called &quot;algorithms&quot;, &quot;containers&quot;, &quot;functions&quot;, and &quot;iterators&quot;.

The STL provides a set of common classes for C++, such as containers and associative arrays, that can be used with any built-in type or user-defined type that supports some elementary operations (such as copying and assignment). STL algorithms are independent of containers, which significantly reduces the complexity of the library.

The STL achieves its results through the use of templates. This approach provides compile-time polymorphism that is often more efficient than traditional run-time polymorphism. Modern C++ compilers are tuned to minimize abstraction penalties arising from heavy use of the STL.

The STL was created as the first library of generic algorithms and data structures for C++, with four ideas in mind: generic programming, abstractness without loss of efficiency, the Von Neumann computation model, and value semantics.

The STL and the C++ Standard Library are two distinct entities.

== History ==
In November 1993 Alexander Stepanov presented a library based on generic programming to the ANSI/ISO committee for C++ standardization. The committee&#x27;s response was overwhelmingly favorable and led to a request from Andrew Koenig for a formal proposal in time for the March 1994 meeting. The committee had several requests for changes and extensions and the committee members met with Stepanov and Meng Lee to help work out the details. The requirements for the most significant extension (associative containers) had to be shown to be consistent by fully implementing them, a task Stepanov delegated to David Musser. A proposal received final approval at the July 1994 ANSI/ISO committee meeting. Subsequently, the Stepanov and Lee document 17 was incorporated into the ANSI/ISO C++ draft standard (1, parts of clauses 17 through 27).

The prospects for early widespread dissemination of the STL were considerably improved with Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s decision to make its implementation freely available on the Internet in August 1994. This implementation, developed by Stepanov, Lee, and Musser during the standardization process, became the basis of many implementations offered by compiler and library vendors today.

== Composition ==

=== Containers ===
The STL contains sequence containers and associative containers. The containers are objects that store data. The standard sequence containers include , , and . The standard associative containers are , , , , , , and . There are also &quot;container adaptors&quot; , , and , that are containers with specific interface, using other containers as implementation.

=== Iterators ===
The STL implements five different types of iterators. These are &quot;input iterators&quot; (that can only be used to read a sequence of values), &quot;output iterators&quot; (that can only be used to write a sequence of values), &quot;forward iterators&quot; (that can be read, written to, and move forward), &quot;bidirectional iterators&quot; (that are like forward iterators, but can also move backwards) and &quot;s&quot; (that can move freely any number of steps in one operation).

A fundamental STL concept is a &quot;range&quot; which is a pair of iterators that designate the beginning and end of the computation, and most of the library&#x27;s algorithmic templates that operate on data structures have interfaces that use ranges.

It is possible to have bidirectional iterators act like random-access iterators, so moving forward ten steps could be done by simply moving forward a step at a time a total of ten times. However, having distinct random-access iterators offers efficiency advantages. For example, a vector would have a random-access iterator, but a list only a bidirectional iterator.

Iterators are the major feature that allow the generality of the STL. For example, an algorithm to reverse a sequence can be implemented using bidirectional iterators, and then the same implementation can be used on lists, vectors and deques. User-created containers only have to provide an iterator that implements one of the five standard iterator interfaces, and all the algorithms provided in the STL can be used on the container.

This generality also comes at a price at times. For example, performing a search on an associative container such as a map or set can be much slower using iterators than by calling member functions offered by the container itself. This is because an associative container&#x27;s methods can take advantage of knowledge of the internal structure, which is opaque to algorithms using iterators.

=== Algorithms ===
A large number of algorithms to perform activities such as searching and sorting are provided in the STL, each implemented to require a certain level of iterator (and therefore will work on any container that provides an interface by iterators). Searching algorithms like and use binary search and like sorting algorithms require that the type of data must implement comparison operator or custom comparator function must be specified; such comparison operator or comparator function must guarantee strict weak ordering. Apart from these, algorithms are provided for making heap from a range of elements, generating lexicographically ordered permutations of a range of elements, merge sorted ranges and perform union, intersection, difference of sorted ranges.

=== Functions ===
The STL includes classes that overload the function call operator (). Instances of such classes are called functors or function objects. Functors allow the behavior of the associated function to be parameterized (e.g. through arguments passed to the functor&#x27;s constructor) and can be used to keep associated per-functor state information along with the function. Since both functors and function pointers can be invoked using the syntax of a function call, they are interchangeable as arguments to templates when the corresponding parameter only appears in function call contexts.

A particularly common type of functor is the predicate. For example, algorithms like take a unary predicate that operates on the elements of a sequence. Algorithms like sort, partial_sort, nth_element and all sorted containers use a binary predicate that must provide a strict weak ordering, that is, it must behave like a membership test on a transitive, non-reflexive and asymmetric binary relation. If none is supplied, these algorithms and containers use less by default, which in turn calls the less-than-operator &lt;.

== Criticisms ==
=== Quality of implementation of C++ compilers ===
The Quality of Implementation (QoI) of the C++ compiler has a large impact on usability of the STL (and templated code in general):
* Error messages involving templates tend to be very long and difficult to decipher. This problem has been considered so severe that a number of tools have been written that simplify and prettyprint STL-related error messages to make them more comprehensible.
* Careless use of templates can lead to code bloat. This has been countered with special techniques within STL implementations (e.g. using void* containers internally and other &quot;diet template&quot; techniques) and improving compilers&#x27; optimization techniques. However, this symptom is similar to naively manually copying a set of functions to work with a different type, in that both can be avoided with care and good technique.
* Template instantiation can increase compilation time and memory usage, in exchange for typically reducing runtime decision-making (e.g. via virtual functions). Until the compiler technology improves enough, this problem can be only partially eliminated by careful coding, avoiding certain idioms, and simply not using templates where they are not appropriate or where compile-time performance is prioritized.

=== Other issues ===
* Initialization of STL containers with constants within the source code is not as easy as data structures inherited from C (addressed in C++11 with initializer lists).
* STL containers are not intended to be used as base classes (their destructors are deliberately non-virtual); deriving from a container is a common mistake.
* The concept of iterators as implemented by the STL can be difficult to understand at first: for example, if a value pointed to by the iterator is deleted, the iterator itself is then no longer valid. This is a common source of errors. Most implementations of the STL provide a debug mode that is slower, but can locate such errors if used. A similar problem exists in other languages, for example Java. Ranges have been proposed as a safer, more flexible alternative to iterators.
* Certain iteration patterns such as callback enumeration APIs cannot be made to fit the STL model without the use of coroutines, which were outside the C++ standard until C++20.
* Compiler compliance does not guarantee that Allocator objects, used for memory management for containers, will work with state-dependent behavior. For example, a portable library can not define an allocator type that will pull memory from different pools using different allocator objects of that type. (Meyers, p. 50) (addressed in C++11).
* The set of algorithms is not complete: for example, the algorithm was left out, though it has been added in C++11.

<text>Hypochondriasis or hypochondria is a condition in which a person is excessively and unduly worried about having a serious illness. Hypochondria is an old concept whose meaning has repeatedly changed over its lifespan. It has been claimed that this debilitating condition results from an inaccurate perception of the condition of body or mind despite the absence of an actual medical diagnosis. An individual with hypochondriasis is known as a hypochondriac. Hypochondriacs become unduly alarmed about any physical or psychological symptoms they detect, no matter how minor the symptom may be, and are convinced that they have, or are about to be diagnosed with, a serious illness.

Often, hypochondria persists even after a physician has evaluated a person and reassured them that their concerns about symptoms do not have an underlying medical basis or, if there is a medical illness, their concerns are far in excess of what is appropriate for the level of disease. It is also referred to hypochondriaism which is the act of being in a hypochondriatic state, acute hypochondriaism. Many hypochondriacs focus on a particular symptom as the catalyst of their worrying, such as gastro-intestinal problems, palpitations, or muscle fatigue. To qualify for the diagnosis of hypochondria the symptoms must have been experienced for at least six months.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) classifies hypochondriasis as a mental and behavioral disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV-TR defined the disorder &quot;Hypochondriasis&quot; as a somatoform disorder and one study has shown it to affect about 3% of the visitors to primary care settings. The 2013 DSM-5 replaced the diagnosis of hypochondriasis with the diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder (75%) and illness anxiety disorder (25%).

Hypochondria is often characterized by fears that minor bodily or mental symptoms may indicate a serious illness, constant self-examination and self-diagnosis, and a preoccupation with one&#x27;s body. Many individuals with hypochondriasis express doubt and disbelief in the doctors&#x27; diagnosis, and report that doctors’ reassurance about an absence of a serious medical condition is unconvincing, or short-lasting. Additionally, many hypochondriacs experience elevated blood pressure, stress, and anxiety in the presence of doctors or while occupying a medical facility, a condition known as &quot;white coat syndrome&quot;. Many hypochondriacs require constant reassurance, either from doctors, family, or friends, and the disorder can become a debilitating challenge for the individual with hypochondriasis, as well as their family and friends. Some individuals with hypochondria completely avoid any reminder of illness, whereas others frequently visit medical facilities, sometimes obsessively. Some may never speak about it.

A research based on 41,190 people, and published in December 2023 by JAMA Psychiatry, found that people suffering from hypochondriasis had a five-year shorter life expectancy compared to those without symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Hypochondriasis is categorized as a somatic amplification disorder—a disorder of &quot;perception and cognition&quot;—that involves a hyper-vigilance of situation of the body or mind and a tendency to react to the initial perceptions in a negative manner that is further debilitating. Hypochondriasis manifests in many ways. Some people have numerous intrusive thoughts and physical sensations that push them to check with family, friends, and physicians. For example, a person who has a minor cough may think that they have tuberculosis. Or sounds produced by organs in the body, such as those made by the intestines, might be seen as a sign of a very serious illness to patients dealing with hypochondriasis.

Other people are so afraid of any reminder of illness that they will avoid medical professionals for a seemingly minor problem, sometimes to the point of becoming neglectful of their health when a serious condition may exist and go undiagnosed. Yet others live in despair and depression, certain that they have a life-threatening disease and no physician can help them. Some consider the disease as a punishment for past misdeeds.

Hypochondriasis is often accompanied by other psychological disorders. Bipolar disorder, clinical depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, and somatization disorder, 
panic disorder are the most common accompanying conditions in people with hypochondriasis, as well as a generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis at some point in their life.

Many people with hypochondriasis experience a cycle of intrusive thoughts followed by compulsive checking, which is very similar to the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, while people with hypochondriasis are afraid of having an illness, patients with OCD worry about getting an illness or of transmitting an illness to others. Although some people might have both, these are distinct conditions.

Patients with hypochondriasis often are not aware that depression and anxiety produce their own physical symptoms, and mistake these symptoms for manifestations of another mental or physical disorder or disease. For example, people with depression often experience changes in appetite and weight fluctuation, fatigue, decreased interest in sex, and motivation in life overall. Intense anxiety is associated with rapid heartbeat, palpitations, sweating, muscle tension, stomach discomfort, dizziness, shortness of breath, and numbness or tingling in certain parts of the body (hands, forehead, etc.).

If a person is ill with a medical disease such as diabetes or arthritis, there will often be psychological consequences, such as depression. Some even report being suicidal. In the same way, someone with psychological issues such as depression or anxiety will sometimes experience physical manifestations of these affective fluctuations, often in the form of medically unexplained symptoms. Common symptoms include headaches; abdominal, back, joint, rectal, or urinary pain; nausea; fever and/or night sweats; itching; diarrhea; dizziness; or balance problems. Many people with hypochondriasis accompanied by medically unexplained symptoms feel they are not understood by their physicians, and are frustrated by their doctors’ repeated failure to provide symptom relief.

==Cause==
The genetic contribution to hypochondriasis is probably moderate, with heritability estimates around 10–37%. Non-shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences that differ between twins in the same family) explain most of the variance in key components of the condition such as the fear of illness and disease conviction. In contrast, the contribution of shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences shared by twins in the same family) to hypochondriasis is approximately zero.

Although little is known about exactly which non-shared environmental factors typically contribute to causing hypochondriasis, certain factors such as exposure to illness-related information are widely believed to lead to short-term increases in health anxiety and to have contributed to hypochondriasis in individual cases. An excessive focus on minor health concerns and serious illness of the individual or a family member in childhood have also been implicated as potential causes of hypochondriasis. Underlying anxiety disorders, such as general anxiety disorder, also increases an individual&#x27;s risk.

In the media and on the Internet, articles, TV shows, and advertisements regarding serious illnesses such as cancer and multiple sclerosis often portray these diseases as being random, obscure, and somewhat inevitable. In the short term, inaccurate portrayal of risk and the identification of non-specific symptoms as signs of serious illness may contribute to exacerbating fear of illness. Major disease outbreaks or predicted pandemics can have similar effects.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that some individuals become hypochondriac after experiencing major medical diagnosis or death of a family member or friend. Similarly, when approaching the age of a parent&#x27;s premature death from disease, many otherwise healthy, happy individuals fall prey to hypochondria. These individuals believe they have the same disease that caused their parent&#x27;s death, sometimes causing panic attacks with corresponding symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
The ICD-10 defines hypochondriasis as follows:
:A. Either one of the following:
::* A persistent belief, of at least six months&#x27; duration, of the presence of a minimum of two serious physical diseases (of which at least one must be specifically named by the patient).
::* A persistent preoccupation with a presumed deformity or disfigurement (body dysmorphic disorder).

:B. Preoccupation with the belief and the symptoms causes persistent distress or interference with personal functioning in daily living and leads the patient to seek medical treatment or investigations (or equivalent help from local healers).

:C. Persistent refusal to accept medical advice that there is no adequate physical cause for the symptoms or physical abnormality, except for short periods of up to a few weeks at a time immediately after or during medical investigations.

:D. Most commonly used exclusion criteria: not occurring only during any of the schizophrenia and related disorders (F20–F29, particularly F22) or any of the mood disorders (F30–F39).

The DSM-IV defines hypochondriasis according to the following criteria:
:A. Preoccupation with fears of having, or the idea that one has, a serious disease based on the person&#x27;s misinterpretation of bodily symptoms.
:B. The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance.
:C. The belief in Criterion A is not of delusional intensity (as in Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type) and is not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance (as in Body Dysmorphic Disorder).
:D. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
:E. The duration of the disturbance is at least 6 months.
:F. The preoccupation is not better accounted for by Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, a Major Depressive Episode, Separation Anxiety, or another Somatoform Disorder.

In the fifth version of the DSM (DSM-5), most who met criteria for DSM-IV hypochondriasis instead meet criteria for a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) or illness anxiety disorder (IAD).

===Classification===
The classification of hypochondriasis in relation to other psychiatric disorders has long been a topic of scholarly debate and has differed widely between different diagnostic systems and influential publications.

In the case of the DSM, the first and second versions listed hypochondriasis as a neurosis, whereas the third and fourth versions listed hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The current version of the DSM (DSM-5) lists somatic symptom disorder (SSD) under the heading of &quot;somatic symptom and related disorders&quot;, and illness anxiety disorder (IAD) under both this heading and as an anxiety disorder.

The ICD-10, like the third and fourth versions of the DSM, lists hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The ICD-11, however, lists hypochondriasis under the heading of &quot;obsessive-compulsive or related disorders&quot;.

There are also numerous influential scientific publications that have argued for other classifications of hypochondriasis. Notably, since the early 1990s, it has become increasingly common to regard hypochondriasis as an anxiety disorder, and to refer to the condition as &quot;health anxiety&quot; or &quot;health related obsessive-compulsive disorder.&quot;

==Treatment==
Approximately 20 randomized controlled trials and numerous observational studies indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for hypochondriasis. Typically, about two-thirds of patients respond to treatment, and about 50% of patients achieve remission, i.e., no longer have hypochondriasis after treatment. The effect size, or magnitude of benefit, appears to be moderate to large. CBT for hypochondriasis and health anxiety may be offered in various formats, including as face-to-face individual or group therapy, via telephone, or as guided self-help with information conveyed via a self-help book or online treatment platform. Effects are typically sustained over time.

There is also evidence that antidepressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can reduce symptoms. In some cases, hypochondriasis responds well to antipsychotics, particularly the newer atypical antipsychotic medications.

==Etymology==
Among the regions of the abdomen, the hypochondrium is the uppermost part. The word derives from the Greek term ὑποχόνδριος &quot;hypokhondrios&quot;, meaning &quot;of the soft parts between the ribs and navel&quot; from ὑπό &quot;hypo&quot; (&quot;under&quot;) and χόνδρος &quot;khondros&quot;, or cartilage (of the sternum). &quot;Hypochondria&quot; in Late Latin meant &quot;the abdomen&quot;.

The term &quot;hypochondriasis&quot; for a state of disease without real cause reflected the ancient belief that the viscera of the hypochondria were the seat of melancholy and sources of the vapor that caused morbid feelings. Until the early 18th century, the term referred to a &quot;physical disease caused by imbalances in the region that was below your rib cage&quot; (i.e., of the stomach or digestive system). For example, Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; (1621) blamed it &quot;for everything from &#x27;too much spittle&#x27; to &#x27;rumbling in the guts.

Immanuel Kant discussed hypochondria in his 1798 book, &quot;Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&quot;, like this: The disease of the hypochondriac consists in this: that certain bodily sensations do not so much indicate a really existing disease in the body as rather merely excite apprehensions of its existence: and human nature is so constituted – a trait which the animal lacks – that it is able to strengthen or make permanent &quot;local impressions&quot; simply by paying attention to them, whereas an &quot;abstraction&quot; – whether produced on purpose or by other diverting occupations – lessens these impressions, or even effaces them altogether.

<doc id="156783" wikidata="Q129846" url="?curid=156783" title="Saint Basil's Cathedral">
<text>The Cathedral of Vasily the Blessed (), known in English as Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral, is an Orthodox church in Red Square of Moscow, and is one of the most popular cultural symbols of Russia. The building, now a museum, is officially known as the Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat, or Pokrovsky Cathedral. It was built from 1555 to 1561 on orders from Ivan the Terrible and commemorates the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan. Its completion, with its colours, was made in 1683. It was the city&#x27;s tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600.

The original building, known as &quot;Trinity Church&quot; and later &quot;Trinity Cathedral&quot;, contained eight chapels arranged around a ninth, central chapel dedicated to the Intercession; a tenth chapel was erected in 1588 over the grave of the venerated local saint Vasily (Basil). In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was perceived as the earthly symbol of the Heavenly City. Like all churches in Byzantine Christianity, the church was popularly known as the &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and served as an allegory of the Jerusalem Temple in the annual Palm Sunday parade attended by the Patriarch of Moscow and the Tsar.

The cathedral has nine domes (each one corresponding to a different church) and is shaped like the flame of a bonfire rising into the sky. Dmitry Shvidkovsky, in his book &quot;Russian Architecture and the West&quot;, states that &quot;it is like no other Russian building. Nothing similar can be found in the entire millennium of Byzantine tradition from the fifth to the fifteenth century ... a strangeness that astonishes by its unexpectedness, complexity and dazzling interleaving of the manifold details of its design.&quot; The cathedral foreshadowed the climax of Russian national architecture in the 17th century, and it is considered as a prime example of Russian Renaissance architecture. 

As part of the program of state atheism, the church was confiscated from the Russian Orthodox community as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s antireligious campaigns and has operated as a division of the State Historical Museum since 1928. It was completely secularized in 1929, and remains a federal property of the Russian Federation. The church has been part of the Moscow Kremlin and Red Square UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, weekly Orthodox Christian services with prayer to St. Basil have been restored since 1997.

== History ==

=== Construction under Ivan IV ===

The site of the church had been, historically, a busy marketplace between the St. Frol&#x27;s (later Saviour&#x27;s) Gate of the Moscow Kremlin and the outlying posad. The centre of the marketplace was marked by the Trinity Church, built of the same white stone as the Kremlin of Dmitry Donskoy (1366–68) and its cathedrals. Tsar Ivan IV marked every victory of the Russo-Kazan War by erecting a wooden memorial church next to the walls of Trinity Church; by the end of his Astrakhan campaign, it was shrouded within a cluster of seven wooden churches. According to the report in Nikon&#x27;s Chronicle, in the autumn of 1554 Ivan ordered the construction of the wooden Church of Intercession on the same site, &quot;on the moat&quot;. One year later, Ivan ordered the construction of a new stone cathedral on the site of Trinity Church to commemorate his campaigns. Dedication of a church to a military victory was &quot;a major innovation&quot; for Muscovy. The placement of the church outside the Kremlin walls was a political statement in favour of posad commoners and against hereditary boyars.

Contemporary commentators clearly identified the new building as Trinity Church, after its easternmost sanctuary; the status of &quot;katholikon&quot; (, &quot;&quot;, large assembly church) had not been bestowed on it yet:

The identity of the architect is unknown. Tradition held that the church was built by two architects, Barma and Postnik: the official Russian cultural heritage register lists &quot;Barma and Postnik Yakovlev&quot;. Researchers proposed that both names refer to the same person, Postnik Yakovlev or, alternatively, Ivan Yakovlevich Barma (Varfolomey). Legend held that Ivan blinded the architect so that he could not re-create the masterpiece elsewhere. Many historians are convinced that it is a myth, as the architect later participated in the construction of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow as well as in building the walls and towers of the Kazan Kremlin. Postnik Yakovlev remained active at least throughout the 1560s. This myth likely originated with Jerome Horsey&#x27;s account of Ivan III of Moscow having blinded the architect of the fortress of Ivangorod.

There is evidence that construction involved stonemasons from Pskov and German lands.

=== Development ===
==== 1583–1596 ====
The original Trinity Church burnt down in 1583 and was refitted by 1593. The ninth sanctuary, dedicated to Basil Fool for Christ (the 1460s–1552), was added in 1588 next to the north-eastern sanctuary of the Three Patriarchs. Another local fool, Ivan the Blessed, was buried on the church grounds in 1589; a sanctuary in his memory was established in 1672 inside the south-eastern arcade.

The vault of the Saint Basil Sanctuary serves as a reference point in evaluating the quality of Muscovite stonemasonry and engineering. As one of the first vaults of its type, it represents the average of engineering craft that peaked a decade later in the church of the Trinity in Khoroshovo (completed 1596). The craft was lost in the Time of Troubles; buildings from the first half of the 17th century lack the refinement of the late 16th century, compensating for poor construction skill with thicker walls and heavier vaults.

==== 1680–1683 ====

The second, and most significant, round of refitting and expansion took place in 1680–1683. The nine churches themselves retained their appearance, but additions to the ground-floor arcade and the first-floor platform were so profound that Nikolay Brunov rebuilt a composite church from an &quot;old&quot; building and an independent work that incorporated the &quot;new&quot; Trinity Church. What once was a group of nine independent churches on a common platform became a monolithic temple.

The formerly open ground-floor arcades were filled with brick walls; the new space housed altars from thirteen former wooden churches erected on the site of Ivan&#x27;s executions in Red Square. Wooden shelters above the first-floor platform and stairs (the cause of frequent fires) were rebuilt in brick, creating the present-day wrap-around galleries with tented roofs above the porches and vestibules.

The old detached belfry was demolished; its square basement was reused for a new belltower. The tall single tented roof of this belltower, built in the vernacular style of the reign of Alexis I, significantly changed the appearance of the cathedral, adding a strong asymmetrical counterweight to the church itself. The effect is most pronounced on the southern and eastern facades (as viewed from Zaryadye), although the belltower is large enough to be seen from the west.

The first ornamental murals in the cathedral appeared in the same period, starting with floral ornaments inside the new galleries; the towers retained their original brickwork pattern. Finally, in 1683, the church was adorned with a tiled cornice in yellow and blue, featuring a written history of the church in Old Slavic typeface.

==== 1737–1784 ====
In 1737, the church was damaged by a massive fire and later restored by Ivan Michurin. The inscriptions made in 1683 were removed during the repairs of 1761–1784. The church received its first figurative murals inside the churches; all exterior and interior walls of the first two floors were covered with floral ornamentation. The belltower was connected with the church through a ground-floor annex; the last remaining open arches of the former ground-floor arcade were filled during the same period, erasing the last hint of what was once an open platform carrying the nine churches of Ivan&#x27;s Jerusalem.

==== 1800–1848 ====
Paintings of Red Square by Fyodor Alekseyev, made in 1800–1802, show that by this time the church was enclosed in an apparently chaotic cluster of commercial buildings; rows of shops &quot;transformed Red Square into an oblong and closed yard.&quot; In 1800 the space between the Kremlin wall and the church was still occupied by a moat that predated the church itself. The moat was filled in preparation for the coronation of Alexander I in 1801. The French troops who occupied Moscow in 1812 used the church for stables and looted anything worth taking. The church was spared by the Fire of Moscow (1812) that razed Kitai-gorod, and by the troops&#x27; failure to blow it up according to Napoleon&#x27;s order. The interiors were repaired in 1813 and the exterior in 1816. Instead of replacing missing ceramic tiles of the main tent, the Church preferred to simply cover it with a tin roof.

The fate of the immediate environment of the church has been a subject of dispute between city planners since 1813. Scotsman William Hastie proposed clearing the space around all sides of the church and all the way down to the Moskva River; the official commission led by Fyodor Rostopchin and Mikhail Tsitsianov agreed to clear only the space between the church and Lobnoye Mesto. Hastie&#x27;s plan could have radically transformed the city, but he lost to the opposition, whose plans were finally endorsed by Alexander I in December 1817 (the specific decision on clearing the rubble around the church was issued in 1816).

Nevertheless, actual redevelopment by Joseph Bove resulted in clearing the rubble and creating Vasilyevskaya (St. Basil&#x27;s) Square between the church and Kremlin wall by shaving off the crest of the Kremlin Hill between the church and the Moskva River. Red Square was opened to the river, and &quot;St. Basil thus crowned the decapitated hillock.&quot; Bove built the stone terrace wall separating the church from the pavement of Moskvoretskaya Street; the southern side of the terrace was completed in 1834. Minor repairs continued until 1848, when the domes acquired their present-day colours.

==== 1890–1914 ====
Preservationist societies monitored the state of the church and called for a proper restoration throughout the 1880s and 1890s, but it was regularly delayed for lack of funds. The church did not have a congregation of its own and could only rely on donations raised through public campaigning; national authorities in Saint Petersburg and local in Moscow prevented financing from state and municipal budgets. In 1899 Nicholas II reluctantly admitted that this expense was necessary, but again all the involved state and municipal offices, including the Holy Synod, denied financing. Restoration, headed by Andrey Pavlinov (died 1898) and Sergey Solovyov, dragged on from 1896 to 1909; in total, preservationists managed to raise around 100,000 roubles.

Restoration began with replacing the roofing of the domes. Solovyov removed the tin roofing of the main tent installed in the 1810s and found many original tiles missing and others discoloured; after a protracted debate the whole set of tiles on the tented roof was replaced with new ones. Another dubious decision allowed the use of standard bricks that were smaller than the original 16th-century ones. Restorers agreed that the paintwork of the 19th century must be replaced with a &quot;truthful recreation&quot; of historic patterns, but these had to be reconstructed and deduced based on medieval miniatures. In the end, Solovyov and his advisers chose a combination of deep red with deep green that is retained to the present.
In 1908 the church received its first warm air heating system, which did not work well because of heat losses in long air ducts, heating only the eastern and northern sanctuaries. In 1913 it was complemented with a pumped water heating system serving the rest of the church.

==== 1918–1941 ====

During World War I, the church was headed by protoiereus Ioann Vostorgov, a nationalist preacher and a leader of the Black-Hundredist Union of the Russian People. Vostorgov was arrested by Bolsheviks in 1918 on a pretext of embezzling nationalized church properties and was executed in 1919. The church briefly enjoyed Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;personal interest&quot;; in 1923 it became a public museum, though religious services continued until 1929.

Bolshevik planners entertained ideas of demolishing the church after Lenin&#x27;s funeral (January 1924). In the first half of the 1930s, the church became an obstacle for Joseph Stalin&#x27;s urbanist plans, carried out by Moscow party boss Lazar Kaganovich, &quot;the moving spirit behind the reconstruction of the capital&quot;. The conflict between preservationists, notably Pyotr Baranovsky, and the administration continued at least until 1936 and spawned urban legends. In particular, a frequently-told story is that Kaganovich picked up a model of the church in the process of envisioning Red Square without it, and Stalin sharply responded &quot;Lazar, put it back!&quot; Similarly, Stalin&#x27;s master planner, architect Vladimir Semyonov, reputedly dared to &quot;grab Stalin&#x27;s elbow when the leader picked up a model of the church to see how Red Square would look without it&quot; and was replaced by pure functionary Sergey Chernyshov.

In the autumn of 1933, the church was struck from the heritage register. Baranovsky was summoned to perform a last-minute survey of the church slated for demolition, and was then arrested for his objections. While he served his term in the Gulag, attitudes changed and by 1937 even hard-line Bolshevik planners admitted that the church should be spared. In the spring of 1939, the church was locked, probably because demolition was again on the agenda; however, the 1941 publication of Dmitry Sukhov&#x27;s detailed book on the survey of the church in 1939–1940 speaks against this assumption.

==== 1947 to present ====

In the first years after World War II, renovators restored the historical ground-floor arcades and pillars that supported the first-floor platform, cleared up vaulted and caissoned ceilings in the galleries, and removed &quot;unhistoric&quot; 19th-century oil paint murals inside the churches. Another round of repairs, led by Nikolay Sobolev in 1954–1955, restored original paint imitating brickwork, and allowed restorers to dig inside old masonry, revealing the wooden frame inside it. In the 1960s, the tin roofing of the domes was replaced with copper.

The last round of renovation was completed in September 2008 with the opening of the restored sanctuary of St. Alexander Svirsky. The building is still partly in use today as a museum and, since 1991, is occasionally used for services by the Russian Orthodox Church. Since 1997, Orthodox Christian services have been held regularly. Nowadays, every Sunday at Saint Basil&#x27;s church, there is a divine liturgy at 10a.m. with an Akathist to Saint Basil.

== Architectural style ==
Because the church has no analog—in the preceding, contemporary, or later architecture of Muscovy and Byzantine cultural tradition, in general,—the sources that inspired Barma and Postnik are disputed. Eugène Viollet-le-Duc rejected European roots for the cathedral, opining that its corbel arches were Byzantine and ultimately Asian. A modern &quot;Asian&quot; hypothesis considers the cathedral a recreation of Qolşärif Mosque, which was destroyed by Russian troops after the Siege of Kazan.

Nineteenth-century Russian writers, starting with Ivan Zabelin, emphasized the influence of the vernacular wooden churches of the Russian North; their motifs made their ways into masonry, particularly the votive churches that did not need to house substantial . David Watkin also wrote of a blend of Russian and Byzantine roots, calling the cathedral &quot;the climax&quot; of Russian vernacular wooden architecture.

The church combines the staggered layered design of the earliest (1505–1508) part of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, the central tent of the Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye (1530s), and the cylindric shape of the Church of Beheading of John the Baptist in Dyakovo (1547); but the origin of these unique buildings is equally debated. The Church in Kolomenskoye, according to Sergei Podyapolsky, was built by Italian Petrok Maly, although mainstream history has not yet accepted his opinion. Andrey Batalov revised the year of completion of Dyakovo church from 1547 to the 1560s–70s, and noted that Trinity Church could have had no tangible predecessors at all.

 Dmitry Shvidkovsky suggested that the &quot;improbable&quot; shapes of the Intercession Church and the Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye manifested an emerging national renaissance, blending earlier Muscovite elements with the influence of Italian Renaissance. A large group of Italian architects and craftsmen continuously worked in Moscow in 1474–1539, as well as Greek refugees who arrived in the city after the fall of Constantinople. These two groups, according to Shvidkovsky, helped Moscow rulers in forging the doctrine of Third Rome, which in turn promoted assimilation of contemporary Greek and Italian culture. Shvidkovsky noted the resemblance of the cathedral&#x27;s floorplan to Italian concepts by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Donato Bramante, but most likely Filarete&#x27;s &quot;Trattato di architettura&quot;. Other Russian researchers noted a resemblance to sketches by Leonardo da Vinci, although he could not have been known in Ivan&#x27;s Moscow. Nikolay Brunov recognized the influence of these prototypes but not their significance; he suggested that mid-16th century Moscow already had local architects trained in Italian tradition, architectural drawing and perspective, and that this culture was lost during the Time of Troubles.

Andrey Batalov wrote that judging by the number of novel elements introduced with Trinity Church, it was most likely built by German craftsmen. Batalov and Shvidkovsky noted that during Ivan&#x27;s reign, Germans and Englishmen replaced Italians, although German influence peaked later during the reign of Mikhail Romanov. German influence is indirectly supported by the rusticated pilasters of the central church, a feature more common in contemporary Northern Europe than in Italy.

The 1983 academic edition of &quot;Monuments of Architecture in Moscow&quot; takes the middle ground: the church is, most likely, a product of the complex interaction of distinct Russian traditions of wooden and stone architecture, with some elements borrowed from the works of Italians in Moscow. Specifically, the style of brickwork in the vaults is Italian.

== Layout ==

Instead of following the original ad hoc layout (seven churches around the central core), Ivan&#x27;s architects opted for a more symmetrical floor plan with &quot;eight&quot; side churches around the core, producing &quot;a thoroughly coherent, logical plan&quot; despite the erroneous latter &quot;notion of a structure devoid of restraint or reason&quot; influenced by the memory of Ivan&#x27;s irrational atrocities. The central core and the four larger churches placed on the four major compass points are octagonal; the four diagonally placed smaller churches are cuboid, although their shape is hardly visible through later additions. The larger churches stand on massive foundations, while the smaller ones were each placed on a raised platform as if hovering above ground.

Although the side churches are arranged in perfect symmetry, the cathedral as a whole is not. The larger central church was deliberately offset to the west from the geometric centre of the side churches, to accommodate its larger apse on the eastern side. As a result of this subtle calculated asymmetry, viewing from the north and the south presents a complex multi-axial shape, while the western façade, facing the Kremlin, appears properly symmetrical and monolithic. The latter perception is reinforced by the fortress-style machicolation and corbeled cornice of the western Church of Entry into Jerusalem, mirroring the real fortifications of the Kremlin.

Inside the composite church is a labyrinth of narrow vaulted corridors and vertical cylinders of the churches. Today the cathedral consists of nine individual chapels. The largest, central one, the Church of the Intercession, is tall internally but has a floor area of only . Nevertheless, it is wider and airier than the church in Kolomenskoye with its exceptionally thick walls. The corridors functioned as internal parvises; the western corridor, adorned with a unique flat caissoned ceiling, doubled as the narthex.

The detached belfry of the original Trinity Church stood southwest or south of the main structure. Late 16th- and early 17th-century plans depict a simple structure with three roof tents, most likely covered with sheet metal. No buildings of this type survive to date, although it was then common and used in all of the pass-through towers of Skorodom. August von Meyenberg&#x27;s panorama (1661) presents a different building, with a cluster of small onion domes.

== Structure ==
The foundations, as was traditional in medieval Moscow, were built of white stone, while the churches themselves were built of red brick (), then a relatively new material (the first attested brick building in Moscow, the new Kremlin Wall, was started in 1485). Surveys of the structure show that the basement level is perfectly aligned, indicating use of professional drawing and measurement, but each subsequent level becomes less and less regular. Restorers who replaced parts of the brickwork in 1954–1955 discovered that the massive brick walls conceal an internal wooden frame running the entire height of the church. This frame, made of elaborately tied thin studs, was erected as a life-size spatial model of the future cathedral and was then gradually enclosed in solid masonry.

The builders, fascinated by the flexibility of the new technology, used red bricks as a decorative medium both inside and out, leaving as much brickwork open as possible; when location required the use of stone walls, it was decorated with a brickwork pattern painted over stucco. A major novelty introduced by the church was the use of strictly &quot;architectural&quot; means of exterior decoration. Sculpture and sacred symbols employed by earlier Russian architecture are completely missing; floral ornaments are a later addition. Instead, the church boasts a diversity of three-dimensional architectural elements executed in brick.

== Colour ==
The church acquired its present-day vivid colours in several stages from the 1680s to 1848. Russian attitude towards colour in the 17th century changed in favour of bright colours; iconographic and mural art experienced an explosive growth in the number of available paints, dyes and their combinations. The original colour scheme, missing these innovations, was far less challenging. It followed the depiction of the Heavenly City in the Book of Revelation:

The 25 seats from the biblical reference are alluded to in the building&#x27;s structure, with the addition of eight small onion domes around the central tent, four around the western side church and four elsewhere. This arrangement survived through most of the 17th century. The walls of the church mixed bare red brickwork or painted imitation of bricks with white ornaments, in roughly equal proportion. The domes, covered with tin, were uniformly gilded, creating an overall bright but fairly traditional combination of white, red and golden colours. Moderate use of green and blue ceramic inserts provided a touch of rainbow as prescribed by the Bible.

While historians agree on the colour of the 16th-century domes, their shape is disputed. Boris Eding wrote that they most likely were of the same onion shape as the present-day domes. However, both Kolomenskoye and Dyakovo churches have flattened hemispherical domes, and the same type could have been used by Barma and Postnik.

== Naming ==
The building, originally known as &quot;Trinity Church&quot;, was consecrated on 12 July 1561, and was subsequently elevated to the status of a &quot;sobor&quot; (similar to an ecclesiastical basilica in the Catholic Church, but usually and incorrectly translated as &quot;cathedral&quot;). &quot;Trinity&quot;, according to tradition, refers to the easternmost sanctuary of the Holy Trinity, while the central sanctuary of the church is dedicated to the Intercession of Mary. Together with the westernmost sanctuary of the Entry into Jerusalem, these sanctuaries form the main east–west axis (Christ, Mary, Holy Trinity), while other sanctuaries are dedicated to individual saints.

The name &quot;Intercession Church&quot; came into use later, coexisting with Trinity Church. From the end of the 16th century to the end of the 17th century the cathedral was also popularly called Jerusalem, with reference to its church of Entry into Jerusalem as well as to its sacral role in religious rituals. Finally, the name of Vasily (Basil) the Blessed, who died during construction and was buried on-site, was attached to the church at the beginning of the 17th century.

Current Russian tradition accepts two coexisting names of the church: the official &quot;Church of Intercession on the Moat&quot; (in full, the &quot;Church of Intercession of Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat&quot;), and the &quot;Temple of Basil the Blessed&quot;. When these names are listed together the latter name, being informal, is always mentioned second.

The common Western translations &quot;Cathedral of Basil the Blessed&quot; and &quot;Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral&quot; incorrectly bestow the status of cathedral on the church of Basil, but are nevertheless widely used even in academic literature. Especially during the 19. century, in English and other languages the Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral was also called (Cathedral or Church of) Vassili Blagennoi.

== Sacral and social role ==
=== Miraculous find ===
On the day of its consecration the church itself became part of Orthodox thaumaturgy. According to the legend, its &quot;missing&quot; ninth church (more precisely a sanctuary) was &quot;miraculously found&quot; during a ceremony attended by Tsar Ivan IV, Metropolitan Makarius with the divine intervention of Saint Tikhon. Piskaryov&#x27;s Chronist wrote in the second quarter of the 17th century:

=== Allegory of Jerusalem ===
Construction of wrap-around ground-floor arcades in the 1680s visually united the nine churches of the original cathedral into a single building. Earlier, the clergy and the public perceived it as nine distinct churches on a common base, a generalized allegory of the Orthodox Heavenly City similar to fantastic cities of medieval miniatures. At a distance, separate churches towering over their base resembled the towers and churches of a distant citadel rising above the defensive wall. The abstract allegory was reinforced by real-life religious rituals where the church played the role of the biblical Temple in Jerusalem:

The last donkey walk () took place in 1693. noted that &quot;all&quot; cross processions of the period began, as described by Petreius, from the Dormition Church, passed through St. Frol&#x27;s (Saviour&#x27;s) Gate and ended at Trinity Cathedral. For these processions the Kremlin itself became an open-air temple, properly oriented from its &quot;narthex&quot; (Cathedral Square) in the west, through the &quot;royal doors&quot; (Saviour&#x27;s Gate), to the &quot;sanctuary&quot; (Trinity Cathedral) in the east.

=== Urban hub ===
Tradition calls the Kremlin the centre of Moscow, but the geometric centre of the Garden Ring, first established as the Skorodom defensive wall in the 1590s, lies outside the Kremlin wall, coincident with the cathedral. Pyotr Goldenberg (1902–71), who popularized this notion in 1947, still regarded the Kremlin as the starting seed of Moscow&#x27;s radial-concentric system, despite Alexander Chayanov&#x27;s earlier suggestion that the system was not strictly concentric at all.

In the 1960s Gennady Mokeev (born 1932) formulated a different concept of the historical growth of Moscow. According to Mokeev, medieval Moscow, constrained by the natural boundaries of the Moskva and Neglinnaya Rivers, grew primarily in a north-easterly direction into the posad of Kitai-gorod and beyond. The main road connecting the Kremlin to Kitai-gorod passed through St. Frol&#x27;s (Saviour&#x27;s) Gate and immediately afterwards fanned out into at least two radial streets (present-day Ilyinka and Varvarka), forming the central market square. In the 14th century the city was largely contained within two balancing halves, Kremlin and Kitai-gorod, separated by a marketplace, but by the end of the century it extended further along the north-eastern axis. Two secondary hubs in the west and south spawned their own street networks, but their development lagged behind until the Time of Troubles.

Tsar Ivan&#x27;s decision to build the church next to St. Frol&#x27;s Gate established the dominance of the eastern hub with a major vertical accent, and inserted a pivot point between the nearly equal Kremlin and Kitai-gorod into the once amorphous marketplace. The cathedral was the main church of the posad, and at the same time it was perceived as a part of the Kremlin thrust into the posad, a personal messenger of the Tsar reaching the masses without the mediation of the boyars and clergy. It was complemented by the nearby Lobnoye mesto, a rostrum for the Tsar&#x27;s public announcements first mentioned in chronicles in 1547 and rebuilt in stone in 1597–1598. Conrad Bussow, describing the triumph of False Dmitriy I, wrote that on 3 June 1606 &quot;a few thousand men hastily assembled and followed the boyarin with [the impostor&#x27;s] letter through the whole Moscow to the main church they call Jerusalem that stands right next to the Kremlin gates, raised him on Lobnoye Mesto, called out for the Muscovites, read the letter and listened to the boyarin&#x27;s oral explanation.&quot;

<doc id="156787" wikidata="Q190873" url="?curid=156787" title="Desalination">
<text>Desalination is a process that removes mineral components from saline water. More generally, desalination is the removal of salts and minerals from a substance. One example is soil desalination. This is important for agriculture. It is possible to desalinate saltwater, especially sea water, to produce water for human consumption or irrigation. The by-product of the desalination process is brine. Many seagoing ships and submarines use desalination. Modern interest in desalination mostly focuses on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use. Along with recycled wastewater, it is one of the few water resources independent of rainfall.

Due to its energy consumption, desalinating sea water is generally more costly than fresh water from surface water or groundwater, water recycling and water conservation; however, these alternatives are not always available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide. Desalination processes are using either thermal methods (in the case of distillation) or membrane-based methods (e.g. in the case of reverse osmosis).

An estimate in 2018 found that &quot;18,426 desalination plants are in operation in over 150 countries. They produce 87 million cubic meters of clean water each day and supply over 300 million people.&quot; The energy intensity has improved: It is now about 3 kWh/m3 (in 2018), down by a factor of 10 from 20–30 kWh/m3 in 1970. Nevertheless, desalination represented about 25% of the energy consumed by the water sector in 2016.

==History==

Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle observed in his work &quot;Meteorology&quot; that &quot;salt water, when it turns into vapour, becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses&quot;, and that a fine wax vessel would hold potable water after being submerged long enough in seawater, having acted as a membrane to filter the salt. 

At the same time the desalination of seawater was recorded in China. Both the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Water Seas&quot; in the Period of the Warring States and the &quot;Theory of the Same Year&quot; in the Eastern Han Dynasty mentioned that people found that the bamboo mats used for steaming rice would form a thin outer layer after long use. The as-formed thin film had adsorption and ion exchange functions, which could adsorb salt.

Numerous examples of experimentation in desalination appeared throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, but desalination became feasible on a large scale only in the modern era. A good example of this experimentation comes from Leonardo da Vinci (Florence, 1452), who realized that distilled water could be made cheaply in large quantities by adapting a still to a cookstove. During the Middle Ages elsewhere in Central Europe, work continued on distillation refinements, although not necessarily directed towards desalination.

The first major land-based desalination plant may have been installed under emergency conditions on an island off the coast of Tunisia in 1560. It is believed that a garrison of 700 Spanish soldiers was besieged by the Turkish army and that, during the siege, the captain in charge fabricated a still capable of producing 40 barrels of fresh water per day, though details of the device have not been reported.

Before the Industrial Revolution, desalination was primarily of concern to oceangoing ships, which otherwise needed to keep on board supplies of fresh water. Sir Richard Hawkins (1562–1622), who made extensive travels in the South Seas, reported that he had been able to supply his men with fresh water by means of shipboard distillation. Additionally, during the early 1600s, several prominent figures of the era such as Francis Bacon and Walter Raleigh published reports on desalination. These reports and others, set the climate for the first patent dispute concerning desalination apparatus. The two first patents regarding water desalination were approved in 1675 and 1683 (patents No. 184 and No. 226, published by William Walcot and Robert Fitzgerald (and others), respectively). Nevertheless, neither of the two inventions entered service as a consequence of scale-up difficulties. No significant improvements to the basic seawater distillation process were made during the 150 years from the mid-1600s until 1800.

When the frigate &quot;Protector&quot; was sold to Denmark in the 1780s (as the ship &quot;Hussaren&quot;) its still was studied and recorded in great detail. In the United States, Thomas Jefferson catalogued heat-based methods going back to the 1500s, and formulated practical advice that was publicized to all U.S. ships on the reverse side of sailing clearance permits.

Beginning about 1800, things started changing as a consequence of the appearance of the steam engine and the so-called age of steam. Knowledge of the thermodynamics of steam processes and the need for a pure water source for its use in boilers generated a positive effect regarding distilling systems. Additionally, the spread of European colonialism induced a need for freshwater in remote parts of the world, thus creating the appropriate climate for water desalination.

In parallel with the development and improvement of systems using steam (multiple-effect evaporators), these type of devices quickly demonstrated their desalination potential. In 1852, was issued a British patent for a vertical tube seawater distilling unit that, thanks to its simplicity of design and ease of construction, gained popularity for shipboard use. Land-based units did not significantly appear until the latter half of the nineteenth century. In the 1860s, the US Army purchased three Normandy evaporators, each rated at 7000 gallons/day and installed them on the islands of Key West and Dry Tortugas. Another land-based plant was installed at Suakin during the 1880s that provided freshwater to the British troops there. It consisted of six-effect distillers with a capacity of 350 tons/day.

After World War II, many technologies were developed or improved such as Multi Effect Flash desalination (MEF) and Multi Stage Flash desalination (MSF). Another notable technology is freeze-thaw desalination. Freeze-thaw desalination, (cryo-desalination or FD), excludes dissolved minerals from saline water through crystallization.

The Office of Saline Water was created in the United States Department of the Interior in 1955 in accordance with the Saline Water Conversion Act of 1952. This act was motivated by a water shortage in California and inland western United States. The Department of the Interior allocated resources including research grants, expert personnel, patent data, and land for experiments to further advancements. 

The results of these efforts included the construction of over 200 electrodialysis and distillation plants globally, reverse osmosis (RO) research, and international cooperation (for example, the First International Water Desalination Symposium and Exposition in 1965). The Office of Saline Water merged into the Office of Water Resources Research in 1974.

The first industrial desalination plant in the United States opened in Freeport, Texas in 1961 after a decade of regional drought. 

By the late 1960s and the early 1970s, RO started to show promising results to replace traditional thermal desalination units. Research took place at state universities in California, at the Dow Chemical Company and DuPont. Many studies focus on ways to optimize desalination systems. The first commercial RO plant, the Coalinga desalination plant, was inaugurated in California in 1965 for brackish water. Dr. Sidney Loeb, in conjunction with staff at UCLA, designed a large pilot plant to gather data on RO, but was successful enough to provide freshwater to the residents of Coalinga. This was a milestone in desalination technology, as it proved the feasibility of RO and its advantages compared to existing technologies (efficiency, no phase change required, ambient temperature operation, scalability, and ease of standardization). A few years later, in 1975, the first sea water reverse osmosis desalination plant came into operation.

As of 2000, more than 2000 plants were operated. The largest are in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the UAE; and the biggest plant with a volume of 1,401,000 m3/d is in Saudi Arabia (Ras Al Khair).

As of 2021 22,000 plants were in operation In 2024 the Catalan government installed a floating offshore plant near the port of Barcelona and purchased 12 mobile desalination units for the northern region of the Costa Brava to combat the severe drought.

In 2012, cost averaged $0.75 per cubic meter. By 2022, that had declined (before inflation) to $0.41. Desalinated supplies are growing at a 10%+ compound rate, doubling in abundance every seven years.

==Applications==


There are now about 21,000 desalination plants in operation around the globe. The biggest ones are in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. The world&#x27;s largest desalination plant is located in Saudi Arabia (Ras Al-Khair Power and Desalination Plant) with a capacity of 1,401,000 cubic meters per day.

Desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water, and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination. It is usually only economically practical for high-valued uses (such as household and industrial uses) in arid areas. However, there is growth in desalination for agricultural use and highly populated areas such as Singapore or California. The most extensive use is in the Persian Gulf.

While noting costs are falling, and generally positive about the technology for affluent areas in proximity to oceans, a 2005 study argued, &quot;Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation. Unfortunately, that includes some of the places with the biggest water problems.&quot;, and, &quot;Indeed, one needs to lift the water by 2000 m, or transport it over more than 1600 km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs.&quot;

Thus, it may be more economical to transport fresh water from somewhere else than to desalinate it. In places far from the sea, like New Delhi, or in high places, like Mexico City, transport costs could match desalination costs. Desalinated water is also expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as Riyadh and Harare. By contrast in other locations transport costs are much less, such as Beijing, Bangkok, Zaragoza, Phoenix, and, of course, coastal cities like Tripoli. After desalination at Jubail, Saudi Arabia, water is pumped 320 km inland to Riyadh. For coastal cities, desalination is increasingly viewed as a competitive choice.

In 2023, Israel was using desalination to replenish the Sea of Galilee&#x27;s water supply.

Not everyone is convinced that desalination is or will be economically viable or environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future. Debbie Cook wrote in 2011 that desalination plants can be energy intensive and costly. Therefore, water-stressed regions might do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than invest in desalination plants.

==Technologies==

Desalination is an artificial process by which saline water (generally sea water) is converted to fresh water. The most common desalination processes are distillation and reverse osmosis.

There are several methods. Each has advantages and disadvantages but all are useful. The methods can be divided into membrane-based (e.g., reverse osmosis) and thermal-based (e.g., multistage flash distillation) methods. The traditional process of desalination is distillation (i.e., boiling and re-condensation of seawater to leave salt and impurities behind).

There are currently two technologies with a large majority of the world&#x27;s desalination capacity: multi-stage flash distillation and reverse osmosis.

=== Distillation ===

====Solar distillation====
Solar distillation mimics the natural water cycle, in which the sun heats sea water enough for evaporation to occur. After evaporation, the water vapor is condensed onto a cool surface. There are two types of solar desalination. The first type uses photovoltaic cells to convert solar energy to electrical energy to power desalination. The second type converts solar energy to heat, and is known as solar thermal powered desalination.

====Natural evaporation====
Water can evaporate through several other physical effects besides solar irradiation. These effects have been included in a multidisciplinary desalination methodology in the IBTS Greenhouse. The IBTS is an industrial desalination (power)plant on one side and a greenhouse operating with the natural water cycle (scaled down 1:10) on the other side. The various processes of evaporation and condensation are hosted in low-tech utilities, partly underground and the architectural shape of the building itself. This integrated biotectural system is most suitable for large scale desert greening as it has a km2 footprint for the water distillation and the same for landscape transformation in desert greening, respectively the regeneration of natural fresh water cycles.

====Vacuum distillation====
In vacuum distillation atmospheric pressure is reduced, thus lowering the temperature required to evaporate the water. Liquids boil when the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature. Effectively, liquids boil at a lower temperature, when the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than usual atmospheric pressure. Thus, because of the reduced pressure, low-temperature &quot;waste&quot; heat from electrical power generation or industrial processes can be employed.

====Multi-stage flash distillation====
Water is evaporated and separated from sea water through multi-stage flash distillation, which is a series of flash evaporations. Each subsequent flash process uses energy released from the condensation of the water vapor from the previous step.

====Multiple-effect distillation====
Multiple-effect distillation (MED) works through a series of steps called &quot;effects&quot;. Incoming water is sprayed onto pipes which are then heated to generate steam. The steam is then used to heat the next batch of incoming sea water. To increase efficiency, the steam used to heat the sea water can be taken from nearby power plants. Although this method is the most thermodynamically efficient among methods powered by heat, a few limitations exist such as a max temperature and max number of effects.

====Vapor-compression distillation====
Vapor-compression evaporation involves using either a mechanical compressor or a jet stream to compress the vapor present above the liquid. The compressed vapor is then used to provide the heat needed for the evaporation of the rest of the sea water. Since this system only requires power, it is more cost effective if kept at a small scale.

==== Membrane distillation ====
Membrane distillation uses a temperature difference across a membrane to evaporate vapor from a brine solution and condense pure water on the colder side. The design of the membrane can have a significant effect on efficiency and durability. A study found that a membrane created via co-axial electrospinning of PVDF-HFP and silica aerogel was able to filter 99.99% of salt after continuous 30-day usage.

=== Osmosis ===

====Reverse osmosis====

The leading process for desalination in terms of installed capacity and yearly growth is reverse osmosis (RO). The RO membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied pressure (on the membrane feed side) to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts. Reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes. Energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity, plant size and process type. At present the cost of seawater desalination, for example, is higher than traditional water sources, but it is expected that costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include, but are not limited to, improved efficiency, reduction in plant footprint, improvements to plant operation and optimization, more effective feed pretreatment, and lower cost energy sources.

Reverse osmosis uses a thin-film composite membrane, which comprises an ultra-thin, aromatic polyamide thin-film. This polyamide film gives the membrane its transport properties, whereas the remainder of the thin-film composite membrane provides mechanical support. The polyamide film is a dense, void-free polymer with a high surface area, allowing for its high water permeability. A recent study has found that the water permeability is primarily governed by the internal nanoscale mass distribution of the polyamide active layer.

The reverse osmosis process requires maintenance. Various factors interfere with efficiency: ionic contamination (calcium, magnesium etc.); dissolved organic carbon (DOC); bacteria; viruses; colloids and insoluble particulates; biofouling and scaling. In extreme cases, the RO membranes are destroyed. To mitigate damage, various pretreatment stages are introduced. Anti-scaling inhibitors include acids and other agents such as the organic polymers polyacrylamide and polymaleic acid, phosphonates and polyphosphates. Inhibitors for fouling are biocides (as oxidants against bacteria and viruses), such as chlorine, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite. At regular intervals, depending on the membrane contamination; fluctuating seawater conditions; or when prompted by monitoring processes, the membranes need to be cleaned, known as emergency or shock-flushing. Flushing is done with inhibitors in a fresh water solution and the system must go offline. This procedure is environmentally risky, since contaminated water is diverted into the ocean without treatment. Sensitive marine habitats can be irreversibly damaged.

Off-grid solar-powered desalination units use solar energy to fill a buffer tank on a hill with seawater. The reverse osmosis process receives its pressurized seawater feed in non-sunlight hours by gravity, resulting in sustainable drinking water production without the need for fossil fuels, an electricity grid or batteries. Nano-tubes are also used for the same function (i.e., Reverse Osmosis).

==== Forward osmosis ====
Forward osmosis uses a semi-permeable membrane to effect separation of water from dissolved solutes. The driving force for this separation is an osmotic pressure gradient, such as a &quot;draw&quot; solution of high concentration.

=== Freeze–thaw ===
Freeze–thaw desalination (or freezing desalination) uses freezing to remove fresh water from salt water. Salt water is sprayed during freezing conditions into a pad where an ice-pile builds up. When seasonal conditions warm, naturally desalinated melt water is recovered. This technique relies on extended periods of natural sub-freezing conditions.

A different freeze–thaw method, not weather dependent and invented by Alexander Zarchin, freezes seawater in a vacuum. Under vacuum conditions the ice, desalinated, is melted and diverted for collection and the salt is collected.

===Electrodialysis===
Electrodialysis uses electric potential to move the salts through pairs of charged membranes, which trap salt in alternating channels. Several variances of electrodialysis exist such as conventional electrodialysis, electrodialysis reversal.

Electrodialysis can simultaneously remove salt and carbonic acid from seawater. Preliminary estimates suggest that the cost of such carbon removal can be paid for in large part if not entirely from the sale of the desalinated water produced as a byproduct.

=== Microbial desalination ===

Microbial desalination cells are biological electrochemical systems that implements the use of electro-active bacteria to power desalination of water in situ, resourcing the natural anode and cathode gradient of the electro-active bacteria and thus creating an internal supercapacitor.

=== Wave-powered desalination ===
Wave powered desalination systems generally convert mechanical wave motion directly to hydraulic power for reverse osmosis. Such systems aim to maximize efficiency and reduce costs by avoiding conversion to electricity, minimizing excess pressurization above the osmotic pressure, and innovating on hydraulic and wave power components.
One such approach is desalinating using submerged buoys, a wave power approach done by CETO and Oneka. Wave-powered desalination plants began operating by CETO on Garden Island in Western Australia in 2013 and in Perth in 2015, and Oneka has installations in Chile, Florida, California, and the Caribbean.

=== Wind-powered desalination ===
Wind energy can also be coupled to desalination. Similar to wave power, a direct conversion of mechanical energy to hydraulic power can reduce components and losses in powering reverse osmosis. Wind power has also been considered for coupling with thermal desalination technologies.

=== Desalination by thermophoresis ===
In April 2024, researchers from the Australian National University published experimental results of a novel technique for desalination. This technique, thermodiffusive desalination, passes saline water through a channel that is exposed to a temperature gradient. Due to thermophoresis, species migrate under this temperature gradient, orthogonal to the fluid flow. Researchers then separated the water into fractions. After multiple passes through the channel, the researchers were able to achieve a NaCl concentration drop of 25000 ppm with a recovery rate of 10% of the original water volume.

==Design aspects==

===Energy consumption===
The desalination process&#x27;s energy consumption depends on the water&#x27;s salinity. Brackish water desalination requires less energy than seawater desalination.

The energy intensity of seawater desalination has improved: It is now about 3 kWh/m3 (in 2018), down by a factor of 10 from 20-30 kWh/m3 in 1970. This is similar to the energy consumption of other freshwater supplies transported over large distances, but much higher than local fresh water supplies that use 0.2 kWh/m3 or less.

A minimum energy consumption for seawater desalination of around 1 kWh/m3 has been determined, excluding prefiltering and intake/outfall pumping. Under 2 kWh/m3 has been achieved with reverse osmosis membrane technology, leaving limited scope for further energy reductions as the reverse osmosis energy consumption in the 1970s was 16 kWh/m3.

Supplying all US domestic water by desalination would increase domestic energy consumption by around 10%, about the amount of energy used by domestic refrigerators. Domestic consumption is a relatively small fraction of the total water usage.
Note: &quot;Electrical equivalent&quot; refers to the amount of electrical energy that could be generated using a given quantity of thermal energy and an appropriate turbine generator. These calculations do not include the energy required to construct or refurbish items consumed.

Given the energy-intensive nature of desalination and the associated economic and environmental costs, desalination is generally considered a last resort after water conservation. But this is changing as prices continue to fall.

===Cogeneration===
Cogeneration is generating useful heat energy and electricity from a single process. Cogeneration can provide usable heat for desalination in an integrated, or &quot;dual-purpose&quot;, facility where a power plant provides the energy for desalination. Alternatively, the facility&#x27;s energy production may be dedicated to the production of potable water (a stand-alone facility), or excess energy may be produced and incorporated into the energy grid. Cogeneration takes various forms, and theoretically any form of energy production could be used. However, the majority of current and planned cogeneration desalination plants use either fossil fuels or nuclear power as their source of energy. Most plants are located in the Middle East or North Africa, which use their petroleum resources to offset limited water resources. The advantage of dual-purpose facilities is they can be more efficient in energy consumption, thus making desalination more viable.
The current trend in dual-purpose facilities is hybrid configurations, in which the permeate from reverse osmosis desalination is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination. Basically, two or more desalination processes are combined along with power production. Such facilities have been implemented in Saudi Arabia at Jeddah and Yanbu.

A typical supercarrier in the US military is capable of using nuclear power to desalinate of water per day.

===Alternatives to desalination===
Increased water conservation and efficiency remain the most cost-effective approaches in areas with a large potential to improve the efficiency of water use practices. Wastewater reclamation provides multiple benefits over desalination of saline water, although it typically uses desalination membranes. Urban runoff and storm water capture also provide benefits in treating, restoring and recharging groundwater.

A proposed alternative to desalination in the American Southwest is the commercial importation of bulk water from water-rich areas either by oil tankers converted to water carriers, or pipelines. The idea is politically unpopular in Canada, where governments imposed trade barriers to bulk water exports as a result of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) claim.

The California Department of Water Resources and the California State Water Resources Control Board submitted a report to the state legislature recommending that urban water suppliers achieve an indoor water use efficiency standard of per capita per day by 2023, declining to per day by 2025, and by 2030 and beyond.

==Costs==

Factors that determine the costs for desalination include capacity and type of facility, location, feed water, labor, energy, financing, and concentrate disposal. Costs of desalinating sea water (infrastructure, energy, and maintenance) are generally higher than fresh water from rivers or groundwater, water recycling, and water conservation, but alternatives are only sometimes available. Desalination costs in 2013 ranged from US$0.45 to US$1.00/m3. More than half of the cost comes directly from energy costs, and since energy prices are very volatile, actual costs can vary substantially.

The cost of untreated fresh water in the developing world can reach US$5/cubic metre.

Since 1975, desalination technology has seen significant advancements, decreasing the average cost of producing one cubic meter of freshwater from seawater from $1.10 in 2000 to approximately $0.50 today. Improved desalination efficiency is a primary factor contributing to this reduction. Energy consumption remains a significant cost component, accounting for up to half the total cost of the desalination process.

Desalination can substantially increase energy intensity, particularly for regions with limited energy resources. For instance, in the island nation of Cyprus, desalination accounts for approximately 5% of the country&#x27;s total power consumption.

The global desalination market was valued at $20 billion in 2023. With growing populations in arid coastal regions, this market is projected to double by 2032. In 2023, global desalination capacity reached 99 million cubic meters per day, a significant increase from 27 million cubic meters per day in 2003.


Desalination stills control pressure, temperature and brine concentrations to optimize efficiency. Nuclear-powered desalination might be economical on a large scale.

In 2014, the Israeli facilities of Hadera, Palmahim, Ashkelon, and Sorek were desalinizing water for less than US$0.40 per cubic meter. As of 2006, Singapore was desalinating water for US$0.49 per cubic meter.

==Environmental concerns==
===Intake===
In the United States, cooling water intake structures are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These structures can have the same impacts on the environment as desalination facility intakes. According to EPA, water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by sucking fish and shellfish or their eggs into an industrial system. There, the organisms may be killed or injured by heat, physical stress, or chemicals. Larger organisms may be killed or injured when they become trapped against screens at the front of an intake structure. Alternative intake types that mitigate these impacts include beach wells, but they require more energy and higher costs.

The Kwinana Desalination Plant opened in the Australian city of Perth, in 2007. Water there and at Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast Desalination Plant and Sydney&#x27;s Kurnell Desalination Plant is withdrawn at , which is slow enough to let fish escape. The plant provides nearly of clean water per day.

===Outflow===

Desalination processes produce large quantities of brine, possibly at above ambient temperature, and contain residues of pretreatment and cleaning chemicals, their reaction byproducts and heavy metals due to corrosion (especially in thermal-based plants). Chemical pretreatment and cleaning are a necessity in most desalination plants, which typically includes prevention of biofouling, scaling, foaming and corrosion in thermal plants, and of biofouling, suspended solids and scale deposits in membrane plants.

To limit the environmental impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant&#x27;s cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution. Furthermore, zero liquid discharge systems can be adopted to treat brine before disposal.

Another possibility is making the desalination plant movable, thus avoiding that the brine builds up into a single location (as it keeps being produced by the desalination plant). Some such movable (ship-connected) desalination plants have been constructed.

Brine is denser than seawater and therefore sinks to the ocean bottom and can damage the ecosystem. Brine plumes have been seen to diminish over time to a diluted concentration, to where there was little to no effect on the surrounding environment. However studies have shown the dilution can be misleading due to the depth at which it occurred. If the dilution was observed during the summer season, there is possibility that there could have been a seasonal thermocline event that could have prevented the concentrated brine to sink to sea floor. This has the potential to not disrupt the sea floor ecosystem and instead the waters above it. Brine dispersal from the desalination plants has been seen to travel several kilometers away, meaning that it has the potential to cause harm to ecosystems far away from the plants. Careful reintroduction with appropriate measures and environmental studies can minimize this problem.

=== Energy use ===
The energy demand for desalination in the Middle East, driven by severe water scarcity, is expected to double by 2030. Currently, this process primarily uses fossil fuels, comprising over 95% of its energy source. In 2023, desalination consumed nearly half of the residential sector&#x27;s energy in the region.

===Other issues===
Due to the nature of the process, there is a need to place the plants on approximately 25 acres of land on or near the shoreline. In the case of a plant built inland, pipes have to be laid into the ground to allow for easy intake and outtake. However, once the pipes are laid into the ground, they have a possibility of leaking into and contaminating nearby aquifers. Aside from environmental risks, the noise generated by certain types of desalination plants can be loud.

==Health aspects==

=== Iodine deficiency ===
Desalination removes iodine from water and could increase the risk of iodine deficiency disorders. Israeli researchers claimed a possible link between seawater desalination and iodine deficiency, finding iodine deficits among adults exposed to iodine-poor water concurrently with an increasing proportion of their area&#x27;s drinking water from seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO). They later found probable iodine deficiency disorders in a population reliant on desalinated seawater.
A possible link of heavy desalinated water use and national iodine deficiency was suggested by Israeli researchers. They found a high burden of iodine deficiency in the general population of Israel: 62% of school-age children and 85% of pregnant women fall below the WHO&#x27;s adequacy range. They also pointed out the national reliance on iodine-depleted desalinated water, the absence of a universal salt iodization program and reports of increased use of thyroid medication in Israel as a possible reasons that the population&#x27;s iodine intake is low. In the year that the survey was conducted, the amount of water produced from the desalination plants constitutes about 50% of the quantity of fresh water supplied for all needs and about 80% of the water supplied for domestic and industrial needs in Israel.

==Experimental techniques==
Other desalination techniques include:

===Waste heat===
Thermally-driven desalination technologies are frequently suggested for use with low-temperature waste heat sources, as the low temperatures are not useful for process heat needed in many industrial processes, but ideal for the lower temperatures needed for desalination. In fact, such pairing with waste heat can even improve electrical process:
Diesel generators commonly provide electricity in remote areas. About 40–50% of the energy output is low-grade heat that leaves the engine via the exhaust. Connecting a thermal desalination technology such as membrane distillation system to the diesel engine exhaust repurposes this low-grade heat for desalination. The system actively cools the diesel generator, improving its efficiency and increasing its electricity output. This results in an energy-neutral desalination solution. An example plant was commissioned by Dutch company Aquaver in March 2014 for Gulhi, Maldives.

===Low-temperature thermal===
Originally stemming from ocean thermal energy conversion research, low-temperature thermal desalination (LTTD) takes advantage of water boiling at low pressure, even at ambient temperature. The system uses pumps to create a low-pressure, low-temperature environment in which water boils at a temperature gradient of between two volumes of water. Cool ocean water is supplied from depths of up to . This water is pumped through coils to condense the water vapor. The resulting condensate is purified water. LTTD may take advantage of the temperature gradient available at power plants, where large quantities of warm wastewater are discharged from the plant, reducing the energy input needed to create a temperature gradient.

Experiments were conducted in the US and Japan to test the approach. In Japan, a spray-flash evaporation system was tested by Saga University. In Hawaii, the National Energy Laboratory tested an open-cycle OTEC plant with fresh water and power production using a temperature difference of between surface water and water at a depth of around . LTTD was studied by India&#x27;s National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) in 2004. Their first LTTD plant opened in 2005 at Kavaratti in the Lakshadweep islands. The plant&#x27;s capacity is /day, at a capital cost of INR 50 million (€922,000). The plant uses deep water at a temperature of . In 2007, NIOT opened an experimental, floating LTTD plant off the coast of Chennai, with a capacity of /day. A smaller plant was established in 2009 at the North Chennai Thermal Power Station to prove the LTTD application where power plant cooling water is available.

===Thermoionic process===
In October 2009, Saltworks Technologies announced a process that uses solar or other thermal heat to drive an ionic current that removes all sodium and chlorine ions from the water using ion-exchange membranes.

===Evaporation and condensation for crops===
The Seawater greenhouse uses natural evaporation and condensation processes inside a greenhouse powered by solar energy to grow crops in arid coastal land.

=== Ion concentration polarisation (ICP) ===
In 2022, using a technique that used multiple stages of ion concentration polarisation followed by a single stage of electrodialysis, researchers from MIT manage to create a filterless portable desalination unit, capable of removing both dissolved salts and suspended solids. Designed for use by non-experts in remote areas or natural disasters, as well as on military operations, the prototype is the size of a suitcase, measuring 42 × 33.5 × 19 cm3 and weighing 9.25 kg. The process is fully automated, notifying the user when the water is safe to drink, and can be controlled by a single button or smartphone app. As it does not require a high pressure pump the process is highly energy efficient, consuming only 20 watt-hours per liter of drinking water produced, making it capable of being powered by common portable solar panels. Using a filterless design at low pressures or replaceable filters significantly reduces maintenance requirements, while the device itself is self cleaning. However, the device is limited to producing 0.33 liters of drinking water per minute. There are also concerns that fouling will impact the long-term reliability, especially in water with high turbidity. The researchers are working to increase the efficiency and production rate with the intent to commercialise the product in the future, however a significant limitation is the reliance on expensive materials in the current design.

===Other approaches===

Adsorption-based desalination (AD) relies on the moisture absorption properties of certain materials such as Silica Gel.

==== Forward osmosis ====
One process was commercialized by Modern Water PLC using forward osmosis, with a number of plants reported to be in operation.

==== Hydrogel based desalination ====

The idea of the method is in the fact that when the hydrogel is put into contact with aqueous salt solution, it swells absorbing a solution with the ion composition different from the original one. This solution can be easily squeezed out from the gel by means of sieve or microfiltration membrane. The compression of the gel in closed system lead to change in salt concentration, whereas the compression in open system, while the gel is exchanging ions with bulk, lead to the change in the number of ions. The consequence of the compression and swelling in open and closed system conditions mimics the reverse Carnot Cycle of refrigerator machine. The only difference is that instead of heat this cycle transfers salt ions from the bulk of low salinity to a bulk of high salinity. Similarly to the Carnot cycle this cycle is fully reversible, so can in principle work with an ideal thermodynamic efficiency. Because the method is free from the use of osmotic membranes it can compete with reverse osmosis method. In addition, unlike the reverse osmosis, the approach is not sensitive to the quality of feed water and its seasonal changes, and allows the production of water of any desired concentration.

==== Small-scale solar ====
The United States, France and the United Arab Emirates are working to develop practical solar desalination. AquaDania&#x27;s WaterStillar has been installed at Dahab, Egypt, and in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In this approach, a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres can distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source – five times more than conventional stills. It eliminates the need for plastic PET bottles or energy-consuming water transport. In Central California, a startup company WaterFX is developing a solar-powered method of desalination that can enable the use of local water, including runoff water that can be treated and used again. Salty groundwater in the region would be treated to become freshwater, and in areas near the ocean, seawater could be treated.

==== Passarell ====
The Passarell process uses reduced atmospheric pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination. The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber. The compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing the water in the tubes. Water vapor condenses on the outside of the tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system&#x27;s energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.

==== Geothermal ====
Geothermal energy can drive desalination. In most locations, geothermal desalination beats using scarce groundwater or surface water, environmentally and economically.

==== Nanotechnology ====
Nanotube membranes of higher permeability than current generation of membranes may lead to eventual reduction in the footprint of RO desalination plants. It has also been suggested that the use of such membranes will lead to reduction in the energy needed for desalination.

Hermetic, sulphonated nano-composite membranes have shown to be capable of removing various contaminants to the parts per billion level, and have little or no susceptibility to high salt concentration levels.

==== Biomimesis ====
Biomimetic membranes are another approach.

==== Electrochemical ====
In 2008, Siemens Water Technologies announced technology that applied electric fields to desalinate one cubic meter of water while using only a purported 1.5 kWh of energy. If accurate, this process would consume one-half the energy of other processes. As of 2012 a demonstration plant was operating in Singapore. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Marburg are developing more efficient methods of electrochemically mediated seawater desalination.

==== Electrokinetic shocks ====
A process employing electrokinetic shock waves can be used to accomplish membraneless desalination at ambient temperature and pressure. In this process, anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations, respectively using electrokinetic shockwaves. Calcium and carbonate ions react to form calcium carbonate, which precipitates, leaving fresh water. The theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with electrodialysis and reverse osmosis.

==== Temperature swing solvent extraction ====
Temperature Swing Solvent Extraction (TSSE) uses a solvent instead of a membrane or high temperatures.

Solvent extraction is a common technique in chemical engineering. It can be activated by low-grade heat (less than , which may not require active heating. In a study, TSSE removed up to 98.4 percent of the salt in brine. A solvent whose solubility varies with temperature is added to saltwater. At room temperature the solvent draws water molecules away from the salt. The water-laden solvent is then heated, causing the solvent to release the now salt-free water.

It can desalinate extremely salty brine up to seven times as salty as the ocean. For comparison, the current methods can only handle brine twice as salty.

==== Wave energy ====
A small-scale offshore system uses wave energy to desalinate 30–50 m3/day. The system operates with no external power, and is constructed of recycled plastic bottles.

== Plants ==
Trade Arabia claims Saudi Arabia to be producing 7.9 million cubic meters of desalinated water daily, or 22% of world total as of 2021 yearend.
* Perth began operating a reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant in 2006. The Perth desalination plant is powered partially by renewable energy from the Emu Downs Wind Farm.
* A desalination plant now operates in Sydney, and the Wonthaggi desalination plant was under construction in Wonthaggi, Victoria. A wind farm at Bungendore in New South Wales was purpose-built to generate enough renewable energy to offset the Sydney plant&#x27;s energy use, mitigating concerns about harmful greenhouse gas emissions.
* A January 17, 2008, article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated, &quot;In November, Connecticut-based Poseidon Resources Corp. won a key regulatory approval to build the $300 million water-desalination plant in Carlsbad, north of San Diego. The facility would produce 190,000 cubic metres of drinking water per day, enough to supply about 100,000 homes. As of June 2012, the cost for the desalinated water had risen to $2,329 per acre-foot. Each $1,000 per acre-foot works out to $3.06 for 1,000 gallons, or $0.81 per cubic meter.
As new technological innovations continue to reduce the capital cost of desalination, more countries are building desalination plants as a small element in addressing their water scarcity problems.
* Israel desalinizes water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter
* Singapore desalinizes water for 49 cents per cubic meter and also treats sewage with reverse osmosis for industrial and potable use (NEWater).
* China and India, the world&#x27;s two most populous countries, are turning to desalination to provide a small part of their water needs
* In 2007 Pakistan announced plans to use desalination
* All Australian capital cities (except Canberra, Darwin, Northern Territory and Hobart) are either in the process of building desalination plants, or are already using them. In late 2011, Melbourne will begin using Australia&#x27;s largest desalination plant, the Wonthaggi desalination plant to raise low reservoir levels.
* In 2007 Bermuda signed a contract to purchase a desalination plant
* Before 2015, the largest desalination plant in the United States was at Tampa Bay, Florida, which began desalinizing 25 million gallons (95000 m3) of water per day in December 2007. In the United States, the cost of desalination is $3.06 for 1,000 gallons, or 81 cents per cubic meter. In the United States, California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida use desalination for a very small part of their water supply. Since 2015, the Claude &quot;Bud&quot; Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant has been producing 50 million gallons of drinking water daily.
* After being desalinized at Jubail, Saudi Arabia, water is pumped inland though a pipeline to the capital city of Riyadh.

As of 2008, &quot;World-wide, 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day, according to the International Desalination Association.&quot; An estimate in 2009 found that the worldwide desalinated water supply will triple between 2008 and 2020.

One of the world&#x27;s largest desalination hubs is the Jebel Ali Power Generation and Water Production Complex in the United Arab Emirates. It is a site featuring multiple plants using different desalination technologies and is capable of producing 2.2 million cubic meters of water per day.

A typical aircraft carrier in the U.S. military uses nuclear power to desalinize of water per day.

==In nature==

Evaporation of water over the oceans in the water cycle is a natural desalination process.

The formation of sea ice produces ice with little salt, much lower than in seawater.

Seabirds distill seawater using countercurrent exchange in a gland with a rete mirabile. The gland secretes highly concentrated brine stored near the nostrils above the beak. The bird then &quot;sneezes&quot; the brine out. As freshwater is not usually available in their environments, some seabirds, such as pelicans, petrels, albatrosses, gulls and terns, possess this gland, which allows them to drink the salty water from their environments while they are far from land.

Mangrove trees grow in seawater; they secrete salt by trapping it in parts of the root, which are then eaten by animals (usually crabs). Additional salt is removed by storing it in leaves that fall off. Some types of mangroves have glands on their leaves, which work in a similar way to the seabird desalination gland. Salt is extracted to the leaf exterior as small crystals, which then fall off the leaf.

Willow trees and reeds absorb salt and other contaminants, effectively desalinating the water. This is used in artificial constructed wetlands, for treating sewage.

==Society and culture==
Despite the issues associated with desalination processes, public support for its development can be very high. One survey of a Southern California community saw 71.9% of all respondents being in support of desalination plant development in their community. In many cases, high freshwater scarcity corresponds to higher public support for desalination development whereas areas with low water scarcity tend to have less public support for its development.

<doc id="156793" wikidata="Q2446652" url="?curid=156793" title="Tourism in Sweden">
<text>Tourism in Sweden comprised a relatively small part of the Swedish economy in 2011 at 2.9% of the country&#x27;s GDP; at this time, tourism generated 264 billion Swedish krona, 98.8 billion of which was foreign-visitor expenditure in Sweden. 7.1% of Swedish household income is spent on domestic tourism.

One well-known tourist route is via train from southern to northern Sweden, viewing historical, natural and cultural attractions. This route is particularly popular among German tourists.

According to the CIA World Factbook, Sweden was the 21st most-visited country in the world, with 7,627,000 arrivals in 2006.

== Swedish culture ==

Sweden has a number of World Heritage Sites, which are popular as tourist destinations. These include:

* The agricultural landscape of the island of Öland, visited for its geological and geographical features
* Birka and Hovgården on the islands Björkö and Adelsö in Mälaren near Stockholm
* The church village of Gammelstad, Luleå, in northern Sweden
* Drottningholm Palace, Theatre, and the royal domain
* Engelsberg Ironworks
* The Hanseatic town of Visby
* The &quot;High Coast&quot; of Ångermanland
* Laponian area, Swedish Lapland, in northern Sweden
* The mining area of the Great Copper Mountain in Falun
* The naval port of Karlskrona
* Rock carvings in Tanumshede
* Skogskyrkogården in Stockholm

Swedish horse racing is an unusual attraction, in that many races are actually trotting races. The horses are not allowed to gallop; they pull a small vehicle ridden by the human racer.

== Swedish nature ==
Due to Sweden&#x27;s northern location, the summer sun sets for only short periods of time (not at all north of the Arctic Circle). This phenomenon allows outdoor activities later in the evening than usual.

Sweden has a large number of lakes and forests; the former are popular for fishing and canoeing. There are several large lakes, including lakes Vättern and Vänern. The Göta Canal from Stockholm to Gothenburg allows for trips in the summer.

Hiking is popular in the summer, both in the forested regions as well as in the alpine landscapes.

Mountain-hiking is limited to the northern and north-western parts of Sweden where a nearly 1000 km long and 50 to 200 km wide mountain range borders to Norway. In the south the Swedish mountains are generally high rolling hills with some occasional pointy peaks, while the middle and particularly northern parts of the range gradually exhibit a more dramatic nature. Sweden, and Scandinavia in general, lacks notably high peaks (the highest mountain in Sweden is Mt. Kebnekaise near Kiruna, which is high). Despite this, dramatic areas are found in several places, and the northernmost parts of the Swedish mountain range house a notably large and dramatic wild alpine region, known as Laponia area. This area includes world-famous mountain regions like the Sarek National Park and is sometimes referred to as &quot;Europe&#x27;s last wilderness&quot; or &quot;Europe&#x27;s Alaska&quot;. Covering about 9400 km2, the Laponia area is the largest wilderness in Europe with vast areas of untouched nature. This attracts many hikers each year, but visiting certain parts of the region requires experience since it is mostly roadless land with huge walking distances, uninhabited, and with a lack of cellphone reception in large parts.

Another popular area for Swedish mountain hiking is Kungsleden, or &quot;The King&#x27;s Trail&quot;. It is a 400 km long trail that reaches through nearly half the Swedish mountain range, from Abisko in the north, to Hemavan in the south. This hike does not require any extreme experience and staffed mountain huts with accommodation and small shops are located along the trail. It is said to be a great nature experience of world class, both for veterans as well as beginners.

== Northern Sweden and winter sports ==

In the winter, the Jukkasjärvi ice hotel is built every year near the northern town of Kiruna. Kiruna is also frequently used as a place from which to see the Aurora Borealis (Northern lights).

Tourists in Sweden&#x27;s north in the winter often take trips in reindeer sleighs with Sami drivers, in dog sleighs, or on snowmobiles. It is also possible to ski, with downhill resorts at Åre and Vemdalen, and there are many cross country ski tracks throughout northern Sweden. Vasaloppet (in the beginning of March) is the oldest, longest and largest cross-country ski race in the world. Ice hockey is a popular sport in the winter. Many of the bays in the northern part of the country are frozen in winter, and it is possible to go ice yachting or ice skating on the ice. Many lakes are also frozen, so ice fishing (&quot;pimpelfiske&quot;) is quite common.

== Cities and towns ==

Most cities and towns in Sweden are small compared to other European cities and towns. The largest city is Stockholm, with close to 900,000 inhabitants, followed by Gothenburg with 493,000 and Malmö with 270,000.

Stockholm has been Sweden&#x27;s capital since at least the 14th century. It is Sweden&#x27;s metropolis, the centre of the government and of the media. It has a waterfront adjacent to the Stockholm Archipelago; parts of Stockholm are preserved largely intact from older times.

Gothenburg is a relatively recently built city (dating from the 17th century). It is visited for its attractions and shopping opportunities.

Malmö has recently emerged in the eastern part of the Öresund Region, tied together with Copenhagen, Denmark, via the Öresund Bridge. During the last 15 years, Malmö has put more resources into culture; previously it had a reputation as a working class city. The twisted skyscraper Turning Torso and the main crane at the Kockums shipyard are landmarks, with the first being newer. Both Malmö and Gothenburg hosted the Uefa U21 European Championships during the summer of 2009. Malmö was also the host city of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 and 2024.

Uppsala was the political and religious centre of Viking Age Sweden. It became the seat of the Archbishop of Sweden in 1167, with Scandinavia&#x27;s largest church building Uppsala Cathedral inaugurated in the 1440s. In 1477 Uppsala University was founded as the first university in the Nordic countries, thus making Uppsala the center of education in Sweden.

Lund was part of Denmark until 1658, and had been the seat of Denmark&#x27;s archbishop. In 1666, Lund was granted Sweden&#x27;s second university, the Lund University; it is Scandinavia&#x27;s largest.

== Transportation ==
The Swedish rail system is called SJ; it has slower-speed trains throughout the country and faster X 2000 trains connecting the major cities. Connection by rail is possible to Norway and Denmark; connections to Finland are by bus, due to rail gauge differences. It&#x27;s possible to take Silja and Viking Line boats from Stockholm to Helsinki (Finland), Rostock (Germany) or Mariehamn on the Åland islands or the Wasaline ferry from Holmsund at Umeå to Vasa (Finland). The Scandinavian Airlines System and other airlines provides access by air for longer trips.

<text>Henry Archibald Hertzberg Lawson (17 June 1867 – 2 September 1922) was an Australian writer and bush poet. Along with his contemporary Banjo Paterson, Lawson is among the best-known Australian poets and fiction writers of the colonial period and is often called Australia&#x27;s &quot;greatest short story writer&quot;.

A vocal nationalist and republican, Lawson regularly contributed to &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, and many of his works helped popularise the Australian vernacular in fiction. He wrote prolifically into the 1890s, after which his output declined, in part due to struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. At times destitute, he spent periods in Darlinghurst Gaol and psychiatric institutions. After he died in 1922 following a cerebral haemorrhage, Lawson became the first Australian writer to be granted a state funeral.

He was the son of the poet, publisher and feminist Louisa Lawson.

== Family and early life ==

Henry Lawson was born 17 June 1867 in a town on the Grenfell goldfields of New South Wales. His father was Niels Hertzberg Larsen, a Norwegian-born miner. Niels Larsen went to sea at 21 and arrived in Melbourne in 1855 to join the gold rush, along with partner William Henry John Slee. Lawson&#x27;s parents met at the goldfields of Pipeclay (now Eurunderee, Locality Mudgee). Niels and Louisa Albury (1848–1920) married on 7 July 1866 when he was 32 and she 18. On Henry&#x27;s birth, the family surname was Anglicised and Niels became Peter Lawson. The newly married couple were to have an unhappy marriage. Louisa, after family-raising, took a significant part in women&#x27;s movements, and edited a women&#x27;s paper called &quot;The Dawn&quot; (published May 1888 to July 1905). She also published her son&#x27;s first volume, and around 1904 brought out a volume of her own, &quot;Dert and Do&quot;, a simple story of 18,000 words. In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, &quot;The Lonely Crossing and other Poems&quot;. Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son&#x27;s literary work in its earliest days. Peter Lawson&#x27;s grave (with headstone) is in the little private cemetery at Hartley Vale, New South Wales, a few minutes&#x27; walk behind what was Collitt&#x27;s Inn.

Lawson attended school at Eurunderee from 2 October 1876 but experienced an ear infection around this time. It left him with partial deafness and by the age of fourteen he had lost his hearing entirely. However, his master John Tierney was kind and did all he could for Lawson, who was quite shy. Lawson later attended a Catholic school at Mudgee, New South Wales around 8 km away; the master there, Mr Kevan, would teach Lawson about poetry. Lawson was a keen reader of Dickens and Marryat and Australian novels such as Marcus Clarke&#x27;s &quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot; (1874) and Rolf Boldrewood&#x27;s &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; (1882); an aunt had also given him a volume by Bret Harte. Reading became a major source of his education because, due to his deafness, he had trouble learning in the classroom.
In 1883, after working on building jobs with his father in the Blue Mountains, Lawson joined his mother in Sydney at her request. Louisa was then living with Henry&#x27;s sister and brother. At this time, Lawson was working during the day and studying at night for his matriculation in the hopes of receiving a university education. However, he failed his exams. Lawson lived in a boarding house along William Street and wrote a poem titled William Street. Lawson also spent time in Newcastle at the Wickham School of Arts while working for the Hudson Brothers branch railway workshops. He remarked that he &quot;haunted the School of Arts, still with an idea of learning before it was too late.&quot; At around 20 years of age Lawson went to the eye and ear hospital in Melbourne but nothing could be done for his deafness.

In 1890 he began a relationship with Mary Gilmore. She writes of an unofficial engagement and Lawson&#x27;s wish to marry her, but it was broken by his frequent absences from Sydney. The story of the relationship is told in Anne Brooksbank&#x27;s play &quot;All My Love&quot;.

In 1896, Lawson married Bertha Bredt, Jr., daughter of Bertha Bredt, the prominent socialist. The marriage ended very unhappily. Bertha filed for divorce and in her affidavit she stated: 

A judicial separation was granted and was declared in June 1903. They had two children, son Jim (Joseph) and daughter Bertha.

== Poetry and prose writing ==

Henry Lawson&#x27;s first published poem was &#x27;A Song of the Republic&#x27; which appeared in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, 1 October 1887; his mother&#x27;s republican friends were an influence. This was followed by &#x27;The Wreck of the Derry Castle&#x27; and then &#x27;Golden Gully.&#x27; Prefixed to the former poem was an editorial note:
Lawson was 20 years old, not 17.

In 1890-1891 Lawson worked in Albany. He then received an offer to write for the Brisbane &quot;Boomerang&quot; in 1891, but he lasted only around 7–8 months as the &quot;Boomerang&quot; was soon in trouble. While in Brisbane he contributed to William Lane&#x27;s Worker; he later angled for an editorial position with the similarly named &quot;Worker&quot; of Sydney, but was unsuccessful. He returned to Sydney and continued to write for the &quot;Bulletin&quot; which, in 1892, paid for an inland trip where he experienced the harsh realities of drought-affected New South Wales. He also worked as a roustabout in the woolshed at Toorale Station. This resulted in his contributions to the Bulletin Debate and became a source for many of his stories in subsequent years. Elder writes of the trek Lawson took between Hungerford and Bourke as &quot;the most important trek in Australian literary history&quot; and says that &quot;it confirmed all his prejudices about the Australian bush. Lawson had no romantic illusions about a &#x27;rural idyll&#x27;.&quot; As Elder continues, his grim view of the outback was far removed from &quot;the romantic idyll of brave horsemen and beautiful scenery depicted in the poetry of Banjo Paterson&quot;.

Lawson&#x27;s most successful prose collection is &quot;While the Billy Boils&quot;, published in 1896. In it he &quot;continued his assault on Paterson and the romantics, and in the process, virtually reinvented Australian realism&quot;. Elder writes that &quot;he used short, sharp sentences, with language as raw as Ernest Hemingway or Raymond Carver. With sparse adjectives and honed-to-the-bone description, Lawson created a style and defined Australians: dryly laconic, passionately egalitarian and deeply humane.&quot; Most of his work focuses on the Australian bush, such as the desolate &quot;Past Carin&#x27;&quot;, and is considered by some to be among the first accurate descriptions of Australian life as it was at the time. &quot;The Drover&#x27;s Wife&quot; with its &quot;heart-breaking depiction of bleakness and loneliness&quot; is regarded as one of his finest short stories. It is regularly studied in schools and has often been adapted for film and theatre.
Lawson was a firm believer in the merits of the sketch story, commonly known simply as &#x27;the sketch,&#x27; claiming that &quot;the sketch story is best of all.&quot; Lawson&#x27;s Jack Mitchell story &quot;On the Edge of a Plain&quot; is often cited as one of the most accomplished examples of the sketch.

Like the majority of Australians, Lawson lived in a city, but had had plenty of experience in outback life, in fact, many of his stories reflected his experiences in real life. In Sydney in 1898 he was a prominent member of the Dawn and Dusk Club, a bohemian club of writer friends who met for drinks and conversation.

== Later years ==
In 1903 he bought a room at Mrs Isabel Byers&#x27; Coffee Palace in North Sydney. This marked the beginning of a 20-year friendship between Mrs Byers and Lawson. Despite his position as the most celebrated Australian writer of the time, Lawson was deeply depressed and perpetually poor. He lacked money due to unfortunate royalty deals with publishers. His ex-wife repeatedly reported him for non-payment of child maintenance. He was gaoled at Darlinghurst Gaol for drunkenness, wife desertion, child desertion, and non-payment of child support seven times between 1905 and 1909, for a total of 159 days and recorded his experience in the haunting poem &quot;One Hundred and Three&quot; (his prison number) which was published in 1908. He refers to the prison as &quot;Starvinghurst Gaol&quot; because of the meagre rations given to the inmates.

At this time, Lawson became withdrawn, alcoholic, and unable to carry on the usual routine of life.
Mrs Byers (née Ward) was an excellent poet herself and, although of modest education, had been writing vivid poetry since her teens in a similar style to Lawson&#x27;s. Long separated from her husband and elderly, Mrs Byers was, at the time she met Lawson, a woman of independent means looking forward to retirement. Byers regarded Lawson as Australia&#x27;s greatest living poet, and hoped to sustain him well enough to keep him writing. She negotiated on his behalf with publishers, helped to arrange contact with his children, contacted friends and supporters to help him financially, and assisted and nursed him through his mental and alcohol problems. She wrote countless letters on his behalf and knocked on any doors that could provide Henry with financial assistance or a publishing deal.

It was in Mrs Isabel Byers&#x27; home that Henry Lawson died, of a cerebral hemorrhage, in Abbotsford, Sydney in 1922. He was given a state funeral. His death registration on the NSW Births, Deaths &amp; Marriages index is ref. 10451/1922 and was recorded at the Petersham Registration District. It shows his parents as Peter and Louisa. His funeral was attended by the Prime Minister Billy Hughes and the (later) Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang (who was the husband of Lawson&#x27;s sister-in-law Hilda Bredt), as well as thousands of citizens. He is interred at Waverley Cemetery Lawson was the first person to be granted a New South Wales state funeral (traditionally reserved for Governors, Chief Justices, etc.) on the grounds of having been a &#x27;distinguished citizen&#x27;.

== Honours and legacy ==

A bronze statue of Lawson accompanied by a swagman, a dog and a fencepost (reflecting his writing) stands in The Domain, Sydney. The Henry Lawson Memorial committee raised money through public donation to commission the statue by sculptor George Washington Lambert in 1927. The work was unveiled on 28 July 1931 by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game.

In 1949 Lawson was the subject of an Australian postage stamp.

Lawson&#x27;s &quot;The Drover&#x27;s Wife&quot; short story was featured on a 1991 $1.20 stamp, and a 2017 $1.00 stamp, both from Australia Post.

In 2017 Lawson was again featured on two Australian postage stamps, one featuring &quot;Mitchell: A Character Sketch&quot; and the other The Drover&#x27;s Wife and family, including dog, pitted against the snake.

He was featured on the first (paper) Australian ten-dollar note issued in 1966 when decimal currency was first introduced into Australia. Lawson was pictured against scenes from the town of Gulgong in NSW. This note was replaced by a polymer note in 1993; the polymer series had different people featured on the notes.

Lawson&#x27;s treatment (or lack thereof) of Aboriginal Australians in his work has been criticised and debated. Author Ryan Butta writes that there are some &quot;glaring omissions&quot; in Lawson&#x27;s writings about Bourke, in particular the Afghan cameleers who were there at the time, and being written about in local newspapers, and who were responsible for opening up the interior of the continent.

In 2024, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relationship between Australia and Indonesia, Indonesian composer Ananda Sukarlan was commissioned to set one of his poems to music, and Sukarlan chose &quot;On the Night Train&quot;. It was premiered by the soprano Mariska Setiawan and the strings of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra

== Henry Lawson Festivals ==
Currently the NSW towns of Gulgong and Grenfell both host Henry Lawson Festivals, with the Grenfell Festival also incorporating a literary competition.

<text>In geometry, a cuboid is a hexahedron with quadrilateral faces, meaning it is a polyhedron with six faces; it has eight vertices and twelve edges. A &quot;rectangular cuboid&quot; (sometimes also called a &quot;cuboid&quot;) has all right angles and equal opposite rectangular faces. Etymologically, &quot;cuboid&quot; means &quot;like a cube&quot;, in the sense of a convex solid which can be transformed into a cube (by adjusting the lengths of its edges and the angles between its adjacent faces). A cuboid is a convex polyhedron whose polyhedral graph is the same as that of a cube.

General cuboids have many different types. When all of the rectangular cuboid&#x27;s edges are equal in length, it results in a cube, with six square faces and adjacent faces meeting at right angles. Along with the rectangular cuboids, &quot;parallelepiped&quot; is a cuboid with six parallelogram. &quot;Rhombohedron&quot; is a cuboid with six rhombus faces. A &quot;square frustum&quot; is a frustum with a square base, but the rest of its faces are quadrilaterals; the square frustum is formed by truncating the apex of a square pyramid.
In attempting to classify cuboids by their symmetries, found that there were at least 22 different cases, &quot;of which only about half are familiar in the shapes of everyday objects&quot;.


There exist quadrilateral-faced hexahedra which are non-convex.

<text>Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, better known as &quot;Fonzie&quot; or &quot;The Fonz&quot;, is a fictional character played by Henry Winkler in the American sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974–1984). He was originally a secondary character, but was soon positioned as a lead character when he began surpassing the other characters in popularity. The Fonzie character was so popular that in the second season producers considered renaming the show to &quot;Fonzie&#x27;s Happy Days.&quot; Fonzie was seen by many as the epitome of coolness and a sex symbol.

&quot;Happy Days&quot; producer and writer Bob Brunner created both Arthur Fonzarelli&#x27;s &quot;Fonzie&quot; nickname, and the invented put-down, &quot;Sit on it&quot;. The character was a stereotypical greaser who was frequently seen on his motorcycle, wore a leather jacket, and typified the essence of cool, in contrast to his circle of friends.

On November 8, 1980, Hanna-Barbera Productions and Paramount Television produced the ABC Saturday morning &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot; animated series during the Saturday morning schedule on ABC.

Fonzie is one of only three characters (along with Howard Cunningham and Marion Cunningham) to appear in all 255 episodes of the series.

== Character traits and development ==

Arthur Fonzarelli was born to an Italian-American family. He and his mother were abandoned by his father when Arthur was three, and Arthur holds few memories of him, but deep resentment toward him for the abandonment. In the season 6 episode &quot;Christmas Time&quot;, a sailor delivers a Christmas present ostensibly from his father (played by Eddie Fontaine). Fonzie is resentful, but at the end of the episode he opens his father&#x27;s letter explaining why he left and reads it. He also learns that the sailor was his father, who admits in the letter that he doubted he would have the courage to reveal the truth to his son. Fonzie only relents when Howard Cunningham agrees with Fonzie that his father was irresponsible and in the wrong. In a later episode, Fonzie unexpectedly meets a woman he believes is his mother in a diner. She convinces him she is not, but in the end, she looks at a picture of Fonzie she had in her possession. In the final season, Fonzie meets his half-brother &#x27;Arte&#x27; Fonzarelli, who informs him that their father has by then died. Fonzie has mixed emotions upon hearing this, as this left so many questions about his past unanswered, but Fonzie bonded with Arte, who helped him cope.

Grandma Nussbaum appears to have been a primary caregiver to Fonzie since the age of six. When he (instead of Grandma Nussbaum) moves into the Cunninghams&#x27; garage apartment—a plot development that helped precipitate his increased presence in the series—he turns his old apartment over to his grandmother. Grandma Nussbaum (and she alone) calls Fonzie &quot;Skippy&quot;. She is also the grandmother of Fonzie&#x27;s cousin Chachi Arcola (played by Scott Baio).

Fonzie&#x27;s devotion to her foreshadows his ongoing devotion to mother figures throughout the show, particularly to Marion Cunningham, whom Fonzie affectionately calls &quot;Mrs. C.&quot; Though at first looked down on and mistrusted (a result of his past and being a high school dropout), he eventually became accepted by the Cunninghams (his friend Richie&#x27;s family), even more so after he rented an attic room over their garage. Even Richie&#x27;s father, Howard (&quot;Mr. C.&quot; to Fonzie and the most resistant to him living with them), a pillar of the community, came to regard Fonzie with affection and said &quot;Ayyyy&quot; when Fonzie moved into the garage. 

Fonzie shares a very close relationship with his younger cousin Chachi, and his nephew Spike. Fonzie was able to be the older brother figure that Chachi needed in his life. In having Chachi come to live and work with him, Fonzie grows too, becoming an overall better, more responsible and caring person. Fonzie serves as Chachi&#x27;s best man when he marries Joanie. In the long shot at the end of Chachi and Joanie&#x27;s wedding, Fonzie is the first person who comes to congratulate his younger cousin. He and Chachi embrace for several seconds. They share another hug at the end of Mr. C&#x27;s toast. These are just a couple examples of Fonzie and Chachi&#x27;s relationship. The last couple of seasons show how close Fonzie and Chachi really grew to be.

Fonzie also encourages Spike to follow his dreams, regardless of how they may be perceived by others. Spike confesses to Fonzie his ambitions to own a &quot;flower store&quot;, but is reluctant to make it known out of fear that it will ruin his self-perceived image of cool. Using himself as an example, Fonzie tells Spike to not let others dictate his path in life, to follow his own instincts and take responsibility for his own happiness.

== Civic involvement ==
Fonzie was involved in community projects. He endorses Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s 1956 presidential campaign. At a rally Fonzie declares, &quot;Ayyy, he won the war, didn&#x27;t he!?&quot; and &quot;I like Ike! My bike likes Ike! Ayyy...&quot; Eisenhower carried Wisconsin with 62% of the vote, easily defeating Adlai Stevenson (supported by Richie Cunningham&#x27;s more-researched speech). In that election, Eisenhower got 457 electoral votes to 73 for Stevenson.

Fonzie becomes involved with other issues. Highlighting actor Henry Winkler&#x27;s off-camera work, several episodes dealt with civil rights of people with disabilities. Concerned that students with epilepsy were denied their chance to attend public school and play sports, he intervenes to resolve the issue; he also learns sign language to communicate with a woman working at the municipal power company. And he pushes Chachi to continue working with his disability when Chachi himself just wants to quit because things will be hard. Such advocacy builds on the previous season&#x27;s episode where Fonzie hired wheelchair-using Don King to work in his garage, promising to provide workplace accommodation for his employee.

Concerned about equal opportunity, Fonz wants Milwaukee racially integrated. Personally friends with African Americans, he becomes upset when a party in which Richie welcomes Hawaii into the Union is boycotted because it will be racially integrated. Initially wanting to force people to attend, Fonzie learns from Howard that people cannot be forced to change their minds overnight. In a later episode, Fonzie volunteers to go south with Al and a group of Freedom Riders to help integrate a segregated diner. Normally flirtatious with women, Fonzie is instead disgusted that the waitress does not serve black customers. At one point he tells her that he cannot date her because of her compliance with the diner policy. Another episode that dealt with racial issues was where Fonzie was a juror in a trial of a black biker accused of robbery. The episode dealt with circumstantial evidence and jury nullification. Mr. Cunningham, who was on the same jury, went to bat for Fonzie, saying all jurors are permitted to present arguments and he took it very seriously about taking a man&#x27;s freedom away, which he refused to do without proof of guilt. The episode was based on &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;. Fonzie was able to get the black biker acquitted, explaining that his English-made Triumph Grand Mark 2 had its accelerators on the left handlebar. The robber had snatched the purse of the woman with his left hand. Therefore, there is no way that the black biker could have sped off on his bike if the purse was in his left hand.

Fonzie also becomes involved with the Big Brother (later known a Big Brothers, Big Sisters) program. After spending some time with his &quot;Little Brother&quot; Danny, Fonzie decides to adopt him. While Fonzie is by this time a respected and responsible pillar of the community, the adoption process hits a snag when the adoption agency denies his application due to his marital status. Devastated, Fonzie&#x27;s first instincts are to take Danny and run, but then realizes that doing so would only prove the agency right. He reluctantly returns Danny to the agency. On the day of Joanie and Chachi&#x27;s wedding, the agency surprises Fonzie by returning Danny to him, introducing Danny as his &quot;son&quot;, with Danny calling the joyous Fonzie &quot;Dad&quot; for the first time.

== Commentary ==
Micky Dolenz auditioned and was in the running to portray the Fonz, but the part ultimately was given to Henry Winkler. Fonzie was originally envisioned as a tall blonde male character.

Winkler received three Primetime Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe awards for his portrayal of Fonzie. In addition, the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution asked him to donate one of Fonzie&#x27;s leather jackets in 1980. The Smithsonian curator Eric Jentsch added the following to the jacket description: &quot;Fonzie was a representation of cool at a time when you were learning about what cool was.&quot; Years later, NPR would make a similar assessment, stating that for &quot;kids growing up in the 1970s, there was one, absolute model of cool — not James Dean or Marlon Brando, but The Fonz.&quot; In 1999 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Fonzie as number 4 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 in the UK, the Fonz was ranked 13th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. A few decades later, American artist Gerald P. Sawyer, unveiled the Bronze Fonz (a public artwork) on the Milwaukee Riverwalk in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 18, 2008. In 2021, when asked which books influenced him in childhood, American journalist Anderson Cooper (who is also dyslexic) responded that, &quot;I also loved the Fonz and read a book when I was around 8 called &quot;The Fonz: The Henry Winkler Story&quot;. I actually keep it in my office at CNN. Henry Winkler was very important to me when I was a child. Meeting him as an adult — and discovering what a kind and gracious person he is — was amazing.&quot;

Winkler feared being typecast as a greaser after playing Fonzie (and for his previous role as a greaser in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; before &quot;Happy Days&quot;); to avoid this, he turned down the role of Danny Zuko in &quot;Grease&quot;. He nonetheless had difficulty finding work in the 1980s after &quot;Happy Days&quot; ended because of his association with the Fonzie role; he would work mainly behind the camera in the 1980s, most notably as Executive Producer of the popular adventure TV series, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, and eventually begin getting other roles in the 1990s, prompting a career rejuvenation.

=== In popular culture ===
*&quot;The Fonz Dance&quot; (&quot;Happy Days,&quot; Season 4, Episode 8) refers to Winkler improvising a version of the hora as Richie&#x27;s band plays the song Hava Nagila. Years later in 2018, Winkler performed a version of the dance as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.
*In season 5 of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, the doctor who delivers Phoebe&#x27;s triplets is a fan of Fonzie, which annoys her.
*In the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; the character Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) calms would-be robber &quot;Honey Bunny&quot; (Amanda Plummer) by instructing her to &quot;Be like Fonzie&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s right, we&#x27;re all gonna be cool!&quot;)
*2019 it was reported that Dominic Cummings, special political adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, paraphrased Jules by telling Conservative MPs to &quot;be cool like Fonzies&quot; as political pressure built to request an extension to the date of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.
*In the 2015 sci-fi film &quot;The Martian&quot;, the character Mark Watney poses as the Fonz for his first official &quot;proof of life&quot; picture.
*Jon Hein developed the phrase &quot;jumping the shark&quot; in response to Season Five, Episode 3, &quot;Hollywood: Part 3&quot; of the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, in which Fonzie jumps over a shark while on water-skis.
*Fonzie had the ability of hitting electrical equipment to make it work, and this became known as the &quot;Fonzarelli Fix&quot;, a term that is still in use today.
*A garage apartment is sometimes called a Fonzie flat.
*The 2016 single &quot;Lemon&quot; by N.E.R.D. featuring Rihanna, has the line in Rihanna&#x27;s verse, &quot;Waiting for my thumb like The Fonz&quot; as a reference to Fonzie&#x27;s trademark thumbs up.

<doc id="156817" wikidata="Q1780820" url="?curid=156817" title="Gridiron pendulum">
<text>A gridiron pendulum was a temperature-compensated clock pendulum invented by British clockmaker John Harrison around 1726. It was used in precision clocks. In ordinary clock pendulums, the pendulum rod expands and contracts with changes in temperature. The period of the pendulum&#x27;s swing depends on its length, so a pendulum clock&#x27;s rate varied with changes in ambient temperature, causing inaccurate timekeeping. The gridiron pendulum consists of alternating parallel rods of two metals with different thermal expansion coefficients, such as steel and brass. The rods are connected by a frame in such a way that their different thermal expansions (or contractions) compensate for each other, so that the overall length of the pendulum, and thus its period, stays constant with temperature.

The gridiron pendulum was used during the Industrial Revolution period in pendulum clocks, particularly precision &quot;regulator clocks&quot; employed as time standards in factories, laboratories, office buildings, railroad stations and post offices to schedule work and set other clocks. The gridiron became so associated with accurate timekeeping that by the turn of the 20th century many clocks had pendulums with decorative fake gridirons, which had no temperature compensating qualities.

==How it works==

The gridiron pendulum is constructed so the high thermal expansion (zinc or brass) rods make the pendulum shorter when they expand, while the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer. By using the correct ratio of lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc or brass rods exactly compensate for the greater length of the low expansion steel rods, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature changes. 

The simplest form of gridiron pendulum, introduced as an improvement to Harrison&#x27;s around 1750 by John Smeaton, consists of five rods, 3 of steel and two of zinc. A central steel rod runs up from the bob to the suspension pivot.

At that point a cross-piece (middle bridge) extends from the central rod and connects to two zinc rods, one on each side of the central rod, which reach down to, and are fixed to, the bottom bridge just above the bob. The bottom bridge clears the central rod and connects to two further steel rods which run back up to the top bridge attached to the suspension. As the steel rods expand in heat, the bottom bridge drops relative to the suspension, and the bob drops relative to the middle bridge. However, the middle bridge rises relative to the bottom one because the greater expansion of the zinc rods pushes the middle bridge, and therefore the bob, upward to match the combined drop caused by the expanding steel.

In simple terms, the upward expansion of the zinc counteracts the combined downward expansion of the steel (which has a greater total length). The rod lengths are calculated so that the effective length of the zinc rods multiplied by zinc&#x27;s thermal expansion coefficient equals the effective length of the steel rods multiplied by iron&#x27;s expansion coefficient, thereby keeping the pendulum the same length.

Harrison&#x27;s original pendulum used brass rods (pure zinc not being available then); these required more rods because brass does not expand as much as zinc does. Instead of one high expansion rod on each side, two are needed on each side, requiring a total of 9 rods, five steel and four brass. The exact degree of compensation can be adjusted by having a section of the central rod which is partly brass and partly steel. These overlap (like a sandwich) and are joined by a pin which passes through both metals. A number of holes for the pin are made in both parts and moving the pin up or down the rod changes how much of the combined rod is brass and how much is steel. 

In the late 19th century the Dent company developed a tubular version of the zinc gridiron in which the four outer rods were replaced by two concentric tubes which were linked by a tubular nut which could be screwed up and down to alter the degree of compensation.

In the 1730s clockmaker John Ellicott designed a version that only required 3 rods, two brass and one steel (&quot;see drawing&quot;), in which the brass rods as they expanded with increasing temperature pressed against levers which lifted the bob. The Ellicott pendulum did not see much use.

==Disadvantages==
Scientists in the 1800s found that the gridiron pendulum had disadvantages that made it unsuitable for the highest-precision clocks. The friction of the rods sliding in the holes in the frame caused the rods to adjust to temperature changes in a series of tiny jumps, rather than with a smooth motion. This caused the rate of the pendulum, and therefore the clock, to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is not very stable dimensionally; it is subject to creep. Therefore, another type of temperature-compensated pendulum, the mercury pendulum invented in 1721 by George Graham, was used in the highest-precision clocks.

By 1900, the highest-precision astronomical regulator clocks used pendulum rods of low thermal expansion materials such as invar and fused quartz.

==Mathematical analysis==
===Temperature error===
All substances expand with an increase in temperature formula_1, so uncompensated pendulum rods get longer with a temperature increase, causing the clock to slow down, and get shorter with a temperature decrease, causing the clock to speed up. The amount depends on the linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) formula_2 of the material they are composed of. CTE is usually given in parts per million (ppm) per degree Celsius. If a rod has a length formula_3 at some standard temperature formula_4, the length of the rod as a function of temperature is 
:formula_5
If formula_6 and formula_7, the expansion or contraction of a rod of length formula_3 with a coefficient of expansion formula_2 caused by a temperature change formula_10 is
:formula_11        (1)

The period of oscillation formula_12 of the pendulum (the time interval for a right swing and a left swing) is
:formula_13        (2)
A change in length formula_14 due to a temperature change formula_10 will cause a change in the period formula_16. Since the expansion coefficient is so small, the length changes due to temperature are very small, parts per million, so formula_17 and the change in period can be approximated to first order as a linear function
:formula_18
:formula_19 
Substituting equation (1), the change in the pendulum&#x27;s period caused by a change in temperature formula_10 is
:formula_21
:formula_22

So the fractional change in an uncompensated pendulum&#x27;s period is equal to one-half the coefficient of expansion times the change in temperature.

Steel has a CTE of 11.5 x 10−6 per °C so a pendulum with a steel rod will have a thermal error rate of 
5.7 parts per million or 0.5 seconds per day per degree Celsius (0.9 seconds per day per degree Fahrenheit). Before 1900 most buildings were unheated, so clocks in temperate climates like Europe and North America would experience a summer/winter temperature variation of around resulting in an error rate of 6.8 seconds per day. Wood has a smaller CTE of 4.9 x 10−6 per °C thus a pendulum with a wood rod will have a smaller thermal error of 0.21 sec per day per °C, so wood pendulum rods were often used in quality domestic clocks. The wood had to be varnished to protect it from the atmosphere as humidity could also cause changes in length.

===Compensation===
A gridiron pendulum is symmetrical, with two identical linkages of suspension rods, one on each side, suspending the bob from the pivot. Within each suspension chain, the total change in length of the pendulum formula_3 is equal to the sum of the changes of the rods that make it up. It is designed so with an increase in temperature the high expansion rods on each side push the pendulum bob up, in the opposite direction to the low expansion rods which push it down, so the net change in length is the difference between these changes 
:formula_24
From (1) the change in length formula_14 of a gridiron pendulum with a temperature change formula_10 is
:formula_27
:formula_28
where formula_29 is the sum of the lengths of all the low expansion (steel) rods and formula_30 is the sum of the lengths of the high expansion rods in the suspension chain from the bob to the pivot. The condition for zero length change with temperature is
:formula_31
:formula_32        (3)
In other words, the ratio of the total rod lengths must be equal to the inverse ratio of the thermal expansion coefficients of the two metals
In order to calculate the length of the individual rods, this equation is solved along with equation (2) giving the total length of pendulum needed for the correct period formula_12
:formula_34
Most of the precision pendulum clocks with gridirons used a &#x27;seconds pendulum&#x27;, in which the period was two seconds. The length of the seconds pendulum was formula_35. 

In an ordinary uncompensated pendulum, which has most of its mass in the bob, the center of oscillation is near the center of the bob, so it was usually accurate enough to make the length from the pivot to the center of the bob formula_36 0.9936 m and then correct the clock&#x27;s period with the adjustment nut. But in a gridiron pendulum, the gridiron constitutes a significant part of the mass of the pendulum. This changes the moment of inertia so the center of oscillation is somewhat higher, above the bob in the gridiron. Therefore the total length formula_3 of the pendulum must be somewhat longer to give the correct period. This factor is hard to calculate accurately. Another minor factor is that if the pendulum bob is supported at bottom by a nut on the pendulum rod, as is typical, the rise in center of gravity due to thermal expansion of the bob has to be taken into account. Clockmakers of the 19th century usually used recommended lengths for gridiron rods that had been found by master clockmakers by trial and error.

===Five rod gridiron===
In the 5 rod gridiron, there is one high expansion rod on each side, of length formula_38, flanked by two low expansion rods with lengths formula_39 and formula_40, one from the pivot to support the bottom of formula_38, the other goes from the top of formula_38 down to support the bob. So from equation (3) the condition for compensation is
:formula_43
Since to fit in the frame the high expansion rod must be equal to or shorter than each of the low expansion rods formula_44 and formula_45 the geometrical condition for construction of the gridiron is
:formula_46
Therefore the 5 rod gridiron can only be made with metals whose expansion coefficients have a ratio greater than or equal to two
:formula_47
Zinc has a CTE of formula_2 = 26.2 ppm per °C, versus the steel value of 11.5, so the ratio of formula_49 = 2.28. Thus the zinc/steel combination can be used in 5 rod pendulums. 
The compensation condition for a zinc/steel gridiron is
:formula_50

===Nine rod gridiron===
To allow the use of metals with a lower ratio of expansion coefficients, such as brass and steel, a greater proportion of the suspension length must be the high expansion metal, so a construction with more high expansion rods must be used. In the 9 rod gridiron, there are two high expansion rods on each side, of length formula_38 and formula_52, flanked by three low expansion rods with lengths formula_39, formula_40 and formula_55. So from equation (3) the condition for compensation is
:formula_56
Since to fit in the frame each of the two high expansion rods must be as short as or shorter than each of the high expansion rods, the geometrical condition for construction is
:formula_57
Therefore the 9 rod gridiron can be made with metals with a ratio of thermal expansion coefficients exceeding 1.5.
:formula_58
Brass has a CTE of around formula_2 = 19.3 ppm per °C, giving a ratio of formula_49 = 1.68. So while brass/steel cannot be used in 5 rod gridirons, it can be used in the 9 rod version.
So the compensation condition for a brass/steel gridiron using brass with the above CTE is
:formula_61

<text>The Tata Group () is an Indian group of companies headquartered in Mumbai. Established in 1868, it is India&#x27;s largest business conglomerate, with products and services in over 160 countries, and operations in 100 countries.

There are total 29 publicly listed Tata Group companies with a combined market capitalisation of ₹33.7 trillion (US$403 billion) as of 20 August 2024. 

==History==

When the American Civil War caused a boom in the Bombay cotton market, Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata and his father joined the Asiatic Banking Corporation. When the tide ebbed, Tata&#x27;s credit was left desolate. Fortunately, the firm&#x27;s credit was re-established during the next three years. A share in the lucrative contract for the commissariat of Napier&#x27;s expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 restored the family fortune. He dreamed of achieving four goals: setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution, and a hydroelectric plant.

=== 1868–1937===
In 1870, with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company. Further, he bought a bankrupt oil mill at Chinchpokli and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill, which he sold for a profit after two years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at Nagpur named Empress Mill. During his lifetime, in 1903, the company opened the Taj Mahal Hotel at Colaba waterfront as the first hotel with electricity in British India.

After Jamsetji&#x27;s 1904 death, his older son Dorabji Tata became chairman. Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), now known as Tata Steel in 1907. Marking the group&#x27;s global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in London. Following the founder&#x27;s goals, Western India&#x27;s first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to Tata Power. Fulfilling yet another dream, the Indian Institute of Science was established, admitting its first group of students in 1911.

=== 1938–1991 ===

J. R. D. Tata was made chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95 enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company had either started or in which they held a controlling interest. New sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them recognition.

In 1932, Tata founded an airline, known as Tata Air Services (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from Tata Sons, though JRD Tata would continue as chairman until 1977.

In 1945, Tata Motors was founded, first focused on locomotives. In 1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz. In 1968, Tata Consultancy Services was founded.

=== 1991–2024 ===

In 1991, Ratan Tata became chairman of Tata Group. This was also the year of economic liberalization in India, opening up the market to foreign competitors. During this time, Tata Group began to acquire several companies. Tata Group bought Tetley In February 2000. After that, it acquired Corus Group in 2007. The next year, the company&#x27;s subsidiary Tata Motors launched the Tata Nano, presenting it as &quot;the world’s most affordable car,&quot; and acquired Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Company.

In 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman. He was instrumental in restructuring business verticals and increasing promoter stake ownership in companies. Under his leadership, the group made acquisitions through insolvency law and investments in e-commerce, expanded its airline business by winning a bid for Air India, and completely bought Air Asia India. He has mentioned the future strategy is to focus on healthcare, electronics, and digital.

Tata-owned Air India got approval to acquire AirAsia India nearly two months after putting forth the proposal. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the acquisition of the entire shareholding in Air Asia India by Tata-owned Air India.

==Criticism and controversies== 
 
The company has attracted controversy for reports of political corruption, cronyism, theft, mass killings, and exploitation of its customers, Indian citizens, and natural resources. 

===Munnar, Kerala===
The Kerala Government filed an affidavit in the high court alleging that Tata Tea had &quot;grabbed&quot; forest land of at Munnar. The Tatas provided that they possessed of land, which they are allowed to retain under the Kannan Devan Hill (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, and there was a shortage of in that. The Chief Minister of Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan, who vowed to evict all on government land in Munnar, formed a special squad for the Munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties. However, the mission was aborted due to both influential landholders and opposition from Achuthanandan&#x27;s own party.

===Kalinganagar, Odisha===
On 2 January 2006, Kalinganagar, Tribal Orissa villagers protested against the construction of a new steel plant for Tata Steel on land historically owned by them. Some of the villagers had been evicted without adequate relocation. Police retribution was brutal: 37 protesters were injured and 13 killed, including 3 women and a 13-year-old boy. One policeman was hacked to death by a mob after police had opened fire on protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets. Family members of the deceased villagers later claimed that the bodies had been mutilated during post-mortem examination.

===Supplies to Burma&#x27;s military regime===
In December 2006, Myanmar&#x27;s chief of general staff, General Thura Shwe Mann, visited the Tata Motors plant in Pune. In 2009, Tata Motors announced that it would manufacture trucks in Myanmar. Tata Motors reported that these contracts to supply hardware and automobiles to Burma&#x27;s military were subsequently criticised by human rights activists.

=== Singur land acquisition ===
The Singur controversy in West Bengal was a series of protests by locals and political parties over the forced acquisition, eviction, and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the Tata Nano plant, during which Mamata Banerjee&#x27;s party was widely criticised as acting for political gain. Despite the support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state government, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal, citing safety concerns. Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, made land available for the Nano project.

On 31 August 2016, in a historic judgement, the Honorable Supreme Court of India set aside the land acquisition by the West Bengal Government in 2006 that had facilitated Tata Motors&#x27; Nano plant, stating that the West Bengal government had not taken possession of the land legally, and were now required to repossess and return it to local farmers within 12 weeks without compensation.

===Dhamra Port, Odisha===
The Port of Dhamara has received significant coverage, sparking controversy in India, and in Tata&#x27;s emerging global markets. The Dhamra port, an equal joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen &amp; Toubro, has been criticised for its proximity to the Gahirmatha Sanctuary and Bhitarkanika National Park by Indian and international organisations, including Greenpeace; Gahirmatha Beach is one of the world&#x27;s largest mass nesting sites for the olive ridley turtle, and India&#x27;s second largest mangrove forest, Bhitarkanika, is a designated Ramsar site, and critics claimed that the port could disrupt mass nesting at Gahirmtha beaches as well as the ecology of the Bitharkanika mangrove forest.
Tata Steel employed mitigation measures set by the project&#x27;s official advisor, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the company pledged to &quot;adopt all its recommendations without exception&quot; when conservation organisations asserted that a thorough environmental impact analysis had not been done for the project, which had undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed.

===Proposed soda extraction plant in Tanzania===
In 2007, Tata Group joined forces with a Tanzanian company to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania. Environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near Lake Natron, and it has a very high chance of affecting the lake&#x27;s ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers, jeopardising endangered lesser flamingo birds. Lake Natron is where two-thirds of lesser flamingos reproduce. Producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake, and then disposing the water back to the lake. This process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake. 22 African nations signed a petition to stop its construction.

===Epic Systems trade-secret case judgement===
In April 2016, a U.S. Federal Grand Jury awarded Epic Systems a US$940 million judgement against Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp. Filed 31 October 2014; the suit charged that &quot;6,477 unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance Tata&#x27;s competing product, Med Mantra.&quot; In 2017, U.S. District Court Judge William Conley reduced the Award to $420 million; the company states that the judgement is also being appealed, as &quot;not supported by evidence presented during the trial and a strong appeal can be made to superior court to fully set aside the jury verdict.”

===2018 NCLT verdict===
In July 2018, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which &quot;adjudicates issues relating to Indian companies,&quot; issued a verdict in the company&#x27;s favor on charges of mismanagement leveled in 2016 by ousted chairman, Cyrus Mistry.

<text> (; , ) is a Flemish municipality of Belgium, much of which consists of a number of small Belgian enclaves fully surrounded by the Netherlands.

Parts of are surrounded by the Dutch province of North Brabant, but it is part of the Belgian province of Antwerp. , it had a population of 2,935. The total area is .

==Geography==

===Border with Baarle-Nassau===

 is noted for its complicated borders with , Netherlands.

The border&#x27;s complexity results from a number of medieval treaties, agreements, land-swaps and sales between the Lords of and the Dukes of Brabant. Generally speaking, predominantly agricultural or built environments became constituents of Brabant and other parts devolved to . These distributions were ratified and clarified as a part of the border settlements agreed under the Treaty of Maastricht in 1843. The tight integration of the European Union and in particular the Schengen Agreement have made many of the practicalities of the situation substantially simpler since the 1990s.

In total, the municipality of Baarle-Hertog consists of 26 separate parcels of land. Four are linked to other Belgian municipalities, from west to east: the Baalbrugse Bemden, a strip of land along the Merkske, Zondereigen-Ginhoven and an area near Weelde-Station. The largest single section, Zondereigen (named after its main hamlet), is located within mainland Belgium on the contiguous Dutch-Belgian border (north of the town of ). In addition to this, there are 22 Belgian exclaves fully within the Netherlands. There are also seven Dutch enclaves within the Belgian exclaves (i.e., counter-exclaves) that are part of the territory of the Netherlands. Six of these Dutch enclaves are located within the largest Belgian exclave, and a seventh in the second-largest Belgian exclave. An eighth Dutch exclave is located near .

During the First World War, this situation meant that the Imperial German Army could not occupy these parts of Belgium without crossing the Netherlands, which the Dutch government did not allow. Thus, these pieces of Belgium became a place where refugees could safely stay. A clandestine radio transmitter was smuggled in and from there worked with the Belgian resistance. The Dutch government fenced off these areas and controlled access in or out of them, building a church and school for the Belgian people who were effectively stranded within the enclaves. This situation did not exist in the Second World War, as both countries were occupied by Nazi Germany.

Some houses in the town of / are divided between the two countries. At one time, according to Dutch laws, restaurants had to close earlier. For some restaurants on the border, this simply meant that the customers had to move to a table on the Belgian side. In 2020, restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic differed between the two countries; for instance, preventing a Belgian citizen living metres away from an open Dutch bar from patronising it.

Many fireworks shops are found in , as Belgian laws controlling the sale of fireworks are more lenient than those of the Netherlands. Many Dutch tourists come to to buy fireworks to celebrate the New Year.

Two villages in the municipality, Zondereigen and Ginhoven, are located in the main territory of Belgium.

===List of enclaves===

<text>Geel () is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp, which acquired city status in the 1980s. It comprises Central-Geel which is constituted of 4 old parishes a/o towns: Sint-Amand, Sint-Dimpna, Holven and Elsum. Further on around the center are the parish-towns of Ten Aard (N), Bel (E), Winkelomheide (SE), Stelen, Oosterlo and Zammel (S), Punt (SW) and Larum (W). In 2021, Geel had a total population of 40,781. The total area is . Geel’s patron saint, the Irish Saint Dymphna, inspired the town’s pioneering de-institutionalized method of care for the mentally ill.

==History==

===Origins and Middle Ages===
Archaeological finds in the area point to Iron Age settlements, but the name of Geel (until mid-20th century spelled as Gheel) hails from a Germanic root meaning &quot;yellow&quot; and dates from the early Middle Ages. A hamlet already existed in the mid-13th century, at which time a certain Petrus Cameracencis, canon of Cambrai, wrote the &quot;Vitae Dymphnae et S. Gereberni presbiteri&quot; (English: Life of Dymphna and St. Gerebern priest) about an Irish woman and her tutor set in Geel according to oral tradition. The cult of the saint attracted numerous pilgrims to the area, leading to a substantial population growth: 2,136 inhabitants in 1374.

In the 12th century, the extended territory around Geel was given to the Grimbergen Abbey. It then became property of one noble family after another throughout medieval times. The noble lords or dames were masters of their community, but pledged feudal allegiance to the Dukes of Brabant. Some form of municipal government was granted to Geel as early as the first half of the 13th century. Throughout the Middle Ages to the end of the 18th century, the history of Geel follows that of the Duchy of Brabant. During all this time, the economy of the city depended on the breeding of sheep for the cloth industry, complemented by the cultivation of flax for the manufacture and trade of linen. A cloth hall was built at the beginning of the 15th century, which was later transformed into the city hall. The Eighty Years&#x27; War greatly damaged the Geel economy as well as its buildings and churches. The textile industry recovered to last until the early 19th century, but the economy was now mostly supported by agriculture, specifically rye, oat, barley, and buckwheat. Geel was also known at that time for its Latin School, which attracted students from far away to prepare them for entry at the Catholic University of Leuven.

===From the French Revolution until today===
In 1795, the Duchy of Brabant was dissolved and Geel made part of the French department of Deux-Nèthes, the precursor of the present province of Antwerp. The nobles and clerics of the Ancien Régime gave way to a mayor, who was now answerable to the town’s people. Geel actively participated in the Belgian Revolution of 1830, resulting in the award of an honorary flag from King Leopold II. The 19th century also saw the building of several new churches at the demand of the various parishes. A major occurrence in the history of Geel is the battle of Geel (also referred to as the &quot;Gheel bridgehead&quot;) in September 1944, one of the heaviest and bloodiest fights during the liberation of Belgium. Eventually the territory of Geel, and the smaller villages around it, were finally liberated on September 23, but it had claimed numerous military and civilian casualties.

==A model of psychiatric care==
Geel is well known for the early adoption of de-institutionalization in psychiatric care. This practice is based on the positive effects that placement in a host family gives the patient, most importantly access to family life that would otherwise have been denied. The legendary 7th-century Saint Dymphna, who had fled to the Geel area from Ireland, is usually credited with this type of care. The earliest Geel infirmary and the model where patients go into town, interact with the community during the day, and return to the hospital at night to sleep, date from the 13th century.

Originally, this practice was religiously motivated and organized by a chapter of canons, attached to the church of Saint Dymphna. By the 18th century, however, the placement of patients was mostly done directly, without the intervention of the canons. The number of patients grew in proportion to the growing city’s reputation abroad and the economic benefits flowing to the city provided further motivation to the inhabitants. Attracted by the gentle care of patients, Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s father considered sending his famous son to Geel in 1880. The high point came in 1938, with a total of 3,736 placed patients, compared with only 700 a hundred years earlier.

This novel type of psychiatric care was evaluated by various other institutions around the world (see for instance Eastern State Hospital in Virginia), but often seen as too revolutionary to implement. It is only in the early 20th century that the idea of deinstitutionalization was adopted more widely elsewhere. Today, a modern psychiatric centre stands on the place of the old infirmary, and close to 500 patients are still placed with inhabitants.

The fact that people with mental illness are living with relatively non-judgmental (formerly) strangers and not with family members has been cited as a partial explanation of the success of this model, because it creates an environment that avoids emotional over-involvement, critical comments, and hostility (measured collectively in psychiatry as &quot;expressed emotion&quot;). Another aspect cited as helpful is that people with mental illness are allowed to live their lives relatively freely, without being labeled as &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;in recovery&quot;.

==Sights==
*The market square, facing the Sint-Amands church and bordered by attractive café terraces, is the focal point of the city. The oldest part of the city hall dates from the 17th century. Not far away, the Sint-Dimpna church marks the place where the saint was buried.
*Geel is located along the river Nete, in the Campine region noted for varied landscape of forests and dunes.
*Nature reserve &quot;De Zegge&quot;, belonging to the society which owns the Antwerp Zoo.
*Among the city&#x27;s attractions one counts a field of orchids, a centenary linden tree, three wind mills, a military cemetery, and a handful a museums including a clock museum, a lamp museum, and an old bakery. The Saint-Alexis college is emblazoned with Art Nouveau sgraffiti by Gabriel Van Dievoet.

<text>Hoogstraten () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The municipality comprises Hoogstraten, Meer, Meerle, Meersel-Dreef, Minderhout and Wortel (Meersel-Dreef includes the northernmost point in Belgium).

Hoogstraten (originally &quot;Hoogstraeten&quot;) has a population of over 20,000, and lies in Flanders at the northern border of Belgium within an enclave surrounded on three sides by the Netherlands. Today, about 15% percent of the population consists of Dutch people.
The town is named after the &quot;hoge straat&quot; or &quot;high road&quot; – a military highway that linked the old towns of Antwerp and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. In the town&#x27;s early days, little trade existed. Villages and towns produced just enough for their own support, with little or no surplus to be &#x27;sold&#x27; to other areas. Thus, most travelers along this high road were soldiers and armies.

Today Hoogstraten is internationally known for its strawberries. Veiling Hoogstraten (auction) is one of the largest of the Benelux. Every year more than 30,000 tonnes of strawberries are traded there. However its main agricultural crop is the tomato.

==History==
===Medieval period===
Originally Hoogstraten probably existed as a small group of thatched cottages, with perhaps one which served as an inn. Passing travellers would pay for a meal of bread and stew and the opportunity to lie on a straw pallet in an upper room for the night while their horse was tended in a stable attached to the cottage. Apart from the innkeeper who probably also sold beer, most of the men in Hoogstraten laboured for the principal landowner while their wives tended to the family. There was no natural lake or hill around which the cottages might have been grouped so the town&#x27;s focus was the main street, the &quot;Vrijheid&quot;. There was a small river, the Mark, but given the tendency for rivers to overflow in this flat land, townspeople were wise to avoid building too close to it.

The town was chartered in 1210, when it was granted the title of &#x27;free town&#x27;. This effectively gave it a charter with certain privileges: perhaps exemption from some taxes or exemption from ecclesiastical territorial sovereignty. Both helped the growth of a town.

A watermill (&#x27;het Laermolen&#x27;) was built outside town on the River Mark. It was already an old mill when it was first mentioned in 1391. In 1380 a Beguinage was established to house good but poor old women.

===Early-modern period===
A very large brick church was built in 1524, and a matching town hall next door was built in 1530 before the church was completed in 1546.

By 1564, a drawing shows the town still consisted of houses on both sides of the wide unpaved Vrijheid. The number of houses had grown to more than a hundred fine upstanding wooden buildings some three stories high. The church, St. Catherine&#x27;s Church, formed the centre of the town. Behind the church on a slight hill a bit more than a kilometer away stood the castle of the Count.

Under the ownership of Count Antoon de Lalaing (1480–1540) and his wife, Countess Elisabeth van Culemborg (1475–1555), the &#x27;Land van Hoogstraten&#x27; became a county, a title bestowed by Margaretha of Austria. The &#x27;county&#x27; encompassed the whole the Count&#x27;s land in which several villages existed. It is now marked by the boundaries of his property, one of three bulges of northern Belgium each of which are almost surrounded by The Netherlands.

Between 1 September 1602 – 18 May 1604 the Mutiny of Hoogstraten took place - the longest mutiny by soldiers of the Spanish Army of Flanders during the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

While Hoogstraten lies within modern Belgian Flanders, prior to 1794 the town was in the Duchy of Brabant since old Flanders reached no further North West than Antwerp.

Hoogstraten remained in the hands of the Lalaing-Culemborg family until 1709 after which the town was transferred to their heir Salm-Salm family. In 1740 Hoogstraten was elevated to a Duchy by Emperor Charles VI, but barely half a century later, during French rule, it lost its titles of &#x27;town&#x27; and &#x27;duchy.&#x27; The status of a town often depended on whether the townspeople were considered supporters or not, so one might infer that the area was seen to have anti-French feeling. In early 1814 near the town the Battle of Hoogstraten was fought in which the coalition forces were victorious over the French.

===Contemporary period===
Over two hundred years later, in 1977, Hoogstraten was combined, as it had been in the past, with a mixture of dependent municipalities: the villages of Meer, Meerle, Meersel-Dreef, Minderhout and Wortel, which clustered around its edges, none of these villages was more than 15 kilometers from each other. Since 1985 Hoogstraten has once more been entitled to call itself a &#x27;stad&#x27; – a town.
Klein - Seminarie (Hoogstraten)

=== Postal history ===

The HOOGSTRAETEN post-office opened on 1 February 1845. It used a Distribution postal code 26 (before 1864), and 182 with points before 1874. MEERLE opened on 18 July 1902.

Postal codes since 1969: 
- 2320 Hoogstraten 
- 2321 Meer 
- 2322 Minderhout
- 2323 Wortel
- 2328 Meerle.

==History of Uranium mining==

In the 1920s and 1930s the Union Minière du Haut Katanga company, operating in the then Belgian colony of Congo, had a virtual monopoly of the world uranium market (holding most of the deposits known at the time). The uranium mined in Congo was mostly transported to the UMHK refinery for uranium ore which was located in Olen.

Some 1200 tonnes of uranium stored at the Olen refinery were captured by the Germans during the invasion and occupation of Belgium in 1940, and only recovered by US troops at the end of World War 2.

<text>Turnhout () is a Belgian municipality and city located in the Flemish province of Antwerp. The municipality comprises only the city of Turnhout proper. In 2021, its population was 45,874. The total area is . The agglomeration is much more populous, with 81,473 inhabitants. It is known for its playing card industry, and houses the head office of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of playing cards, Cartamundi. Turnhout is also the capital of the administrative district with the same name. The city council often promotes the city as &quot;the capital of the Kempen area.&quot; This designation is entirely unofficial, since the Kempen area is far larger than the Turnhout district and does not form an administrative unit.

Turnhout serves as the economic and cultural center for other communities in the immediate vicinity with more than 40 schools. There is also an important services sector with two hospitals, a two-stage theatre, an eight-screen cinema and one of the largest cultural centres of Belgium.

Turnhout is located at about 51.3 North and 4.9 East, from the centre of Antwerp, from Breda and Tilburg, from Eindhoven. The football club of the city is K.V. Turnhout.

In reference to 2021 census, the population of Turnhout was recorded at 45,874

==History==
Turnhout originated on the crossroads of two major trade routes and in the protection of the hunting castle of the Dukes of Brabant that seems to have existed since 1110 or earlier. This hunting past is still reflected in the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The small community that developed obtained its Libertas as a &quot;free city&quot; from Henry I, Duke of Brabant in about 1212. In 1338, the privilege of organizing a market on Saturday was granted, a tradition that still holds today, the city could now hold an annual fair so that all the goods from the surrounding villages could be offered for sale in Turnhout. In 1466, a traveler described the well-built houses and paved roads, and counted five churches.
By the 16th century, Turnhout had become a wealthy commercial center. Unfortunately, the end of the century brought war, fire, confiscations and epidemics. Suppression and inquisition made many progressive citizens to take refuge in the Dutch Republic, leaving the land of Turnhout impoverished. The further history of Turnhout consists of a series of ups and downs. Many times, the city and surroundings were the playground of armies, resulting in two major battles named after Turnhout: one in 1597 and one in 1789 are referred to as Battle of Turnhout.

In 1830, Belgium became independent, and Turnhout fell just south of the new border with the Netherlands. The period of peace between 1831 and 1914 saw the digging of the canal (1846) and the construction of the railroad (1855).

In the late Middle Ages, Turnhout was a well-known center for the weaving of bedding articles and of the linen trade. At the start of the 19th century, these trades were replaced by industries based on the use of paper. Pieter Corbeels and Philippus Jacobus Brepols are considered to be the founders of this industry. Turnhout retains much of this industry today. Numerous graphics companies are located in the region, such as Brepols, Group Joos, Proost International Book Production, Van Genechten Packaging, and last but not least Cartamundi, the world market leader of the playing card industry. In addition, the Belgian Centre for the Graphics Industry, and the Flemish Innovation Center for Graphic Communication (Campus Blairon) are located in Turnhout. Soudal, whose headquarters is located in Turnhout, is one of the leading companies in sealants.

=== Postal history ===
The Turnhout post office opened before 1830. It used postal code 122 with bars (before 1864), and 367 with points before 1874.

Postal code since 1969: 2300.

==Sights==
Architectural sights worth visiting are the 12th century castle of the Dukes of Brabant, the Gothic church of St. Peter, the beguinage (begijnhof) dating from the 13th century, the 14th century Gothic chapel of Theobald and the Taxandria museum housed in a prestigious Renaissance mansion. Of particular interest is the Museum of the Playing Card. This is located in an old factory building downtown and houses a beautifully restored steam engine.

The beguinage was recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1998.

The largest building in Turnhout is the Turnova tower, built in 2019. It is considered the first skyscraper in the city.

<text>Northeim is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the northwest and clockwise) the districts of Holzminden, Hildesheim, Goslar and Göttingen, and the state of Hesse (district of Kassel).

==History==
In medieval times the area had been part of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Later the majority of it belonged to Hanover and then Prussia. In 1885 the Prussian government created districts in the newly acquired provinces. In 1884 the districts of Einbeck, Northeim, and Uslar were established. Northeim and Uslar were merged in 1932, and they were again merged with Einbeck in 1974. The district&#x27;s area was further enlarged in 1977, when some municipalities of neighbouring districts (Gandersheim and Osterode am Harz) joined the Northeim district.

==Geography==

The district is located in the Weserbergland mountains. The Weser forms the western border of the district. Another river, the Leine, runs through the district from south to north. It is joined by the River Rhume which flows through the town of Northeim and the River Ilme which flows through the town of Einbeck.

<doc id="156858" wikidata="Q724351" url="?curid=156858" title="Asexuality">
<text>Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered a sexual orientation or the lack thereof. It may also be categorized more widely, to include a broad spectrum of asexual sub-identities.

Asexuality is distinct from abstention from sexual activity and from celibacy, which are behavioral and generally motivated by factors such as an individual&#x27;s personal, social, or religious beliefs. Sexual orientation, unlike sexual behavior, is believed to be &quot;enduring&quot;. Some asexual people engage in sexual activity despite lacking sexual attraction or a desire for sex, for a number of reasons, such as a desire to physically pleasure themselves or romantic partners, or a desire to have children.

Acceptance of asexuality as a sexual orientation and field of scientific research is still relatively new, as a growing body of research from both sociological and psychological perspectives has begun to develop. While some researchers assert that asexuality is a sexual orientation, other researchers disagree. Asexual individuals may represent about one percent of the population.

Various asexual communities have started to form since the impact of the Internet and social media in the mid-1990s. The most prolific and well-known of these communities is the Asexual Visibility and Education Network, which was founded in 2001 by David Jay.

== Definition, identity and relationships ==
Because there is significant variation among those who identify as asexual, the term &quot;asexuality&quot; can encompass broad definitions. Researchers generally define asexuality as the lack of sexual attraction or the lack of interest in sexual activity, though specific definitions vary—the term may be used to refer to individuals with low or absent sexual behavior or exclusively romantic non-sexual partnerships in addition to low or absent sexual desire or attraction.

The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), an online forum dedicated to asexuality, defines an asexual as &quot;someone who does not experience sexual attraction&quot;, as well as adding that asexuality &quot;at its core&quot; is &quot;just a word that people use to help figure themselves out&quot;, and encourages people to use the term &quot;asexual&quot; to define themselves &quot;as long as it makes sense to do so&quot;. Asexuality is often abbreviated as &quot;&quot;, a phonetic shortening of &quot;asexual&quot;, and the community as a whole is likewise referred to as the &quot;ace community&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Despite lacking sexual attraction, some asexuals might engage in purely romantic relationships, while others may not. Some who identify as asexual report that they experience sexual attraction, though lack the inclination to act on it, citing no desire to engage in sexual activity—some asexuals also lack the desire to engage in non-sexual physical activity such as cuddling or hand-holding, while others choose to do so. Asexual people may seek relationships without romantic or sexual activity, known as &quot;queerplatonic relationships&quot;. A &quot;squish&quot; is a term used by the asexual community to describe a non-sexual crush.

Certain asexuals may participate in sexual activity out of curiosity. Some may also masturbate as a form of solitary release, while others may not feel a need to do so. The desire for masturbation or other sexual activity is often referred to as &quot;sex drive&quot; by asexuals, who disassociate it from sexual attraction and being asexual; asexuals who masturbate generally consider it to be a normal product of the human body rather than a sign of latent sexuality, and others do not find it pleasurable. Some asexual men are unable to get an erection and are unable to attempt penetration. Asexuals also differ in their views on performing sexual acts — some are indifferent and may engage in sexual activity for the benefit of a romantic partner, while others are more strongly averse to the idea, though they are not typically against sex as a whole.

Many who identify as asexual may identify with diverse gender identities or classifications of romantic orientation. These are often integrated with a person&#x27;s asexual identity, and asexuals may still identify as heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual or pansexual regarding romantic or emotional aspects of sexual orientation or sexual identity in addition to identifying as asexual. The romantic aspects of sexual orientations may also be indicated by a variety of romantic identities, including biromantic, heteroromantic, homoromantic, or panromantic, and those who do not experience romantic attraction may identify as aromantic. This split between romantic and sexual orientation is commonly explained as the split attraction model, which states that romantic and sexual attraction are not strictly linked for all people. Individuals who are both aromantic and asexual are sometimes known as &quot;&quot;&quot; or &quot;aroace&quot;.

=== Gray asexuality ===
The term &quot;gray asexuality&quot;&quot; refers to the spectrum between asexuality and non-asexuality (also referred to as ). Individuals who identify as gray asexual may occasionally experience sexual attraction, or only experience sexual attraction as a secondary component once a reasonably stable or large emotional connection has been formed with the target, known as &quot;demisexuality&quot;.

== Research ==
=== Prevalence ===
Most scholars agree that asexuality is rare, constituting 1% or less of the population. Asexuality is not a new aspect of human sexuality, but it is relatively new to public discourse. In comparison to other sexualities, asexuality has received little attention from the scientific community, with quantitative information about the prevalence of asexuality low in numbers. S. E. Smith of &quot;The Guardian&quot; is not sure asexuality has actually increased; he instead leans toward the belief that it is simply more visible. Alfred Kinsey rated individuals from 0 to 6 according to their sexual orientation from heterosexual to homosexual, known as the Kinsey scale. He also included a category he called &quot;X&quot; for individuals with &quot;no socio-sexual contacts or reactions.&quot; Although, in modern times, this is categorized as representing asexuality, scholar Justin J. Lehmiller stated, &quot;the Kinsey X classification emphasized a lack of sexual behavior, whereas the modern definition of asexuality emphasizes a lack of sexual attraction. As such, the Kinsey Scale may not be sufficient for accurate classification of asexuality.&quot; Kinsey labeled 1.5% of the adult male population as &quot;X&quot;. In his second book, &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;, he reported this breakdown of individuals who are X: unmarried females = 14–19%, married females = 1–3%, previously married females = 5–8%, unmarried males = 3–4%, married males = 0%, and previously married males = 1–2%.

Further empirical data about an asexual demographic appeared in 1994 when a research team in the United Kingdom carried out a comprehensive survey of 18,876 British residents, spurred by the need for sexual information in the wake of the AIDS pandemic. The survey included a question on sexual attraction, to which 1.05% of the respondents replied that they had &quot;never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all.&quot; The study of this phenomenon was continued by Canadian sexuality researcher Anthony Bogaert in 2004, who explored the asexual demographic in a series of studies. Bogaert&#x27;s research indicated that 1% of the British population does not experience sexual attraction, but he believed that the 1% figure was not an accurate reflection of the likely much larger percentage of the population that could be identified as asexual, noting that 30% of people contacted for the initial survey chose not to participate in the survey. Since less sexually experienced people are more likely to refuse to participate in studies about sexuality, and asexuals tend to be less sexually experienced than allosexuals, asexuals were likely under-represented in the responding participants. The same study found the number of homosexuals and bisexuals combined to be about 1.1% of the population, which is much smaller than other studies indicate.

Contrasting Bogaert&#x27;s 1% figure, a study by Aicken et al., published in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000 to 2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for the age range 16–44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction.

In a survey conducted by YouGov in 2015, 1,632 British adults were asked to try to place themselves on the Kinsey scale. 1% of participants answered &quot;No sexuality&quot;. The breakdown of participants was 0% men, 2% women, and 1% across all age ranges.

=== Sexual orientation, mental health and cause ===
There is significant debate over whether or not asexuality is a sexual orientation. It has been compared and equated with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), a diagnosis which was in the DSM-4, in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone; HSDD has been used to medicalize asexuality, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a sexual dysfunction (such as anorgasmia, anhedonia, etc.), because it does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially. Unlike people with HSDD, asexual people normally do not experience &quot;marked distress&quot; and &quot;interpersonal difficulty&quot; concerning feelings about their sexuality, or generally a lack of sexual arousal; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic. One study found that, compared to HSDD subjects, asexuals reported lower levels of sexual desire, sexual experience, sex-related distress, and depressive symptoms. Researchers Richards and Barker report that asexuals do not have disproportionate rates of alexithymia, depression, or personality disorders. Some people, however, may identify as asexual even if their non-sexual state is explained by one or more of the aforementioned disorders.

Since the release of the DSM-5 in 2013, which split HSDD into diagnoses for female sexual arousal disorder and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, both disorders have been criticised for similar issues to HSDD. Although the DSM-5 mentions asexuality as an exclusion criterion for these two disorders, individuals must self-identify as asexual to meet the differential diagnosis and this requirement has been criticised for imposing a diagnosis on people who are possibly asexual but do not yet identify as such. , HSDD continues to be used to describe transgender women.

The first study that gave empirical data about asexuals was published in 1983 by Paula Nurius concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. 689 subjects—most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes—were given several surveys, including four clinical well-being scales. Results showed that asexuals were more likely to have low self-esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations: 25.88% of heterosexuals, 26.54% of bisexuals (called &quot;ambisexuals&quot;), 29.88% of homosexuals, and 33.57% of asexuals were reported to have problems with self-esteem. A similar trend existed for depression. For various reasons, Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions could be drawn from this.

In a 2013 study, Yule et al. looked into mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female participants were included in the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants were more likely to report having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesized that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.

With regard to sexual orientation categories, asexuality may be argued as not being a meaningful category to add to the continuum and instead argued as the lack of sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one&#x27;s natural sexuality and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety, or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.

The suggestion that asexuality is a sexual dysfunction is controversial among the asexual community. Those who identify as asexual usually prefer it to be recognized as a sexual orientation. Scholars who argue that asexuality is a sexual orientation may point to the existence of different sexual preferences. They and many asexual people believe that the lack of sexual attraction is valid enough to be categorized as a sexual orientation. The researchers argue that asexuals do not choose to have no sexual desire and generally start to find out their differences in sexual behaviors around adolescence. Because of these facts coming to light, it is reasoned that asexuality is more than a behavioral choice and is not something that can be cured like a disorder. There is also analysis on whether identifying as asexual is becoming more popular.

Research on the etiology of sexual orientation when applied to asexuality has the definitional problem of sexual orientation not consistently being defined by researchers as including asexuality. While heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality are usually, but not always, determined during the early years of preadolescent life, it is not known when asexuality is determined. &quot;It is unclear whether these characteristics [&quot;viz.&quot;, &quot;lacking interest in or desire for sex&quot;] are thought to be lifelong, or if they may be acquired.&quot;

One criterion usually taken to define a sexual orientation is that it is stable over time. In a 2016 analysis in the &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot;, Brotto et al. found &quot;only weak support&quot; for this criterion being met among asexual individuals. An analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health by Stephen Cranney found that, of 14 individuals who reported no sexual attraction in the study&#x27;s third wave (when subjects ranged in age from 18 to 26), only 3 continued to identify in this way at the fourth wave, six years later. However, Cranney notes that asexual identification in the third wave was still significant as a predictor of asexual identification in the subsequent wave. In a subsequent commentary, Cranney stated that the interpretation of this data was complicated by the absence of any &quot;set quantitative standard for how long a sexual desire must last before it is considered stable or intrinsic enough to be considered an orientation&quot;.

=== Sexual activity and sexuality ===
While some asexuals masturbate as a solitary form of release or have sex for the benefit of a romantic partner, others do not (see above). Fischer et al. reported that &quot;scholars who study the physiology of asexuality suggest that people who are asexual are capable of genital arousal but may experience difficulty with so-called subjective arousal.&quot; This means that &quot;while the body becomes aroused, subjectively – at the level of the mind and emotions – one does not experience arousal.&quot;

The Kinsey Institute sponsored another small survey on the topic in 2007, which found that self-identified asexuals &quot;reported significantly less desire for sex with a partner, lower sexual arousability, and lower sexual excitation but did not differ consistently from non-asexuals in their sexual inhibition scores or their desire to masturbate.&quot;

A 1977 paper titled &quot;Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups&quot;, by Myra T. Johnson, is explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans. Johnson defines asexuals as those men and women &quot;who, regardless of physical or emotional condition, actual sexual history, and marital status or ideological orientation, seem to &quot;prefer&quot; not to engage in sexual activity.&quot; She contrasts autoerotic women with asexual women: &quot;The asexual woman ... has no sexual desires at all [but] the autoerotic woman ... recognizes such desires but prefers to satisfy them alone.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s evidence is mostly letters to the editor found in women&#x27;s magazines written by asexual/autoerotic women. She portrays them as invisible, &quot;oppressed by a consensus that they are non-existent,&quot; and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement. Johnson argued that society either ignores or denies their existence or insists they must be ascetic for religious reasons, neurotic, or asexual for political reasons.

In a study published in 1979 in volume five of &quot;Advances in the Study of Affect&quot;, as well as in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot;, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey&#x27;s model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.

In a 1983 study by Paula Nurius, which included 689 subjects (most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes), the two-dimensional fantasizing and eroticism scale was used to measure sexual orientation. Based on the results, respondents were given a score ranging from 0 to 100 for hetero-eroticism and from 0 to 100 for homo-eroticism. Respondents who scored lower than 10 on both were labeled &quot;asexual&quot;. This consisted of 5% of the males and 10% of the females. Results showed that asexuals reported much lower frequency and desired frequency of a variety of sexual activities, including having multiple partners, anal sexual activities, having sexual encounters in a variety of locations, and autoerotic activities.

=== Feminist research ===
The field of asexuality studies is still emerging as a subset of the broader field of gender and sexuality studies. Notable researchers who have produced significant works in asexuality studies include KJ Cerankowski, Ela Przybylo, and CJ DeLuzio Chasin.

A 2010 paper written by KJ Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled &quot;New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice&quot;, suggests that asexuality may be somewhat of a question in itself for the studies of gender and sexuality. Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex, which is generally accepted by society to be the most basic of instincts. Their &quot;New Orientations&quot; paper states that society has deemed &quot;[LGBT and] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro-sex feminism [in which it is] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities.&quot; In addition to accepting self-identification as asexual, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher Simon LeVay&#x27;s blind study of the hypothalamus in gay men, women, and straight men, which indicates that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men.

In 2014, Cerankowski and Milks edited and published &quot;Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives&quot;, a collection of essays intended to explore the politics of asexuality from a feminist and queer perspective. It is broken into the introduction and then six parts: Theorizing Asexuality: New Orientations; The Politics of Asexuality; Visualizing Asexuality in Media Culture; Asexuality and Masculinity; Health, Disability, and Medicalization; and Reading Asexually: Asexual Literary Theory. Each part contains two to three papers on a given aspect of asexuality research. One such paper is written by Ela Przybylo, another name becoming common in asexual scholarly literature. Her article about the Cerankowski and Milks anthology focuses on accounts of self-identified male asexuals, with a particular focus on the pressures men experience towards having sex in dominant Western discourse and media. Three men living in Southern Ontario, Canada, were interviewed in 2011, and Przybylo admits that the small sample size means that her findings cannot be generalized to a greater population in terms of representation and that they are &quot;exploratory and provisional&quot;, especially in a field that is still lacking in theorizations. All three interviewees addressed being affected by the stereotype that men have to enjoy and want sex in order to be &quot;real men&quot;.

Another of Przybylo&#x27;s works, &quot;Asexuality and the Feminist Politics of &quot;Not Doing It&quot;&quot;, published in 2011, takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality. Pryzyblo argues that asexuality is made possible only through the Western context of &quot;sexual, coital, and heterosexual imperatives&quot;. She addresses earlier works by Dana Densmore, Valerie Solanas, and Breanne Fahs, who argued for &quot;asexuality and celibacy&quot; as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy. While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy, she considers blurring the lines between the two to be productive for a feminist understanding of the topic. In her 2013 article, &quot;Producing Facts: Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex&quot;, Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research: that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s, which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality, and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert&#x27;s 2004 study and has popularized the subject and made it more &quot;culturally visible&quot;. In this article, Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon, and continues to be critical of its scientific study. Pryzblo published a book, &quot;Asexual Erotics,&quot; in 2019. In this book, she argued that asexuality poses a &quot;paradox&quot; in that is a sexual orientation that is defined by the absence of sexual activity entirely. She distinguishes between a sociological understanding of asexuality and a cultural understanding, which she said could include &quot;the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances&quot;.

CJ DeLuzio Chasin states in &quot;Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential&quot; that academic research on asexuality &quot;has positioned asexuality in line with essentialist discourses of sexual orientation&quot; which is troublesome as it creates a binary between asexuals and persons who have been subjected to psychiatric intervention for disorders such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. Chasin says that this binary implies that all asexuals experience a lifelong (hence, enduring) lack of sexual attraction, that all non-asexuals who experience a lack of sexual desire experience distress over it, and that it pathologizes asexuals who do experience such distress. As Chasin says such diagnoses as HSDD act to medicalize and govern women&#x27;s sexuality, the article aims to &quot;unpack&quot; problematic definitions of asexuality that are harmful to both asexuals and women alike. Chasin states that asexuality has the power to challenge commonplace discourse of the naturalness of sexuality, but that the unquestioned acceptance of its current definition does not allow for this. Chasin also argues there and elsewhere in &quot;Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community: Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance&quot; that it is important to interrogate why someone might be distressed about low sexual desire. Chasin further argues that clinicians have an ethical obligation to avoid treating low sexual desire per se as pathological, and to discuss asexuality as a viable possibility (where relevant) with clients presenting clinically with low sexual desire.

=== Intersections with race and disability ===
Scholar Ianna Hawkins Owen writes, &quot;Studies of race have revealed the deployment of asexuality in the dominant discourse as an ideal sexual behavior to justify both the empowerment of whites and the subordination of blacks to uphold a racialized social and political system.&quot; This is partly due to the simultaneous sexualization and de-sexualization of black women in the Mammy archetype, as well as by how society de-sexualizes certain racial minorities, as part of a bid to claim superiority by Whites. This is co-existent with the sexualization of black female bodies in the Jezebel archetype, both utilized to justify slavery and enable further control. Owen also criticizes the &quot;...investment in constructing asexuality upon a white racial rubric (who else can claim access to being just like everyone else?)&quot;. Ben Brandley and Angela Labrador argue that asexual identity may be more accessible to white people than people of color because of how people of color are sexualized. Michael Paramo argues in an article for &quot;Aze&quot; that this can create a &quot;cyclical perception&quot; that the asexual community is dominated by white people which can make people of color continue to feel excluded from it.

Karen Cuthbert comments on &quot;providing the first empirically grounded discussion of this intersection of asexuality and disability (and to a lesser extent gender and &#x27;race&#x27;).&quot; Eunjung Kim comments on the intersections between disability or crip theory and asexuality, saying disabled people are more frequently de-sexualized. Disabled people who are also asexual have stated that they can feel invisible because of this since they must navigate these assumptions both within the asexual and disabled communities and outside of them. Anna Kurowicka notes that asexual people may sometimes reject the notion that their asexuality is related to disability in an effort to avoid unwanted medical intervention. At the same time, disabled people may reject the assumption that they are inherently asexual. Kurowicka argues that contemporary discourses should trouble the desire to separate asexuality and disability that is rooted in compulsory sexuality.

=== Bogaert&#x27;s psychological work and theories ===
Bogaert argues that understanding asexuality is of key importance to understanding sexuality in general. For his work, Bogaert defines asexuality as &quot;a lack of lustful inclinations/feelings directed toward others,&quot; a definition that he argues is relatively new in light of recent theory and empirical work on sexual orientation. This definition of &quot;asexuality&quot; also makes clear this distinction between behavior and desire, for both asexuality and celibacy, although Bogaert also notes that there is some evidence of reduced sexual activity for those who fit this definition. He further distinguishes between desire for others and desire for sexual stimulation, the latter of which is not always absent for those who identify as asexual, although he acknowledges that other theorists define asexuality differently and that further research needs to be done on the &quot;complex relationship between attraction and desire&quot;. Another distinction is made between romantic and sexual attraction, and he draws on work from developmental psychology, which suggests that romantic systems derive from attachment theory while sexual systems &quot;primarily reside in different brain structures&quot;.

Concurrent with Bogaert&#x27;s suggestion that understanding asexuality will lead to a better understanding of sexuality overall, he discusses the topic of asexual masturbation to theorize on asexuals and &quot;&#x27;target-oriented&#x27; paraphilia, in which there is an inversion, reversal, or disconnection between the self and the typical target/object of sexual interest/attraction&quot; (such as attraction to oneself, labelled &quot;automonosexualism&quot;).

In an earlier 2006 article, Bogaert acknowledges that a distinction between behavior and attraction has been accepted into recent conceptualizations of sexual orientation, which aids in positioning asexuality as such. He adds that, by this framework, &quot;(subjective) sexual attraction is the psychological core of sexual orientation&quot;, and also addresses that there may be &quot;some skepticism in [both] the academic and clinical communities&quot; about classifying asexuality as a sexual orientation, and that it raises two objections to such a classification: First, he suggests that there could be an issue with self-reporting (i.e., &quot;a &#x27;perceived&#x27; or &#x27;reported&#x27; lack of attraction&quot;, particularly for definitions of sexual orientation that consider physical arousal over subjective attraction), and, second, he raises the issue of overlap between absent and &quot;very&quot; &quot;low&quot; sexual desire, as those with an extremely low desire may still have an &quot;underlying sexual orientation&quot; despite potentially identifying as asexual.

== Community ==

The history of the asexual community is presently undocumented in academic work. Although several private websites for those who fall under the modern definition of asexuality existed online in the 1990s, scholars believe that it was not until the early 21st century when a community of self-identified asexuals began to form, aided by the popularity of online communities. Several small communities existed online, such as the &quot;Leather Spinsters&quot;, &quot;Nonolibidoism Society&quot;, and &quot;Haven for the Human Amoeba&quot;, documented by Volkmar Sigusch. In 2001, activist David Jay founded the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), whose stated goals are &quot;creating public acceptance and discussion of asexuality and facilitating the growth of an asexual community&quot;.

Some asexuals believe that participation in an asexual community is an important resource, as they often report feeling ostracized in broader society. Communities such as AVEN can be beneficial to those in search of answers when questioning their sexual orientation, such as providing support if one feels their lack of sexual attraction constitutes a disease. Online asexual communities can also serve to inform others about asexuality. However, affiliating with online communities among asexual people vary. Some question the purpose of online communities, while others heavily depend on them for support. According to Elizabeth Abbott, asexuality has always been present in society, though asexual people kept a lower profile. She further stated that while the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval times, and has been sometimes used as grounds to terminate a marriage, though asexuality has never been illegal, unlike homosexuality. However, the recent growth of online communication and social networking as facilitated the growth of a community built upon a common asexual identity.

=== Symbols ===
 
In 2009, AVEN members participated in the first asexual entry into an American pride parade at the San Francisco Pride Parade. In 2010, after a period of debate surrounding the existence of a pride flag to represent asexuality, as well as a system to create one, the asexual pride flag was formally announced. The final design was a popular design, and received the most votes in an online open-access poll. The flag&#x27;s colors—four horizontal stripes of black, gray, white, and purple from top to bottom—represent asexuality, gray-asexuality, allosexuality, and community, respectively. They have also since been used as a representation of asexuality as a whole. Some members of the asexual community additionally opt to wear a black ring on their right middle finger, colloquially known as an &quot;ace ring&quot;, as a form of identification. Some asexuals use ace playing card suits as identities of their romantic orientation, such as the ace of spades for aromanticism and the ace of hearts for non-aromanticism.

=== Events ===
On June 29, 2014, AVEN organized the second International Asexuality Conference, as an affiliate WorldPride event in Toronto. The first was held at the 2012 World Pride in London. The second such event, which was attended by around 250 people, was the largest gathering of asexuals to date. The conference included presentations, discussions, and workshops on topics such as research on asexuality, asexual relationships, and intersecting identities.

 (formerly Asexual Awareness Week) occurs on the last full week in October. It is an awareness period that was created to celebrate and bring awareness to asexuality (including grey asexuality). It was founded by Sara Beth Brooks in 2010.

 (IAD) is an annual celebration of the asexuality community that takes place on 6 April. The intention for the day is &quot;to place a special emphasis on the international community, going beyond the anglophone and Western sphere that has so far had the most coverage&quot;. An international committee spent a little under a year preparing the event, as well as publishing a website and press materials. This committee settled on the date of 6 April to avoid clashing with as many significant dates around the world as possible, although this date is subject to review and may change in future years. The first International Asexuality Day was celebrated in 2021 and involved asexuality organizations from at least 26 countries. Activities included virtual meetups, advocacy programs both online and offline, and the sharing of stories in various art-forms.

== Religion ==
Studies have found no significant statistical correlation between religion and asexuality, with asexuality occurring with equal prevalence in both religious and irreligious individuals. Asexuality is more common among celibate clergy, as non-asexuals are more likely to be discouraged by vows of chastity. According to Aicken &quot;et al.&quot;, a higher proportion of Muslim respondents reported that they did not experience any form of sexual attraction compared to Christian respondents.

Because the application of the term &quot;asexuality&quot; is relatively recent, most religions do not have clear stances on it.

In , Jesus mentions &quot;For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others – and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.&quot; Some biblical exegetes have interpreted the &quot;eunuchs who were born that way&quot; as including asexuals. While Christianity has not directly mentioned asexuality, it has revered celibacy; the apostle Paul, writing as a celibate, has been described by some writers as asexual. He writes in ,

== Discrimination and legal protections ==
A 2012 study published in &quot;Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations&quot; reported that asexuals are evaluated more negatively in terms of prejudice, dehumanization and discrimination than other sexual minorities, such as gay men, lesbians and bisexuals. Both homosexual and heterosexual people thought of asexuals as not only cold, but also animalistic and unrestrained. A different study, however, found little evidence of serious discrimination against asexuals because of their asexuality. Asexual activist, author, and blogger Julie Decker has observed that sexual harassment and violence, such as corrective rape, commonly victimizes the asexual community. Sociologist Mark Carrigan sees a middle ground, arguing that while asexuals do often experience discrimination, it is not of a phobic nature but &quot;more about marginalization because people genuinely don&#x27;t understand asexuality.&quot;

Asexuals also face prejudice from the LGBT community. Many LGBT people assume that anyone who is not homosexual or bisexual must be straight and frequently exclude asexuals from their definitions of &quot;queer&quot;. Although many well-known organizations devoted to aiding LGBTQ communities exist, these organizations generally do not reach out to asexuals and do not provide library materials about asexuality. Upon coming out as asexual, activist Sara Beth Brooks was told by many LGBT people that asexuals are mistaken in their self-identification and seek undeserved attention within the social justice movement. Other LGBT organizations, such as The Trevor Project and the National LGBTQ Task Force, explicitly include asexuals because they are non-heterosexual and can therefore be included in the definition of queer. Some organizations now add an A to the LGBTQ acronym to include asexuals; however, this is still a controversial topic in some queer organizations.

In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. Since 1999, Brazil has banned pathologization or attempted treatment of sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, and the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically attract the attention of the public or major scrutiny; therefore, it has not been the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.

== In media ==
Asexual representation in media is limited and rarely openly acknowledged or confirmed by creators or authors. In works composed prior to the beginning of the twenty-first century, characters are generally automatically assumed to be sexual and the existence of a character&#x27;s sexuality is usually never questioned. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle portrayed his character Sherlock Holmes as what would today be classified as asexual, with the intention to characterize him as solely driven by intellect and immune to the desires of the flesh. The Archie Comics character Jughead Jones was likely intended by his creators as an asexual foil to Archie&#x27;s excessive heterosexuality, but, over the years, this portrayal shifted, with various iterations and reboots of the series implying that he is either gay or heterosexual. In 2016, he was confirmed to be asexual in the &quot;New Riverdale&quot; Jughead comics. The writers of the 2017 television show &quot;Riverdale&quot;, based on the Archie comics, chose to depict Jughead as a heterosexual despite pleas from both fans and Jughead actor Cole Sprouse to retain Jughead&#x27;s asexuality and allow the asexual community to be represented alongside the gay and bisexual communities, both represented in the show. This decision sparked conversations about deliberate asexual erasure in the media and its consequences, especially on younger viewers.

Anthony Bogaert has classified Gilligan, the eponymous character of the 1960s television series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, as asexual. Bogaert suggests that the producers of the show likely portrayed him in this way to make him more relatable to young male viewers of the show who had not yet reached puberty and had therefore presumably not yet experienced sexual desire. Gilligan&#x27;s asexual nature also allowed the producers to orchestrate intentionally comedic situations in which Gilligan spurns the advances of attractive females. Films and television shows frequently feature attractive, but seemingly asexual, female characters who are &quot;converted&quot; to heterosexuality by the male protagonist by the end of the production. These unrealistic portrayals reflect a heterosexual male belief that all asexual women secretly desire men.

Asexuality as a sexual identity, rather than as a biological entity, became more widely discussed in the media in the beginning of the twenty-first century. The Fox Network series &quot;House&quot; represented an &quot;asexual&quot; couple in the episode &quot;Better Half&quot; (2012). However, this representation has been questioned by members of the asexual community, as the episode concluded that the man simply had a pituitary tumor that reduced his sex drive and the woman was only pretending to be asexual to please him, leading to controversy over the representation and a change.org petition for Fox Network to reconsider how it represents asexual characters in the future, stating it &quot;represented asexuality very poorly by attributing it to both medical illness and deception.&quot; Other fictional asexual characters include SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick from &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and Todd Chavez from &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; (generally well-accepted by the asexual community as positive representation).
