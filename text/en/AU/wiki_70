<text>Hank Rutherford Hill (born April 15) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Fox animated television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. He lives in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, with his family and works as the assistant manager of a local branch of Strickland Propane. He likes to drink beer, typically Alamo brand, in the alley behind his house with his friends. He is voiced by series creator Mike Judge. &quot;The Economist&quot; described Hank Hill as one of the wisest people on television, and in 1997 &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; included him on its annual list of the most influential Texans.

==Development==
When Mike Judge submitted the pilot script and drawings for &quot;King of the Hill&quot; to the Fox network, network executives advised him that Hank Hill should be younger than 49 years old, as Judge had described the character. Judge received a phone message from a network executive who told him that Hank&#x27;s age should be 32, the same age as the network&#x27;s average viewer. Judge later said, &quot;I got all angry, and then I was like, &#x27;Well, wait. It&#x27;s just a drawing.&#x27; So I just went back with the same drawing and said, &#x27;Okay, he&#x27;s 34.&#x27;&quot;

Hank has been compared to Tom Anderson, the &quot;disapproving old man&quot; who is a neighbor of the title characters on Judge&#x27;s earlier series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Television columnist Frank Wooten of &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; has written, &quot;Hank still looks and sounds like a young Mr. Anderson (beleaguered, baffled Korean War veteran of &#x27;Beavis and Butt-head&#x27;). But he&#x27;s more in touch with contemporary reality (sort of) -- and funnier.&quot; Throughout the show&#x27;s run, Hank&#x27;s character&#x27;s personality appears to primarily be built around the image of the all American, authoritarian family man. In a 2006 interview, Judge said, &quot;Originally I was going to have Hank be his [Mr. Anderson&#x27;s] son. I was kind of thinking we&#x27;d tie it into &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; as a sort of spinoff or something, but Fox said no.&quot; Greg Daniels, another creator of the program, has said that Hank Hill is &quot;based on a lot of neighbors I&#x27;ve had… He&#x27;s upset about how America is changing, and he doesn&#x27;t know what to do about it.&quot;

==Character biography==

===Early life and family===
Hank Hill was born at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York. According to the episode &quot;Yankee Hankie,&quot; Hank proudly believed he was born in Texas to Tilly Mae Hill and Cotton Lyndal Hill but finds (to his disgust and horror) that he was actually born in New York City. His mother told him she gave birth to Hank in the women&#x27;s restroom at Yankee Stadium during Cotton&#x27;s failed attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro during a rare American visit. Fidel Castro visited New York City on April 15, implying that April 15 is Hank&#x27;s birthday. After referring to himself as a native Texan for forty years, he was sad to learn he was born in New York, but over time, accepted his heritage when he realized that many of the Alamo heroes were not from Texas, either. Hank, who previously thought he was an only child, finds out he has a Japanese half brother named Junichiro in the episode &quot;Returning Japanese&quot;. This is due to an affair Cotton Hill had with his Japanese nurse while recovering from leg injuries in post-World War II Japan. Also, in the episode &quot;Hank Gets Dusted&quot;, Hank is shown to be the cousin of ZZ Top bassist and vocalist Dusty Hill.

Hank is an Eagle Scout. Hank is set in his ways and afraid of taking risks, but generally a good person. Although he is traditionally conservative in his attitude, in how he dislikes change and novel situations, he can adapt to them quite well, quickly mastering unfamiliar social milieus. He can be pushed too far on occasion, usually by his son, Bobby, and neighbors Bill Dauterive, Dale Gribble, and, (to a lesser extent) Boomhauer.
Most openings of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; start with Hank, Dale, Bill and Boomhauer all agreeing to something before the action kicks in, drinking from Alamo branded beer cans. A running joke throughout the series is an angry Hank yelling &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kick your ass!&quot; This is just a threat; he rarely, if ever, harms anyone, though he has literally kicked at least two people in the posterior out of anger (an acupuncturist in &quot;Hank&#x27;s Unmentionable Problem&quot; and Jimmy Wichard in &quot;Life in the Fast Lane: Bobby&#x27;s Saga&quot;). Hank&#x27;s honesty and naivety often get him in unpredictable and troublesome situations. Ultimately, Hank cares for the people around him, particularly his family and friends and is always out to do what is right. One characteristic that Hank shows is when he lies to someone, he turns his head or looks around the room.

===Working life===
Hank is a known workaholic and workplace overachiever who sells &quot;propane and propane accessories&quot; as an assistant manager at the fictional Strickland Propane, a local propane dealership. He refuses to miss a day or take time off for anything, including sickness or injury, which occasionally frustrates his boss, Buck Strickland. Examples of this devotion to work are seen in &quot;Little Horrors of Shop,&quot; where Hank admits to taking the day off for Bobby&#x27;s birth despite not being sick (and voluntarily coming in that Saturday to make up for it); in that same episode, he shows great discomfort at taking a mandatory two-week vacation (fearing that he might be &quot;found dead, not working&quot;) and struggles to fill his time off with other activities. In &quot;Hank and the Great Glass Elevator,&quot; he refuses to leave work 10 minutes early on a Friday, instead sitting patiently at his desk until exactly 5:00 despite having no work to do. In &quot;Hank&#x27;s Back&quot;, he refused to go on Worker&#x27;s Compensation after injuring his back on the job, despite repeated attempts at suggesting too much work will make him sloppy. Despite this hypervigilant work ethic, in &quot;Hank Gets Dusted&quot; he does imply he would have taken bereavement leave when his hero Tom Landry died, expressing dismay that he went into work anyway because he believed his cousin Dusty Hill was simply making up the news as a practical joke. When Hank gets a phone call in the middle of the night, he often immediately starts with the Strickland slogan, &quot;Strickland Propane, taste the meat, not the heat&quot;, showing his dedication to his work. Hank also has a habit of announcing himself as &quot;Hank Hill, Assistant Manager, Strickland Propane&quot;, even in situations where it has nothing to do with his work such as when called on to give a speech as Patch Boomhauer&#x27;s best man at his wedding rehearsal dinner. Hank&#x27;s family is well aware of his devotion to propane; he refers to the gas as &#x27;sweet lady propane&#x27;, acknowledging that he and his wife Peggy have an agreement on the matter. Peggy herself has referred to herself as a &#x27;propane wife&#x27;.

He was briefly promoted to manager when Buck&#x27;s wife/ex-wife (affectionately referred to as &quot;Miz Liz&quot;) temporarily took over Strickland Propane. Hank was also briefly promoted to manager by Buck Strickland while helping Buck rebuild a house for Habitat for Humanity as part of Buck&#x27;s community service after a drunk driving conviction, before being demoted again after he blurted out &quot;I love you&quot; to Buck. Unlike Buck and his business enemy, Milton Farnsworth &quot;M.F.&quot; Thatherton, Hank believes that selling propane through honesty and hard work is what life is all about. Hank won the Propane Salesman of the Year Award for three years, as well as the prestigious Blue Flame of Valor Award. His greatest attribute is his reliability. Another trait of Hank appears to be customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. While appearing to suffer a sales slump during the month-long &quot;Grill Stravaganza&quot; sale, he remained confident his sales would come in at the end of the month, trusting his tried and true method of giving customers pamphlets and simply telling them to return if and only if they&#x27;re &quot;ready.&quot; Despite this, he managed to sell more propane than anyone else at Strickland in a single day by simply giving one customer that pamphlet; he later sold that single customer 500 units, and in doing so won the sales for the Grill Stravaganza. Strickland has referred to Hank as his golden goose. This virtue was tested when he threatened to quit rather than continue working at a carwash (which Buck and Kahn bought stake in) and continue to take verbal abuse. He also threatened to quit unless Buck fired a new employee who was making crude jokes and sexual innuendo (eventually in frustration, Hank actually dragged the new employee into the washroom and washed his mouth out with soap). Hank&#x27;s work ethic extends past his occupation. He is a noted DIY enthusiast. The meticulous detail to which he maintains his home was reflected when he opted to submit it for Parade of Homes.

Hank looks up to Buck, who calls Hank &quot;Ol&#x27; Top&quot;. And Hank keeps a somewhat idyllic picture of Buck, even though he recognizes his boss&#x27;s many shortcomings (excessive gambling, alcoholism, womanizing, and a general lack of principles). Hank must frequently clean up his boss&#x27;s unsavory &quot;situations&quot;: bailing him out of jail, facilitating his vices, and performing suspicious errands. In one episode he went as far as covering up Strickland&#x27;s illegal price fixing agreement with the other local propane providers to keep him from being arrested. Hank also seems to think that being a propane salesman is the best job there is (and wants his son, Bobby Hill, to follow his footsteps and start a propane business of his own). Hank loves his job very much, but throughout the series always makes a big deal out of it when his closest friends and even family find his occupation boring and somewhat useless and even find his obsession with propane odd. In the episode &quot;A Fire Fighting We Will Go,&quot; Bobby questions Hank about his new job as a volunteer fireman, in which Bobby says he is surprised because Hank always seems to exaggerate and make a big deal about being a propane salesman.

===Personal life===
In the first episode of the series, his wife Peggy Hill prompts Hank to tell their son that he loves him. After he finally manages to do so, Bobby says that he thought of himself as a &quot;big disappointment,&quot; which Hank immediately rejects, earnestly declaring that Bobby is the one thing in town that has never disappointed him. Although Hank is often confused and irritated by Bobby&#x27;s eccentricities, he clearly loves his son, even though he&#x27;s uncomfortable in saying it to his face. He even feigns an interest in Bobby&#x27;s passions such as prop comedy and theatre. Hank is relieved when his Laotian-American neighbor Kahn Souphanousinphone tells him that he caught Bobby and Connie taking their clothes off since, up until that time, Hank was uncertain of Bobby&#x27;s interest in girls. From his eccentricities, Hank often says of Bobby, &quot;That boy ain&#x27;t right. I tell you what.”

Hank suffers from a fictional genetic disorder called Diminished Gluteal Syndrome (DGS). His essentially non-existent buttocks provide insufficient cushioning when he sits, causing him great discomfort and eventually forcing him to wear an &quot;ortho-gluteal&quot; prosthesis. A running gag throughout the series is that Hank and Peggy would have more kids if not for Hank&#x27;s narrow urethra, a topic Hank is sensitive about and often becomes annoyed about if brought up to people outside the immediate family.

Hank was on the high school football team (as were Bill, Boomhauer, and team towel manager, Dale). He was a running back and led the league in rushing (his record remains unbroken). He had a promising career until he snapped his ankle in the state championship (although this cost Arlen the game, he is still celebrated for &quot;taking them to State&quot;). This incident exacerbated Hank&#x27;s already-restrained emotionalism, as he saw it as punishment from God for doing a celebratory dance after scoring a touchdown earlier during the game. After graduating from high school, he went on to work as a salesman at Jeans West, a clothing retailer, until Buck found that he was a good salesman and hired him at Strickland Propane, where he taught Hank everything about propane and propane accessories. According to his neighbor Dale, he also had a brief stint as a tractor salesman.

Although his career in propane is later shown to have started with a chance meeting with Buck Strickland, in episode &quot;Order of the Straight Arrow&quot;, a flashback to 1965 shows younger Hank, Dale, Bill and Boomhauer on a scouting trip, talking about what they&#x27;re going to do when they grow up. Hank says, &quot;I&#x27;m going to sell propane and propane accessories... if my grades are good enough,&quot; which is confusing since he met Buck at Jeans West, although it can be explained if Hank mistakenly puts in his adult passion for propane into memories from his childhood, or it may have been possible that Hank had to work at Jeans West due to a tight job market and his goal of working in propane was finally realized with the sale to Buck. This same episode reveals that boys entering the Order are 12 years old, which would give Hank a birth date of sometime in 1953. In the second-season episode, &quot;Hank&#x27;s Dirty Laundry,&quot; Hank himself states his birth year as 1953.

Hank drives a red Ford Super Duty, which replaced his original truck, a red SuperCab Ford Ranger (1983 or 1993 model depends on the episodes) after it was destroyed by a train, despite trying to make it last as long as mechanically possible. Both trucks have manual transmissions while the Ranger carries a bed mounted toolbox for times when Hank takes his truck out on Strickland-related business. He gives great love and affection to his lawn and his bloodhound, Ladybird. In one episode, Peggy is bitter for throwing a special birthday party for Ladybird but not for herself, where it is implied in some episodes she believes Hank spends more time with Ladybird and being house proud than he does with her, as suggested in another episode where he mourns over his sub-par lawn compared to his neighbors, remarking. &quot;I put so much work into this, my sweat, blood, tears, all the tender feelings I&#x27;ve kept from my family.&quot;

Hank&#x27;s idol is outlaw country singer Willie Nelson (despite multiple differences between the personalities and lifestyles of the two), and he also plays a 1963 Guild Solid Top acoustic guitar named Betsy in his Bluegrass band. Hank is a fan of Country and Bluegrass music. Occasionally, he will listen to Southern rock music and in one episode, remarks that he likes &quot;this Zamfir fellow,&quot; even believing that his music was better than the Beatles. He considers his cousin Dusty&#x27;s band ZZ Top to be a family shame. Another episode shows that Hank and his friends seem to like the song &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; by Red Sovine. In another, he had also shown approval towards Doo-wop. He also appears to have a soft spot for Foreigner, as on Luanne&#x27;s 21st birthday he put &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; on the jukebox six times in a row. Hank seems to dislike Christian Rock music, as in &quot;Reborn To Be Wild&quot;, Hank told Bobby&#x27;s youth group leader, &quot;You&#x27;re not making Christianity better, you&#x27;re just making Rock &amp; roll worse&quot;. He took a slight interest in boyband music namely due to their lack of explicit lyrics compared to obscenity-filled rap and failing to understand the demographic the music was meant for.

Hank is 6&#x27;2&quot;, as shown on his driver&#x27;s license.

==Personality==
Much of the humor of the show results from the collision of Hank&#x27;s deeply conservative manner, nature, and philosophy with the world and people around him. He is uncomfortable with intimacy and with expressions of affection or sexuality (as demonstrated by the running joke throughout the series, in which Hank is extremely averse and overreacts to physical contact or anything sexual concerning his niece, Luanne), but he has a healthy relationship with his wife, as well as the rest of his family, except his father. He believes passionately in hard work, honesty, tradition, responsibility, and convention (he refuses to leave work early, even so much as 10 minutes early on a Friday); and is a proud Texan and American always trying his best to see others, regardless of culture, for their personal character. He is, however, a highly respected authority among his friends and family, who often seek his help and advice, knowing that he will always advocate doing the right thing in the right way.

Hank is against charcoal, butane (which he refers to as a &quot;bastard gas&quot;) and the use of propane alternatives (such as electric water-heaters, heaters, stoves and ovens). Hank believes that propane is the best source of fuel and is known to try to &quot;convert&quot; people to propane use. When niece Luanne Platter uses charcoal on burgers at a barbecue, Peggy and Bobby find them delicious and eat them all: they are horrified to learn that they enjoy charcoal grilling. Hank&#x27;s love for propane is sometimes shown in an ironic juxtaposition with his love of all things Texas, for example being introduced to mesquite, a traditional Texan barbecue wood, by his immigrant neighbor Kahn.

One of Hank&#x27;s most treasured hobbies is the care he takes over his lawn. He&#x27;s unofficially nominated the best lawn in the neighborhood. He rides a fictional &quot;Mason&quot; 1500 series Riding mower, a mower he also covets to the point when the Mason Corporation undertook the focus group discontinuing his model in favor of a new one, he managed to point out all the flaws in the engineering and convince the group the mower was inferior. In the episode &quot;King of the Ant Hill&quot; with Cinco de Mayo approaching, Hank purchases an exorbitant new lawn of Raleigh St. Augustine sod for $1.25 per square foot, which Dale destroys with fire ants as an act of revenge to Hank for terminating his exterminating services. Just as Hank is about to attack him to a physical fight in payback for ruining his lawn, Dale redeems himself by saving Bobby from the fire ants, who attacked him for confining them. His friends and neighbors gifted him with a few square feet of new Raleigh, albeit only enough to cover a small fraction of his front yard. When he converted his back yard into a putting green, he installed kikuyu grass. In only one episode did Hank purposely allow his lawn to die; when water restrictions and a drought forced Hank to run for public office on a platform opposing the city water policy which wasted more water than it saved. He later discovered Kahn was bribing the water department employee to keep his lawn green and Bobby blackmailed him to keep Hank&#x27;s lawn from dying. Refusing to be corrupt, he ceased watering. Hank has also states that he has held back &quot;tender feelings&quot; towards his family in order to focus on the lawn.

Hank resides in a single-story rancher, which he claims has historic value. He is a noted do it yourself (DIY) enthusiast and prides himself on homeownership, to the point where he completely distrusts repairmen and refuses initially to call them during times of crisis, even during a few incidents where he was unable to solve the problem on his own. He is skilled in home repair, lawn and garden and automotive repair. He meticulously obeys virtually every building code in the city ordinance. He gets a great deal of joy engaging in home repair and his level of skill (and attention to detail) was repeatedly shown to exceed that of workmen he employed.

Hank is also a follower of sports. He is a huge fan of football, being a former player himself. He is a long-time fan of the Dallas Cowboys, but later allows himself to also be a fan of the Houston Texans because they play in a different conference and wouldn&#x27;t play the Cowboys unless it was in an all-Texas Super Bowl. Contemplating the possibility, Hank states dreamily &quot;An all-Texas Super Bowl.. His will be done&quot;. Hank also is a supporter of the Texas Longhorns. He also follows baseball as a fan of the Texas Rangers, although in &quot;Meet The Manger Babies&quot;, he stated that he would rather miss a baseball game than the Super Bowl to help Luanne with her puppet show. However, his idyllic passion is golf which coincides with his love of lawns. He once converted his back yard into a putting green. He is, however, critical of some sports. He is critical of soccer, claiming to Bobby &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I ever needed to tell you this, but I would be a bad parent if I didn&#x27;t; soccer was invented by European ladies to keep them busy while their husbands did the cooking&quot;. He also hates tennis and appears to hate ice hockey as well.

While more of a stereotypical Southern redneck in earlier episodes, for example, idolizing outlaw singer Willie Nelson, Hank becomes more of a small town, middle-class conservative who is extremely law-abiding. Everybody looks to Hank when they have any seemingly useless or dull work that needs to be done. His gruff, temperamental, and impartial tendencies have been challenged a few times throughout the series, during which Hank always proves himself to be on top of his game. When his dog Ladybird attacked a black repairman named Mack (voiced by Bernie Mac) working on their heating system, he was accused of being racist and portraying those feelings onto his dog, though it was later proven that he is not racist but that in fact he hates repairmen, as he prides himself on proper home maintenance. Before Ladybird had attacked Mack, Hank had told him that &quot;A man should not be judged by the color of his skin but by the actions of his heart&quot;. He prides himself on having taken auto-shop in high school and refuses to let mechanics touch his truck, feeling that he can accomplish anything without help. Hank has briefly worked at Mega-Lo Mart as a propane salesman trainee after Mega-Lo Mart drove Strickland Propane out of business. Hank&#x27;s reserved nature probably resulted from years of verbal abuse from his war-veteran father Cotton Hill. However, if sufficiently provoked, Hank has proven not to be a pushover, often ending disputes with his self-popularized quote &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kick your ass!&quot; (though he rarely follows through on this threat). He is also staunchly pro-Texas. In the episode &quot;Texas City Twister,&quot; in which a tornado has torn off all his clothes, he is given the choice of covering himself with the Texas flag or a potted cactus. With barely a thought, he chooses the cactus, thereby sparing the flag.

He is for the most part an outspoken conservative (he once said dreamily that he missed voting for Ronald Reagan). He was initially a huge fan of George W. Bush, but after discovering he had a weak handshake, Hank suffered a crisis of conscience and was unsure if he could still vote for the man. Hank is a registered Republican, but has respect for some old-school Democrats such as fellow Texan and former US President Lyndon B. Johnson. His purebred Georgia bloodhound Ladybird is named after the wife of President Johnson, former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, Hank has made mention that Ladybird&#x27;s mom helped track down James Earl Ray, assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after an attempted prison escape. However, Hank also shows deference to Jimmy Carter when they meet (though he later refers to him as a &quot;one-termer&quot;) and greatly respects former Democratic Texas Governor Ann Richards (although he displays great respect for, and deference to, all authority figures, but the respect was most likely the result of Hank&#x27;s great liking of Texas culture and history as mentioned throughout the show). He has also expressed support for labor unions.

In nearly every episode, Hank and his friends Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer will stand about in the alley behind Hank&#x27;s house, drinking Alamo beer and discussing the events of the day. When consensus is reached and at breaks in the conversation, they will give short words of agreement, such as &quot;yup&quot; or &quot;mm-hmm&quot;. He considers his wife his best friend and feels that physically punishing children is wrong; he is verbally strict, but not directly abusive. In the episode &quot;Sleight of Hank&quot;, it was revealed that Hank has a huge dislike for magicians after seeing David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear. He has shown to have chiroptophobia, the fear of bats.

Political parties aside, he is very conservative and old-fashioned, being largely ignorant (and disdainful) of new trends; several episodes involve him reluctantly dealing with subjects outside of his comfort zone, such as yoga, boybands, etc. Despite his discomfort with change and unfamiliar or awkward social situations and milieus, when his involvement is unavoidable, Hank repeatedly shows the ability to adapt to 
(and even learn from) them, even to immerse himself and become intellectually or emotionally invested in them — Hank&#x27;s surprising ability to adapt to the awkward and uncomfortable is also evident from his good relations with all three members of the Nancy Gribble love triangle. Hank is portrayed as having traditional family values and he is shown to be uncomfortable with hiring a woman to work at Strickland because she was believed to be too attractive, even though she was overqualified; instead, he hired a man for shallowly expressing a fondness for the Dallas Cowboys and a blatantly fraudulent adoration for propane. The man was later revealed to be a completely unreliable drug addict. His old-fashioned ways extend to a suspicion of new technology. He does, however, eventually get a cellphone and briefly becomes addicted to a computer game whose main character is modeled on him. In the episode &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Crack Bass&quot;, Hank made the mistake of purchasing crack cocaine he assumed was fish bait; when his liberal lawyer explained that virtually everyone including then-President Bill Clinton has consumed drugs, Hank comments, &quot;Not my president! I voted for Dole!&quot;, referencing the 1996 election.

Hank is not entirely unbending in his habits. One of them is his discovery and embrace of organic meat in the episode &quot;Raise the Steaks&quot;. He even goes as far as to defend hippies, something he seemed somewhat ashamed to do; nevertheless, he agreed with them on the superior flavor of some natural and organic food. He has also been shown to have fairly tolerant views on other religions (except perhaps Buddhism). Hank has some environmentalist leanings (though he distances himself from the movement at large), once lamenting about air pollution in Houston, opposing the building of McMansions, and running for city council on a platform of removing low-flow toilets, in part, because they wasted more water than they saved. Similarly, he seems to believe in global warming, as when Dale commented on how warmer temperatures could lead to a citrus industry in Alaska, Hank responded &quot;We live in Texas. It&#x27;s already 110 in the summer, and if it gets one degree hotter I&#x27;m gonna kick your ass!&quot; Despite his un-worldly outlook and occasional naiveté, he has been shown to be very clever in various scenarios. These include outwitting a rapacious lawyer who was attempting to sue Strickland Propane for an injury suffered on its premises by making it appear as though the injury occurred in his own law office, and forcing a veterinarian who was requiring costly and unnecessary tests for a soldier&#x27;s cat to desist (in poetic irony, Hank began informing the vet&#x27;s demanding clientele of an unneeded, but slightly superior, imaging machine the vet was unwilling to invest in). Hank also got the see-no-evil parents of a youngster who was bullying him to exert discipline by having Bobby behave exactly like their son toward them.

Hank can be gullible, as for 25 years he bought vehicles (five cars) at sticker price from Tom Hammond&#x27;s dealership, thinking they were a great deal and Hammond was a true friend. He has also been tricked because of his relative ignorance concerning drugs or subcultures. Hence he once mistakenly bought vials of crack cocaine believing they were fishing bait and in a time of stress took a hit of marijuana because he thought it was a cigarette. He once introduced a woman named Tammy Duvall (voiced by Renée Zellweger), who later turned out to be a prostitute, to several business associates, she gifted him with a feather-tipped hat while driving his father&#x27;s vintage Cadillac leading to the community to thinking that he was a pimp much to his horror. This led her former pimp, Alabaster Jones (voiced by Snoop Dogg), to believe he was her new pimp, a role he was forced to act out to rid her of him.

In &quot;Be True to Your Fool&quot;, a flashback reveals that shortly after Hank graduated from high school with his three best friends, Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer, Bill enlisted in the United States Army—a night of celebratory drinking led them to a punk bar, where the then-formidable Bill saved a drunken Hank from a beating. In gratitude, Hank stumbled off to a tattoo parlor and paid to have Bill&#x27;s name inked onto his chest before passing out. Only Boomhauer was with Hank, and, unable to persuade the proprietor to ignore Hank&#x27;s purchase, convinced him to put the tattoo in a less conspicuous place, the back of Hank&#x27;s head; Hank had completely forgotten that night, but was reminded of it while undergoing treatment for head lice in the present (an affliction caused by Bill trying to meet the school district&#x27;s head lice lady). He had the name removed out of disgust, but eventually had a jailhouse tattoo of it put on to show Bill that the two were still friends.

Hank thinks very highly of Texas. He thinks that Texas is superior to all other states in the U.S or at least Hollywood. (This is a play on the stereotype of exaggerated Texas pride.) In the episode &quot;Returning Japanese Part 1&quot;, Hank says &quot;Peggy, I&#x27;ve already chosen the country for our summer vacation, America. And the state, Texas. And the town, Denton. I don&#x27;t care what their police did to that cyclist. It&#x27;s still a great town.&quot; Later in the episode, he also says to his father Cotton, &quot;Dad, there is no other place I&#x27;d rather be,&quot; after Cotton said, &quot;Hank, you work at a gas station; fuel this thing up and fly me back to Texas!&quot;. A recurring gag throughout the series is Hank&#x27;s contempt for big cities and urban areas, once comparing a youth-oriented shopping center to &quot;Hell, or Dallas&quot;, and, regarding San Antonio, asking &quot;Why would anyone want to live there?&quot; as he and Bobby watched a weather girl screw up on camera.

==Character analysis==
Describing Hank physically, Jo Johnson has written, &quot;In keeping with [Mike] Judge&#x27;s tradition of subtlety, the character of Hank Hill is only slightly overweight, not to satisfy the stereotype of the boorish husband, but because he eats a lot of meat and drinks a lot of beer.&quot;

Palmer-Mehta notes that Hank&#x27;s &quot;fervor for selling propane and propane accessories is nearly apostolic.&quot; During their development of the character, the show&#x27;s writers did substantial research on the propane business. Over time, members of the propane industry came to view Hank Hill as a largely positive image.

Ethan Thompson writes that although Hank Hill is similar to other sitcom father figures, such as Archie Bunker from &quot;All in the Family&quot;, he is different due to his &quot;ability to acknowledge that the values and beliefs he grew up with are no longer sufficient to guide him in his roles as father, husband, friend, and employee.&quot;

&quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Matt Bai discussed Hank&#x27;s political perspective in 2005, writing, &quot;[L]ike a lot of the basically conservative voters you meet in rural America ... Hank never professes an explicit party loyalty, and he and his buddies who sip beer in the alley don&#x27;t talk like their fellow Texan Tom DeLay. If Hank votes Republican, it&#x27;s because, as a voter who cares about religious and rural values, he probably doesn&#x27;t see much choice. But Hank and his neighbors resemble many independent voters, open to proposals that challenge their assumptions about the world, as long as those ideas don&#x27;t come from someone who seems to disrespect what they believe.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; included Hank Hill on its annual &quot;Texas Twenty&quot; list of &quot;the most impressive, intriguing, and influential Texans&quot;. He was the first &quot;non-human&quot; to make the list. An accompanying mock interview described him as &quot;perhaps the most recognized Texan in the world&quot;.

Ten years later, Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore described Hank as &quot;more than ever ... a man on the spot, torn between squabbling, widening extremes. . . the man politicians always glorify in campaign speeches, but conveniently forget once they win: the ordinary guy, just trying to get by.&quot; Moore opined that Hank &quot;was a remarkable invention 10 years ago&quot; and the fact that the show was &quot;still funny and savvy&quot; a decade later was &quot;even more notable&quot;.

<doc id="154031" wikidata="Q5210461" url="?curid=154031" title="Dale Gribble">
<text>Dale Alvin Gribble is a fictional character in the Fox animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, voiced by Johnny Hardwick. A neighbor of Hank Hill, he is characterized by various eccentricities such as his paranoid belief in conspiracy theories. He often resorts to elaborate and shaky plots in lieu of physical strength, being a longtime chain smoker. He works for himself, mostly as a pest exterminator, and is a personal gun fanatic. 

==Production==
Daniel Stern was originally offered the role of Dale Gribble, but declined due to a salary dispute. Stephen Root also auditioned for the role, but later stated that &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel right&quot;; Root ultimately was cast as Bill Dauterive. The role of Dale was eventually given to Johnny Hardwick.

==Portrayal==
Hardwick has described Dale as fancying himself as a William S. Burroughs, a Hunter S. Thompson or a Jack Nicholson type who thinks he knows all the angles. He believes most tabloid stories and urban legends, distrusting virtually every authority figure.

Dale enjoys drinking beer with Hank Hill, Bill, and Boomhauer. He has other unhealthy habits such as chain-smoking cigarettes (a habit he has maintained since third grade) and drinking Mountain Dew. He has a paranoid nature, which extends to his home and family. He has coded scenarios should he ever come under threat (no matter how absurd or unlikely). His own home is rigged with various extensive security and surveillance features. Yet for all his documentation of goings-on, he never deduces that his wife, Nancy Gribble, had an affair with John Redcorn for nearly fifteen years, and that his adolescent son Joseph Gribble (who strongly resembles Redcorn) is not his biological son, but is rather Redcorn&#x27;s biological son through the aforementioned affair. Nancy has a full-time job and pays most of the family&#x27;s bills, while Dale cooks and cleans. He is seen to be a musician in some episodes.

Dale was in the same grade as Hank in school (and Hank was born in 1953). He is almost never seen without his signature Mack cap (under which he is balding) and prescription eyeglasses with sunglass lenses on a hinge except on rare occasions where he is forced to remove them. He has a slightly raspy voice. Amongst other trademark quirks and phrases, he utters &quot;G&#x27;h!&quot; when he is startled or learns something that feeds into his paranoid nature.

Dale has a conspiratorial knowledge of the workings of the U.S. government, the legal system, and bureaucracy. He uses this knowledge to assist his friends but has a habit of horribly misconstruing information. Dale is occasionally depicted attempting to construct a guard tower in his front yard. His obsession with conspiracy theories can sometimes cause him to be very selfish or double-cross his friends, although in the end he usually reconciles with them. His schemes also tend to run out of steam or collapse.

While Dale is boastful and often outgoing in his schemes, he invariably turns into a coward at the slightest sight of trouble, being quick to give up his accomplices. He typically thinks his misfortunes are malicious attacks upon him. He expresses contempt for Hank&#x27;s wife, Peggy Hill, who often tries to help him; when the two are occasionally forced to cooperate, they do so well.

Dale runs his own extermination business, Dale&#x27;s Dead-Bug, for which he drives a white Dodge Caravan nicknamed &quot;the Bug-ebago&quot;, which has a large plastic queen ant figure on the roof. He is not above resorting to explosives to deal with pesky targets.

==Reception==
The character of Dale Gribble and Hardwick&#x27;s portrayal have received positive reception. Following Hardwick&#x27;s death in August 2023, Cartoon Brew regarded Gribble as &quot;iconic&quot;, with the companies Hulu and 20th Century Animation releasing a statement after his death saying that Hardwick &quot;gave life to one of our most iconic characters&quot;. Critics and reviewers from other entertainment blogs and websites have similarly discussed the character in positive terms.

<text>Lucius Aelius Sejanus ( – 18 October AD 31), commonly known as Sejanus (), was a Roman soldier and confidant of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. Of the Equites class by birth, Sejanus rose to power as prefect of the Praetorian Guard, the imperial bodyguard, of which he was commander from AD 14 until his execution for treason in AD 31.

While the Praetorian Guard was formally established under Emperor Augustus, Sejanus introduced a number of reforms which saw the unit evolve beyond a mere bodyguard into a powerful and influential branch of the government involved in public security, civil administration and ultimately political intercession; these changes had a lasting impact on the course of the Principate.

During the 20s, Sejanus gradually accumulated power by consolidating his influence over Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor&#x27;s son Drusus Julius Caesar. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in AD 26, Sejanus was left in control of the administration of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in AD 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.

== Family ==
Sejanus was born around 20 BC at Volsinii, Etruria, into the Seia gens. His father was Lucius Seius Strabo. The Seii were Romans of the Equites class (or knights), the second-highest social class of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Sejanus&#x27;s grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with Terentia, a sister of the wife of Gaius Maecenas, who was one of Emperor Augustus&#x27; most powerful political allies.

Strabo married into equally illustrious families. One of his wives was Cosconia Gallita, sister of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis (suffect consul in AD 10) and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (suffect consul in AD 2). Sejanus was once thought to have possibly been a child of this marriage, but Ronald Syme has argued that Sejanus&#x27;s mother was a Junia Blaesa, sister of Junius Blaesus.

Sejanus&#x27;s brother Lucius Seius Tubero, who became suffect consul in AD 18, was thought to have been a paternal half-brother, from his father Strabo marrying a daughter of Quintus Aelius Tubero but Syme has rejected this, instead he believes that Lucius Seius Tubero was Junia Blaesa&#x27;s son from a marriage to Quintus Aelius Tubero whom Strabo adopted upon marrying Junia.

Sejanus was later adopted into the Aelia gens, possibly by Gaius Aelius Gallus the prefect, or Sextus Aelius Catus his half-brother&#x27;s half-brother, and by Roman custom became known as Lucius Aelius Seianus or simply as Seianus.

The adoptive family of Sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks: Quintus Aelius Tubero (consul in 11 BC) and Sextus Aelius Catus (consul in AD 4), who was the father of Aelia Paetina, the second wife of the future Emperor Claudius. Sejanus&#x27;s uncle, Junius Blaesus, distinguished himself as a military commander; he became proconsul of Africa in AD 21 and earned triumphal honors by crushing the rebellion of Tacfarinas.

According to the ancient historian Tacitus, Sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy Marcus Gavius Apicius, whose daughter may have been Sejanus&#x27;s first wife Apicata. With Apicata, Sejanus had two sons, Strabo and Capito Aelianus, and a daughter, Junilla.

== Rise to power ==

=== Praetorian prefect ===

It is likely that Sejanus&#x27;s father Strabo came to the attention of Augustus through his father&#x27;s connection with Maecenas. Sometime after 2 BC, Strabo was appointed prefect of the Praetorian Guard, one of the two most powerful positions a Roman knight could attain in the Empire. This office he carried on dutifully and without incident until the death of Augustus in AD 14. Little is known about the life Sejanus led prior to this date, but according to Tacitus, he accompanied Gaius Caesar, adopted son of Augustus, during his campaigns in Armenia in 1 BC. Upon the accession of Tiberius in AD 14, Sejanus was appointed prefect of the Praetorian Guard as the colleague of his father Strabo, and began his rise to prominence.

The Praetorian Guard was an elite unit of the Roman army formed by Augustus in 27 BC, with the specific function to serve as a bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family. Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration. Furthermore, their presence served as a constant reminder to the people and the Senate of the substantial armed force which served as the basis for the imperial power. Augustus was careful however to uphold the republican veneer of this regime, and only allowed nine cohorts to be formed (one fewer than in a normal Roman legion), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.

When Strabo was assigned to the governorship of Egypt in AD 15, Sejanus became the sole commander of the Praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the principate. In AD 20 the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into a single garrison just outside Rome and the number of cohorts was increased from nine to twelve, one of which now held the daily guard at the palace. The practice of joint leadership between two prefects was abandoned, and Sejanus himself appointed the centurions and tribunes. With these changes in effect, Sejanus now commanded the complete loyalty of a force of around 12,000 soldiers, all of which were at his immediate disposal. The facade of Augustus was no longer maintained, and Tiberius openly displayed the strength of the guard at parades.

=== Feud with Drusus ===
In his capacity as Praetorian prefect, Sejanus quickly became a trusted advisor to Tiberius. By AD 23, he exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor, who referred to Sejanus as &quot;Socius Laborum&quot; (my partner in my toils). By this time he had been raised to the rank of praetor, a position which was not normally granted to Romans of the equestrian class. A statue had been erected in his honor in the Theatre of Pompey and in the Senate his followers were advanced with public offices and governorships. His privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family, in particular earning him the enmity of Tiberius&#x27;s son Drusus Julius Caesar.

The history of Sejanus and Drusus dated back to at least AD 15. That year a mutiny had broken out among legions posted in Pannonia and Germania. While his adopted son Germanicus restored order in Germania, Tiberius&#x27;s biological son Drusus was sent to quell the uprising in Pannonia, accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian cohorts. In part due to what the soldiers believed to be bad omens, Drusus quickly managed to restore stability in the army and publicly put the chief instigators to death. The camp was purged of mutineers by the Praetorians and the legions returned to the winter barracks. Despite this success, the following years witnessed a growing animosity between Drusus and Sejanus.

Since the death of Germanicus, Drusus had been groomed as the successor of his father, commanding legions in Illyricum in AD 18, and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in AD 21. In practice it was still Sejanus who was the second man in the empire, and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage never happened, as the boy mysteriously or accidentally died a few days later of asphyxiation.

When this failed, it seems Sejanus turned his attention toward eliminating Drusus. By AD 23 the enmity between the two men had reached a critical point. During an argument Drusus had struck the prefect with his fist, and he openly lamented that &quot;a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor&#x27;s son was alive&quot;. Tiberius was already in his sixties, thus the possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future loomed large. To secure his position, Sejanus secretly plotted against Drusus and seduced his wife Livilla. With her as an accomplice, Drusus was slowly poisoned and died of seemingly natural causes on September 13, AD 23.

=== Consolidation of power ===
The loss of his son was a major blow to Tiberius, personally and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps, and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 he had prepared to relinquish some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, and Caligula) as possible heirs.

Germanicus had died in AD 19, in somewhat suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved with a group of senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius&#x27;s mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina&#x27;s ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome&#x27;s first woman, was an open secret. Sejanus saw Agrippina&#x27;s sons Nero, Drusus, and Caligula as a threat to his power.

Sejanus again attempted to marry into the Julio-Claudian family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier, in AD 25 he asked to marry Drusus&#x27; widow Livilla, possibly with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, in the position of a potential successor. The emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank. Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his paranoia towards Agrippina and the Senate, he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of Campania, which he did in AD 26, and finally to the island of Capri, where he lived until his death in AD 37. Sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between Tiberius (guarded by the Praetorians) and the capital.

Despite the withdrawal of Tiberius from Rome&#x27;s political scene, the presence of Livia seems to have checked Sejanus&#x27;s overt power for a time. According to Tacitus, her death in AD 29 changed all that. Sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Among those who perished were Gaius Asinius Gallus, a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina&#x27;s faction. Agrippina and her sons Nero and Drusus were arrested and exiled in AD 30, and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances. Only Caligula, the youngest son of Germanicus and Agrippina, survived the purges of Sejanus by moving to Capri with Tiberius in AD 31. His three younger sisters, Agrippina the Younger, Drusilla, and Livilla, also all survived the purges of Sejanus.

== Downfall ==

=== Denunciation ===
In AD 31, despite his equestrian rank, Sejanus shared the consulship with Tiberius , and finally became betrothed to Livilla. Tiberius had not been seen in Rome since AD 26 and senators and equestrians courted Sejanus&#x27;s favour as if he were Emperor. His birthday was publicly observed and statues were erected in his honour. With most of the political opposition crushed, Sejanus felt his position was unassailable. The ancient historian Cassius Dio wrote:

Sejanus was so great a person by reason both of his excessive haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself seemed to be the emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.

Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor, Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the Empire.

But suddenly, at the end of AD 31, he was arrested, summarily executed and his body unceremoniously cast down the Gemonian stairs. What caused his downfall is unclear: ancient historians disagree about the nature of his conspiracy, whether it was Tiberius or Sejanus who struck first and in which order subsequent events occurred. Modern historians consider it unlikely that Sejanus plotted to seize power and, if he had planned so at all, rather might have aimed at overthrowing Tiberius to serve as a regent to Tiberius Gemellus, son of Drusus, or possibly Gaius Caligula. Unfortunately the relevant section pertaining to this period in the &quot;Annals&quot; of Tacitus has been lost. According to Josephus, it was Antonia, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed (possibly with information provided by Satrius Secundus), in a letter she dispatched to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas. According to Juvenal, a letter was sent from Capri with orders to execute Sejanus without a trial.

Further details concerning Sejanus&#x27;s fall are provided by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years later in his &quot;Roman History&quot;. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to what extent Sejanus had already usurped his authority in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power. However, he realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus to attempt a coup. Instead, Tiberius addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them. Tiberius variously announced that he would arrive in Rome the next day or that he was at the point of death. He stepped down as consul, forcing Sejanus to do the same and conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, rekindling popular support for the house of Germanicus. The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action in Rome to withdraw from overtly supporting Sejanus until the matter was clearly resolved.

When it became obvious to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared, his next step was to choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, previously prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard, and members of the vigiles, led by Publius Graecinius Laco, surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus, but when the letter, which initially digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately apprehended and imprisoned in the Tullianum.

=== Execution and aftermath ===
That same evening the Senate convened at the Temple of Concord and summarily condemned Sejanus to death. He was taken from prison and strangled, after which his body was cast onto the Gemonian stairs. Riots ensued, in which mobs hunted down and killed anyone they could link to Sejanus. The Praetorians also resorted to looting when they were accused of having conspired with the former prefect. Following the issue of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; by the Senate, Sejanus&#x27;s statues were torn down and his name obliterated from all public records, even from coins, as in the one pictured opposite. On October 24, Sejanus&#x27;s eldest son Strabo was arrested and executed. Upon learning of his death, Apicata committed suicide on October 26, after addressing a letter to Tiberius which claimed that Drusus had been poisoned with the complicity of Livilla. The accusations were further corroborated by confessions from Livilla&#x27;s slaves, who, under torture, admitted to having administered the poison to Drusus.[The story should be read with caution. Barbara Levick says that Sejanus must have murdered Drusus in self-defense because only Tiberius stood between the Praetorian Prefect and the end of his career at the hands of Drusus. Furthermore, she says it is even less likely that Livilla would have been complicit in the destruction of her family, the key to her children&#x27;s future. Levick dismisses the accusation of Apicata as the revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another.]

Enraged upon learning the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was starved to death by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. Because there was no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was said to have been raped first, with the rope around her neck and her body thrown down the Gemonian stairs along with her brother&#x27;s. At the beginning of the following year, &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; was also passed on Livilla.

Although Rome at first rejoiced at the demise of Sejanus, the city was quickly plunged into more extensive trials as Tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius&#x27;s wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro, who succeeded Sejanus as the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.

Most historical documentation of Tiberius&#x27;s revenge is given by Suetonius and Tacitus; their portrayal of a tyrannical, vengeful emperor has been challenged by several modern historians. Edward Togo Salmon wrote that,

== Legacy ==

=== Praetorian Guard ===
The reforms of Sejanus most significantly included the founding of the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers were equally at the mercy of the Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear. The power Sejanus attained in his capacity as prefect proved Maecenas right in his prediction to Augustus, that it was dangerous to allow one man to command the guard. Cassius Dio notes that after Sejanus, no other prefect except Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, who commanded the Guard under Septimius Severus, would rise to such influence.

=== Historiography ===
With the exception of Velleius Paterculus, ancient historians have universally condemned Sejanus, although accounts differ regarding the extent to which Sejanus was manipulated by Tiberius or the other way around. Suetonius Tranquillus asserts that Sejanus was merely an instrument of Tiberius, to hasten the downfall of Germanicus and his family and that he was quickly disposed of once he ceased to be useful. Tacitus, on the other hand, attributes much of the decline of Tiberius&#x27;s rule after AD 23 to the corrupting influence of Sejanus, although he is generally also harsh on Tiberius.

Among the writers who fell victim to the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus as the last of the true Romans, which was considered an offence under the &quot;Lex Maiestatis&quot;; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus&#x27; daughter Marcia &quot;To Marcia, On Consolation&quot;. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus&#x27;s displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father&#x27;s work so that it could be published again under Caligula.

Phaedrus was suspected of having alluded to Sejanus in his &quot;Fables&quot; and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was an historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume &quot;The Roman History&quot; details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter&#x27;s high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. It has been conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of Sejanus.

===Literary interpretations===
Sejanus&#x27;s fall is depicted in the section in Juvenal&#x27;s Satire X on the emptiness of power. This reviews the destruction of his statues after the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; judgment and reflects on the fickleness of public opinion. The dramatist Ben Jonson borrowed from the poem for some passages in his &quot;&quot;. The play is seen as a topical reference to the fall of the former royal favourite, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, executed for treason two years before. Sejanus is also a leading figure in another Roman history play of about this time, the anonymous &quot;Tragedy of Claudius Tiberius Nero&quot; (1607).

Making contemporary political points in this way through reinterpretation of distant historical episodes was now common. In 17th century France, the fall of the powerful Cardinal Mazarin was celebrated in a political pamphlet that also drew parallels with the career of Sejanus, &quot;L&#x27;Ambitieux ou le portraict d&#x27;Aelius Sejanus en la personne du Cardinal Mazarin&quot; (Paris, 1642). In England other royal favourites were seen in these terms too. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, is the target of an anonymous manuscript Roman tragedy, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Favourite&quot;. The prudent need for anonymity is suggested by the arrest of Sir John Eliot, who was sent to the Tower of London for his outspoken criticism of the Duke in the 1626 parliament, comparing him to Sejanus.

Following Buckingham&#x27;s death in 1628, when it was safer to do so, a translation of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, &quot;The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus&quot;. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins&#x27; &quot;Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus&quot;, which had originally been titled &quot;Della peripetia di fortuna&quot; (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later in the century Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, was the target of the four-page political pamphlet &quot;Sejanus, or The popular favourite, now in his solitude, and sufferings&quot;, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl&#x27;s imprisonment in the Tower on a charge of treason, is interpreted as an argument for absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary of politicians.

The name of Sejanus continued to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 in the course of a popular skit, &quot;C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call&#x27;d, The downfall of Sejanus&quot;; its authorship is attributed to &#x27;a masquerader&#x27; and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question &#x27;Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.&#x27; A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus&quot; was reissued under the title of &quot;The Favourite&quot;. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.

Elsewhere in Europe there were other dramatic adaptations of the story. They included Jean de Magnon&#x27;s rhyming tragedy, &quot;Sejanus&quot; (1647) and Henri van der Zande&#x27;s &quot;De dood van Elius Sejanus of Spiegel voor der vorsten gunstelingen&quot; (The death of Sejanus, a mirror for the favourites of princes, Amsterdam 1716). Later there was another recycling of Jonson&#x27;s tragedy in England by the Irish actor Francis Gentleman. Abridged and &#x27;improved&#x27; by some additions of his own, he published his &quot;Sejanus, a tragedy: as it was intended for the stage&quot; (1752), when he could not get it acted. Later plays include a 5-act tragedy by A.Arterton (1875) and the privately printed &quot;Sejanus: A Tragedy in Five Acts&quot; by P. J. A. Chaulk (1923)

A later fictional treatment of the historical episode appeared as the first story of Edward Maturin&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus, and Other Roman Tales&quot; (New York 1839). It also figures in Robert Graves&#x27; &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1934). In this Antonia sends the letter of accusation to Tiberius via Claudius, after discovering her daughter is plotting with Sejanus. And since Pontius Pilate was a nominee of Sejanus and implicated in his anti-Jewish policies, it encouraged the inclusion of Sejanus in novels dealing with the circumstances of Jesus Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. The first of these was Miles Gerald Keon&#x27;s &quot;Dion and the Sibyls: A Classic Christian Novel&quot; (London, 1866); later examples include Paul L. Maier&#x27;s &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; (Grand Rapids MI 1968) and Chris Seepe&#x27;s &quot;The Conspiracy to Assassinate Jesus Christ&quot; (Toronto 2012).

The aim of some later novels has been to concentrate as much on local colour as on the story. This was true of William Percival Crozier&#x27;s historical romance &quot;The Fates Are Laughing&quot; (1945), which was written by a classicist with an eye for detail and set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula. It is equally true of some recent detective novels set in Roman times. David Wishart&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus&quot; (London, 1998) features Marcus Corvinus, and James Mace&#x27;s &quot;Empire Betrayed: The Fall of Sejanus&quot; (2013) focused on a military colleague, Aulus Nautius Cursor.

<text>Kathryn Grayson (born Zelma Kathryn Elisabeth Hedrick; February 9, 1922 – February 17, 2010) was an American actress and coloratura soprano.

From the age of 12, Grayson trained as an opera singer. She was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by the early 1940s, soon establishing a career principally through her work in musicals. After several supporting roles, she was a lead performer in such films as &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943), &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945) with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly and &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951) and &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; (1953), both with Howard Keel.

She also worked in theatre, appearing in &quot;Camelot&quot; (1962–1964). Later in the decade, she performed in several operas, including &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;.

==Early life==
Zelma Kathryn Elisabeth Hedrick was born on February 9, 1922, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, one of four children of Charles Hedrick, a building contractor-realtor, and Lillian Hedrick (née Grayson).

The Hedrick family later moved to Kirkwood, Missouri, outside St. Louis. At the age of 12, Grayson was discovered singing on the empty stage of the St. Louis Municipal Opera House by a janitor, who introduced her to Frances Marshall of the Chicago Civic Opera, from whom Grayson received voice lessons. Grayson&#x27;s sister Frances Raeburn (born Mildred Hedrick) was also an actress and singer, appearing along with her in the film &quot;Seven Sweethearts&quot;. Grayson had two brothers, Clarence &quot;Bud&quot; E. Hedrick, and Harold. The family moved to California when she was 15 years old.

==Film career==
===1940s===
In 1940, an MGM talent scout saw Grayson performing at a music festival. MGM hoped to find a replacement for Deanna Durbin, who had left the studio for Universal Pictures. For the next 18 months, Grayson took voice, drama and diction lessons and followed a routine of dieting and exercise. Within a year, she had her first screen test. However, studio executives were not satisfied, and she endured a further six months of lessons until she made her first film appearance in 1941&#x27;s &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Private Secretary&quot; as secretary Kathryn Land, participating in three musical numbers.

Two further films were planned for Grayson in 1941: &quot;White House Girl&quot;, which was later produced in 1948 with Durbin, and &quot;Very Warm for May&quot;, from the Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein musical of the same name. The film eventually was produced in 1944 as &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot;.

Grayson appeared in three films in 1942: &quot;The Vanishing Virginian&quot;, &quot;Rio Rita&quot; and &quot;Seven Sweethearts&quot;. In the first, Grayson plays the teenage daughter, Rebecca, of the eccentric Yancey family from Lynchburg, Virginia. Set in 1913, the film was based on Rebecca Yancey Williams&#x27;s own family.

Grayson co-starred in &quot;Rio Rita&quot; with Abbott and Costello. Grayson portrayed the title character, Rita Winslow. The film was originally meant to be an adaptation of the 1927 Broadway musical; however, only two songs were retained for the film, the title song, and &quot;The Ranger Song&quot;, which was performed by Grayson.

Co-starring Van Heflin, &quot;Seven Sweethearts&quot; cast Grayson as the youngest of seven daughters from Holland, Michigan, who is hired by reporter-photographer Heflin to serve as a model and secretary while he covers the town&#x27;s tulip festival, and with whom he falls in love.

In 1943, Grayson appeared in the film &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot;, (originally titled &quot;Private Miss Jones&quot;), along with Gene Kelly, Mickey Rooney, Eleanor Powell, June Allyson and others. The film was intended as a morale booster for American troops and their families. Grayson starred as the singing daughter of an Army commander.

It was announced in 1942 that Grayson would appear in &quot;An American Symphony&quot; with Judy Garland. Garland was replaced by June Allyson, and the film was retitled as &quot;Two Sisters from Boston&quot; and released in 1946.

Grayson did not appear in any films for nearly two years (from 1943 to 1945), but instead worked at entertaining troops during the war and performing on radio programs. Notably, it is reported that she would only perform under the condition that the audience was integrated, as troops were segregated at the time.

She returned to films in &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, a musical romantic-comedy set in Los Angeles and co-starring Kelly and Frank Sinatra. &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; was the fifth-highest grossing film of 1945, earning over $4.779 million.

This was followed by &quot;Two Sisters from Boston&quot; and guest appearances in &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; and &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;. Her performance in &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; included &quot;Make Believe&quot; in a capsule version of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which would be remade five years later, with Grayson in the starring role.

MGM re-paired Grayson and Sinatra for two movies in 1947 and 1948, &quot;It Happened in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot;. Both films performed poorly at the box office, and audiences thought the plots absurd. After the setbacks of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Bandit&quot;, Grayson was partnered with tenor Mario Lanza in &quot;That Midnight Kiss&quot; in 1949.

===1950s===

In 1950, Grayson was once again partnered with Lanza, and portrayed an opera singer in &quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot;, and performed the Academy-Award-nominated song &quot;Be My Love&quot;. While shooting the &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; scene in the film, Lanza kept attempting to french kiss Grayson, which Grayson claimed was made even worse by the fact that Lanza would constantly eat garlic before shooting. Grayson went to costume designer Helen Rose, who sewed pieces of brass into Grayson&#x27;s gloves. Any time Lanza attempted to french kiss her after that, she hit him with the brass-filled glove.

For the premiere of the film in New Orleans, she was a guest at an auction selling the film&#x27;s costumes.

Grayson replaced June Allyson in the role of Ina Massine in 1951&#x27;s &quot;Grounds for Marriage&quot;. She portrayed an opera singer with laryngitis, alongside Van Johnson who played her doctor and love interest. This was also her first non-singing role at MGM. Grayson&#x27;s musical performances do appear in the film, but in the form of recordings.

Grayson was next cast as Magnolia Hawks in the 1951 remake of the 1927 Hammerstein and Kern musical, &quot;Show Boat&quot;. &quot;Show Boat&quot; was the third-highest-grossing film of 1951, earning over $5.533 million.

Grayson teamed again with Keel in the 1952 Technicolor musical &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;, a remake of the 1935 Astaire and Rogers film &quot;Roberta&quot;.

She was released to the Warner Brothers studio in January 1953, with the stipulation that she return to MGM for one more film. She returned to co-star for a third time with Howard Keel in her most acclaimed role, as Lilli Vanessi/Katharina in &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;, released in November 1953. The film was lavishly produced (the only musical other than &quot;Those Redheads from Seattle (1953)&quot; to be filmed in 3-D), with songs by Cole Porter, choreography by Hermes Pan, and musical direction by André Previn.

===Warner Bros===
While on loan to Warner Bros, her first musical release was &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, May 1953, alongside Gordon MacRae. She was asked to perform &quot;La Bohème&quot; at the Central City Opera House in Central City, Colorado, but due to her filming obligations for &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, she had to turn it down. Warner Bros. starred her in a second musical that year, &quot;So This Is Love&quot;.

Grayson appeared on television occasionally, having guest starred in the CBS anthology series, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; in the episode, &quot;Shadow on the Heart&quot;, with John Ericson, and on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; in the title role of the &quot;Lone Woman&quot;, with Raymond Burr and Scott Brady in the historical roles of the brothers Charles and William Bent, respectively. In the 1980s, Grayson guest starred in three episodes as recurring character Ideal Molloy on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

==Stage career==
Grayson appeared on stage in numerous productions including &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Rosalinda&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, and &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, for which she was nominated for Chicago&#x27;s Sarah Siddons Award. In 1953, Grayson optioned the story &quot;It&#x27;s Greek to Me&quot;, written by Helen Deutsch, to be accompanied by a score from Cole Porter. The story was a mythical love story about Hercules and Hippolyte, and Grayson hoped to be reunited with Howard Keel and take the show on the road. However, the project fell apart.

Her casting in &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; led to her replacing Julie Andrews in 1962 as Queen Guinevere in &quot;Camelot&quot;. She then continued the role for over sixteen months in the national tour of the United States before leaving for health reasons.

Grayson had a lifelong dream of being an opera star, and she appeared in a number of operas in the 1960s, such as &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;. Her dramatic and comedy stage roles included &quot;Night Watch&quot;, &quot;Noises Off&quot;, &quot;Love Letters&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Afoot&quot; as Dottie Otterling.

==Musical career==
Grayson trained from the age of twelve as an opera singer. While appearing in her film roles, Grayson also performed on the radio. Grayson performed on concert tours throughout the 1950s. In May 1951, Grayson had to postpone a concert tour due to being unknowingly cast in &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;. &quot;My concert bookings were all set. So when I read in New York that I was to do this film, I said &#x27;How silly!&#x27;, then boom! The next day I got my studio telegram asking me to return for the picture!&quot;

In 1952, Grayson was offered more than $10,000 to perform for a week at the Riviera night club in New Jersey before making &quot;The Desert Song&quot;. After filming &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, Grayson created a recording of the musical with Tony Martin.

Grayson gave nightclub and concert tours in Australia a few times. On one of those trips to the Far East, Grayson also gave a concert in Manila, the Philippines, in 1969, where she performed at the New Frontier theater.

Grayson supervised the Voice and Choral Studies Program at Idaho State University.

==Personal life==
Grayson married twice, first to actor John Shelton and then to the actor/singer Johnnie Johnston. She was a Republican. Grayson adhered to Roman Catholicism.

===John Shelton===
Shelton and Grayson eloped to Las Vegas, where they were married on July 11, 1941. The two had courted for 18 months, after meeting while making screen tests. In July 1942, Shelton moved out of their Brentwood home and into his own apartment. This came after a month of reconciliation after a judge dismissed their divorce suit. Grayson charged Shelton with mental cruelty. They divorced on June 17, 1946.

===Johnnie Johnston===
Grayson wed singer/actor Johnnie Johnston on August 22, 1947, in Carmel, California. On October 7, 1948, Grayson&#x27;s only child, daughter Patricia &quot;Patty Kate&quot; Kathryn Johnston was born. Patricia married Robert Towers and had two children, Kristin and Jordan. Jordan Towers became the lead singer of the band SomeKindaWonderful.

Grayson and Johnston separated on November 15, 1950. On October 3, 1951, Grayson was granted a divorce from Johnston on the grounds of mental cruelty. Johnston&#x27;s &quot;This Time for Keeps&quot; co-star, Esther Williams, claimed in her 1999 autobiography that while making the film, Johnston would read Grayson&#x27;s intimate letters aloud to the girls in his fan club, including the &quot;all-too-graphic details concerning what she liked about his love-making.&quot;

==Death==
According to her secretary, Grayson died in her sleep at her home in Los Angeles on February 17, 2010, aged 88.

==Honors==
On February 9, 2022, in honor of the 100th anniversary of Grayson&#x27;s birth, Turner Classic Movies TV network showed five of Grayson&#x27;s films.

<doc id="154040" wikidata="Q2456276" url="?curid=154040" title="Syntactic ambiguity">
<text>Syntactic ambiguity, also known as structural ambiguity, amphiboly, or amphibology, is characterized by the potential for a sentence to yield multiple interpretations due to its ambiguous syntax. This form of ambiguity is not derived from the varied meanings of individual words but rather from the relationships among words and clauses within a sentence, concealing interpretations beneath the word order. Consequently, a sentence presents as syntactically ambiguous when it permits reasonable derivation of several possible grammatical structures by an observer.

In jurisprudence, the interpretation of syntactically ambiguous phrases in statutory texts or contracts may be done by courts. Occasionally, claims based on highly improbable interpretations of such ambiguities are dismissed as being frivolous litigation and without merit. The term &quot;parse forest&quot; refers to the collection of all possible syntactic structures, known as &quot;parse trees&quot;, that can represent the ambiguous sentence&#x27;s meanings. The task of clarifying which meaning is actually intended from among the possibilities is known as &quot;syntactic disambiguation&quot;.

==Different forms==

===Globally ambiguous===
A globally ambiguous sentence is one that has at least two distinct interpretations and where reading the entire sentence does not resolve the ambiguity. Globally ambiguous sentences exist where no feature of the representation (i.e. word order) distinguishes the possible distinct interpretations. Global ambiguities are often unnoticed because readers tend to choose the interpretation they understand to be more probable. One example of a global ambiguity is &quot;The woman held the baby in the green blanket.&quot; In this example, the baby, incidentally wrapped in the green blanket, is being held by the woman, or the woman is using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby, or the woman is wrapped in the green blanket and holding the baby.

===Locally ambiguous===
A locally ambiguous sentence is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase but has only one interpretation. The ambiguity in a locally ambiguous sentence briefly stays and is resolved, i.e., disambiguated, by the end of the speech. Sometimes, local ambiguities can result in &quot;garden path&quot; sentences, in which a structurally correct sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the one that makes most sense.

==Examples==
:&quot;The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose.&quot; — &quot;Henry VI&quot; (1.4.30), by William Shakespeare
:*Henry will depose the duke.
:*The duke will depose Henry.
::Amphiboly occurs frequently in poetry, sometimes owing to the alteration of the natural order of words for metrical reasons.

:&quot;&quot; — &quot;Edward II&quot; by Christopher Marlowe
:: Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March supposedly plotted to murder Edward II of England in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending this order in Latin which changes meaning depending on where the comma is placed.
:* Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good. (either Edward, killing him, or being afraid to kill him is good)
:* Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear. (either Edward or killing him is good to fear)

:&quot;I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m a man, and so is Lola.&quot; — &quot;Lola&quot; by the Kinks (written by Ray Davies)
:*Lola and I are both glad I&#x27;m a man.
:*I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m a man, and Lola is also a man.
:*I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m a man, and I&#x27;m also glad Lola is a man.
:*I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m a man, and Lola is also glad to be a man.
::The ambiguity is intentional and alludes to a cross-dresser.

:&quot;John saw the man on the mountain with a telescope.&quot;
:*John, using a telescope, saw a man on a mountain.
:*John saw a man on a mountain which had a telescope on it.
:*John saw a man on a mountain who had a telescope.
:*John, on a mountain and using a telescope, saw a man.
:*John, on a mountain, saw a man who had a telescope.

:&quot;The word of the Lord came to Zechariah, son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, the prophet.&quot;
:*... the prophet Zechariah, who was the son of Berekiah, who was the son of Iddo
:*... Zechariah, who was the son of the prophet Berekiah, who was the son of Iddo
:*... Zechariah, who was the son of Berekiah, who was the son of the prophet Iddo
:*... the prophet Zechariah, who was the son of Berekiah and Iddo
:*... Zechariah, who was the son of Berekiah and Iddo, the prophet

:&quot;Lesbian Vampire Killers&quot;, the title of a comedy-horror film
:* Lesbians who kill vampires.
:* Killers of lesbian vampires.
:* Lesbian vampires that are killers.

:&quot;The Purple People Eater&quot; by Sheb Wooley
:* A purple creature that eats people.
:* A creature that eats purple people. (This interpretation is confirmed in the lyrics, although whether the creature itself is also purple is never made clear.)

:&quot;British Left Waffles on Falkland Islands.&quot;
:* The British party of the left rambles indecisively about Falkland Island policy.
:* The British forces left behind waffles (the breakfast item) on the Falkland Islands.

Aristotle writes about an influence of ambiguities on arguments and also about this influence depending on either combination or division of words:

==In headlines==
Newspaper headlines are written in a telegraphic style (headlinese) which often omits the copula, creating syntactic ambiguity. A common form is the garden path type. The name crash blossoms was proposed for these ambiguous headlines by Danny Bloom in the Testy Copy Editors discussion group in August 2009. He based this on the headline &quot;Violinist linked to JAL crash blossoms&quot; that Mike O&#x27;Connell had posted, asking what such a headline could be called. The &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; regularly reprints such headlines in its &quot;The Lower Case&quot; column, and has collected them in the anthologies &quot;Squad Helps Dog Bite Victim&quot; and &quot;Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge&quot;. Language Log also has an extensive archive of crash blossoms, for example &quot;Infant Pulled from Wrecked Car Involved in Short Police Pursuit&quot;.

Many purported crash blossoms are or recycled. One celebrated one from World War I is &quot;French push bottles up German rear&quot;; life imitated art in the Second World War headline &quot;Eighth Army Push Bottles Up Germans&quot;.

==In humour and advertising==

Syntactic or structural ambiguities are frequently found in humour and advertising. One enduring joke using an ambiguous modifier is a quip spoken by Groucho Marx in the 1930 film &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;: &quot;I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Another sentence, which emerged from early 1960s machine translation research, is &quot;Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana&quot;.
Significantly enough, structural ambiguities may also be intentionally created when one understands the kinds of syntactic structures that will lead to ambiguity; however, for the respective interpretations to work, they must be compatible with semantic and pragmatic contextual factors.

==Syntactic and semantic ambiguity==

In syntactic ambiguity, the same sequence of words is interpreted as having different syntactic structures. In contrast, in semantic ambiguity the structure remains the same, but the individual words are interpreted differently. Controlled natural languages are often designed to be unambiguous so that they can be parsed into a logical form.

==Kantian==
Immanuel Kant employs the term &quot;amphiboly&quot; in a sense of his own, as he has done in the case of other philosophical words. He means it as a confusion of pure understanding with perceived experience, and an attribution to the latter of what belongs only to the former.

==Models==

===Competition-based model===
Competition-based models hold that differing syntactic analyses rival each other when syntactic ambiguities are resolved. If probability and language constraints offer similar support for each one, especially strong competition occurs. On the other hand, when constraints support one analysis over the other, competition is weak and processing is easy. After van Gompel et al.&#x27;s experiments (2005), the reanalysis model has become favoured over competition-based models. Convincing evidence against competition-based models includes the fact that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated (clearer) sentences, showing that the analyses do not compete against each other in the former. Plausibility tends to strengthen one analysis and eliminate rivalry. However, the model has not been completely rejected. Some theories claim that competition makes processing difficult, if only briefly.

===Reanalysis model===
According to the reanalysis model, processing is hard once the reader has realised that their analysis is false (with respect to the already adopted syntactic structure) and he or she must then return and recheck the structure. Most reanalysis models, like the unrestricted race model, work in series, which implies that only one analysis can be supported at a time.

Consider the following statements:
# &quot;The dog of the woman that had the parasol was brown.&quot;
# &quot;The woman with the dog that had the parasol was brown.&quot;
# &quot;The dog with the woman that had the parasol was brown.&quot;

Research supports the reanalysis model as the most likely reason for why interpreting these ambiguous sentences is hard. Results of many experiments tracking the eye-movements of subjects have demonstrated that it is just as hard to process a persistently ambiguous sentence (1) as an unambiguous sentence (2 and 3) because information before the ambiguity only weakly leans towards each possible syntax.

===Unrestricted race model===

The unrestricted race model states that analysis is affected before the introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is used (based on probability) before multiple analyses can be introduced. Gompel and Pickering plainly refer to the unrestricted race model as a two-stage reanalysis model. Unlike constraint-based theories, only one analysis can be made at any one time. Thus, reanalysis may sometimes be necessary if information following the first analysis proves it wrong. 

However, the name &quot;unrestricted race&quot; comes directly from its properties taken from the constraint-based models. As in constraint-based theories, any source of information can support the different analyses of an ambiguous structure; thus the name. In the model, the other possible structures of an ambiguous sentence compete in a race, with the structure that is constructed fastest being used. The more such an analysis is supported, and the stronger the support is, the more likely this one will be made first.

Consider the following statements:

# &quot;The maid of the princess who scratched herself in public was terribly humiliated.&quot;
# &quot;The son of the princess who scratched himself in public was terribly humiliated.&quot;
# &quot;The son of the princess who scratched herself in public was terribly humiliated.&quot;

Research showed that people took less time to read persistently ambiguous sentences (sentence 1) than temporarily ambiguous sentences that were clarified later (sentences 2 and 3). In sentences 2 and 3, the reflexive pronouns “himself” and “herself” clarify that “who scratched” is modifying the son and the princess respectively. Thus, the readers are forced to reanalyse and their reading times will therefore rise. In sentence 1, however, the ambiguity of the reflexive pronoun “herself” fits both the maid and the princess. This means the readers do not have to reanalyse. Thus, ambiguous sentences will take a shorter time to read compared to clarified ones.

This is called the underspecification account as readers do not stick to a meaning when not provided with clarifying words. The reader understands someone scratched herself but does not seek to determine whether it was the maid or the princess. This is also known as the “good-enough” approach to understanding language.

== The good-enough approach ==
The good-enough approach to understanding language claims that representations of meaning are usually incomplete and language processing only partial. A good-enough interpretation may occur when such a representation is not robust, supported by context, or both and must handle potentially distracting information. Thus, such information is clipped for successful understanding 

==Differences in processing==

=== Children and adults ===
Children interpret ambiguous sentences differently from adults due to lack of experience. Children have not yet learned how the environment and contextual clues can suggest a certain interpretation of a sentence. They have also not yet developed the ability to acknowledge that ambiguous words and phrases can be interpreted multiple ways. As children read and interpret syntactically ambiguous sentences, the speed at which initial syntactic commitments are made is lower in children than in adults. Furthermore, children appear to be less skilled at directing their attention back to the part of the sentence that is most informative in terms of aiding reanalysis. Other evidence attributes differences in interpreting ambiguous sentences to working memory span. While adults tend to have a higher working memory span, they sometimes spend more time resolving the ambiguity but tend to be more accurate in their final interpretation. Children, in contrast, can decide quickly on an interpretation because they consider only the interpretations their working memory can hold.

=== Low reading span vs. high reading span adults ===
For low reading span adults who had the worst verbal working memory, they took longer to process the sentences with the reduced relative clause compared to the relative clause and had similar times from inanimate or animate subjects. For high reading span subjects who had the best verbal working memory, they were overall faster than the low reading span subjects. Within the high reading span subjects, however, they responded faster to inanimate subjects and took longer to respond to animate subjects. This was because the animate subjects had a greater propensity to create a garden path sentence &quot;because of&quot; (not despite) greater verbal working memory. This suggested that since the low reading span subjects had less cognitive resources, only syntactic cues could be processed while high reading span subjects had more cognitive resources and could thus get tripped up with the garden path sentence.

The group – with core members Greg Dulli (vocals, rhythm guitar), Rick McCollum (lead guitar), and John Curley (bass) – rose up around the grunge movement, evolving from a garage band in the vein of the Replacements to incorporate more R&amp;B and soul influences into their sound and image. After releasing their first album independently in 1988, the band signed to the Seattle-based label Sub Pop. They released their major-label debut and fourth album, &quot;Gentlemen&quot;, in 1993. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described them as &quot;one of the few alt-bands to flourish on a major label&quot; in the 1990s.

Dulli frequently claimed in interviews that the band would never get back together following their dissolution in 2001; however the group reunited in 2012.

==Band history==

===Early years and &quot;Big Top Halloween&quot; (1986-1988)===
Greg Dulli (vocals, rhythm guitar), Rick McCollum (lead guitar), John Curley (bass), and Steve Earle (drums) formed the band in Cincinnati late in 1986. The Afghan Whigs had evolved out of Dulli&#x27;s previous band, The Black Republicans, a band that Curley later joined. Curley attended a number of Black Republicans shows and approached Dulli and &quot;made it a point to tell the vocalist he was a better bassist than the one in the Black Republicans.&quot; Curley would introduce Dulli to McCollum, a frequent jam partner who was famed on the local Cincinnati scene for his innovative use of effects pedals. McCollum and Dulli would bond over their shared love of R&amp;B, in fact the first song The Afghan Whigs ever rehearsed was a cover of The Temptations&#x27; &quot;Psychedelic Shack.&quot; Dulli later described the intent behind The Afghan Whigs was to exist as &quot;a cross between the Band, the Temptations, and Neil Young playing with Crazy Horse.&quot; The name The Afghan Whigs was coined by Curley &quot;as a play on the Black Republicans.&quot;

In the wake of The Black Republicans&#x27; breakup Dulli had decamped to Arizona, where he composed half the material for what would become The Afghan Whigs&#x27; debut album &quot;Big Top Halloween&quot; (1988), self-released on the band&#x27;s own Ultrasuede label. &quot;We were running through what were the first songs I&#x27;d ever written to do some demos, so we were playing really loose,&quot; Dulli recalls. &quot;And then all of a sudden, I found out John was having covers made.&quot; While only a thousand copies of &quot;Big Top Halloween&quot; would be pressed initially, one of them managed to capture the attention of Jonathan Poneman, the co-founder of influential Seattle-based indie label Sub Pop, which signed The Afghan Whigs in 1989. Initially Sub Pop planned for the Whigs to release only a one-off single, but that soon led to a full-blown record contract with the label.

===Signing to Sub Pop and &quot;Up in It&quot; (1989–1990)===
Upon signing to Sub Pop, The Afghan Whigs became the second non-Pacific-Northwestern United States band to record for the Sub Pop label. In 1990, Sub Pop put out The Afghan Whigs&#x27; second album &quot;Up in It.&quot; Largely recorded by Nirvana producer Jack Endino and featuring the college-radio hit &quot;Retarded,&quot; &quot;Up in It&quot; received a favorable reception with music critics upon release.

To support the album&#x27;s release, The Afghan Whigs went on a package tour with grunge originators Mudhoney and Boston underground band Bullet LaVolta. &quot;Up in It&quot; was followed by a limited edition single released by No.6 Records under the name &quot;Ornament,&quot; which included vocals by Scrawl singer Marcy Mays (who would later contribute lead vocals to the band&#x27;s song &quot;My Curse&quot; off the album &quot;Gentlemen&quot;).

===&quot;Congregation&quot; and &quot;Uptown Avondale&quot; (1992)===
With the 1992 album &quot;Congregation&quot; and covers EP, &quot;Uptown Avondale&quot;, the band developed what would become their signature sound, blending soul with psychedelic sprawl and punk abandon. Critics noted the combination of Stax and Motown influences with indie-rock sonics on the band&#x27;s material. &quot;Uptown Avondale&quot; featured covers of hits by soul acts such as The Supremes.

Videos for notable &quot;Congregation&quot; songs like &quot;Conjure Me&quot; and &quot;Turn on the Water&quot; would receive airplay on MTV, which began to regularly cover The Afghan Whigs as a new band to watch. The Afghan Whigs would also tour extensively during this period, including a U.S. jaunt with Scottish indie rockers Teenage Fanclub.

===Signing to Elektra and &quot;Gentlemen&quot; (1993)===
Building on the buzz that welcomed &quot;Congregation&quot;, The Afghan Whigs soon signed to a major label, Elektra Records, following a bidding war that resulted in a contract so lucrative, it featured a clause that allowed for the funding of a Dulli-scripted feature film that ultimately was never made. For their major label debut, The Afghan Whigs ensconced themselves in Ardent Studios in Memphis, where Big Star, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, and ZZ Top had recorded. The result of those sessions was the 1993 album &quot;Gentlemen&quot;.

&quot;Gentlemen&quot; received a positive review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Critics would go on to praise it for its unflinching, self-flagellating lyrics, and a decisive stylistic break with the grunge-style epitomized by Nirvana and Mudhoney. &quot;Gentlemen&quot; would place at No. 17 on The &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Pazz &amp; Jop&quot; critic&#x27;s poll for 1993.

&quot;Gentlemen&quot; proved to be The Afghan Whigs&#x27; most commercially successful release, and by 1996 it had sold 130,000 copies in the United States. The singles &quot;Debonair&quot; (a Modern Rock Top 20 hit) and &quot;Gentlemen&quot; received regular airplay on MTV and college radio. Another album track, &quot;Fountain and Fairfax&quot; appeared on the television series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; in 1994. The lead vocals on &quot;My Curse&quot; were sung not by Dulli, but by singer Marcy Mays of Scrawl – allegedly because the lyrics documenting the violent dissolution of a relationship were so personal, Dulli couldn&#x27;t sing it.

===&quot;Black Love&quot; era (1996)===
Following the promotion of &quot;Gentlemen&quot;, The Afghan Whigs further expanded into the public eye. In 1996, Dulli served as executive producer for the soundtrack for the Ted Demme film &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;. The Afghan Whigs appeared in the film as a bar band and contributed two songs to the soundtrack: Frederick Knight&#x27;s &quot;Be For Real&quot; and Barry White&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe.&quot; Dulli also was the only musician other than Dave Grohl to appear on the debut album from Foo Fighters.

Eventually, work began on The Afghan Whigs&#x27; fifth full-length album, which would be called &quot;Black Love&quot; upon its release in 1996. The band started writing demos in March 1995; the recording took place in both Seattle and Memphis-based studios featuring new drummer Paul Buchignani, who had replaced Steve Earle.

Although previous releases explored liquor-drenched obsession, secrets and misery, &quot;Black Love&quot; stepped into a darker, seedier and complex side of Dulli&#x27;s persona, passionately taking his obsession with murder and paranoia to their logical ends. Dulli himself noted that the songs had a conceptual framework that reflected the structure of a film, influenced by noir-influenced writer James Ellroy and violent neo-noir films like &quot;Blood Simple.&quot; Other influences included pulp fiction novels, Kenneth Anger&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; and the crime photographs of Weegee. Other lyrical inspirations included the troubled life of Temptations singer David Ruffin for the song &quot;Blame, Etc.&quot; The album opener, &quot;Crime Scene Part One&quot;, was allegedly influenced by the story of then-unproduced screenplay for the film &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot;.

Commercially, &quot;Black Love&quot; peaked at No. 79 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart. The album also received critical praise for capturing the power of the Whigs&#x27; live show in a studio recording; its lush yet funky musicality garnered comparisons to the Rolling Stones in their 1970s-era prime and standing out once again from the day&#x27;s more conventional alternative rock in its distinctive embrace of black-music idioms. The Whigs promoted &quot;Black Love&quot; with extensive touring, including a jaunt of large venues opening for a Neil Young tour that also featured Jewel.

===Legal dispute with Elektra and signing to Sony/Columbia for &quot;1965&quot; (1998)===
In the wake of &quot;Black Love&quot;&#x27;s commercial disappointment, The Afghan Whigs said they suffered neglect and dishonest business dealings with their label, Elektra. Eventually, the two parted ways and the Whigs signed to Columbia Records for their next album, &quot;1965&quot;. The unamicable parting resulted in Dulli being treated for depression, providing subject matter for songs like &quot;Neglekted&quot; which was featured on the band&#x27;s next full-length effort. The song had originally been named &quot;Sylvia&quot; as a swipe against then-Elektra head, Sylvia Rhone.

After a year&#x27;s hiatus during which Dulli began another project known as The Twilight Singers, The Afghan Whig&#x27;s went to Daniel Lanois&#x27; famed studio in New Orleans to record &quot;1965,&quot; named after the year both Dulli and Curley were born. Influenced again by film noir, as well as the urban wordplay of rappers like Nas, &quot;1965&quot; received positive reviews in the press, praising, in particular, the band&#x27;s continued flair for blending soul styles with rock. In addition to their headlining dates, The Afghan Whigs went on tour with Aerosmith as the classic-rock group&#x27;s opening act. During the live dates for &quot;1965,&quot; Dulli got in an altercation with a stagehand following an Austin, Texas concert date and suffered a head injury that left him in a coma. Two months after Dulli&#x27;s recovery, however, the group returned to the road.

===Break up (2001)===
In 2001, The Afghan Whigs broke up by circulating a press release announcement which was picked up by the major music press. In it, the band claimed their geographic disparity and family obligations of its core members made it impossible for them to create new material together. In further interviews, Dulli clarified that theirs was an amicable split, and did not necessarily represent an &quot;official breakup.&quot;

===Reunion (2006, 2011–present)===

In 2006, The Afghan Whigs temporarily reunited. The lineup recorded two new tracks (&quot;I&#x27;m A Soldier&quot; and &quot;Magazine&quot;) featured on their retrospective titled &quot;&quot;, released on June 5, 2007, through Rhino Records, which critics noted rated on a par with the band&#x27;s material released during its prime.

The band would not perform again until a December 7, 2011, press release from the promoters of All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties announced that The Afghan Whigs would reunite and play at their I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror events on May 27, 2012, in London, followed by an appearance at Pier 36 in New York City on September 22, 2012. A week later it was announced that the band would also be performing at both Primavera Sound festivals in 2012. In April of that year, it was revealed that the revitalized The Afghan Whigs would be playing the 2012 edition of Lollapalooza. Dulli clarified in interviews that playing The Afghan Whigs with Curley on a 2010 solo tour and meeting with McCollum anew during that period directly led to plans of reforming for live performance.

On May 22, 2012, the reunited The Afghan Whigs (minus drummer Steve Earle) made their debut performance on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, playing one new song, the soul cover &quot;See and Don&#x27;t See,&quot; and old favorite &quot;I&#x27;m Her Slave&quot; from &quot;Congregation&quot;. The reunited Whigs played their first full concert the next night at Manhattan venue The Bowery Ballroom, receiving critical accolades from the major media. &quot;Regardless of how the surprising reunion of The Afghan Whigs turns out, their show last night at the Bowery Ballroom will go down as the &#x27;90s alt-rock heroes&#x27; greatest concert ever,&quot; Glenn Gamboa wrote in Newsday; meanwhile, Steve Kandell noted in a &quot;SPIN&quot; review that &quot;their first show together since then, at New York&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom last night, felt less like an easy nostalgia trip than a reminder of problems we, perhaps selectively, forgot we ever had. …Leader Greg Dulli was leaner, meaner, fitter, and in better voice at 47 than even during the band&#x27;s heyday… From the opening strains of &quot;Crime Scene, Part One,&quot; all the old drama and menace and hurt feelings and failings were right there, palpable and visceral, all couched in the equally palpable sense of relief that none of us are that fucked up anymore.&quot; The Afghan Whigs&#x27; first new recording released during the 2012 reformation, &quot;See and Don&#x27;t See,&quot; also received considerable airplay on influential stations such as Sirius XMU, KEXP, XPN, and KCRW. On July 16, the band released their second new recording, a cover of Frank Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Lovecrimes.&quot; Like the previous release, the song was made available as a free download from the band&#x27;s website.

In 2013 at South by Southwest (SXSW), The Afghan Whigs headlined The FADER FORT and played a collaborative set with surprise guest Usher. John Curly claims that moment solidified the probability that the band would record together again and that following their SXSW performance they began compiling ideas for new material.

On January 27, 2014, the band&#x27;s official mailing list announced an April release date for the first album of new The Afghan Whigs material in 16 years, a return to the Sub Pop roster titled &quot;Do to the Beast&quot;.

On February 18, 2014, the band announced that Rick McCollum was no longer a member of the group. Guitar parts on &quot;Do to the Beast&quot; were performed by numerous musicians including Dave Rosser, Jon Skibic, and Mark McGuire among others. The band added drummer Patrick Keeler of The Raconteurs and The Greenhornes in 2014.

The band released its eighth album, &quot;In Spades&quot; on May 5, 2017.

Guitarist Dave Rosser, a band member since 2014 who played on both of their reunion albums, died on June 28, 2017, following a long battle with colon cancer.

In February 2022, the band released their first single in five years, &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll Make You See God,&quot; which was featured on the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; soundtrack. How Do You Burn? their ninth studio album, was released Sept. 9, 2022, through BMG Rights Management, their first album since 1998&#x27;s &quot;1965&quot; to not be released under Sub Pop.

==Legacy==
The influence of The Afghan Whigs has been acknowledged by a number of musicians spanning genres and formats, including The National, The Gaslight Anthem, The Horrible Crowes, Interpol, The Hold Steady, My Chemical Romance and Jimmy Eat World.
Also, Italian indie rock band Afterhours, who extensively toured the US between 2006 and 2011, under the auspice of Greg Dulli cites The Afghan Whigs as their influence.

On June 23, 2009, a The Afghan Whigs tribute album was released, featuring contributions from Mark Lanegan, Joseph Arthur, and 11 other artists influenced by the band.

==Lyrical themes==
Since the band&#x27;s formation, certain themes have been noted as developing Dulli&#x27;s songwriting for The Afghan Whigs and beyond – in particular, his mixing of black humor with topics such as drug addiction, sexual deviancy and suicidal thoughts, which often seem more personal and provocative due to their frequent embrace of the first person. Many notable The Afghan Whigs&#x27; songs are rooted in exploring power battles in romantic relationships. &quot;Gentlemen&quot; in particular has been cited for its frank and uncomfortable exploration of masculine tropes and expectations, including elements of sadomasochism and alienation. &quot;Black Love&quot; meanwhile, contains lyrics about revenge and honesty.

Dulli&#x27;s songs with The Afghan Whigs also betray a fascination with and sympathy for the anti-hero, which he attributed to an influential conversation with his grandfather during childhood: &quot;I remember as a kid watching a cowboys-and-Indians movie and I was rooting for the cowboys… My grandfather asked me why, and I said, `Because they&#x27;re the good guys.&#x27; And my grandfather explained to me that the Indians were fighting for their land and that the cowboys were trying to steal it from them. Then he said something to me that I never forgot, which was, `Good people aren&#x27;t good all the time and bad people aren&#x27;t bad all the time.&#x27; I&#x27;ve been exploring that gray area ever since the idea that saints can fall and sinners can transcend.&quot;

==Covers==
The Afghan Whigs are known for their cover songs as well as their original material – in particular, freely reinterpreted songs from the soul music and R&amp;B canon that they were exposed to in their youth. However, The Afghan Whigs have never restricted their choices in covers by genre; even from their earliest concerts they have been known to cover songs like The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Like A Hurricane,&quot; as well as tracks made famous by The Supremes, Prince, PJ Harvey, The Fugees, and TLC. &quot;Congregation&quot; includes a version of &quot;The Temple&quot; from the soundtrack of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and they were also known to perform Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Wall&quot; in its entirety. The Whigs have covered a rare 1970 soul song by Marie &quot;Queenie&quot; Lyons, &quot;See and Don&#x27;t See,&quot; although the band continues to explore contemporary material as well, such as &quot;Love Crimes&quot; by current R&amp;B iconoclast Frank Ocean, which was debuted on the band&#x27;s 2012 reunion tour. The band also recorded a cover of the Lou Reed song &quot;I Love You, Suzanne&quot; for the album &quot;The Power of The Heart: A Tribute To Lou Reed&quot;. It was released by Light In The Attic Records on April 20, 2024.

<text>AFI (abbreviation for A Fire Inside) is an American rock band from Ukiah, California, formed in 1991. Since 1998, it consists of lead vocalist Davey Havok, drummer and backing vocalist Adam Carson, bassist, backing vocalist and keyboardist Hunter Burgan, and guitarist, backing vocalist and keyboardist Jade Puget. Havok and Carson are the sole remaining original members. Originally a hardcore punk band, they have since delved into many genres, starting with horror punk and following through post-hardcore and emo into alternative rock and gothic rock.

AFI has released eleven studio albums, ten EPs, one live album and one DVD. The band first reached substantial commercial success with their fifth album, &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; (2000), which peaked at number 174 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. They then broke into the mainstream with their sixth, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; (2003), which peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained on the chart for 51 weeks. The album was supported by popular singles &quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; and &quot;Silver and Cold&quot;, both of which peaked at number seven on America&#x27;s Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2003. &quot;The Leaving Song Pt. II&quot; was also released as a single, reaching number 16 on the chart. &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 2006 and is AFI&#x27;s best-selling release, having sold over 1.26 million copies .

AFI&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Decemberunderground&quot; (2006), debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and featured the hit single &quot;Miss Murder&quot;, which topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, reached number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and appeared in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 2013. Their next three albums, &quot;Crash Love&quot; (2009), &quot;Burials&quot; (2013) and &quot;AFI&quot; (2017), were also successful, peaking at increasing positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. An EP, &quot;The Missing Man&quot;, followed in December 2018. The band released their eleventh album, &quot;Bodies&quot;, on June 11, 2021.

==History==

===Early years (1991–1994)===
While still in high school in Ukiah, California, lead vocalist Davey Havok formed a band called AFI in November 1991 with Mark Stopholese and Vic Chalker. At the time, the band did not know how to play any instruments. Stopholese suggested that his friend, drummer Adam Carson, join the band. Stopholese learned guitar and Chalker learned bass, but Chalker was soon replaced by Geoff Kresge. By the end of October 1992, the band had played their first three shows, generally as an opener for a few other punk bands, including Influence 13, which featured future AFI guitarist Jade Puget and frequent collaborator Nick 13. AFI recorded their first EP, &quot;Dork&quot; (1993), with the now defunct band Loose Change, which also featured Puget.

The band briefly broke up in 1993, when the members left Ukiah to attend different colleges. They decided to commit to AFI full-time after an extremely positive experience and enthusiastic crowd response at a reunion show they played at The Phoenix Theater over Christmas break.

AFI relocated to Berkeley, California and lived in a squat that was a decommissioned fraternity house. Between 1993 and 1995, the band independently released vinyl EPs such as &quot;Behind the Times&quot;, Eddie Picnic&#x27;s All Wet and &quot;Fly in the Ointment&quot;, as well as the compilation EPs &quot;This Is Berkeley, Not West Bay&quot;, &quot;AFI/Heckle&quot;, and &quot;Bombing the Bay&quot; (with Swingin&#x27; Utters).

===First three albums (1995–1998)===
AFI&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot; was released July 4, 1995, on Wingnut Records. It was by Doug Sangalang and Rancid&#x27;s Tim Armstrong and Brett Reed. The album featured fast and upbeat hardcore songs, with humorous lyrical themes, which are vocalized in songs such as &quot;Nyquil&quot;, &quot;Cereal Wars&quot;, and &quot;I Wanna Get a Mohawk (But Mom Won&#x27;t Let Me Get One)&quot;. Around this time, they coined the term &#x27;East Bay hardcore&#x27; to describe their genre.

AFI signed on to Nitro Records, a record label started by The Offspring&#x27;s Dexter Holland and Greg K. AFI would remain with the label until the release of the &quot;336 EP&quot; (2002). In 1996, they released their second album, &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot;. Two songs from their previous album, &quot;Yurf Rendenmein&quot; and &quot;Two of A Kind&quot;, were re-recorded for this album. After several tours in support of the album, Kresge decided to leave the group. His spot was filled by current AFI bassist Hunter Burgan for the remaining album tour dates.

Burgan went on to help AFI record &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot; (1997) and was invited to become their full-time bassist. Jade Puget, a former member of Influence 13 and Havok&#x27;s close friend, also provided background vocals and additional guitar on the album, making it the first to feature all four current members of the band. It is also the first album to be copyrighted to the band&#x27;s official moniker, A Fire Inside. Subsequently, the &quot;A Fire Inside EP&quot; (1998) was released, after which Stopholese left the band and was replaced by Puget.

===Darker sound and wider reach (1999–2001)===
The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot; (1999), was a musical turning point which featured a darker sound, mixing the band&#x27;s original hardcore roots with dark romantic influences and an emphasis on a more somber atmosphere and lyrics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later referred to this as the point where Havok &quot;developed into a singer and songwriter of substance&quot;. During this period, AFI&#x27;s style was considered punk rock. The influence of death rock and gothic rock was also apparent. Offspring frontman Dexter Holland was featured as a backing vocalist on two tracks.

The &quot;All Hallow&#x27;s E.P.&quot; (1999) further explored the horror punk genre, featuring artwork and lyrics containing Halloween themes, including a cover of the Misfits song &quot;Halloween&quot;. The song &quot;The Boy Who Destroyed the World&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, and the single &quot;Totalimmortal&quot; was later covered by The Offspring.

On September 19, 2000, AFI released &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;, which debuted on the Billboard Charts at number 174, and peaked at number 9 on the Heatseekers chart. It continued to touch base with the horror punk genre, but expanded into styles that were a departure from previous works. The album featured slower, more melodic songs that were more reminiscent of alternative rock, such as &quot;Ever and a Day&quot; and &quot;6 to 8&quot;. Hardcore influences were present, more overtly on some tracks. The album sold over 100,000 copies. &quot;The Days of the Phoenix&quot; was released as a single and video and had some moderate mainstream success, garnering the band more TV and radio airplay. The song reached the UK Singles Chart with its titular EP in 2001, peaking at number 152. The success of &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; helped to encourage the band to pursue higher mainstream notoriety.

===Mainstream labels and popularity (2002–2007)===
In 2002, AFI left Nitro Records. DreamWorks Records artists and repertoire executive Luke Wood signed them to the label following intense interest. Their first album for the label, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;, was released in 2003. The album opened in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top ten and scored enthusiastic lead reviews in major music magazines. The songs &quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot;, &quot;The Leaving Song Pt. II&quot;, and &quot;Silver and Cold&quot; had some Billboard chart success and exposed the band to even larger audiences. They were nominated in the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for the MTV2 award category for the &quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; video, which came to be their first VMA.

In June 2006, AFI&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Decemberunderground&quot;, was released on Interscope Records. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Miss Murder&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Charts. The release reflects the continually changing and growing fan base of the band, and the album debuted as No. 1 on the Billboard charts. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies of the album. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Love Like Winter&quot;, was successful on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and was retired after 40 days on the countdown.

On December 12, 2006, AFI released their first DVD, &quot;I Heard a Voice – Live from Long Beach Arena&quot;, featuring a live performance shot in Long Beach, California. The performance was later released on December 13, 2007, as a live album, and charted at number 133 on the Billboard 200, and number 16 on the Hard Rock Albums chart. The album was well-received, with punknews.org giving it a four-star rating and commenting that when hearing or seeing the performance &quot;you begin to realize AFI are truly a great live band,&quot; and that at some points &quot;Pantera would say turn the noise down.&quot;

On July 7, 2007, AFI performed on the American leg of Live Earth. They performed &quot;The Missing Frame&quot;, &quot;Love Like Winter&quot;, &quot;Miss Murder&quot;, and a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.

===&quot;Crash Love&quot;, &quot;Burials&quot; and &quot;The Blood Album&quot; (2008–2017)===
In July 2009, Havok announced that after two years of writing and recording, a new album titled &quot;Crash Love&quot; would be released on September 29, 2009. It was recorded with producer David Bottrill (who was later dismissed in favor of Joe McGrath and Jacknife Lee). The first single from the album, &quot;Medicate&quot;, was released on August 25, 2009, and reached number 7 on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart. Another single, &quot;Beautiful Thieves&quot;, followed later in the year. Havok called &quot;Crash Love&quot; &quot;the album by which we&#x27;ll be remembered&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first release to make a significantly smaller impact than their previous effort, but peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

From April to June 2013, several teaser videos were released on AFI&#x27;s website.
The band was announced to play Riot Fest 2013, as well as being signed to Republic Records. A single titled &quot;I Hope You Suffer&quot; was released on July 23, and the title of the album, &quot;Burials&quot;, was announced. Another single, &quot;17 Crimes&quot;, was released on August 6. The third single from the album, titled &quot;The Conductor&quot;, was released on September 9. The album was released on October 22, produced by Gil Norton. It peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In a June 2016 interview with Aggressive Tendencies, Puget confirmed that AFI had begun working on new material for their tenth studio album. On October 27, the band released two new songs via Spotify, &quot;Snow Cats&quot; and &quot;White Offerings&quot;.
The band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;AFI&quot; (also known as &quot;The Blood Album&quot;), was released on January 20, 2017. Puget served as the main producer. The album peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Other singles were released, including &quot;Aurelia&quot; and &quot;Hidden Knives&quot;.

===&quot;The Missing Man&quot; and &quot;Bodies&quot; (2018–present)===
On October 26, 2018, the band surprise-released a new single called &quot;Get Dark&quot; on Spotify and iTunes. This was followed by &quot;The Missing Man&quot; EP on December 7, featuring five new songs.

On March 25, 2020, AFI was announced as a headliner for the Two Thousand Trees Festival on July 10 of the same year. Puget was interviewed by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; to promote the festival appearance and said that &quot;hopefully at least a couple of songs&quot; from the band&#x27;s eleventh album would be released by then. On April 27, 2020, Puget said that the album was finished, but that its release date was being pushed back as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The next day, it was announced that the Two Thousand Trees Festival was being pushed back to 2021, also due to the pandemic.

On January 15, 2021, the band released the tracks &quot;Twisted Tongues&quot; and &quot;Escape from Los Angeles&quot;. On February 25, it was revealed that the album would be called &quot;Bodies&quot;, and be released on June 11. Along with the announcement, the band revealed two new songs as another joint single, &quot;Looking Tragic / Begging for Trouble&quot;. On April 9, &quot;Dulceria / Far Too Near&quot; were released, followed by &quot;Tied to a Tree&quot; on May 25.

On March 11, 2023, AFI played &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; in full for the first and last time at the Kia Forum on the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, supported by Jawbreaker, Chelsea Wolfe and Choir Boy.

==Musical style==

AFI&#x27;s music has been classified under many genres of music, including punk rock, hardcore punk, emo, gothic rock, horror punk, skate punk, alternative rock, screamo, garage punk, and pop-punk. 

AFI&#x27;s sound has constantly changed. AFI originally were a hardcore punk band. AFI&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot; (1995), &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot; (1996), and &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot; (1997), all have been described as hardcore punk. AFI&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot; and the band&#x27;s fifth album &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; both have been described as horror punk. AFI&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; is considered post-hardcore and emo. &quot;Decemberunderground&quot;, which features elements of music genres like electronic, new wave, industrial, punk rock, hardcore punk, and synthpop, is considered alternative rock, post-hardcore and emo. AFI&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Crash Love&quot; is considered alternative rock and pop rock. AFI&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Burials&quot; is considered alternative rock and gothic rock. AFI&#x27;s 2017 self-titled album, also referred to as &quot;The Blood Album&quot;, has been described as new wave, post-punk and gothic rock. In 2021 AFI released their 11th album Bodies, which has been described as continuing their gothic rock sound and taking a greater influence from new wave.

&quot;Louder&quot; wrote, &quot;Long before My Chemical Romance topped the charts with the anthemic ‘&#x27;Welcome to the Black Parade&#x27;’, California&#x27;s AFI were already injecting their brand of punk with gothic imagery and a sense of theatricality. By the time Gerard Way’s band arrived, AFI had already built a devoted fan base incorporating punks, hardcore fans, goths, metallers and every other type of musical pariah imaginable. They were a band that couldn&#x27;t help but stand out everywhere they went.&quot; &quot;AllMusic&quot; described AFI as &quot;Northern California hardcore punk revivalists&quot; whose style &quot;evolved to include alternative rock, post-punk, emo, and new wave flair&quot;. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; said that the band &quot;morphed from a conventional garage-punk band into a gothic-rock arena act.&quot; &quot;Loudwire&quot; said that the band &quot;developed from more of a SoCal punk style into a somewhat gothic post-hardcore band&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; said that &quot;Although often described as a cross between goth rock and hardcore punk, by the time of their commercial breakthrough in 2003, [AFI] started out as a straight ahead skate/punk band.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;To call California-based hardcore/screamo quartet A.F.I. a band without a flag in the current modern rock landscape is not an unfair assessment of their situation.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; categorized the band as pop-punk. AFI has often been labeled as &quot;gothic punk&quot; due to the band&#x27;s appearance, but AFI band members never considered the label accurate. Jade Puget has said, &quot;Goth-punk isn&#x27;t a style of music, it doesn&#x27;t even exist.&quot;

Puget, who has produced much of the band&#x27;s music, stated in 2021:
==Influences==
AFI have drawn inspiration from a diverse range of artists. &quot;We have many, many influences that span the musical spectrum&quot;, Havok told &quot;the Boston Globe&quot;. &quot;Each of us grew up on everything from punk to hardcore to dark &#x27;80s UK stuff like the Cure, Bauhaus, Joy Division, and [the] Sisters of Mercy. And there were rock bands like Guns N&#x27; Roses and Metallica and industrial bands like Skinny Puppy, Ministry, Front 242 and Alien Sex Fiend. And we all love the Smiths.&quot; Other groups that have inspired AFI include the Teen Idles, Dag Nasty, Government Issue, Negative Approach, Earth Crisis, Snapcase, Refused, Sick of it All, the Cro-Mags, Minor Threat, Black Flag, the Misfits, the Germs, and State of Alert. AFI have also been influenced by electronic band OMD, whom Havok said &quot;have and will continue to musically and emotionally inspire&quot; him.

==Legacy==
According to the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, AFI have been &quot;hailed as being responsible for bringing back the big &#x27;80s rock chorus.&quot; The band has received much praise in particular from &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, which has supported the group since the mid-1990s. The publication rated the band&#x27;s major-label debut, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;, as the most anticipated album of 2003, and noted that it &quot;blew the doors off goth-punk as we knew it&quot;. AFI has also been granted responsibility for paving the way for the rise of the visual element of rock bands in the 2000s; in a December 2006 article, Revolver Magazine wrote that &quot;AFI have increased the importance of a band&#x27;s visual identity and the flair for the theatrical,&quot; adding that &quot;when a group like Panic! at the Disco borrows imagery from a movie such as &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, you have to consider the precedent AFI set when they borrowed cues from Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.&quot; &quot;Shoutmouth.com&quot; placed AFI at number 22 on its list of the 25 most influential punk bands, noting that the band &quot;have evolved with each album, showing that a punk band can not only change, but stay true to their sound at the same time. AFI have been on a constant rise through their career, and as such, out the honors&quot;. After &quot;Sing The Sorrow&quot; release, &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; described Havok&#x27;s voice as one of those &quot;you&#x27;ll love or hate, but one thing can&#x27;t be denied, this guy has range beyond belief&quot;. Recognized by his trademark flair and vocal style, Havok has been recognized as &quot;a bona fide rock god&quot; by &quot;Alternative Press&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;The Pitch&quot; described the band&#x27;s fan club as a &quot;particularly excitable bunch&quot;, adding that &quot;there&#x27;s also the type of sentiments that put the &quot;cult&quot; back into cult success, such as links to something called &#x27;the Church of Havok&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="154046" wikidata="Q1893311" url="?curid=154046" title="Material Exchange Format">
<text>Material Exchange Format (MXF) is a container format for professional digital video and audio media defined by a set of SMPTE standards. A typical example of its use is for delivering advertisements to TV stations and tapeless archiving of broadcast TV programs. It is also used as part of the Digital Cinema Package for delivering movies to commercial theaters.

== Summary ==
MXF, when used in the form of &quot;Operational Pattern OP1A&quot; or &quot;OPAtom&quot;, can be used as a &quot;container&quot;, &quot;wrapper&quot; or &quot;reference file&quot; format which supports a number of different streams of coded &quot;essence&quot;, encoded in any of a variety of video and audio compression formats, together with a metadata wrapper which describes the material contained within the MXF file. Other &quot;Operational Patterns&quot; can contain or reference multiple materials, just like a simple timeline of a video editing program.

MXF has full timecode and metadata support and is intended as a platform-agnostic stable standard for future professional video and audio applications.

MXF was developed to carry a subset of the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF) data model, under a policy known as the Zero Divergence Directive (ZDD). This theoretically enables MXF/AAF workflows between non-linear editing (NLE) systems using AAF and cameras, servers, and other devices using MXF.

== Usage ==
From 2004 onwards, MXF was in the process of evolving from standard to deployment. The breadth of the standard was subject to lead to interoperability problems, as vendors implement different parts of the standard or interpret misleading parts of the standard differently.

MXF is fairly effective at the interchange of D10 (IMX) material, mainly because of the success of the Sony eVTR and Sony&#x27;s eVTR RDD to SMPTE. Workflows combining the eVTR, Avid NLE systems, and broadcast servers using MXF in coordination with AAF are now possible.

Long-GOP MPEG-2 material interchange between video servers is possible, as broadcasters develop application specifications they expect their vendors to implement.

As of autumn 2005, there were major interoperability problems with MXF in broadcast post-production use. The two data-recording camera systems which produced MXF at that time, Sony&#x27;s XDCAM and Panasonic&#x27;s DVCPRO P2, produced mutually incompatible files due to opaque sub-format options obscured behind the MXF file extension. Without advanced tools, it was impossible to distinguish these incompatible formats.

Some of the incompatibilities were addressed and ratified in the 2009 version of the standard.

MXF is used as the audio and video packaging format for Digital Cinema Package (DCP). It is also used in the STANAG specification documents.

The file extension for MXF files is &quot;.mxf&quot;. The Macintosh File Type Code registered with Apple for MXF files is &quot;mxf &quot;, including a trailing space.

== Tools ==

=== MXF converters ===
This list represents some examples of free and open source products that support the MXF standard:

* FFmpeg, an open source project added support for muxing and demuxing of MXF and MXF D-10 in FFmpeg 0.5, released in March 2009.
:* Note that up to 2019, FFmpeg implements only the base MXF standard but does not provide vendor specific profiles, e.g. one cannot produce a MXF File that is compatible to Sony XDCAM devices due to missing header metadata entries (for further information see ffmpeg trac ticket 5097)
* GStreamer is an open source Material Exchange Format (MXF) library. Pitivi uses this tool.
* VSDC is a free video editor for open and edit mxf file.
* Ingex is an open-source (GPL) suite of software for the digital capture of audio and video data, developed and heavily used by the BBC. SDI capture is supported, as well as real-time transcoding (with MXF). Portions of the suite also act as a network file server for media files, as well as archiving to LTO-3 data tape.

== The MXF standards ==

===Base documents===
* SMPTE 377M: The MXF File Format Specification (the overall master document)

* SMPTE 388M: GC-AA (how to store A-law coded audio essence data in MXF using the Generic Container)
* SMPTE 389M: Generic Container Reverse Play System Element
* SMPTE 394M: System Item Scheme-1 for Generic Container
* SMPTE 405M: Elements and Individual Data Items for the GC SI Scheme 1

===Metadata, dictionaries and registries===
* SMPTE 380M: DMS1 (a standard set of descriptive metadata to use with MXF files)
* SMPTE 436M: MXF Mappings for VBI Lines and Ancillary Data Packets
* SMPTE RP210: SMPTE Metadata Dictionary (the latest version is available here.)
* SMPTE RP224: Registry of SMPTE Universal Labels

== Availability of standards ==

SMPTE&#x27;s top standards page has information, for the ordering of CD-ROMs, which would hold formal copy of the SMPTE standards. Judging by SMPTE&#x27;s index, all of the standards, referenced above, would be contained on those CD-ROMs, as available from SMPTE.
IRT Test Center contains up-to-date information on the status of the SMPTE documents.

<text>Henry E. Rohlsen Airport is a public airport six miles (10 km) southwest of Christiansted on the island of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. The airport is named after Henry E. Rohlsen, a St. Croix native who was one of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II.

The airport, which was a hub for Aero Virgin Islands in the 1970s and 1980s, can receive jets up to the size of the Boeing 747s. Before 1996 the airport was known as Alexander Hamilton International Airport.

==History==
During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force stationed the 12th Bombardment Squadron (25th Bombardment Group) at the airport for antisubmarine patrols flying B-18 Bolo aircraft from November 8, 1941, to November 10, 1942. During the time the military operated the airport, it was called Benedict Airfield. When the airport was transferred to civilian control, it was renamed to honor former St. Croix resident Alexander Hamilton.

Several airlines have operated scheduled passenger jet service to St. Croix in the past, including Air Florida with Douglas DC-9-10s, Caribair with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s, Continental Airlines with Boeing 727-200s, Eastern Airlines with Boeing 727-100s, 727-200s and 757-200s, Midway Airlines with Boeing 737-200s, Pan Am with Boeing 727-200s as well as wide-body Airbus A300B4s, and Trans Caribbean Airways with Boeing 727-200s. American Airlines has served St. Croix for many years. In 1974, American served the airport with Boeing 707 and Boeing 727-100 jetliners with nonstop flights to New York City. In 1994, American operated Airbus A300-600R wide-body jets into St. Croix with nonstop service to Miami. A Boeing 747 carrying relief supplies during the aftermath of Hurricane Marilyn landed at the airport in 1995. Satellite imagery shows the presence of C-17 and C-130 military transports in 2006 and 2015.

On November 11, 2018, the world&#x27;s second-largest cargo airplane, the Antonov An-124, landed on St. Croix to deliver building supplies for houses as part of the hurricane recovery.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Henry E. Rohlsen Airport covers an area of , which contains one asphalt-paved runway (10/28) measuring . For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2013, the airport had 36,287 aircraft operations, an average of 99 per day: 68% air taxi, 25% general aviation, 6% scheduled commercial and 1% military. In the same period, 36 aircraft were based at this airport, including 11 single-engine, 15 multi-engine, five jets, four military aircraft and one helicopter.

=== Terminal modernization and expansion project===
In August 2018, the Virgin Islands Port Authority (VIPA) held a charrette to announce and discuss the terminal&#x27;s expansion and renovation. On March 14, 2019, the VIPA announced that bidding for phase one of the upgrade project would be in September. The renovation was expected to be complete within a year.

VIPA had begun the Henry E. Rohlsen Airport Terminal Expansion and Modernization Project as of September 2020. The improvements to the terminal will be completed in four phases over a six-year period.

Phase one entails enclosing 5,500 square feet of walkway space to increase the lounge&#x27;s seating capacity, refurbishing the existing passenger lounge space and restrooms, enclosing the 1,100-square-foot open-air gardens with a new roof structure to provide additional concessions space, and upgrading the mechanical systems for the additional air-conditioned area.

Phase one is estimated to cost $8.6 million and was funded by a $7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration in 2019 with a local match of $1.6 million from the VI Port Authority. The construction was anticipated to take 18 months and end in March 2022, but was ahead of schedule and ended on December 21, 2021.

Phases two through four include the addition of a second level to accommodate jet bridges, additional hold room, concession and retail space, improvement of passenger flow and baggage handling in the terminal; redesign, expansion, and modernization of the interior of the terminal to make the best use of the existing floor plan; the addition of tropical landscaping; and changes to improve the flow of vehicular traffic. Expanding the terminal will allow St. Croix to take full advantage of its 10,000-foot runway.

While Phase 1 of the HERA Terminal Expansion is fully funded, VIPA is actively seeking funding sources for Phases 2 through 4. The project is estimated to cost $140 million.

<text>The Franklin REX 5, (also known as the “Rex-Pro”, as the “Rex 5000”, and with cosmetic variation as the “Rex 5001”) was one of the Rex line of Personal Digital Assistants, each a PCMCIA PC card and thus the size of a credit card, built around a Toshiba microprocessor emulating a Zilog Z80. The REX firmware was written by Starfish Software, and the hardware was manufactured by Citizen Electronics. Earlier models in this line (the Rex and the Rex-3) had almost no input possibilities except to download data when installed in a host computer or in a docking station; the Rex 5 added a sixth button and introduced a modal input method. (The later REX 6000 again had only five buttons, but included a touch screen.) Further, with 512 KB of RAM, the Rex 5 had twice the memory of the Rex-3 (which, in turn, had four times that of the original Rex).

The REX 5000 was repackaged by Motorola as the StarTAC ClipOn Organizer, which piggybacked onto digital versions of their popular StarTAC phone (as well as some Timeport models), expanding the capabilities of the phone from having a capacity of 100 contacts to 1000, and adding calendar and note functionality.

The REX 5000 and StarTAC ClipOn Organizer, like earlier models of the Rex, utilized Starfish Software&#x27;s TrueSync for data synchronization. Starfish would later be acquired by Motorola.

The REX 5000 was succeeded by the Xircom REX 6000.

<text>The REX 6000 is an ultra-thin Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) produced by Xircom, and later Intel, from about 2000 to 2001. The REX may be synchronized by inserting it in a host PC&#x27;s PCMCIA/PC-card slot. Docking stations were manufactured for connection to hosts without PC card Type-II slots, which allows the REX to be connected via a USB or serial connection.

The REX 6000 is the successor to the Franklin REX 5000, with a notable difference being the addition of a touch screen. In addition, it is possible to remove and install executable code (including both custom applications and the operating system itself). As with the earlier models, the REX 6000 hardware was developed by the Citizen Watch Company of Japan, marketed as the &quot;DataSlim-2&quot;. The firmware for previous REX models was written by Starfish Software, but the REX 6000, though modeled on previous versions, included a complete re-write of the firmware.

The REX 6000 does not support handwriting recognition and to enter data, a virtual keyboard is used. The standard REX 6000 has an American keyboard layout, although third-party software allows for other keyboard layouts. The pre-installed software for the Rex consists of the following:

* Calendar
* Address book
* To-do list
* Notebook
* World clock
* Calculator

Third-party software (&quot;add-ins&quot;) include games, painting programs, spreadsheets and replacements or improvements of the pre-installed software. Most third-party software has been developed in spare time by interested users using customized versions of the Z88DK compiler or the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

The earliest release of the REX 6000 had 1 MB of flash memory, while later releases doubled this to 2 MB. (Earlier REXes stored user data in RAM with the operating system in ROM.) The REX has 32 KB of RAM, but only 12 KB is available for application developers. It uses a 4.3 MHz Toshiba microprocessor compatible to the Zilog Z80, has a 240 × 120 pixel monochrome LCD, and is capable of providing beep sounds to deliver alarms and reminders. The REX 6000 is powered by two button-type CR2016 lithium cells.

Around 2002 Intel acquired Xircom and subsequently discontinued this product line.

<text>Baldur Benedikt von Schirach (; 9 May 1907 – 8 August 1974) was a German politician who was the leader of the Hitler Youth from 1931 to 1940. From 1940 to 1945, he was the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (district leader) and &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich governor) of Vienna.

A member of the Nazi Party from the age of 18, Schirach was named national youth leader of the party in 1931. In 1932, he was elected as a deputy to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. After Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he was appointed &quot;Jugendführer&quot; (Youth Leader) of the German Reich, responsible for all youth organizations in the nation. In 1940, Schirach saw action as an infantryman in the French Campaign, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. In 1940, Schirach was appointed &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the Reichsgau Vienna; Artur Axmann succeeded him as leader of the Hitler Youth. A virulent antisemite, he was responsible for deporting 65,000 Viennese Jews to various Nazi concentration camps in German-occupied Poland. 

In April 1945, facing Red Army advance, Schirach fled from Vienna to Tyrol, where he later surrendered to American forces. At the Nuremberg trials, he was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years in prison. After completing his sentence at Spandau in 1966, Schirach retired to Southern Germany. He died in 1974 at the age of 67.

Schirach was born in Berlin, the youngest of four children of theatre director, grand ducal chamberlain and retired captain of the cavalry Carl Baily Norris von Schirach (1873–1948) and his American wife Emma Middleton Lynah Tillou (1872–1944). A member of the noble Schirach family, of Sorbian West Slavic origins, three of his four grandparents were from the United States, chiefly from Pennsylvania. English was the first language he learned at home and he did not learn to speak German until the age of six. He had two sisters, Viktoria Benedikta and the opera singer Rosalind von Schirach, and a brother, Karl Benedict von Schirach. His brother committed suicide in 1919 at the age of 19.

Schirach was educated at the Wilhelm-Ernst-Gymnasium from 1916 to 1917, followed by the &quot;Forest Pedagogium&quot; boarding school at Bad Berka. This was inspired by a similar school founded by Hermann Lietz. He then returned to Weimar where he attended the &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; at Museumplatz 3.

On 31 March 1932 Schirach married the 19-year-old Henriette Hoffmann, the daughter of Heinrich Hoffmann, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal photographer and friend. Schirach&#x27;s family was at first vehemently opposed to this marriage, but Hitler insisted. Otto Strasser dismissively described Schirach as &quot;a young effeminate&quot;. Through this relationship, Schirach became part of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle. The young couple were welcome guests at Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Berghof&quot; holiday home. Henriette von Schirach gave birth to four children: Angelika Benedikta von Schirach (born 1933), lawyer Klaus von Schirach (born 1935), businessman Robert Benedict Wolf von Schirach (1938–1980) and sinologist Richard von Schirach (1942–2023). Robert had a son, the lawyer and best-selling German crime-fiction writer Ferdinand von Schirach. Richard had children Ariadne von Schirach, philosopher and critic, and Benedict Wells, a novelist.

==Nazi Party career==
===Reich youth leader===
Schirach joined a &quot;Wehrjugendgruppe&quot; (paramilitary youth group) at the age of seventeen, the youth division of the . He first met Hitler aged seventeen, when Hitler gave a speech in Weimar and Schirach was assigned guard duty. Schirach considered this the strongest speech he ever heard from Hitler, and paid attention to the sound of his voice, &quot;deep and raw, resonant like a cello.&quot; Schirach wrote a poem about the encounter, which was published in Hans Severus Ziegler&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Der Nationalsozialist&quot;. It was set to music by Gerhard Pallman and published in several songbooks. Schirach later described it as one of his &quot;many bad poems&quot;. In October 1924, Hitler again visited Weimar, and visited the home of Schirach&#x27;s father.

Schirach became a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) on 29 August 1925 (membership number 17,251). In 1925 he also joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in Weimar. He followed Hitler to Munich, to attend university, and also attended the salons of Elsa and Hugo Bruckmann, with whom he lived for a time. In November 1927 Schirach first demonstrated his talents for organisation, packing a room with students for a speech by Hitler. In February 1928 he became a university group leader of the National Socialist German Students&#x27; League (&quot;Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund&quot;; NSDStB), and on 20 July 1928, he became the national leader (&quot;Reichsführer&quot;). He worked to broaden the Nazi Party&#x27;s appeal to the bourgeoisie. Schirach was supported by Hitler in internal elections, who also wanted the Nazi Party to have a broad social base. During this period Schirach was twice challenged to a duel, and was given a conditional prison sentence for accepting one of them.

Schirach was skilled at bureaucratic power struggles. He founded the School Children&#x27;s Leagues (&quot;Schülerbünde&quot;) to create competition to the Hitler Youth. He made an ally of Joseph Goebbels. In 1929 he defeated Kurt Gruber in an internal election, and later convinced Hitler to sideline Gruber.

In 1929, he was selected as a &quot;Reichsredner&quot; (national speaker) and was active in Party propaganda activities. In 1931 he was prosecuted for an anti-Versailles demonstration, and used his court appearance to attack the Weimar Republic. He was given a three-month suspended prison sentence. On 30 October 1931, he was named as &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; (National Youth Leader) of the Nazi Party.

On 31 March 1932, Schirach married Henriette Hoffmann. Hitler and Ernst Röhm were witnesses to the marriage, and the reception was held in Hitler&#x27;s apartment. Henriette&#x27;s wealthy father, Heinrich Hoffmann, paid for them to move into a luxurious apartment by the Englischer Garten. With Heinrich Hoffmann, Schirach produced several propaganda books of Hoffmann&#x27;s photographs, including &quot;Hitler As No One Knows Him&quot;, &quot;Youth Around Hitler&quot;, and &quot;Hitler in His Mountains&quot;. Schirach wrote the captions. The books sold hundreds of thousands of copies, earning Schirach and Hoffmann substantial royalties.

In May 1932, Schirach was made &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; for Youth Education (&quot;Reichsleiter für Jügenderziehung&quot;). &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; was the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party.

On 16 June 1932, he was made &quot;Reichsführer&quot; of the Party&#x27;s Hitler Youth organization, and resigned from the Student League. Under Schirach, the Hitler Youth stewarded NSDAP events, and 21 members died in 1932. Schirach described these deaths as &quot;blood sacrifice&quot; for propaganda purposes. One example was Herbert Norkus, a fifteen-year-old boy who was stabbed to death by Communists. In a 31 May 1932 speech, Schirach recounted Norkus&#x27;s death and called for a &quot;National Socialist dictatorship&quot;. Schirach gave a memorial speech on the third anniversary of Norkus&#x27;s death in January 1935.

Schirach became a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as a representative of the Party electoral list at the 31 July 1932 election. He would continue to serve in that body until the end of the Nazi regime, from November 1933 as a deputy from electoral constituency 7, Breslau, and from March 1936 as a deputy from electoral constituency 6, Pomerania. He moved the Hitler Youth headquarters to Berlin in 1933 to stay close to Hitler. The building was purchased by an anonymous industrialist.

As leader of the Hitler Youth, Schirach helped to build the &quot;Führer myth&quot;, using his speeches to communicate an emotional connection to Hitler, with themes of laying down one&#x27;s life for Hitler. He wrote the lyrics to many songs, including the &quot;song of the Hitler Youth flag&quot;, which was used in the film &quot;Der Hitlerjunge Quex&quot;. Schirach organised a &quot;Reich Youth Day&quot; on 1 October 1932, with between 50,000 and 70,000 adolescents of the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls attending the (Potsdam Airship Port). It was financed by sales of badges and other propaganda materials. The Hitler Youth also published various magazines, and organised leisure excursions including militaristic activities such as flying, reconnaissance, motorised and mounted &quot;units&quot;. On 17 May 1938, Schirach said, &quot;The real, great educational act for a people lies in ingraining in youth blind obedience, unshakeable loyalty, unconditional comradeship and absolute reliability.&quot;

On 5 April 1933, the offices of the Reich Committee of German Youth Leagues were occupied by a unit of the Hitler Youth. From the records they obtained detailed knowledge of all youth groups including their key figures. In a second surprise raid they took control of the Reich League for German Youth Hostels (&quot;Reichsverband fuer deutsche Jugendherbergen&quot;). On 10 June 1933, Schirach was named &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; (Youth Leader of the German Reich), with responsibility for all youth organizations in the nation. His permission was required to found youth organisations. Also on that date, he was made a State Secretary in the Reich Interior Ministry. On 23 June 1933, all other youth organisations were retroactively dissolved from 17 June 1933.

Under Schirach, the Hitler Youth was nominally run by self-organising youth, with the motto &quot;youth leads youth&quot;. This echoed Goethe&#x27;s line &quot;Youth educates itself in youth&quot;. However, strict ideological boundaries were imposed. Schirach rejected the idea that Goethe was a &quot;prophet of humanity&quot;, &quot;above the fatherland and the nation&quot;, and linked to &quot;individualistic education&quot;. In a speech to students on 5 November 1941, Schirach alluded to individualism, saying &quot;The idea is lonely&quot;, but argued &quot;Academic freedom is not a catchword of liberalism. It is an achievement of the German spirit.&quot;
Schirach became a member of the Academy for German Law upon its formation in October 1933.

Schirach appeared frequently at rallies, such as the Nuremberg rally of 1934, when he appeared with Hitler in rousing the &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; audience. The event was filmed for &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, the propaganda film made by Leni Riefenstahl for the Nazi Party. Schirach set the militaristic tone of the youth organisation, which participated in military-style exercises, as well as practising use of military equipment such as rifles. In July 1940, when a new play by Hans Baumann was staged there, Schirach insisted that 2,000 local Hitler Youth members be part of that 

In 1936, the Hitler Youth was declared the only legal youth organisation. At this point it had approximately six million members. Membership became compulsory in March 1939, with almost eight million members aged 10 and older. On 1 December 1936, Schirach was given the position of State Secretary to the Reich Government, as head of a Supreme Reich Authority (&quot;Oberste Reichsbehörde&quot;).

Some sections of the church scouts and Bundische Jugend resisted forced incorporation. For example, in 1934, in the small town of Wassenberg, Catholic Boy Scouts disrupted the transmission of a speech by Schirach. As a result, their scout uniforms were confiscated by the Aachen State Police Office. Contempt for Schirach was expressed in various songs, such as &quot;Baldur, darling, be clear about this: When a new spirit stirs you will be dumped as soon as possible.&quot; (Baldur, Liebling, sei dir darüber im klaren: Wenn ein neuer Geist sich rührt, wirst du schleunigst abserviert.&quot;)

The Hitler Youth was a militaristic organisation, with Erwin Rommel serving as liaison officer to the Wehrmacht, in charge of military training for the youth. Rommel attempted to subordinate the Hitler Youth to the Wehrmacht instead of the NSDAP, and managed to trick Schirach into signing a document to that effect. His deputy Hartmann Lauterbacher had previously rejected the proposal, but Schirach was not attentive to details. Schirach had to send Lauterbacher to Hitler to cancel the proposal. Hitler criticised Schirach and Rommel was removed from his position.

Schirach was a Protestant Christian, unlike his father and sister, who had left the Church. He stressed that &quot;the Hitler Youth was neither Protestant nor Catholic, but German&quot;, and regularly invoked God in his speeches. In a December 1933 speech he opposed proposals to make the Hitler Youth an explicit alternative to Christianity, saying &quot;They say of us that we are an anti-Christian movement. They even say that I am an outspoken paganist... I solemnly declare here, before the German public, that I stand on the basis of Christianity, but I declare just as solemnly that I will put down every attempt to introduce confessional matters into our Hitler Youth.&quot;

In March 1936 Schirach purchased in Kochel am See. He and Henriette had previously lived in a hunting lodge nearby in Urfeld am Walchensee. In March 1936, Manfred von Brauchitsch and his brother Harald insulted Henriette. Schirach told them they were not men of honour. Manfred challenged Schirach to a duel, but instead Schirach attacked them with a dog whip. Schirach had immunity as a member of the Reichstag.

Schirach was promoted to SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; on 9 November 1937.

In 1937, Schirach founded the Adolf Hitler Schools with Robert Ley. These were under the control of the Hitler Youth rather than the state education authority. In October 1941 Hitler ruled that their exams were equal to those of state high schools.

Schirach formed numerous links with other international youth organisations, particularly Fascist Italy. His deputy Hartmann Lauterbacher met Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, and Hitler Youth made cycling trips to England. Trips to England and Hungary were accused of spying. As &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot;, Schirach visited France, Turkey, Romania, Slovenia, Greece, Iraq, Iran, and Syria.

With the outbreak of war, almost 90% of Hitler Youth leaders were conscripted, and many were killed in the first few months of the war. There was a rise in juvenile crime due to blackouts, and the Hitler Youth was unable to exert control.

===Military service===

In December 1939, Schirach volunteered for military service in the army. After training, he served with the 4th (Machine Gun) Company of the &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; infantry regiment in the Battle of Sedan during the French Campaign. Initially he was a dispatch runner in the rank of &quot;Gefreiter&quot;. He was promoted to &quot;Leutnant&quot;, served as a platoon leader and was decorated for bravery with the Iron Cross 2nd class, before being recalled to Germany.

In Schirach&#x27;s absence, the Hitler Youth was administered by Hartmann Lauterbacher. In April 1940 Schirach had Lauterbacher sent for military service, replacing him with Artur Axmann on 3 May.

===Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of Vienna===
On 7 August 1940, Hitler appointed Schirach to succeed Josef Bürckel as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; of the Reichsgau Vienna, powerful posts in which he remained until the end of the war. He was sworn in as &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; by Hitler in Berlin on 29 September 1940. He also succeeded Bürckel as Reich Defense Commissioner of &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (Military District) XVII, which, in addition to his own Reichsgau, included Reichsgau Upper Danube, Reichsgau Lower Danube and part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. He retained his position as &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; for Youth Education.

Bürckel had been widely disliked, partly due to employing mainly functionaries from outside Vienna, and due to his brutal methods. Schirach took a different approach, employing Austrian National Socialists, and ingratiating himself with the Viennese population. He declared his &quot;love for this blessed and gifted city with its immeasurable cultural treasures&quot;, but stressed its position in the greater German &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s community&quot;).

Schirach took up residence in the Hohe Warte villa of his predecessor Bürckel, a building now occupied by the Embassy of Egypt. Henriette was delighted with the move. The Schirachs continued to live luxuriously. They had no qualms about stealing public money and property, and the property of Jews. Their house was decorated with furniture, artworks, rugs and tapestries stolen from Jews; the house itself had belonged to a Jew who had fled the country. One stolen painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder was bought by Schirach, with special permission from Hitler, for 30,000 Reichsmark, more than Schirach&#x27;s father&#x27;s annual salary. It was rediscovered in 1999 and sold for $600,000. Another painting by Pieter Brueghel the Younger was stolen from Jews who were deported to Theresienstadt where they died. It was purchased by Schirach for 24,000 Reichsmark, again with permission from Hitler. It was rediscovered in 2003 and sold for $688,000. The Schirachs bought around 12 paintings from Alois Miedl. They bought 25 paintings from the Mühlmann agency, totalling 244,000 Reichsmark, selling most of them at a profit. In 1944 Schirach accepted a violin from the State Opera&#x27;s collection, which was never returned. Schirach also made presents of public property to other people, such as a valuable table to Galeazzo Ciano, and an Italian Renaissance box to Renato Ricci. After the war, Henriette spent years trying to regain confiscated furniture and paintings.

Beginning in October 1940, Schirach was assigned to organise the evacuation of 2.5 million children from cities threatened by Allied bombing, sometimes to foster parents, but increasingly to purpose-built camps. Separating children from their parents was used as an opportunity to indoctrinate them ideologically.

Schirach continued his involvement with the Hitler Youth, pursuing links with other European youth organisations. In March 1941 he planned a Fascist youth umbrella organisation with Artur Axmann. He announced the &quot;European Youth Association&quot; at the fifth Hitler Youth summer games in Breslau on 28 August 1941. The association was actually formed in September 1942 in Vienna, under the joint presidency of Axmann and Aldo Vidussoni, with representatives from numerous European states and Japan. It was here he gave a notorious speech describing his deportation of the Jews to the East as his &quot;contribution to European culture&quot;. The closing rally was held on 18 September 1942 on the Heldenplatz. The residents of Vienna considered the rally a waste of resources, as did Goebbels, who banned reporting on the conference. Goebbels criticised the concept of a &quot;Europe of nations&quot; as contrary to goals of German supremacy. The Hitler Youth&#x27;s European activities were banned on 4 November 1942 by Hitler&#x27;s decree. Hitler wrote, &quot;party offices must never forget that the tenets and knowledge of National Socialist ideology correspond to the essence of German blood and hence cannot be transposed onto foreign peoples... Hence the NSDAP and its organisations do not have a European or worldwide mission to fulfil.&quot; In September 1942 Schirach was given the task of giving a speech to the youth, to counter one Franklin D. Roosevelt had made. Schirach&#x27;s response to Roosevelt was broadcast on the radio; Goebbels considered it &quot;an extraordinarily effective and well-founded reply&quot;.

Schirach also desired to expand Vienna&#x27;s economic influence, using the South-eastern European Company (&quot;Südosteuropa-Gesellschaft&quot;, SOEG) founded by Josef Bürckel, and the Vienna Autumn Trade Fair. However, the SOEG was dismissed as a &quot;Viennese breakfast and speeches club without economic impact&quot; by , director of the (MWT, &quot;Central European Economic Conference&quot;); the SOEG director thought the society was &quot;pie in the sky&quot;; Ulrich von Hassell thought SOEG was &quot;practically useless&quot;. Schirach tried but failed to merge the MWT into SOEG. From 1942 onwards, Schirach was no longer able to influence economic policy, due to Albert Speer&#x27;s Central Planning Board.

As Gauleiter, Schirach took a hard line against &quot;asocial&quot; behaviour, establishing an &quot;Asocials Committee&quot;, which committed people to psychiatric clinics for political reasons.

On 16 November 1942, the jurisdiction of the Reich Defense Commissioners was changed from the Wehrkreis to the Gau level, and Schirach retained control of civil defence measures over only Reichsgau Vienna.

Schirach contributed to literature journals, had &quot;remarkable&quot; views on art, and was an influential patron of the arts. He attended cultural events with his wife, and was president of the Bibliophile Society (&quot;Gesellschaft der Bibliophilen&quot;). Hitler wanted to deprive Vienna of its cultural pre-eminence, yet Schirach expanded Vienna&#x27;s cultural programmes, including an exhibition of rare European documents in the Austrian National Library, and displays of Impressionist and Modernist art. At first, Goebbels supported this as a way to keep up morale, and as a &quot;fig leaf&quot; for the German war of aggression. As such, Hitler and Goebbels substantially subsidised the Viennese cultural budget from 1941 to 1943.

Schirach saw the promotion of Viennese culture as a demonstration of his leadership role within the &quot;Reich&quot;. However, Hitler did not want Vienna to compete with Berlin for cultural status. Hitler wanted Vienna to be &quot;gradually neutralised&quot;, with Linz promoted as a cultural &quot;counterweight&quot;. Furthermore, Vienna&#x27;s cultural programmes did not follow official &quot;Reich&quot; policy. Schirach promoted &quot;Vienna&#x27;s European mission&quot;, but this was rejected by Hitler and Goebbels. As a result, Schirach fell into disfavour with Hitler. In 1942 had curated an art exhibition in Weimar, &quot;Young Art in the German Reich&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Schirach brought it to Vienna and had it expanded with works by artists from the &quot;Ostmark&quot;. The exhibition was denounced by Adolf Ziegler and Benno von Arent. In 1943 Hitler ordered its closure, and Schirach&#x27;s main cultural advisor [&quot;General-Kulturreferent&quot;] , who had previously been criticised by Goebbels, was dismissed. Thomas was to be sent to the Eastern front, but he was found medically unfit for service. Hitler summoned Schirach to the Berghof, saying &quot;It was my mistake to have sent you to Vienna. It was a mistake that I ever brought these Viennese into the Greater German Reich. I know these people. In my youth I lived among them. They are the enemies of Germany.&quot; Schirach offered his resignation, which Hitler rejected. In March 1943 Hitler considered ending Schirach&#x27;s control of Vienna&#x27;s cultural programmes, and in May 1943 considered sending him away as a diplomat.

Schirach&#x27;s conflict with Hitler was misperceived by many in Vienna as a form of resistance to Nazi Germany. It may later have helped the Viennese to suppress their sense of responsibility for the Holocaust. In reality, Schirach was a strong National Socialist who used culture to propagandise for war.

An incident at the Berghof on 24 June 1943 intensified Hitler&#x27;s distaste for Schirach. Schirach&#x27;s wife Henriette protested to Hitler about deportations of Jewish women she had witnessed in Amsterdam. Hitler was enraged, shouting &quot;You&#x27;re sentimental... what have the Jews in Holland got to do with you? It&#x27;s all sentimentality, humanity claptrap. You have to learn to hate...&quot; According to Henriette, the Schirachs were told to leave immediately. While it was not the last time Baldur von Schirach saw Hitler, the Schirachs were never again invited to the Berghof. Earlier in the day, Schirach had annoyed Hitler by saying the war had to be stopped. Hitler later said, &quot;He knows as well as I do that there is no way out. I might as well shoot myself in the head as think of negotiating peace.&quot; Hitler made it clear he no longer wanted anything to do with Schirach. Hitler also criticised Schirach&#x27;s attempt to prevent the movement of armament factories to Vienna. At the Nuremberg trials, Schirach said his conflict with Hitler grew over three days, beginning when Schirach had argued for an autonomous Ukraine within the &quot;Reich&quot;, rather than the oppressive policy of Erich Koch. Henriette&#x27;s protest was on the first or second evening. According to Baldur von Schirach, they had planned that she would broach the &quot;Jewish question&quot;, as he was unable to bring up the subject. On the third evening, Goebbels brought up the subject of Vienna, and Hitler spoke with hatred about the Viennese. Goebbels wrote, &quot;Frau von Schirach in particular behaves like a stupid turkey... The Führer doesn&#x27;t want to know Schirach anymore. Schirach is a weakling, a windbag and an idiot when it comes to deep political matters. He would rather dismiss him from Vienna sooner than later, if only he had a successor.&quot; Henriette von Schirach had asked Hitler to send Baldur to Munich as Gauleiter, swapping positions with Paul Giesler; Hitler refused. Hugo Jury later declined to succeed Schirach. Jury and defended Schirach, but Scharizer increasingly took over his work. While generally positive about Schirach, Scharizer wrote &quot;Schirach somehow lives in a different world, in a high tower, as it were, pursuing his hobbies. He thinks about foreign policy and wants to sort it out... Without noticing, Schirach lives a life that is not in keeping with the times. He cannot empathize with the life and way of living of the common people.&quot;

According to Frederic Spotts, Schirach &quot;was a man who thought of himself as a National Socialist poet laureate; he had great cultural pretensions but no political ambitions.&quot; He wrote &quot;flamboyant Nazi poetry&quot;; he was a &quot;prima donna&quot;, &quot;concerned with personal prestige and therefore artistic quality rather than with party doctrine.&quot; Contra Spotts, Oliver Rathkolb portrayed Schirach as an ideological anti-Semite, politically ambitious and relatively skilled at bureaucratic politics, for whom his appointment as Gauleiter of Vienna &quot;ultimately amounted to a political setback... a clear sign he had become less important politically.&quot;

On Whitsun 1943, two Austrian NKVD agents, Josef Angermann and his radio operator Georg Kennerknect, were parachute-dropped into Vienna, with a mission to assassinate Schirach. According to Johann Sanitzer, a Gestapo counter-intelligence agent, Schirach was number four on their death list, behind Hitler and Hermann Göring (Sanitzer did not remember who was number three). They were identified by the Gestapo, but Ernst Kaltenbrunner decided not to publicise their capture so as not to increase his rival Schirach&#x27;s popularity.

Schirach was notoriously anxious about Allied air raids, fleeing in public view to his Gaugefechtsstand Wien (&quot;&quot;Gau&quot; Command Center Vienna&quot;) whenever air raid sirens sounded. He had sent his children away to the Schloss Aspenstein, followed by Henriette in late autumn 1944 (their art collection was shipped separately). Schirach&#x27;s mother Emma had burned to death on 16 July 1944 when a plane crashed into her house in Wiesbaden and she attempted to rescue her dog. Schirach evacuated approximately one third of the children of Vienna, and in September 1944 organised the rescue of 2,000 children from Slovakia, which had become contested territory – an operation in which 15 men died. Hitler and Goebbels thought Schirach had not done enough to protect Vienna from air raids, but there was little he could do due to the centralised armaments policy. In 1941 Göring had ordered him to stop building air raid shelters. Flak towers were constructed from 1942. Schirach&#x27;s December 1943 proposal to evacuate 300,000 women and children from Vienna was rejected.

On 25 September 1944, Schirach became the commander of the Volkssturm units in his Gau.

On 24 February 1945, Hitler called a meeting of most of his &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in Berlin. Attendees included Schirach and Hugo Jury. Hitler ordered that Vienna was to be held at any price, as part of a policy of &quot;total warfare&quot;. Schirach ignored recommendations by Albrecht Schubert, Ludwig Merker, and Hanns Blaschke to declare Vienna a &quot;free city&quot;. However, Austrian soldiers ignored Schirach&#x27;s orders, and planned defence measures did not exist. Vienna came under attack by the Red Army on 2 April 1945. On 4 April 1945 he moved to the vaulted cellars of the Vienna Hofburg. Otto Skorzeny described the atmosphere: &quot;On the floor lay splendid rugs, on the walls hung paintings of battles and portraits of generals from the eighteenth century. In this antechamber, people ate, drank and were noisy.&quot; Skorzeny invited Schirach to undertake a reconnaissance trip to see the unmanned barricades, but Schirach refused. Another witness, Karl Zischka, described people consuming champagne and caviar: &quot;everyone believed in victory. Everyone believed in the miracle weapon that was yet to be deployed somehow.&quot;

By 9 April the Red Army were approaching the city centre. Schirach was aware that a military resistance group led by Major Carl Szokoll had made contact with them. Schirach broadcast a final call for citizens to fight &quot;to the last man&quot; and then departed his headquarters. He moved initially to Flandorf, north of Vienna, where he acted as a liaison officer between Sepp Dietrich of the 6th Panzer Army and Wilhelm Bittrich of the II SS Panzer Corps, with the rank of lieutenant. Dietrich concentrated on retreat. Schirach worked for Dietrich for three weeks. He stayed briefly in Altmelon, then the entire company moved west.

Schirach was determined to avoid being captured by the Red Army. He went to Gmunden on 1 May. After news came of Hitler&#x27;s suicide, he fled west with his adjutant and close colleague Fritz Wieshofer, and their chauffeur Franz Ram. At Schwaz their car broke down. On 2 May he discarded his uniform, grew a moustache and posed as a crime writer, &quot;Dr Richard Falk&quot;.

On 4 June 1945, he finally surrendered to the American town commandant and was arrested by the 103rd Counterintelligence Corps. He was interned in Rum prison camp outside Innsbruck, where he was treated well and allowed to see Henriette for a few hours in June. In August he was moved to a US interrogation camp at Oberursel, where he signed a declaration that he was responsible for building the Hitler Youth until 1940, and considered himself responsible for the organisation even up to the end of the war. On 10 September 1945 he was flown to Nuremberg to be put on trial, believing he would be sentenced to death.

===Deportation of the Jews===

Schirach was an anti-Semite, responsible for sending most of the Jews from Vienna to Nazi concentration camps. During his tenure, 65,000 Jews were deported. In a speech on 15 September 1942, he said that their deportation was a &quot;contribution to European culture&quot;. He attacked &quot;unscrupulous Jewish moneymaking&quot; and claimed that &quot;Jewry attempted with all available means to spoil the healthy youth... Ethos is alien to the Jew... every Jew at large in Europe is a danger to European culture. If one wished to confront me with the accusation that I have deported tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of Jews to the eastern ghetto from this city that was once the metropolis of Jewry, I must answer that I consider it an active contribution to European culture.&quot; 

In a speech on 6 June 1942, shortly after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by Czechslovak agents, Schirach declared,
Schirach later worried this speech would damage his reputation in artistic circles. Discussion of the &quot;Czech question&quot; in public was quickly forbidden by Hitler&#x27;s secretary Martin Bormann and Goebbels.

Schirach promoted the anti-Semitic writer Colin Ross.

On 12 May 1942 Schirach heard a private speech by Arthur Greiser, in which Greiser said that of 800,000 Jews interned in the Litzmannstadt ghetto, only 45,000 slaves remained alive. Greiser said, &quot;Now you will quite rightly ask why there so few Jews left today in the ghetto and outside it too, and here I say to you as a National Socialist: I cannot answer this question in such a circle in detail. I can only answer by saying that the Jews there are of course becoming fewer [in number], down to the 45,000 who actually work – and the Viennese Jews we have received in the meantime, they too have already been put to work... Some of them did not want to stay in the ghetto at all, because they didn&#x27;t like it there, and they wanted to be better situated and make their peace with their Jew god, and we gave them a hand with that and... [Great amusement and strong applause].&quot; Schirach had also heard a speech by Heinrich Himmler in Posen on 6 October 1943, in which Himmler had described his decision to &quot;exterminate&quot; women and children as well as men. Schirach later claimed that he instructed his colleague Hans Dellbrügge to reduce capacity for deportations, however there is no evidence for this claim. According to Wilhelm Bienenfeld, a Viennese Jew, Schirach must have known about the deportations because of the number of people who asked him to intervene. He refused to intervene on numerous occasions, including on behalf of five retired members of the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra, of which he was patron, or on behalf of family friend Josef Krips.

The only case in which Schirach made a great effort on behalf of a Jew was the case of Alice Strauss, the Jewish daughter-in-law of composer Richard Strauss. The Strausses had moved to Vienna so they could be afforded the protection of Schirach. However, 25 of her relatives were murdered in Nazi concentration camps.
In January 1944, Alice and Franz Strauss were abducted by the Viennese Gestapo and imprisoned for two nights. Strauss&#x27;s personal appeal to Schirach saved them, allowing him to take them back to his estate at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where they remained under house arrest until the end of the war. Later during the war, Schirach pleaded for a moderate treatment of the eastern European peoples and criticised the conditions in which Jews were being deported.

Martin Bormann told Schirach to use deportation of Jews as a means to alleviate housing shortages, rather than diverting resources from the war effort to the building of new apartments.

On 16 August 1943, Schirach visited Mauthausen concentration camp. He was not shown the gas facility, but saw the camp crematorium being used to burn only &quot;bodies that had died normal deaths&quot;. He saw a performance by the camp symphony orchestra. He asked commandant Franz Ziereis if prisoners ever left the camp, and was told that they did.

==Trial and conviction==

Schirach was one of the major Nazis put on trial at Nuremberg by the International Military Tribunal. He was indicted for crimes against humanity for his role in the deportation of the Viennese Jews to certain death in German concentration camps located in German-occupied Poland. He was also indicted for crimes against peace for his role in building up the Hitler Youth.

At the trial, Schirach was one of only a few defendants (along with Albert Speer and Hans Frank) to denounce Hitler. Schirach&#x27;s strategy was very different from other defendants such as Göring, who didn&#x27;t want any of the defendants to say anything against Hitler. Like Speer, Schirach rejected legal responsibility for the Holocaust. Schirach admitted to being a former anti-Semite, but attributed these views to his reading of the American Henry Ford&#x27;s &quot;The International Jew&quot;: &quot;I read it and became anti-Semitic.&quot; He was also influenced by Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Adolf Bartels, who was Schirach&#x27;s private tutor. Nonetheless, according to Oliver Rathkolb, anti-Semitism was deeply rooted in German elites from before 1914, and was especially part of Schirach&#x27;s Weimar environment.

Schirach repudiated his anti-Semitism, and denounced Hitler and the Holocaust:

It is the greatest, the most devilish mass murder known to history... The murder was ordered by Adolf Hitler, as is obvious from his last will and testament... He and Himmler jointly committed that crime which, for all time, will be a stain in the annals of our history. It is a crime which fills every German with shame. He had prepared this statement carefully.

Schirach called his former adjutants Gustav Höpken and Fritz Wieshofer as witnesses, as well as Hartmann Lauterbacher. Höpken denied that Schirach had seen Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s reports about German war crimes, and portrayed him as a supporter of the Christian churches. Weishofer claimed that Schirach&#x27;s office had made interventions on behalf of individual Jews. Lauterbacher claimed that Schirach had forbidden the Hitler Youth to take part in pogroms and looting in November 1938, although this was after the pogroms had taken place. Schirach played up his 1943 break with Hitler, and his American ancestry. His lawyer was Dr Fritz Sauter, a well-known defence lawyer from Munich who had been a member of the Nazi Party. Sauter also defended Walther Funk and others at Nuremberg. Sauter argued that Schirach had confessed to his mistakes and was determined to rectify them: &quot;Such a defendant must be given consideration for trying to repair as far as he can the damage which he caused in good faith.&quot;

Schirach claimed he had not known about the extermination camps; however, the trial detailed his involvement in deportations of Jews and his speeches defending his actions. During Schirach&#x27;s cross-examination, Thomas J. Dodd presented documents which had passed through Schirach&#x27;s office, which showed that tens of thousands of Jews had been sent from Vienna to Riga, and tens of thousands of Jews in Riga had been shot. Schirach denied having seen the documents. Schirach claimed to have first heard of the exterminations through Colin Ross, in 1944.

Regarding the accusation of crimes against peace for his leadership of the Hitler Youth, he presented the Hitler Youth as a youth organisation like the Boy Scouts, rather than a paramilitary organisation responsible for war crimes:

I have educated this generation in faith and loyalty to Hitler. The Youth Organization which I built up bore his name. I believed that I was serving a leader who would make our people and the youth of our country great and happy and free. Millions of young people believed this, together with me, and saw their ultimate ideal in National Socialism. Many died for it. Before God, before the German nation, and before my German people I alone bear the guilt of having trained our young people for a man whom I for many long years had considered unimpeachable, both as a leader and as the head of the State, of creating for him a generation who saw him as I did. The guilt is mine in that I educated the youth of Germany for a man who murdered by the millions. I believed in this man, that is all I can say for my excuse and for the characterization of my attitude. This is my own—my own personal guilt. I was responsible for the youth of the country. I was placed in authority over the young people, and the guilt is mine alone. The younger generation is guiltless. It grew up in an anti-Semitic state, ruled by anti-Semitic laws. Our youth was bound by these laws and saw nothing criminal in racial politics. But if anti-Semitism and racial laws could lead to an Auschwitz, then Auschwitz must mark the end of racial politics and the death of anti-Semitism. Hitler is dead. I never betrayed him; I never tried to overthrow him; I remained true to my oath as an officer, a youth leader, and an official. I was no blind collaborator of his; neither was I an opportunist. I was a convinced National Socialist from my earliest days—as such, I was also an anti-Semite. Hitler&#x27;s racial policy was a crime which led to disaster for 5,000,000 Jews and for all the Germans. The younger generation bears no guilt. But he who, after Auschwitz, still clings to racial politics has rendered himself guilty.He claimed that members of the Hitler Youth were innocent of any of the German war crimes:

Dodd also presented a telegram from Schirach arguing for a violent air attack on a British cultural town in response to the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich.

One of the biggest problems for the prosecution was lack of evidence. The trial was taking place so soon after the war that comprehensive evidence had not yet been assembled. The inexperienced prosecutor Dodd was not able to penetrate Schirach&#x27;s defence strategy. The Soviet prosecution also had problems with translation, and a witness statement of a massacre by the Hitler Youth in Lviv in 1941 that was submitted too late.

According to Gustave Gilbert, an American psychologist who observed Schirach over the course of the trial, Göring attempted to &quot;turn&quot; Schirach. A separate dining area was established for Schirach, Speer, Hans Fritzsche and Walther Funk to remove Schirach and Funk from Göring&#x27;s influence. Gilbert administered the Wechsler–Bellevue intelligence test to the defendants; Schirach displayed an IQ of 130. Over the course of the trial, Schirach was interviewed daily by psychiatrist Douglas Kelley.

While on trial and expecting to be hanged, Schirach along with Speer and Fritzsche received the Eucharist from Lutheran Pastor Henry F. Gerecke.

Schirach was acquitted of crimes against peace, but he was found guilty on 1 October 1946 of crimes against humanity. The court concluded that despite the warlike nature of the Hitler Youth, Schirach was not involved in Hitler&#x27;s plans for aggressive war. However, regarding his deportation of Vienna&#x27;s Jews, the court found that Schirach knew they would face a miserable life at best, and that bulletins describing their extermination were in his office. He was sentenced to 20 years in Spandau Prison, Berlin.

==Later life==

On 20 July 1949, his wife Henriette von Schirach (1913–1992) divorced him while he was in prison. However, she travelled to London in 1958, with financial support from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, to lobby British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd for a reduction of his prison sentence. She was unsuccessful. She described her husband as &quot;in no way a criminal, but an idealist, and much too good for politics.&quot; Unlike other prisoners, he had no one else to lobby for his release.

In December 1963, he was sent for two weeks to the British Military Hospital to treat a blood clot in his femoral artery. In February 1965 he was again taken to military hospital for an operation on the retina of his right eye, which was unsuccessful. After the operation, he suffered a thrombosis.

Schirach was released from prison on 1 October 1966, after serving his full sentence. He agreed to a series of interviews with &quot;Stern&quot; magazine. Schirach described his trial as a &quot;show trial&quot;. The 1,500 pages of transcripts were compiled into his memoirs, &quot;I believed in Hitler&quot; (&quot;Ich glaubte an Hitler&quot;, 1967), and were the basis of a biography by . His memoirs were much less successful than his wife Henriette&#x27;s fantastical memoir &quot;The Price of Glory&quot;, although he received generous fees from &quot;Stern&quot;.

In an interview with NBC shortly after his release, he expressed regret over having not done enough to prevent atrocities from being committed.

Schirach was interviewed in English by British journalist David Frost. In the interview, he reflects on his imprisonment, meeting with Hitler, and the deportation of the Jews. Contrary to his testimony at Nuremberg, he denied his anti-Semitism. He again claimed to have no knowledge of the extermination, and deflected guilt in regard to discriminatory education laws: &quot;the whole generation was wrong&quot;. He described Hitler as &quot;a man without measure [i.e. without any sense of measure], a man with great gifts, a man who in some ways could be considered a genius&quot;.

After his release from prison, Schirach moved first to the Stubenrauch villa in Munich, which his son Robert rented for him. In 1968 he moved to an estate in Deibhalde, Trossingen, owned by Fritz Kiehn (1885–1980), a businessman who had been a Nazi member of the Reichstag and an &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; on Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal staff. His son Robert married Kiehn&#x27;s granddaughter Elke, and Robert became managing director of one of Kiehn&#x27;s companies. Baldur was looked after by Kiehn&#x27;s daughter Gretl, ex-wife of Fritz Wieshofer and mother of Elke from her first marriage, and they holidayed together.

Around 1966, , lead trumpeter and then managing director of the Vienna Philharmonic, who had been a member of the &quot;SS&quot; and an informant of the SD, travelled to Schirach to give him the Philharmonic&#x27;s &quot;ring of honour&quot;, to replace one Schirach had been given on 27 March 1942. After the war, the Philharmonic&#x27;s board was full of SS men.

Schirach later turned down further interviews, saying he ought not to comment on public matters due to his role under Hitler.

In 1971, with his eyesight failing, Schirach moved to the Pension Müllen, the former Montroyal hotel in Kröv an der Mosel, which was run by two former BDM leaders Ida and Käthe Müllen. He consumed alcohol to excess. He died there on 8 August 1974, aged 67, of coronary thrombosis, and was buried in Kröv. Käthe Müllen chose his epitaph, &quot;I was one of you&quot; (&quot;Ich war einer von Euch&quot;).

Schirach did not leave a large fortune: his mother&#x27;s American property had been seized in 1944 and his father&#x27;s American assets were confiscated in 1947. After Carl&#x27;s death in 1948, Baldur and Rosalind inherited the fortune, but it continued to be managed by the Office of Alien Property Custodian.

The right to use his grave site was repeatedly extended, until it was finally removed in Spring 2015.

<text>Pale ale is a golden to amber coloured beer style brewed with pale malt. The term first appeared in England around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with high-carbon coke, which resulted in a lighter colour than other beers popular at that time. Different brewing practices and hop quantities have resulted in a range of tastes and strengths within the pale ale family. Pale ale is a kind of ale.

==History==
Coke had been first used for dry roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term &quot;pale ale&quot; was first applied to beers made from such malt. By 1784, advertisements appeared in the &quot;Calcutta Gazette&quot; for &quot;light and excellent&quot; pale ale.

By 1830, the expressions &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;pale ale&quot; were synonymous. Breweries tended to designate beers as &quot;pale ales&quot;, though customers would commonly refer to the same beers as &quot;bitters&quot;. It is thought that customers used the term &quot;bitter&quot; to differentiate these pale ales from other less noticeably hopped beers such as porters and milds.

By the mid to late 20th century, while brewers were still labelling bottled beers as pale ales, they had begun identifying cask beers as &quot;bitters&quot;, except those from Burton on Trent, which tend to be referred to as &quot;pale ales&quot;.

==Types==
Different brewing practices and hop levels have resulted in a range of taste and strength within the pale ale family.

===Amber ale===
Collier Brothers of London applied for the UK trademark of &quot;The Amber Ale&quot; in 1876 and the trademark was maintained through changes in ownership until it expired as UK00000009744 in 2002. It was a &quot;pure delicately hopped Pale Ale&quot; positioned between their light bitter and IPA. Since the expiry of the trademark some traditional British bitters have been rebranded as amber ales, in some cases to distinguish them from golden ales sold under the same brand eg Shepherd Neame Spitfire.

&quot;Amber ale&quot; is an emerging term used in Australia, France (as &quot;ambrée&quot;), Belgium and the Netherlands and North America for pale ales brewed with a proportion of amber malt and sometimes crystal malt to produce an amber colour generally ranging from light copper to light brown. A small amount of crystal or other coloured malt is added to the basic pale ale base to produce a slightly darker colour, as in some Irish and British pale ales. In France the term &quot;ambrée&quot; is used to signify a beer, either cold or warm fermented, which is amber in colour; the beer, as in Pelforth &quot;ambrée&quot; and Fischer amber, may be a Vienna lager, or it may be a &quot;bière de garde&quot; as in Jenlain &quot;ambrée&quot;. In North America, American-variety hops are used in amber ales with varying degrees of bitterness, although very few examples are particularly hoppy. Diacetyl is barely perceived or is absent in an amber ale.

===American pale ale===

Anchor Liberty Ale, a 6% abv ale originally brewed by the Anchor Brewing Company as a special in 1975 to commemorate Paul Revere&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; in 1775, was seen by Michael Jackson, a writer on beverages, as the first modern American ale. Fritz Maytag, the owner of Anchor, visited British breweries in London, Yorkshire and Burton upon Trent, picking up information about robust pale ales, which he applied when he made his American version, using just malt rather than the malt and sugar combination common in brewing at that time, and making prominent use of the American hop, Cascade. By 1983, it was commonly found.

The brewery thought to be the first to successfully use significant quantities of American hops in the notably hoppy style of an APA and use the specific name &quot;pale ale&quot; was the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company. It brewed the first experimental batch of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in November 1980, distributing the finished version in March 1981. Other pioneers of a hoppy American pale ale are Jack McAuliffe of the New Albion Brewing Company and Bert Grant of Yakima Brewing.

American pale ales are generally around 5% abv, with significant quantities of American hops, typically Cascade. Although American-brewed beers tend to use a cleaner yeast, and American two row malt, it the use of strong American hops in particular that distinguish an APA from a British or European pale ale. The style is close to the American India pale ale (IPA), and boundaries blur, though IPAs are stronger and more assertively hopped. The style is also close to amber ale, though these are darker and maltier due to the use of crystal malts.

===Australian pale ale===
Australian pale ale is pale ale that is produced in Australia and developed in Australia around 1990s. Australian pale ales are generally around 6% abv with significant quantities of Australian hops, typically Galaxy.

===&quot;Bière de garde&quot;===
&quot;Bière de garde&quot;, or &quot;keeping beer&quot;, is a pale ale traditionally brewed in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. These beers were usually brewed by farmhouses in the winter and spring, to avoid unpredictable problems with the yeast during the summertime.

The origin of the name lies in the tradition that it was matured or cellared for a period of time once bottled (most were sealed with a cork), to be consumed later in the year, akin to a saison.

Among the better French known &quot;bières de garde&quot; are Brasserie de Saint-Sylvestre, Trois Monts, Brasseurs Duyck, Jenlain and Brasserie La Choulette, &quot;ambrée.

===Blonde===
Blonde ales are very pale in colour. The term &quot;blonde&quot; for pale beers is common in Europe and South America – particularly in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, and Brazil – though the beers may not have much in common, other than colour. Blondes tend to be clear, crisp, and dry, with low-to-medium bitterness and aroma from hops, and some sweetness from malt. Fruitiness from esters may be perceived. A lighter body from higher carbonation may be noticed.

In the United Kingdom, golden or summer ales were developed in the late 20th century by breweries to compete with the pale lager market. A typical golden ale has an appearance and profile similar to that of a pale lager. Malt character is subdued and the hop profile ranges from spicy to citrus; common hops include Styrian Golding and Cascade. Alcohol is in the 4% to 5% abv range. The UK style is attributed to John Gilbert, owner of Hop Back Brewery, who developed &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; in 1989, which won several awards and inspired numerous imitators.

Belgian blondes are often made with pilsner malt. Some beer writers regard blonde and golden ales as distinct styles, while others do not. Duvel is a typical Belgian blonde ale, and one of the most popular bottled beers in the country as well as being well known internationally.

===Burton pale ale===
Late in the second half of the nineteenth century, the recipe for pale ale was put into use by the Burton upon Trent brewers, notably Bass; ales from Burton were considered of a particularly high quality due to synergy between the malt and hops in use and local water chemistry, especially the presence of gypsum. Burton retained absolute dominance in pale ale brewing until a chemist, C. W. Vincent, discovered the process of Burtonization to reproduce the chemical composition of the water from Burton-upon-Trent, thus giving any brewery the capability to brew pale ale.

===English bitter===

The expression &quot;English bitter&quot; first appeared in the early 19th century as part of the development and spread of pale ale. Breweries tended to designate beers as &quot;pale ales&quot;, though customers would commonly refer to the same beers as &quot;bitters&quot;. It is thought that customers used the term &quot;bitter&quot; to differentiate these pale ales from other less noticeably hopped beers. Drinkers tend to loosely group modern bitters into &quot;session&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; bitters (up to 4.1% abv), &quot;best&quot; or &quot;special&quot; bitters (between 4.2% and 4.7% abv) and &quot;strong&quot; bitters (4.8% abv and over).

===India pale ale (IPA)===

India pale ale (IPA) is a style of pale ale developed in England for export to India. The first known use of the expression &quot;India pale ale&quot; is in an advertisement in the &quot;Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser&quot; on 27 August 1829.
Worthington White Shield, originating in Burton-upon-Trent, is a beer considered to be part of the development of India pale ale.

The colour of an IPA can vary from a light gold to a reddish amber.

===Irish red ale===
The term &quot;Irish red ale&quot; was popularised in the United States and subsequently exported worldwide. The additional variants &quot;red ale&quot;, &quot;Irish ale&quot; (,) and &quot;Irish red&quot;, have come to be used by brewers mainly in Ireland and the United States, less so elsewhere. Smithwick&#x27;s and Kilkenny are typical examples of macro-brewed commercial Irish red ale. There are many other smaller and craft examples, such as O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s, Sullivan&#x27;s, Murphy&#x27;s, Porterhouse and Franciscan Well.

Irish red ales are characterised by their malt profile and typically have a sweet, caramel or toffee-like taste, low bitterness and amber to red colour - hence the name.

Irish brewers have increasingly adopted the term Irish Red Ale to distinguish their beers in both the domestic and international markets. In the US, the name can also be used simply to describe a darker amber ale, or the abbreviated term &quot;Irish Red&quot; applied to a &quot;reddish&quot; beer brewed as a lager and ambered with caramel colouring - for example Killian&#x27;s Irish Red.

===Strong pale ale===
Strong pale ales are ales made predominantly with pale malts and have an alcohol strength that may start around 5%, though typically at 7 or 8% by volume, and may go up to 12%, though some brewers have been pushing the alcohol strength higher to produce novelty beers. In 1994, the Hair of the Dog Brewing Company produced a strong pale ale with an alcohol by volume of 29%. In 2010, Brewdog released &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot;, a 41% abv pale ale, which is stronger than typical U.S. distilled spirits (40% abv).

<text>Adelsö is an island in the middle of Lake Mälaren in Sweden, near Björkfjärden. The island is part of Ekerö Municipality and Stockholm County. It is about by ferry and road west of downtown Stockholm. The administrative center of the important Viking settlement Birka (on the neighbouring island Björkö) was situated at Hovgården on Adelsö. The road network is connected via a ferry link across a narrow strait to the main island of Ekerö.

==Geography==
The Adelsö landscape consists of pine-clad rocky hills and moraine ridges dotted with fields and deciduous trees, mainly oak. The highest spot on Adelsö is Kunsta Mountain, which is 53.2 m above sea level. The top of Kunsta has an outlook tower offering a great view of the middle of Lake Mälaren.

There are many edible mushrooms and fruit that can be found on Adelsö including chanterelles, black trumpet, blue berries, lingonberries, juniper berries, cherries, apples, and pears.

==Climate==
Adelsö has a mixture between a maritime and continental climate. Influenced by its position in the middle of Mälaren, there is seasonal lag in late winter as the water easily freeze to lake ice. In summer, Adelsö is just as warm as inland areas during the day and as a result the island has some of the warmest summers in Northern Europe. This is since Mälaren is shallow and surrounded by a lot of land, which in turn raises lake surface temperatures. Nights are cooler than Stockholm year round. The island is dry by Swedish and European standards, with most precipitation arriving being light besides convection in summer.

==Demographics==
Adelsö has about 700 permanent residents, a number that has been quite stable throughout the centuries. Many residents commute to jobs in Stockholm, but there are also farmers and fishermen. During the summer months, the island is popular with tourists.

==Transportation==
Buses (lines 311 and 312) run from the bus terminal at Brommaplan in the middle of Bromma, to Sjöängen on Munsö. From here, the , a vehicular cable ferry crosses to Adelsö. Bus 312 travels on the ferry and traverses the whole island. The ferry runs every half hour during the day and hourly during evenings and nights. The night ferry runs less frequently during the summer months

==History==

The history of Adelsö began with the Stone Age. Adelsö at that time consisted of small islands which emerged from the sea at the end of the Ice Age. Mälaren, a freshwater lake, did not yet exist, so the skerries that were to become Adelsö lay beneath the Baltic Sea.

Fishing, bird- and seal-hunting created the foundation for the life of the people living there. Graves from the early and late Stone Age exist, but most of the gravesites date from the Iron Age, mostly the Viking Age. There are also two ancient hillforts (&quot;fornborgar&quot;) on Adelsö; one of them, situated on Skansberget near Stenby, is unusually well-preserved.
Adelsö, earlier called &quot;Alsnö&quot; or &quot;Alsnu&quot; reflects the importance of the area during the Viking Age. The King&#x27;s House (&quot;Kungsgården&quot;) was next to Hovgården and the monarch ruled over the nearby city of Birka. This is also the site of &quot;Kungshögarna&quot; at Hovgården. &quot;Kungs&quot; means king or royal and &quot;högarna&quot;, from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot;, means mound or barrow.

During the latter part of the 12th century, a Christian church was built next to Hovgården. Birger Jarl&#x27;s sons built Alsnö hus, a splendid castle where King Magnus Ladulås in 1279 assembled the &quot;Meeting of Alsnö&quot;. At that meeting, the &quot;Ordinance of Alsnö&quot; was established, introducing the privileges of the Swedish nobility.

During the Middle Ages, Alsnö hus was used as a summer palace for kings and governors but later fell into ruin. What remains of the castle and several graves near Hovgården was excavated during archeological digs conducted between 1916 and 1926.

<text>Ysbrechtum () is a village 1 km from the city of Sneek in Friesland, Netherlands. It had a population of around 690 in January 2017.

Ysbrechtum contains the , an old estate.

==History==
The village was first mentioned in the 13th century as &quot;Jsbrectum,&quot; and means &quot;the settlement of IJsbrecht.&quot; Ysbrechtum is a &quot;terp&quot; (artificial living hill) village which developed in the early middle ages.

The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1694 as a replacement for its 11th or 12th century predecessor. In 1865, the church was modified and the tower was rebuilt.

Epema State is a &quot;stins&quot; which dated from before 1449. In 1651, it was bought by Doeke Martena van Burmania, the &quot;grietman&quot; (predecessor of mayor/judge) of Wymbritseradeel who extensively modified the estate in 1652 and constructed a gate house. In 1825, the estate was extensively modified and rebuilt in Second Empire style. In 1880, a dome was placed on the roof, but was removed soon after, because it was too heavy. In 1894, the estate was modified in Renaissance Revival style. The building is privately owned and serves as a residential home. The estate is surrounded by a large park.

Ysbrechtum was home to 198 people in 1840. In 1844, the road from Sneek to Bolsward was built, and Ysbrechtum extended towards to road. After World War II, Ysbrechtum became a commuters village of Sneek. 

Until 2011 it belonged to Sneek municipality and before 1984, the village was part of the Wymbritseradiel municipality. In 2015, Sneek announced plans to extend its industrial zone up to Ysbrechtum. The decision triggered protests from the village, and the plans have been altered in 2017.

<doc id="154074" wikidata="Q1673271" url="?curid=154074" title="Regime change">
<text>Regime change is the partly forcible or coercive replacement of one government regime with another. Regime change may replace all or part of the state&#x27;s most critical leadership system, administrative apparatus, or bureaucracy. Regime change may occur through domestic processes, such as revolution, coup, or reconstruction of government following state failure or civil war. It can also be imposed on a country by foreign actors through invasion, overt or covert interventions, or coercive diplomacy. Regime change may entail the construction of new institutions, the restoration of old institutions, and the promotion of new ideologies.

According to a dataset by Alexander Downes, 120 leaders were removed through foreign-imposed regime change between 1816 and 2011.

== Types ==
===Internal regime change===
Regime change can be precipitated by revolution or a coup d&#x27;état. For example, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the Iranian Revolution.

===Foreign-imposed regime change===
Foreign-imposed regime change is the deposing of a regime by a foreign state, which can be achieved through covert means or by direct military action. Interstate war can also culminate into a foreign-imposed regime change for the losers, as occurred for the Axis Powers in 1945. Foreign-imposed regime change is sometimes used by states as a foreign policy tool. According to a dataset by Alexander Downes, 120 leaders have been successfully removed through foreign-imposed regime change between 1816 and 2011.

During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union frequently intervened in elections and engaged in attempts at regime change, both covertly and overtly. According to Michael Poznansky, covert regime change became more common when non-intervention was codified into international law, leading states that wanted to engage in regime change to do so covertly and conceal their violations of international law.

Modern examples of regime-change include the 2001 Invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

=== Regime promotion ===
According to John Owen IV, there are four historical waves of forcible regime promotion:

# Catholicism vs Protestantism: From the 1520s to the early 18th century
# Republicanism vs Constitutional monarchy vs Absolute monarchy: From the 1770s to the late 19th century
# Communism vs Liberalism vs Fascism: From the late 1910s to the 1980s
# Secular government vs Islamism: post-1990

== Impact ==
Studies by Alexander Downes, Lindsey O&#x27;Rourke and Jonathan Monten indicate that foreign-imposed regime change seldom reduces the likelihood of civil war, violent removal of the newly imposed leader, and the probability of conflict between the intervening state and its adversaries, as well as does not increase the likelihood of democratization (unless regime change comes with pro-democratic institutional changes in countries with favorable conditions for democracy). Downes argues,The strategic impulse to forcibly oust antagonistic or non-compliant regimes overlooks two key facts. First, the act of overthrowing a foreign government sometimes causes its military to disintegrate, sending thousands of armed men into the countryside where they often wage an insurgency against the intervener. Second, externally-imposed leaders face a domestic audience in addition to an external one, and the two typically want different things. These divergent preferences place imposed leaders in a quandary: taking actions that please one invariably alienates the other. Regime change thus drives a wedge between external patrons and their domestic protégés or between protégés and their people. Research by Nigel Lo, Barry Hashimoto, and Dan Reiter has contrasting findings, as they find that interstate &quot;peace following wars last longer when the war ends in foreign-imposed regime change.&quot; However, research by Reiter and Goran Peic finds that foreign-imposed regime change can raise the probability of civil war.

<text>Frank J. Gaffney Jr. (born April 5, 1953) is an American defense policy analyst and founder of the Center for Security Policy (CSP). He founded the CSP in 1988, serving as its president until 2023, and thereafter as executive chairman. In the 1970s and 1980s, he worked for the federal government in multiple posts, including as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Forces and Arms Control Policy from 1983 to 1987, and seven months as Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs during the Reagan administration. He was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1987. In later years, he has been described as an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist.

==Early life and education==
Gaffney was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1953 to Virginia Gaffney (&quot;née&quot; Reed) and Frank J. Gaffney. His father was a classical music aficionado and long-time partner at the law firm of Thorp, Reed &amp; Armstrong, which was founded by his wife&#x27;s father, Earl Reed; in 2013, it merged with Clark Hill PLC. Gaffney&#x27;s grandfather, Joseph Gaffney, was a city solicitor in Philadelphia. In the early 20th century, as a known Catholic in Philadelphia, he faced opposition from nativist Protestant groups who alleged that Catholics were &quot;gaining control of American institutions while rewriting the nation&#x27;s history&quot;.

Gaffney attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service in 1975. In 1978, he received an MA in International Studies from Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.

==Career==
Gaffney began his government career in the 1970s, working as an aide in the office of Democratic Senator Henry M. Jackson, under Richard Perle. From August 1983 until November 1987, Gaffney held the position of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Forces and Arms Control Policy in the Reagan administration, again serving under Perle.

In April 1987, Gaffney was nominated to the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. He served as the acting Assistant Secretary for seven months. During this time, despite his official post, he was excluded by senior Reagan administration officials from the then-ongoing arms control talks with the Soviet Union. Gaffney was ultimately forced out of the Pentagon; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in November 1987 that, within four days of Frank Carlucci&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of Defense, &quot;Gaffney&#x27;s belongings were boxed and he was gone&quot;. Following his departure from government, he immediately set about criticizing Ronald Reagan&#x27;s pursuit of an arms control agreement with the USSR.

===Center for Security Policy===

In 1988, Gaffney established the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a Washington, D.C.-based national security think tank that has been widely described as engaging in conspiracy theorizing by a range of individuals, media outlets and organizations. Its activities are focused on exposing and researching perceived jihadist threats to the United States. The Center has been described as &quot;not very highly respected&quot; by BBC News and &quot;disreputable&quot; by &quot;Salon&quot;. It has faced strong criticism from people across the political spectrum, but has also had its reports cited by political figures such as US President Donald Trump and former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann. In 2010 Gaffney became a trustee of the Center for Security Policy. CSP has been described as an &quot;extremist think tank&quot; by the Center for New Community. In 2016, the CSP was classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as a &quot;hate group&quot;. The SPLC describes Gaffney as &quot;one of America’s most notorious Islamophobes&quot;. Gaffney and the CSP have also been described as influential parts of the counter-jihad movement.

On March 16, 2016, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced he would name Frank Gaffney to be one of his National Security Advisors. Cruz said that Gaffney &quot;is a serious thinker who has been focused on fighting jidahists [sic], fighting jihadism across the globe&quot;. In December 2015, Nation Institute Fellow Eli Clifton characterized as unscientific a CSP-funded poll that Donald Trump had been citing, which purportedly showed widespread support for Sharia law among U.S. Muslims and a need for intervention in that community. It added that, &quot;Between Trump’s calls for a national registry of Muslims and a ban on Muslim immigration, it appears that through coincidence or outright collaboration, Trump is building an immigration and anti-Muslim policy framework that closely mirrors the statements and proposals advocated by&quot; Gaffney and the CSP.

Discussing what he calls prominent professional participants in Islamophobia, Professor Todd Green wrote mentioned &quot;Frank Gaffney and David Yerushalmi, both of whom head organizations that are responsible for spreading misinformation about Islam and that seek to enact anti-Muslim laws, including the infamous anti-Sharia&quot;. David Yerushalmi served as legal counsel for the CSP and has been accused of spreading misinformation about Islam and encouraging the enactment of anti-Muslim laws, including anti-Sharia legislation in the United States.

Gaffney and the CSP have been noted to have wielded influence on several prominent individuals of the Trump administration. Gaffney was himself hosted on Steve Bannon&#x27;s radio show at least thirty-four times during Bannon&#x27;s time in &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, and Michael Flynn, Mike Pompeo and Jeff Sessions have all been described as &quot;devotees&quot; of Gaffney&#x27;s ideas. Following John Bolton&#x27;s appointment as National Security Advisor, Gaffney was criticised as the source of where Bolton&#x27;s beliefs originated on a number of subjects. This included the Iran nuclear deal and many anti-Islamic beliefs.

He stepped down as president of the CSP in January 2023 in favor of Tommy Waller, but remains its executive chairman.

====Fax wars====
In the 1990s, Gaffney became known in Washington, D.C., for &quot;fax wars&quot; he waged, whereby his &quot;small but loyal following&quot; would be encouraged to inundate the offices of members of Congress with faxes.

In 1995, Gaffney charged that US Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O&#x27;Leary was intentionally undermining US nuclear readiness; an analysis of Gaffney&#x27;s charges against O&#x27;Leary published by William Arkin observed that Gaffney &quot;specializes in intensely personal attacks&quot; and his Center for Security Policy&#x27;s liberal use of faxes to attack its opponents had made it the &quot;Domino&#x27;s Pizza of the policy business&quot;.

Later, in a 1997 column for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Gaffney alleged a seismic incident in Russia was a nuclear detonation at that nation&#x27;s Novaya Zemlya test site, indicating Russia was violating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTB). Subsequent scientific analysis of Novaya Zemlya confirmed the event was a routine earthquake. Reporting on the allegation, the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; observed that, following its publication, &quot;fax machines around Washington, D.C., and across the country poured out pages detailing Russian duplicity. They came from Frank Gaffney&quot;, going on to note that during the first four months of 1997, Gaffney had &quot;issued more than 25 screeds&quot; against the CTB.

===Other activities===
Gaffney also contributes to the conservative media site &quot;Newsmax&quot;. Gaffney wrote a column for &quot;The Washington Times&quot; from 2012 to 2016, and for &quot;Jewish World Review&quot; from 2000 to 2013. He was also the host of &quot;Secure Freedom Radio&quot;, a nationally-syndicated radio program and podcast which has featured guests such as Newt Gingrich, John R. Bolton, and white nationalist Jared Taylor. The radio program was turned into a television show titled &quot;Securing America TV&quot; on Real America&#x27;s Voice in 2020. Gaffney is the vice-chair of the Committee on the Present Danger and has been described as part of a &quot;new red scare&quot; of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States.

==Conspiracy theories==
The Anti-Defamation League has said that Gaffney &quot;has promulgated a number of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories over the years&quot; and that he has &quot;undue influence&quot; relative to other like-minded figures. Other commentators have suggested that Gaffney&#x27;s propensity for conspiracy theories began earlier during his career in the Reagan administration, where after being denied a higher position, was convinced that Soviet agents within the United States government were blocking him.

===Civilization Jihad===
One of Gaffney&#x27;s main conspiracy theories is the so-called &quot;Civilization Jihad&quot;, a supposed secret Muslim plan to take over America, which came to national prominence by being cited in a debate by 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson. According to the SPLC, Gaffney&#x27;s beliefs stem &quot;from a single discredited source – a 1991 fantasy written by a lone Muslim Brotherhood member that was introduced into evidence during the 2008 Holy Land Foundation trial in Dallas federal court. The FBI found the note to be incongruous with documents taken from Muslim Brotherhood, nor was it found to have been discussed during the 1991 conference of the Muslim Brotherhood.

But to Gaffney, this document was &quot;a smoking gun, a mission statement pointing to a massive Islamist conspiracy under our noses&quot;. The ADL quotes Gaffney as &quot;mentioning that in 1991, a Muslim Brotherhood operative produced the &quot;explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal of the group in North America.&quot; According to Gaffney, the memo explicitly addresses the progress the Muslim Brotherhood has made in building an infrastructure in the United States with the goal of destroying Western civilization from within so that Islam is victorious over other religions&quot;.

The BRIDGE Initiative at Georgetown found that the memo failed to gain traction in the Arab world, as none of the sensationalist phrasings ever became commonplace in subsequent Arab literature and media. In contrast, some politicians and Islamaphobic commentators have used the phrase repeatedly to demonize Muslims.

===ACU dispute===
In 2011, Gaffney was banned by the American Conservative Union from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). ACU chairman David Keene released a statement contending that Gaffney &quot;has become personally and tiresomely obsessed with his weird belief that anyone who doesn&#x27;t agree with him on everything all the time or treat him with the respect and deference he believes is his due, must be either ignorant of the dangers we face or, in extreme case, dupes of the nation&#x27;s enemies&quot;. Gaffney has since returned to CPAC to host panels at the conference in 2015 and 2016.

In an April 2016 column in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; titled, &quot;When conspiracy nuts do real damage&quot;, Keene again slammed Gaffney, writing, &quot;One hopes that is what they will do and that Mr. Gaffney will, like the folks at Group Research, Mr. Hoover&#x27;s aides and most conspiracy nuts of yore will vanish into the fever swamps from which he came&quot;. The column came two months after Gaffney unexpectedly left &quot;The Washington Times&quot; for &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, where he was a staff columnist and Keene was the opinion editor. Keene, who had slashed the frequency of Gaffney&#x27;s column from weekly to monthly, commented to &quot;Media Matters&quot; on Gaffney&#x27;s departure, describing Gaffney&#x27;s work as &quot;well-researched,&quot; and stated, &quot;we&#x27;re sorry to lose him but we wish him well&quot;. Keene also noted that Gaffney had left without giving him any notice, saying, &quot;I guess he&#x27;s notifying us through you&quot;.

===Media responses===
Gaffney has been called a conspiracy theorist by Dave Weigel writing in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine; Steve Benen of MSNBC; &quot;Slate&quot;; and &quot;The Intercept&quot;, among others. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has reported that Gaffney&#x27;s views were &quot;considered radioactive by the Republican establishment&quot;, and Eli Clifton noted that Gaffney suffered &quot;from a lack of mainstream acceptance.&quot; Democrats, and many Republicans, have called Gaffney a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.

===Beliefs===
Conspiracy theories Gaffney has promoted include:

* The belief that the logo of the US Missile Defense Agency is a coded indicator of &quot;official U.S. submission to Islam&quot; because it &quot;appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with the Obama campaign logo&quot;.
* The belief that former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing.
* Gaffney has sought to have Republican Party strategist Grover Norquist excluded from CPAC because of his alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2011, Gaffney said of Norquist, &quot;We are in a war, and he has been working with the enemy for over a decade.&quot; Responding to the accusation, the board of directors of the American Conservative Union unanimously condemned Gaffney&#x27;s charges as &quot;reprehensible&quot; and &quot;unfounded.&quot;
* He has opposed the building of a number of large religious Muslim sites in the United States, including Park51, also referred to as the Ground Zero Mosque. 
* Accusations that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin is a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. After the allegation was repeated by Michele Bachmann, US senators John McCain, Scott Brown, and Marco Rubio joined in dismissing it, and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner said &quot;accusations like this being thrown around are pretty dangerous.&quot;
* Accusations that Barack Obama is a Muslim who has secretly orchestrated &quot;the most consequential bait-and-switch since Adolf Hitler&quot;, that General David Petraeus had &quot;submitted to Sharia&quot;, that Congressman Keith Ellison is &quot;likely to leak information to the Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, and that deputies in the Broward County, Florida, sheriff&#x27;s office are &quot;directly tied to Hamas.
* The belief that the responsibility-to-protect norm has been supported by the United States government to lay the groundwork for a forthcoming American military invasion of Israel.
* The belief that Muslim enemies of the United States are hidden in plain sight and organizing through mainstream Muslim rights organizations. He said of Muslims, “They essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions, for the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed.”

<doc id="154076" wikidata="Q2312056" url="?curid=154076" title="Epiphany (feeling)">
<text>An epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, &quot;epiphanea&quot;, &quot;manifestation, striking appearance&quot;) is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe a scientific breakthrough or a religious or philosophical discovery, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by psychologists and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation.

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes&#x27;s discovery of a method to determine the volume of an irregular object (&quot;Eureka!&quot;) and Isaac Newton&#x27;s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.

==History==
The word &quot;epiphany&quot; originally referred to insight through the divine. Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is supernatural, as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.

The word&#x27;s secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist James Joyce. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as &quot;a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mindthe manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it&quot;. The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection &quot;Dubliners&quot; (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany&#x27;s meaning in the fragment &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; (published posthumously in 1944). For the philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another&#x27;s face (see face-to-face).
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, initiation rites and mystery religions have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The Greek dramatists and poets would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of &quot;catharsis&quot; or &quot;kenosis&quot;, respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of William Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, &quot;a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork.&quot; Both the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and the Pop Artist Andy Warhol would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of fine art (for example a urinal as a fountain), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of &quot;what art is&quot; or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought. Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process. The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one&#x27;s labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies. Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that &quot;the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems.&quot; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one. Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes&#x27; realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout &quot;Eureka!&quot; (&quot;I have found it!&quot;). The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein&#x27;s life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell&#x27;s equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in Bern and realized that if the car sped up (close to the speed of light) he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, &quot;a storm broke loose in my mind,&quot; which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called &quot;the happiest thought of my life&quot; when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of spacea thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of holistic understanding in a prepared mind was said to give Charles Darwin his &quot;hunch&quot; (about natural selection), and Darwin later said he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton&#x27;s apple story, and yet another with Nikola Tesla&#x27;s discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) vision. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.

==In religion==

In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the Visit of the Magi as the revelation of the Incarnation of the infant Christ, and commemorate the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or Theophany) in conjunction with Christ&#x27;s baptism by John the Baptist and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6. Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either Ash Wednesday, or the Feast of the Presentation on February2.

In more general terms, the phrase &quot;religious epiphany&quot; is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to Arjuna&#x27;s realization that Krishna (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;) is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be bodhodaya, from Sanskrit bodha &quot;wisdom&quot; and udaya &quot;rising&quot;. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the bodhi tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining Nirvana. The Zen term &quot;kensho&quot; also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a &quot;koan&quot;.

<text>Timothy Leonard Dalton Leggett (; born 21 March 1946) is a British actor. He gained international prominence as the fourth actor to portray fictional secret agent James Bond in the Eon Productions film series, starring in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987) and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989).

Beginning his career on stage, he made his film debut as Philip II of France in the 1968 historical drama &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. He took roles in the period films &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1970), &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1970), and &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971). Dalton also appeared in the films &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003), &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Tourist&quot; (2010).

On television, Dalton&#x27;s role as Oliver Secombe made him one of the stars of &quot;Centennial&quot; (1978–1979). He later played Mr. Rochester in the BBC serial &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1983), Rhett Butler in the CBS miniseries &quot;Scarlett&quot; (1994), Rassilon in the BBC One sci-fi series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2009–2010), Sir Malcolm Murray on the Showtime horror drama &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014–2016), the Chief on the DC Universe/Max superhero series &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (2019–2021), and Donald Whitfield on the Paramount+ western series &quot;&quot;1923&quot;&quot; (2023–). He portrayed Peter Townsend in the fifth season of &quot;The Crown&quot; (2022) and appeared in the TV series &quot;1923&quot; (2023–present).

== Early life ==
Timothy Leonard Dalton Leggett was born on 21 March 1946 in Colwyn Bay, Wales, to an English father, Peter Dalton Leggett, who was a captain in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the Second World War and was an advertising executive at the time of his son&#x27;s birth; and an American mother, Dorothy Scholes, of Italian and Irish descent.

Before Dalton&#x27;s fourth birthday, the family moved back to England to Belper in Derbyshire, where he attended Herbert Strutt Grammar School. As a teenager, he was a member of the Air Training Corps at LXX (Croft &amp; Culcheth) Squadron.

He decided to become an actor at 16 after seeing a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; and got a role in a production of the play at The Old Vic. He left school in 1962 at 16 to enrol in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and tour with the National Youth Theatre. Dalton did not complete his RADA studies, leaving the academy in 1966 to join the ensemble of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. He had ambitions of being an actor, which pleased his father; &quot;It pleased everybody on my father&#x27;s side of the family. My mother and her side, however, were worried. None of them felt acting was a secure profession for a young man.&quot;

==Career==
Dalton quickly moved to television, working mainly with the BBC, and in 1968 made his film debut as Philip II of France in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. This was the first of several period dramas, which included a remake of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in 1970 in which he portrayed Heathcliff, and the English Civil War drama &quot;Cromwell&quot; as Cavalier commander Prince Rupert of the Rhine. After a few more films, Dalton took a break in 1971 to concentrate on the theatre, performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company and other troupes throughout the world. In 1975, Dalton and Vivien Merchant headed the cast of a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;The Vortex&quot;.

With two exceptions, the films &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971) and &quot;Permission to Kill&quot; (1975), he remained a theatre actor until 1978. That year he starred in &quot;Sextette&quot; as the husband of 85-year-old Mae West, hailing his return to cinema and the beginning of his American career. While in the United States, Dalton worked mainly in television, although he starred in several films. During this time, he played Prince Barin in the science fiction film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980) and played Mr. Rochester in a BBC serial of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1983). Dalton starred alongside Jonathan Pryce in the film &quot;The Doctor and the Devils&quot; (1985).

Dalton co-starred with Joan Collins in the miniseries, &quot;Sins&quot; (1986). He was also replaced in two films in which he&#x27;d been signed to appear. He was offered the role of real-life British Prime Minister William Lamb in the film &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot;. The filmmakers replaced him with Jon Finch at the last moment; Dalton sued for breach of contract and won an out-of-court settlement.

In 1985, Dalton was set to play Don Alfonso de la Torré in Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Pirates&quot;. The two men did not get along, so Polanski replaced Dalton with Damien Thomas. Dalton co-starred with Anthony Edwards in the 1988 British comedy film &quot;Hawks&quot; about two terminally ill patients who set off on a road-trip together.

===James Bond (1986–1994)===
====Initial offers====
Dalton had been considered for the role of James Bond several times. According to the documentary &quot;Inside The Living Daylights&quot;, the producers first approached Dalton in 1968 for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; although Dalton himself in this same documentary claims the approach occurred when he was either 24 or 25 and had already done the film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), so it has been speculated that it was more likely for &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the film in which Roger Moore made his debut as Bond after Sean Connery in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. Dalton declined the offer and told the producers that he was too young for the role. In a 1987 interview, Dalton said, &quot;Originally I did not want to take over from Sean Connery. He was far too good, he was wonderful. I was about 24 or 25, which is too young. But when you&#x27;ve seen Bond from the beginning, you don&#x27;t take over from Sean Connery.&quot; In either 1979 or 1980, during pre-production of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; he was approached again, but did not favour the direction the films were taking, nor did he think the producers were seriously looking for a new 007. As he explained, his idea of Bond was different. In a 1979 episode of the television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Dalton played the role of Damien Roth, a millionaire playboy described by David Doyle&#x27;s character as &quot;almost James Bond-ian&quot;.

In August 1986, Dalton was approached to play Bond after Roger Moore had retired, Dalton would soon begin filming &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; and could do &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; only if the Bond producers waited six weeks. The producers were not willing to wait and offered the role to Pierce Brosnan. However, when news of Brosnan&#x27;s hiring was leaked, the makers of television series &quot;Remington Steele,&quot; in which Brosnan starred, exercised their right to renew the series, and the offer to Brosnan was withdrawn. Having now completed the filming of &quot;Brenda Starr&quot;, Dalton was now available and he accepted the part of Bond for &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.

====Films====

Dalton&#x27;s first appearance as 007, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), was critically successful, grossing more than either of the previous two Bond films with Moore (&quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983) and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985)) as well as contemporary box-office rivals such as &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;. His second film, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989), although almost as successful as its predecessor in most markets, did not perform as well at the U.S. box office, in large part due to a lacklustre marketing campaign, whereby the title of the film was abruptly changed from &quot;Licence Revoked&quot;. The main factor for the lack of success in the U.S. was that it was released at the same time as the hugely successful &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, during the summer blockbuster season. In the United Kingdom, one of its critical markets, the film was also hampered by receiving a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, which severely affected its commercial success. Future Bond films, following the resolution of legal and other issues, were all released between 31 October and mid-December, in order to avoid the risk of a summer failure, as had happened to &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;.

With a worldwide gross of , &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; became the fourth-most-successful Bond film at the time of its release. In 1998, the second Deluxe Edition of Bond&#x27;s soundtracks was released. &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was one of the first soundtracks to receive Deluxe treatment. The booklet/poster of this CD contains MGM&#x27;s quote about &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; being the fourth-most-successful Bond film.

Since Dalton was contracted for three Bond films, the pre-production of his third film began in 1990, in order to be released in 1991. What was confirmed is that the story would deal with the destruction of a chemical weapons laboratory in Scotland, and the events would take place in London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. The film was cancelled due to legal issues between UA/MGM and Eon Productions, which lasted for four years.

The legal battle ended in 1993, and Dalton was expected to return as James Bond in the next Bond film, which later became &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. Since his contract had expired, negotiations with him to renew it took place. Dalton surprised everyone on 12 April 1994 with the announcement that he would not return as James Bond. At this time, he was shooting the miniseries &quot;Scarlett&quot;. Two months later, Brosnan, who had been hired to succeed Moore when Dalton had turned down the role in 1986, was announced as the new Bond. Dalton reflected in 2007, &quot;I was supposed to make one more, but it was cancelled because MGM and the film&#x27;s producers got into a lawsuit which lasted for five years. After that, I didn&#x27;t want to do it anymore.&quot;

====Dalton as Bond====
Dalton portrayed Bond in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987) and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989), the fifteenth and sixteenth entries in the franchise. Unlike Moore, who had played Bond as more of a light-hearted playboy, Dalton&#x27;s portrayal of Bond was darker and more serious. Dalton pushed for renewed emphasis on the gritty realism of Ian Fleming&#x27;s novels instead of fantasy plots and humour.

A fan of the literary character, often seen re-reading and referring to the novels on set, Dalton determined to approach the role and play truer to the original character described by Fleming. His 007, therefore, came across as a reluctant agent who did not always enjoy the assignments he was given, something seen on screen before, albeit obliquely, only in George Lazenby&#x27;s &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. In &quot;The Living Daylights,&quot; for example, Bond tells a critical colleague, Saunders, &quot;Stuff my orders! ... Tell M what you want. If he fires me, I&#x27;ll thank him for it.&quot; This was an element that appealed to Dalton when he read the script. In &quot;Licence to Kill,&quot; he resigns from the Secret Intelligence Service in order to pursue his own agenda of revenge.

This approach proved to be a double-edged sword. Film critics and fans of Fleming&#x27;s original novels welcomed a more serious interpretation after more than a decade of Moore&#x27;s approach. However, Dalton&#x27;s films were criticised for their comparative lack of humour. Dalton&#x27;s serious interpretation was not only in portraying the character, but also in performing most of the stunts of the action scenes himself. His director, John Glen, commented &quot;Tim is a very convincing James Bond. When he has a gun in his hand, you believe he really could kill someone. I don&#x27;t think that was ever the case with Roger Moore.&quot;

Some modern critics have compared Dalton to Daniel Craig. In 2006, Gwladys Fouché of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;while Connery was cool, and Brosnan brilliant, only Dalton could show the dark side of Fleming&#x27;s fearless agent [...Bond producers] want Bond to be closer to the original Ian Fleming character. They want him to be grittier, darker and less jokey. What they really want, it seems, is to have Dalton back.&quot; Dalton himself has claimed that the Bond films starring Daniel Craig are &quot;believable&quot; in the way he wanted his own Bond films to be:
Of his time as Bond, Dalton recalled:

 His time as Bond allowed him to work on projects that were of interest to him; &quot;&quot;Hawks&quot; deals with the subject of extraordinary relevance: Why does it take a crisis to make you realize how bloody precious life is? Unfortunately, it&#x27;s about cancer, which is a not a word the film business thinks of as being particularly commercial. Still, doing the first Bond film enabled me to get &quot;Hawks&quot; made. Doing the Bond film helped the O&#x27;Neill play find an audience. This is a commercial business. If you have a commercial success, you have enhanced viability.&quot;

===Post-Bond career===
After his Bond films, Dalton divided his work between stage, television and films, and diversified the characters he played. This helped him eliminate the 007 typecasting that followed him during the previous period. Dalton was nevertheless for a certain period considered for a part in the Bond film &quot; GoldenEye&quot;. Instead, he played Nazi spy Neville Sinclair in &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), and Rhett Butler in &quot;Scarlett&quot;, the television miniseries sequel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. He also appeared as criminal informant Eddie Myers in the acclaimed British TV film &quot;Framed&quot; (1992). He had a major part in an episode of the TV series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;.

During the second half of the 1990s he starred in several cable films, most notably the Irish Republican Army drama, &quot;The Informant&quot;, and the action thriller &quot;Made Men&quot;. In the TV film &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1999) he played Julius Caesar. He played a parody of James Bond named Damian Drake in the film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003). At the end of that year and the beginning of 2004, he returned to theatre to play Lord Asriel in the stage version of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. Dalton played Simon Skinner, who ran the local supermarket, in the action comedy film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, which was released in 2007.

Dalton returned once again to British television in a guest role for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 2009–10 two-part special &quot;The End of Time&quot;, playing Rassilon. He was first heard in the role narrating a preview clip shown at the 2009 Comic Convention. In 2010 and 2011, he starred in several episodes of the fourth season of the American spy comedy &quot;Chuck&quot; as Alexei Volkoff.

Dalton voiced the character Mr. Pricklepants in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, which was released on 18 June 2010; and again in the television specials &quot;Toy Story of Terror!&quot; (2013) and &quot;Toy Story That Time Forgot&quot; (2014), and the sequel &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019). In 2012, Dalton voiced Lord Milori in &quot;Secret of the Wings&quot;, as part of the Disney Fairies franchise and the fourth film direct-to-DVD instalment of the Tinker Bell film series.

From 2014 to 2016, Dalton portrayed the character Sir Malcolm Murray for three seasons on the &quot;Showtime&quot; original television series&quot; Penny Dreadful&quot;.

From 2019 to 2021, Dalton portrayed the Chief in the DC Universe / HBO Max superhero series &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dalton was in a relationship with reporter Kate Adie as a youth, and actress Vanessa Redgrave (with whom he appeared in the 1971 film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; and the 1979 film &quot;Agatha&quot;) between 1971 and 1986. He briefly dated actresses Stefanie Powers and Whoopi Goldberg.

He was in a relationship with musician Oksana Grigorieva in the 1990s; they met in 1995 while she was employed as a translator for filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov. Dalton and Grigorieva had a son together, born in 1997.. They broke up around 2003.

Dalton has residences in Chiswick in London, West Hollywood, California and St. John&#x27;s, Antigua and Barbuda.

Dalton is a Manchester City F.C. supporter, and is often seen at the City of Manchester Stadium to watch the team play. Although he was born in Wales, Dalton has confirmed he is not &quot;really Welsh other than being born there&quot;, but says he doesn&#x27;t &quot;mind one bit to be named among&quot; the Welsh contingent of actors.

<doc id="154089" wikidata="Q1336538" url="?curid=154089" title="House of Guise">
<text>The House of Guise ( , ; ; ) was a prominent French noble family that was involved heavily in the French Wars of Religion. The House of Guise was the founding house of the Principality of Joinville.

==Origin==
The House of Guise was founded as a cadet branch of the House of Lorraine by Claude of Lorraine (1496–1550), who entered French service and was made the first Duke of Guise by King Francis I in 1527. The family&#x27;s high rank was not due to possession of the Guise dukedom but to their membership in a sovereign dynasty, which procured for them the rank of &quot;prince étranger&quot; at the royal court of France. Claude&#x27;s daughter Mary of Guise (1515–1560) married King James V of Scotland and was mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Claude&#x27;s eldest son, Francis, became the second Duke of Guise at his father&#x27;s death on 12 April 1550 and became a military hero thanks to his defense of Metz in 1552 and the capture of Calais from the English in 1558, while another son, Charles, became Archbishop of Reims and a Cardinal in the Catholic Church.

==French Wars of Religion==
In 1558, the Dauphin Francis married Mary, Queen of Scots. When the young man became king after his father&#x27;s death in 1559, the queen&#x27;s uncles, the Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Lorraine, controlled French politics during his short reign.

In March 1560, opposition to the Guise government coalesced into a conspiracy, led by La Renaudie with support from the Bourbon Prince de Condé. Having been made aware of it, the Guise family were able to crush the conspiracy before the king could be seized. The Guise would take the opportunity of the conspiracy to reorient the Crown&#x27;s religious policy by scaling down the persecution of the last 10 years for a new policy of no toleration and no persecution with the eventual hope the two sects would reunify. Still incensed at his involvement in Amboise, the Guise called the Prince of Condé to them and oversaw a quick trial to establish his guilt, only for the death of Francis II and the succession of Charles IX to sever their links to the government. With Catherine assuming the regency for her young son, the Guise departed court and set themselves up in opposition to her toleration policy in alliance with their rival the Montmorency. In 1562, Catherine would promulgate the Edict of Saint-Germain. Francis returned to court so that he might oppose it, on his way, his retinue massacred a Protestant congregation at Wassy. In response, Condé went into open rebellion and thus started the French Wars of Religion.

Duke Francis helped to defeat the Huguenots at the Battle of Dreux (19 December 1562), but he was assassinated at the Siege of Orleans on 24 February 1563 while he was seeking a final victory. His son, Henry, inherited his titles; and under the direction of his uncle Charles began a campaign to accuse Admiral Coligny of orchestrating his fathers assassination. Charles meanwhile led the French delegation at the Council of Trent, converting to the Papal line in 1563. In 1564, no longer permitted to continue his feud with Coligny through legal channels, he and his uncle Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine would attempt to make a show of force by entering Paris, but their entry ended with both besieged in their residence and forced to concede.

In 1566, the crown forced Charles at Moulins to make the kiss of peace with Coligny to end their feud, but Henry refused to attend. He would also challenge Coligny and Anne de Montmorency to duels, but they rebuffed his attempts. No longer welcome at court, he and his brother Charles, Duke of Mayenne decided to crusade against the Ottoman Empire in Hungary. In September 1568, he reached his majority, just as Charles returned to the centre of French politics with his readmission to the Privy Council. No sooner had he returned to the council than he began leading the war party to break off the Peace of Longjumeau, which would be annulled shortly thereafter and started the Third French War of religion. He would fight at Jarnac, Moncontour and defend Poitiers from a siege by Coligny. By the termination of the third war, the Guise would once more find themselves in disgrace from court due both to their hawkish policy and Henry&#x27;s affair with Margaret de Valois.

Having returned to favour, Henry helped plan the assassination of Coligny, the final culmination of his feud that would spiral into the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre of the Huguenots in 1572. In 1576, frustrated with the Politiques&#x27; direction of the government of Henri III, Guise would be instrumental in the formation of the Catholic League. The death of the royal heir presumptive, Francis, Duke of Anjou, in 1584, which made the Protestant King Henry of Navarre the heir to the French throne, led to a new civil war, the War of the Three Henries, with King Henry III of France, Henry of Navarre and Henry of Guise fighting for control of France. Guise began the war by declaring the unacceptability of Navarre as King of France and controlled the powerful Catholic League, which soon forced the French king to follow in his wake. In 1588 Guise, with Spanish support, instigated a revolt against the king, took control of the city of Paris and became the de facto ruler of France.

After an apparent reconciliation between the French king and the Duke, King Henry III had both the Duke of Guise and his brother, Louis of Lorraine, Cardinal of Guise (1555–1588), murdered in December 1588 during a meeting in the Royal Chateau at Blois. The leadership of the Catholic League fell to their brother, Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, the commander of the armed forces of the Catholic League.

The Duke of Mayenne&#x27;s nephew, the young Duke of Guise, Charles, was proposed by the Catholic League as a candidate for the throne, possibly through a marriage to Philip II of Spain&#x27;s daughter Isabella, the granddaughter of Henry II of France. The Catholic League was eventually defeated, but for the sake of the country, King Henry IV became a Catholic and bought peace with Mayenne, and in January 1596, a treaty was signed that put an end to the League.

== Decline from prominence ==
After this, the House of Guise receded from its prominent position in French politics, and the senior line, that of the Dukes of Guise became extinct in 1688. The vast estates and title were disputed and diverted by various relatives although several junior branches of the family (Dukes of Mayenne, Dukes of Elbeuf etc.) perpetuated the male line until 1825.

Their principal title, Duke de Guise in 1688 was awarded to a branch of the House of Bourbon and afterwards to the House of Orléans. The title, with one exception, was not used by pretenders to throne of France, who were overthrown by the French Revolution of 1848. One of House of Guise&#x27;s heads, Prince Jean, Duke of Guise (1874–1940) nonetheless took it as his title of pretence to the former crown of France and was supported by some of the 19th century Orleanist activists. They formed for at the time the junior set of Legitimists, who are claimants to be senior descendants of the pre-1848 French Royal Family and have been supported by restorative movements before, during and after the Second French Empire of Emperor Napoleon III, the last undoubted monarch of France. By the end of the 1880s, a series of republican Presidents during the relatively-new French Third Republic largely ended any hope of a restored monarchy.

<text>Alfeld is a town in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. Located on the Leine river and situated approximately 20 km southwest of Hildesheim, it is the second biggest city in the district of Hildesheim in southern Lower Saxony and part of the Metropolitan region Hannover-Braunschweig-Göttingen-Wolfsburg. Alfeld is a member of the Leinebergland region and on the German Timber-Frame Road. With the Fagus Factory, Alfeld became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.

==History==
The town was founded before 1214, with the name &quot;Alvelde&quot; recorded in 1214, 1221, and 1233. The toponymic element &quot;-feld&quot; means &quot;open area&quot;, &quot;an undeveloped, open field&quot;, or &quot;an untilled field&quot;. &quot;Al-&quot; likely derives from the Indoeuropean root &quot;el-/ol-&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;, &quot;damp&quot;, or &quot;flowing&quot;.

In 1426, Alfeld joined the Saxon League of Towns, thus becoming an indirect member of the Hanseatic League. The town was one of the smallest cities in the Hanseatic League, but had become prosperous in the fourteenth and fifteenth century through its trade in beer, hops, linen, and yarn.

Alfeld originally belonged to the Diocese of Hildesheim, but was transferred to the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel after the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud (1519-1523). In retrospect, this Brunswick period constituted Alfeld&#x27;s Golden Age, its economy and culture flourishing before the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Main Sights==
Sights in Alfeld include the town hall (1586) with its octagonal tower, the church Saint Nicolai and the Fillerturm, a medieval watchtower, and the Fagus Factory of 1911, a fine example of early modernist architecture by Walter Gropius. More famous are the Seven Hills (German: &quot;Sieben Berge&quot;) in the north and the &quot;Lippoldshöhle&quot; (&quot;Lippold&#x27;s cave&quot;), where a legendary robber-knight is said to have lived.

==Culture==
The assertion that the popular fairy tale of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was born in Alfeld is false. Even though the miners who mined ore In the Seven Mountains believed in the existence of dwarfs, it is more likely that the cradle of the fairy tale is to be searched in France. The version the brothers Grimm heard and wrote down, as they travelled through the Seven Mountains, on the so-called &quot;Märchenstrasse&quot; (Street Of Fairytales) is just one of many.

The most popular beer in Alfeld is Einbecker Brauherrn, from Einbeck, about 12 kilometers or so, away, south of Alfeld. Veltins Pilsner, Flensberger Pils and Gottinger Pils are also popular beers in Alfeld.

==Economy==

The biggest employer of the city is the SAPPI (South African Pulp and Paper Industry) factory with its big chimney, which has become one of Alfeld&#x27;s landmarks. Even more famous than SAPPI is the Fagus Werk, rebuilt in 1910-1915 after the blueprints of architect Walter-Gropius, what is said to be trend-setting for modern architecture.

==Popular culture==

Alfeld is a strategically important town fought over repeatedly by NATO and the Soviet Red Army forces in Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, due to the bridges over the Leine River.

==International relations==
Alfeld is twinned with:

* Wakefield, United Kingdom

==Notable people==
* Augustine of Alfeld (1480–1535), Franciscan and controversial theologian
* Walter Kappe (1905–1944), German Nazi, who, as an emigrant in the US in the 1930s, created propaganda and committed espionage in service of Nazism
* Uwe Schmidt (born 1954), German politician (SPD) and since July 2009, head of the district Kassel
* Albrecht von Goertz (1914–2006), German industrial designer
* Zbigniew Żedzicki (born 1945), Polish wrestler

<doc id="154097" wikidata="Q3307836" url="?curid=154097" title="Mi-Hyun Kim">
<text>Mi-Hyun Kim (, born 13 January 1977) is a professional golfer from South Korea. She turned professional in 1996 and won 11 events on the LPGA of Korea Tour (KLPGA) between 1996 and 2000. In 1999, she joined the LPGA Tour and was named was Rookie of the Year that year. She has won eight LPGA events with her best finish in a major championship second place at the 2001 Women&#x27;s British Open.

==Background==
Born in Incheon, Kim received the nicknamed &quot;Peanut&quot; because she stands only tall. LPGA golfers also refer to her as &quot;Kimmy.&quot; She was inspired to move to the United States by Se Ri Pak, and they along with Grace Park and Hee-Won Han – the four nicknamed the &quot;Seoul Sisters&quot; – are considered pioneers in the surge of outstanding South Korean women&#x27;s golfers on the LPGA Tour. Her swing is characterized by an unusually long backswing that has become shorter in recent years.

==Charitable giving==
In May 2007, Kim donated $100,000 of her $210,000 prize money from winning the SemGroup Championship to victims of a recent tornado that severely damaged the town of Greensburg, Kansas. The tornado occurred during the SemGroup tournament.

Kim did not have any connection to Greensburg or any of its residents. Commenting on her donation, she said, &quot;Honestly, I made a lot of money in the United States on the LPGA Tour. Most of time, I get the money here and donate to South Korea. But, I want to help people here, too. The win was a surprise for me and I think God gave it to me like a special present or he is using me like, &#x27;okay, I give you this, but after that you give to help the people.&#x27;&quot;

A year later on the eve on the 2008 SemGroup Championship, the president of the United Way of the Plains in Wichita, Kansas appeared with Kim at the pre-tournament press conference to publicly thank her and announce that the publicity surrounding Kim&#x27;s donation had spurred further donations totaling $1.2 million and that money is being used to build 25 homes for low- and moderate-income individuals displaced by the tornado.

==Personal==
Kim retired from the LPGA Tour after playing several tournaments during the 2011 season. In December 2008 she married Lee Won-hee, a former Olympic gold medalist in judo who now teaches judo at a university in South Korea. In 2009 they had a son, Ye Sung Lee, who was born in Orlando, Florida. The couple divorced in 2012.

She currently teaches golf in South Korea. A golf teaching/practice facility built by her father is named the Mi-Hyun Kim Golf World.

<text>Kim Jong Il (; ; ; born Yuri Kim; 16 February 1941 – 17 December 2011) was a North Korean politician who was the supreme leader of North Korea from the death of his father Kim Il Sung in 1994 until his death in 2011, when he was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. Afterwards, Kim Jong Il was declared Eternal General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK).

In the early 1980s, Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of North Korea, thus being established the Kim family, and he assumed important posts in party and army organizations. Kim succeeded his father and founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, following his death in 1994. Kim was the General Secretary of the WPK, WPK Presidium, WPK Central Military Commission, Chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA), the fourth-largest standing army in the world.

Kim ruled North Korea as a repressive and totalitarian dictatorship. Kim assumed leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a famine. While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his &quot;Songun&quot; (&quot;military-first&quot;) policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim&#x27;s rule also saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003. In April 2009, North Korea&#x27;s constitution was amended to refer to him and his successors as the &quot;supreme leader of the DPRK&quot;.

The most common colloquial title given to Kim during his lifetime was &quot;Dear Leader&quot; to distinguish him from his father Kim Il Sung, the &quot;Great Leader&quot;. Following Kim&#x27;s failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son, Kim Jong Un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him. After his death, alongside &quot;Eternal General Secretary&quot; of the WPK, Kim Jong Il was declared &quot;Eternal Chairman&quot; of the now defunct National Defence Commission, in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim dynasty. North Korean media also began referring to Kim as &quot;the General&quot; (장군 &quot;Changgun&quot;), similar to his father&#x27;s posthumous designation as &quot;the [eternal] President&quot;.

== Early life ==

=== Birth ===

Soviet records show that Kim Jong Il was born Yuri Kim. In literature, it is assumed that he was born in 1941 in either the camp of Vyatskoye, near Khabarovsk, or camp Voroshilov near Nikolsk. According to Lim Jae Cheon, Kim cannot have been born in Vyatskoye as Kim Il Sung&#x27;s war records show that he arrived at Vyatskoye only in July 1942 and had been living in Voroshilov before, thus Kim Jong Il is generally agreed to have been born in Voroshilov. Kim&#x27;s mother, Kim Jong Suk, was Kim Il Sung&#x27;s first wife. Inside his family, he was nicknamed &quot;Yura&quot;, while his younger brother Kim Man Il (born Aleksandr Kim) was nicknamed &quot;Shura&quot;.

Kim&#x27;s official biography states he was born in a secret military camp on Paektu Mountain (; &quot;Paektusan Miryeong Gohyang jip&quot;) in Korea under Japanese rule on 16 February 1942. According to one comrade of Kim&#x27;s mother, Lee Min, word of Kim&#x27;s birth first reached an army camp in Vyatskoye via radio and that both Kim and his mother did not return there until the following year. Kim Jong Suk died in 1949 from an ectopic pregnancy.

In 1945, Kim was four years old when World War II ended and Korea regained independence from Japan. His father returned to Pyongyang that September, and in late November Kim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at Sonbong. The family moved into a former Japanese officer&#x27;s mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool. Kim&#x27;s brother drowned there in 1948.

=== Education ===
According to his official biography, Kim completed the course of general education between September 1950 and August 1960. He attended Primary School No. 4 and Middle School No. 1 (Namsan Higher Middle School) in Pyongyang. This is contested by foreign academics, who believe he is more likely to have received his early education in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a precaution to ensure his safety during the Korean War.

Throughout his schooling, Kim was involved in politics. He was active in the Korean Children&#x27;s Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957, he became vice-chairman of his middle school&#x27;s DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He pursued a programme of anti-factionalism and attempted to encourage greater ideological education among his classmates.

Kim is also said to have received English language education in Malta in the early 1970s on his infrequent holidays there as a guest of Prime Minister Dom Mintoff.

The elder Kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son, Kim Pyong Il. Since 1988, Kim Pyong Il has served in a series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean ambassador to Poland. Foreign commentators suspect that Kim Pyong Il was sent to these distant posts by his father in order to avoid a power struggle between his two sons.

== Ascension to power ==

=== Initial career ===
Kim Jong Il officially joined the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea in July 1961. He rose up the ranks during the 1960s, and benefited greatly from the Kapsan faction incident around 1967, which was the last credible challenge to Kim Il Sung&#x27;s sole rule. This incident marked the first time Kim Jong Il was – at age 26 – given official duties by his father, when Jong Il took part in the investigation and purges that followed the incident.

In addition, Kim Jong Il gave a speech at the plenum; it was his first as a figure of authority. Kim Jong Il&#x27;s name was also mentioned in public documents, possibly for the first time, indicating that Kim Il Sung might have already planned for Jong Il to succeed him as leader.

Only six months later, in an unscheduled meeting of the party, Kim Il Sung called for loyalty in the film industry that had betrayed him with &quot;An Act of Sincerity&quot;. Kim Jong Il himself announced that he was up to the task and thus begun his influential career in North Korean filmmaking, during which he made significant efforts to further intensify the personality cult of his father and attach himself to it. In 1969, he produced a film adaptation of the North Korean opera &quot;Sea of Blood&quot;.

Kim Jong Il was elected to the Central Committee in 1972 and became its secretary the following year.

However, when Kim Il Sung began to contemplate the succession question in the early 1970s, it didn&#x27;t seem certain that Kim Jong Il would be his successor. There was Kim&#x27;s uncle, Kim Yong-ju, who was once believed to be Kim Il Sung&#x27;s eventual successor but who had made several mistakes in the struggle for power, had serious flaws, and was becoming increasingly marginalized. Then there was the threat posed by his paternal half-brother, Kim Pyong Il, whose mother, Kim Song-ae, wished to place her son in line for succession instead of Jong Il.

Defector Hwang Jang Yop wrote in his memoirs,
In February 1974, Kim Yong-ju was criticized by Kim Il Sung at a party conference and demoted to vice-premier. Kim Yong-ju&#x27;s allies were removed and eventually he was placed under house arrest, where he remained until 1993. In 1976, Kim Song-ae lost her position as chair of the KDWL, which was her vital power base. And in 1979, Kim Pyong Il began a series of diplomatic postings in Europe, arranged so as then he couldn&#x27;t influence politics in North Korea. Kim Pyong Il only returned to North Korea in 2019.

According to Kim Jong Il&#x27;s official biography, the Central Committee already appointed him successor to Kim Il Sung in 1974. The first public confirmation of Kim Jong Il&#x27;s position as successor came in 1977, when in a booklet he was designated as Kim Il Sung&#x27;s only heir.

=== Heir apparent ===

By the time of the Sixth Party Congress in October 1980, Kim&#x27;s control of the Party operation was complete. He was given senior posts in the Presidium, the Military Commission and the party Secretariat. When he was made a member of the Seventh Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly in February 1982, international observers deemed him the heir apparent of North Korea. Prior to 1980, he had no public profile and was referred to only as the &quot;Party Centre&quot;. At this time Kim assumed the title &quot;Dear Leader&quot; (), and the government began building a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father, the &quot;Great Leader&quot;. Kim was regularly hailed by the media as the &quot;fearless leader&quot; and &quot;the great successor to the revolutionary cause&quot;. He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in North Korea.

By the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic stagnation. Kim Il Sung&#x27;s policy of &quot;Juche&quot; (self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade, even with its traditional partners, the Soviet Union and China. South Korea accused Kim of ordering the 1983 bombing in Rangoon, Burma which killed 17 visiting South Korean officials, including four cabinet members, and another in 1987 which killed all 115 onboard Korean Air Flight 858. A North Korean agent, Kim Hyon Hui, confessed to planting a bomb in the case of the second, saying the operation was ordered by Kim personally.

On 24 December 1991, Kim was also named Supreme Commander of the Korean People&#x27;s Army. Defence Minister Oh Jin Wu, one of Kim Il Sung&#x27;s most loyal subordinates, engineered Kim&#x27;s acceptance by the Army as the next leader of North Korea, despite his lack of military service. In 1992, Kim Il Sung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic.

In 1992, radio broadcasts started referring to him as the &quot;Dear Father&quot;, instead of the &quot;Dear Leader&quot;, suggesting a promotion. His 50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations, exceeded only by those for the 80th birthday of Kim Il Sung himself on 15 April that same year.

In 1992, Kim made his first public speech during a military parade for the KPA&#x27;s 60th anniversary and said: &quot;Glory to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People&#x27;s Army!&quot;. These words were followed by a loud applause by the crowd at Pyongyang&#x27;s Kim Il Sung Square where the parade was held.

Kim was named Chairman of the National Defence Commission on 9 April 1993, making him day-to-day commander of the armed forces.

According to defector Hwang Jang Yop, the North Korean government system became even more centralized and autocratic during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang, although Kim Il Sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast, Kim Jong Il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang, Kim Jong Il personally directed even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates.

== Leader of North Korea ==
On 8 July 1994, Kim Il Sung died at the age of 82 from a heart attack. Kim Jong Il had been his father&#x27;s designated successor as early as 1974, named commander-in-chief in 1991, and became Supreme Leader upon his father&#x27;s death.

He officially took over his father&#x27;s old post as General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea on 8 October 1997. In 1998, he was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission, and a constitutional amendment declared that post to be &quot;the highest post of the state&quot;. Also in 1998, the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly wrote the president&#x27;s post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il Sung as the country&#x27;s &quot;Eternal President&quot; in order to honor his memory forever.

Officially, Kim was part of a triumvirate heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier Choe Yong Rim and parliament chairman Kim Yong Nam (no relation). Kim commanded the armed forces, Choe Yong Rim headed the government and handled domestic affairs and Kim Yong Nam handled foreign relations. However, in practice, Kim, like his father before him, exercised absolute control over the government and the country. Although not required to stand for popular election to his key offices, he was unanimously elected to the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly every five years, representing a military constituency, due to his concurrent capacities as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the NDC.

=== Economic policies ===
Kim had a &quot;reputation for being almost comically incompetent in matters of economic management&quot;. The economy of North Korea struggled throughout the 1990s, primarily due to mismanagement. In addition, North Korea experienced severe floods in the mid-1990s, exacerbated by poor land management. This, compounded with the fact that only 18% of North Korea is arable land and the country&#x27;s inability to import the goods necessary to sustain industry, led to a severe famine and left North Korea economically devastated. Faced with a country in decay, Kim adopted a &quot;Military-First&quot; policy to strengthen the country and reinforce the regime. On the national scale, the Japanese Foreign Ministry acknowledges that this has resulted in a positive growth rate for the country since 1996, with the implementation of &quot;landmark socialist-type market economic practices&quot; in 2002, keeping the North afloat despite a continued dependency on foreign aid for food.

In the wake of the devastation of the 1990s, the government began formally approving some activity of small-scale bartering and trade. As observed by Daniel Sneider, associate director for research at the Stanford University Asia–Pacific Research Center, this flirtation with capitalism was &quot;fairly limited, butespecially compared to the pastthere are now remarkable markets that create the semblance of a free market system&quot;.

In 2002, Kim declared that &quot;money should be capable of measuring the worth of all commodities.&quot; These gestures toward economic reform mirror similar actions taken by China&#x27;s Deng Xiaoping in the late 1980s and early 90s. During a rare visit in 2006, Kim expressed admiration for China&#x27;s rapid economic progress.

An unsuccessful devaluation of the North Korean won in 2009, initiated or approved by Kim personally, caused brief economic chaos and uncovered the vulnerability of the country&#x27;s societal fabric in the face of crisis.

=== Foreign relations ===

Kim was known as a skilled and manipulative diplomat. In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung implemented the &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; to improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to start projects in the North. Kim announced plans to import and develop new technologies to develop North Korea&#x27;s fledgling software industry. As a result of the new policy, the Kaesong Industrial Park was constructed in 2003 just north of the demilitarized zone.
In 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an Agreed Framework which was designed to freeze and eventually dismantle the North&#x27;s nuclear weapons program in exchange for aid in producing two power-generating nuclear reactors and the assurance that it would not be invaded again. In 2000, after a meeting with Madeleine Albright, he agreed to a moratorium on missile construction. In 2002, Kim&#x27;s government admitted to having produced nuclear weapons since the 1994 agreement. Kim&#x27;s regime argued the secret production was necessary for security purposesciting the presence of United States-owned nuclear weapons in South Korea and the new tensions with the United States under President George W. Bush. On 9 October 2006, North Korea&#x27;s Korean Central News Agency announced that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.

=== Cult of personality ===

Kim was the focus of an elaborate personality cult inherited from his father and founder of the DPRK, Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il was often the centre of attention throughout ordinary life in the DPRK. On his 60th birthday (based on his official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the country on the occasion of his Hwangap. In 2010, the North Korean media reported that Kim&#x27;s distinctive clothing had set worldwide fashion trends.

The prevailing point of view is that the people&#x27;s adherence to Kim&#x27;s cult of personality was solely out of respect for Kim Il Sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage. Media and government sources from outside North Korea generally support this view, while North Korean government sources aver that it was genuine hero worship. The song &quot;No Motherland Without You&quot;, sung by the KPA State Merited Choir, was created especially for Kim in 1992 and is frequently broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang.

=== Human rights record ===

According to a 2004 Human Rights Watch report, the North Korean government under Kim was &quot;among the world&#x27;s most repressive governments&quot;, having up to 200,000 political prisoners according to U.S. and South Korean officials, with no freedom of the press or religion, political opposition or equal education: &quot;Virtually every aspect of political, social, and economic life is controlled by the government.&quot;

Kim&#x27;s government was accused of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; for its alleged culpability in creating and prolonging the 1990s famine. Human Rights Watch characterized him as a dictator and accused him of human rights violations. Amnesty International condemned him for leaving &#x27;millions of North Koreans mired in poverty&#x27; and detaining hundreds of thousands of people in prison camps.

Kim Jong Il claimed that the barometer for distinguishing whether a person can be deemed a member of North Korean society and hence entitled to rights &#x27;lies not on the grounds of his social class but on the grounds of his ideology&#x27;.

== Health and rumours of waning power ==

=== 2008 reports ===
In an August 2008 issue of the Japanese newsweekly &quot;Shūkan Gendai&quot;, Waseda University professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, an authority on the Korean Peninsula, claimed that Kim died of diabetes in late 2003 and had been replaced in public appearances by one or more stand-ins previously employed to protect him from assassination attempts. In a subsequent best-selling book, &quot;The True Character of Kim Jong Il&quot;, Shigemura cited apparently unnamed people close to Kim&#x27;s family along with Japanese and South Korean intelligence sources, claiming they confirmed Kim&#x27;s diabetes took a turn for the worse early in 2000 and from then until his supposed death three-and-a-half years later he was using a wheelchair. Shigemura moreover claimed a voiceprint analysis of Kim speaking in 2004 did not match a known earlier recording. It was also noted that Kim did not appear in public for the Olympic torch relay in Pyongyang on 28 April 2008. The question had reportedly &quot;baffled foreign intelligence agencies for years&quot;.

On 9 September 2008, various sources reported that after he did not show up that day for a military parade celebrating North Korea&#x27;s 60th anniversary, United States intelligence agencies believed Kim might be &quot;gravely ill&quot; after having suffered a stroke. He had last been seen in public a month earlier.

A former CIA official said earlier reports of a health crisis were likely accurate. North Korean media remained silent on the issue. An Associated Press report said analysts believed Kim had been supporting moderates in the foreign ministry, while North Korea&#x27;s powerful military was against so-called &quot;Six-Party&quot; negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States aimed towards ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons. Some United States officials noted that soon after rumours about Kim&#x27;s health were publicized a month before, North Korea had taken a &quot;tougher line in nuclear negotiations&quot;. In late August North Korea&#x27;s official news agency reported the government would &quot;consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon to their original state as strongly requested by its relevant institutions&quot;. Analysts said this meant &quot;the military may have taken the upper hand and that Kim might no longer be wielding absolute authority&quot;. By 10 September, there were conflicting reports. Unidentified South Korean government officials said Kim had undergone surgery after suffering a minor stroke and had apparently &quot;intended to attend 9 September event in the afternoon but decided not to because of the aftermath of the surgery&quot;. Kim Yong Nam said, &quot;While we wanted to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the country with general secretary Kim Jong Il, we celebrated on our own&quot;. Song Il Ho, North Korea&#x27;s ambassador said, &quot;We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot&quot;. Seoul&#x27;s &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; newspaper reported that &quot;the South Korean embassy in Beijing had received an intelligence report that Kim collapsed on 22 August&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 9 September that Kim was &quot;very ill and most likely suffered a stroke a few weeks ago, but United States intelligence authorities do not think his death is imminent&quot;. The BBC noted that the North Korean government denied these reports, stating that Kim&#x27;s health problems were &quot;not serious enough to threaten his life&quot;, although they did confirm that he had suffered a stroke on 15 August.
Japan&#x27;s Kyodo News agency reported on 14 September, that &quot;Kim collapsed on 14 August due to stroke or a cerebral hemorrhage, and that Beijing dispatched five military doctors at the request of Pyongyang. Kim will require a long period of rest and rehabilitation before he fully recovers and has complete command of his limbs again, as with typical stroke victims&quot;. Japan&#x27;s &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; claimed Kim had occasionally lost consciousness since April. Japan&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Shimbun&quot; on 15 September, added that Kim was staying at the Bongwha State Guest House. He was apparently conscious &quot;but he needs some time to recuperate from the recent stroke, with some parts of his hands and feet paralyzed&quot;. It cited Chinese sources which claimed that one cause for the stroke could have been stress brought about by the United States delay to remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.

On 19 October, North Korea reportedly ordered its diplomats to stay near their embassies to await &quot;an important message&quot;, according to Japan&#x27;s &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, setting off renewed speculation about the health of the ailing leader.

By 29 October 2008, reports stated Kim suffered a serious setback and had been taken back to the hospital. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, on 28 October 2008, stated in a parliamentary session that Kim had been hospitalized: &quot;His condition is not so good. However, I don&#x27;t think he is totally incapable of making decisions&quot;. Aso further said a French neurosurgeon was aboard a plane for Beijing, en route to North Korea. Further, Kim Sung-ho, director of South Korea&#x27;s National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a closed parliamentary session in Seoul that &quot;Kim appeared to be recovering quickly enough to start performing his daily duties&quot;. &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot; newspaper reported &quot;a serious problem&quot; with Kim&#x27;s health. Japan&#x27;s Fuji Television network reported that Kim&#x27;s eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, traveled to Paris to hire a neurosurgeon for his father, and showed footage where the surgeon boarded flight CA121 bound for Pyongyang from Beijing on 24 October. The French weekly &quot;Le Point&quot; identified him as Francois-Xavier Roux, neurosurgery director of Paris&#x27; Sainte-Anne Hospital, but Roux himself stated he was in Beijing for several days and not North Korea. On 19 December 2011, Roux confirmed that Kim suffered a debilitating stroke in 2008 and was treated by himself and other French doctors at Pyongyang&#x27;s Red Cross Hospital. Roux said Kim suffered few lasting effects.

On 5 November 2008, the North&#x27;s Korean Central News Agency published 2 photos showing Kim posing with dozens of Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) soldiers on a visit to military Unit 2200 and sub-unit of Unit 534. Shown with his usual bouffant hairstyle, with his trademark sunglasses and a white winter parka, Kim stood in front of trees with autumn foliage and a red-and-white banner. &quot;The Times&quot; questioned the authenticity of at least one of these photos.

In November 2008, Japan&#x27;s TBS TV network reported that Kim had suffered a second stroke in October, which &quot;affected the movement of his left arm and leg and also his ability to speak&quot;. However, South Korea&#x27;s intelligence agency rejected this report.

In response to the rumors regarding Kim&#x27;s health and supposed loss of power, in April 2009, North Korea released a video showing Kim visiting factories and other places around the country between November and December 2008. In 2010, leaked diplomatic cables purportedly attested that Kim suffered from epilepsy.

According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Kim was a chain-smoker.

=== Successor ===
Kim&#x27;s three sons and his brother-in-law, along with O Kuk Ryol, an army general, had been noted as possible successors, but the North Korean government had for a time been wholly silent on this matter.

Kim Yong Hyun, a political expert at the Institute for North Korean Studies at Seoul&#x27;s Dongguk University, said in 2007: &quot;Even the North Korean establishment would not advocate a continuation of the family dynasty at this point&quot;. Kim&#x27;s eldest son Kim Jong-nam was earlier believed to be the designated heir but he appeared to have fallen out of favor after being arrested at Narita International Airport near Tokyo in 2001 where he was caught attempting to enter Japan on a fake passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

On 2 June 2009, it was reported that Kim&#x27;s youngest son, Kim Jong Un, was to be North Korea&#x27;s next leader. Like his father and grandfather, he has also been given an official sobriquet, The Brilliant Comrade. Prior to his death, it had been reported that Kim was expected to officially designate the son as his successor in 2012.

=== Re-election as leader ===
On 9 April 2009, Kim was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission and made an appearance at the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly. This was the first time Kim was seen in public since August 2008. He was unanimously re-elected and given a standing ovation.

On 28 September 2010, Kim was re-elected as General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea.

=== 2010 and 2011 foreign visits ===
Kim reportedly visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China in May 2010. He entered the country via his personal train on 3 May and stayed in a hotel in Dalian. In May 2010, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell told South Korean officials that Kim had only three years to live, according to medical information that had been compiled. Kim travelled to China again in August 2010, this time with his son, fueling speculation at the time that he was ready to hand over power to his son, Kim Jong Un.

He returned to China again in May 2011, marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between China and the DPRK. In late August 2011, he traveled by train to the Russian Far East to meet with President Dmitry Medvedev for unspecified talks.

=== Late 2011 ===
There were speculations that the visits of Kim abroad in 2010 and 2011 were a sign of his improving health and a possible slowdown in succession might follow. After the visit to Russia, Kim appeared in a military parade in Pyongyang on 9 September, accompanied by Kim Jong Un.

== Death ==
It was reported that Kim had died of a suspected heart attack on 17 December 2011 at 8:30am while travelling by train to an area outside Pyongyang. He was succeeded by his youngest son Kim Jong Un, who was hailed by the Korean Central News Agency as the &quot;Great Successor&quot;. According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), during his death a fierce snowstorm &quot;paused&quot; and &quot;the sky glowed red above the sacred Mount Paektu&quot; and the ice on a famous lake also cracked so loud that it seemed to &quot;shake the Heavens and the Earth&quot;.

Kim&#x27;s funeral took place on 28 December in Pyongyang, with a mourning period lasting until the following day. South Korea&#x27;s military was immediately put on alert after the announcement and its National Security Council convened for an emergency meeting, out of concern that political jockeying in North Korea could destabilise the region. Asian stock markets fell soon after the announcement, due to similar concerns.

On 12 January 2012, North Korea called Kim the &quot;eternal leader&quot; and announced that his body would be preserved and displayed at Pyongyang&#x27;s Kumsusan Memorial Palace. Officials also announced plans to install statues, portraits, and immortality towers across the country. His birthday of 16 February was declared &quot;the greatest auspicious holiday of the nation&quot; and was named the Day of the Shining Star.

In February 2012, on what would have been his 71st birthday, Kim was posthumously made Dae Wonsu (usually translated as &quot;Generalissimo&quot;, literally Grand Marshal), the nation&#x27;s top military rank. He had been named Wonsu (Marshal) in 1992 when North Korean founder Kim Il Sung was promoted to Dae Wonsu. Also in February 2012, the North Korean government created the Order of Kim Jong Il in his honor and awarded it to 132 individuals for services in building a &quot;thriving socialist nation&quot; and for increasing defense capabilities.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
There is no official information available about Kim Jong Il&#x27;s marital history, but he is believed to have been officially married twice and to have had three mistresses. He had three known sons: Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong Chul and Kim Jong Un. His two known daughters are Kim Sol Song and Kim Yo Jong.

Kim&#x27;s first wife, Hong Il Chon, was the daughter of a martyr who died during the Korean War. She was handpicked by his father and married to him in 1966. They had a daughter called Kim Hye Kyung, who was born in 1968. Soon afterwards, they divorced in 1969.

Kim&#x27;s first mistress, Song Hye Rim, was a star of North Korean films. She was already married to another man and with a child when they met. Kim is reported to have forced her husband to divorce her. This relationship, which started in 1970, was not officially recognized. They had one son, Kim Jong-nam (1971–2017), who was Kim Jong Il&#x27;s eldest son. Kim kept both the relationship and the child a secret (even from his father) until he ascended to power in 1994. However, after years of estrangement, Song is believed to have died in Moscow in the Central Clinical Hospital in 2002.

Kim&#x27;s official wife, Kim Young Sook, was the daughter of a high-ranking military official. His father Kim Il Sung handpicked her to marry his son. The two were estranged for some years before Kim&#x27;s death. Kim had a daughter from this marriage, Kim Sol Song (born 1974).

His second mistress, Ko Yong Hui, was a Japanese-born ethnic Korean and a dancer. She had taken over the role of First Lady until her deathreportedly of cancerin 2004. They had two sons, Kim Jong Chul (in 1981) and Kim Jong Un, also &quot;Jong Woon&quot; or &quot;Jong Woong&quot; (in 1983). They also had a daughter, Kim Yo Jong, who was about 23 years old in 2012.

After Ko&#x27;s death, Kim lived with Kim Ok, his third mistress, who had served as his personal secretary since the 1980s. She &quot;virtually act[ed] as North Korea&#x27;s first lady&quot; and frequently accompanied Kim on his visits to military bases and in meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries. She traveled with Kim on a secretive trip to China in January 2006, where she was received by Chinese officials as Kim&#x27;s wife.

According to Michael Breen, author of the book &quot;Kim Jong Il: North Korea&#x27;s Dear Leader&quot;, the women intimately linked to Kim never acquired any power or influence of consequence. As he explains, their roles were limited to that of romance and domesticity.

He had a younger sister, Kim Kyong Hui. She was married to Jang Sung Taek, who was executed in December 2013 in Pyongyang, after being charged with treason and corruption.

=== Personality ===

Like his father, Kim had a fear of flying and always travelled by private armored train for state visits to Russia and China. The BBC reported that Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian emissary who travelled with Kim across Russia by train, told reporters that Kim had live lobsters air-lifted to the train every day and ate them with silver chopsticks.

Kim was said to be a huge film fan, owning a collection of more than 20,000 video tapes and DVDs. His reported favourite movie franchises included &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, Hong Kong action cinema, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;James Bond&quot;, &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot;, and &quot;Rambo&quot;, with Sean Connery and Elizabeth Taylor his favourite male and female actors. Kim was also said to have been a fan of Ealing comedies, inspired by their emphasis on team spirit and a mobilised proletariat. Kim oversaw the production of &quot;The Flower Girl&quot;, a film which also became immensely popular in China. He authored &quot;On the Art of the Cinema&quot;. In 1978, on Kim&#x27;s orders South Korean film director Shin Sang-ok and his actress wife Choi Eun-hee were kidnapped in order to build a North Korean film industry. He supervised all of their films from thereupon until Shin and Choi escaped North Korean control in 1986. The last of these movies was the 1985 &quot;Godzilla&quot;-inspired epic &quot;Pulgasari&quot;, which Kim considered a masterpiece. In 2006, he was involved in the production of the Juche-based movie &quot;The Schoolgirl&#x27;s Diary&quot;, which depicted the life of a young girl whose parents are scientists, with a KCNA news report stating that Kim &quot;improved its script and guided its production&quot;.

Although Kim enjoyed many foreign forms of entertainment, according to former bodyguard Lee Young Kuk, he refused to consume any food or drink not produced in North Korea, with the exception of wine from France. His former chef Kenji Fujimoto, however, has stated that Kim sometimes sent him around the world to purchase a variety of foreign delicacies.

Kim reportedly enjoyed basketball. Former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended her summit with Kim by presenting him with a basketball signed by NBA legend Michael Jordan. His official biography also claims that Kim composed six operas and enjoyed staging elaborate musicals.
United States Special Envoy for the Korean Peace Talks, Charles Kartman, who was involved in the 2000 Madeleine Albright summit with Kim, characterised Kim as a reasonable man in negotiations, to the point, but with a sense of humor and personally attentive to the people he was hosting. However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim&#x27;s antisocial features, such as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to make negotiations extraordinarily difficult.

The field of psychology has long been fascinated with the personality assessment of dictators, a notion that resulted in an extensive personality evaluation of Kim. The report, compiled by Frederick L. Coolidge and Daniel L. Segal (with the assistance of a South Korean psychiatrist considered an expert on Kim&#x27;s behavior), concluded that the &quot;big six&quot; group of personality disorders shared by dictators Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Saddam Hussein (sadistic, paranoid, antisocial, narcissistic, schizoid and schizotypal) were also shared by Kimcoinciding primarily with the profile of Saddam Hussein.

The evaluation found that Kim appeared to pride himself on North Korea&#x27;s independence, despite the extreme hardships it appears to place on the North Korean peoplean attribute appearing to emanate from his antisocial personality pattern.

Defectors claimed that Kim had 17 different palaces and residences all over North Korea, including a private resort near Baekdu Mountain, a seaside lodge in the city of Wonsan, and Ryongsong Residence, a palace complex northeast of Pyongyang surrounded with multiple fence lines, bunkers and anti-aircraft batteries.

=== Finances ===
According to a 2010 report in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Kim had 4billion USD on deposit in European banks in case he ever needed to flee North Korea. The &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that most of the money was in banks in Luxembourg.

In 2000, it was reported that the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea Publishing House has published at least 120 works by Kim. In 2009, KCNA put the numbers as follows:

In his teens and university years, Kim had written poems. He also wrote song lyrics. His first major literary work was &quot;On the Art of the Cinema&quot; in 1973.

<doc id="154101" wikidata="Q2359154" url="?curid=154101" title="I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)">
<text>&quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot; is a pop song (originally known as &quot;True Love and Apple Pie&quot;) by British hit songwriters Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, and sung by Susan Shirley.

The lyrics were rewritten by the songwriters—together with US advertising executive Bill Backer and US songwriter Billy Davis—as a jingle for The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s advertising agency, McCann Erickson, to become &quot;Buy the World a Coke&quot; in the 1971 &quot;Hilltop&quot; television commercial for Coca-Cola and sung by the Hillside Singers. &quot;Buy the World a Coke&quot; was produced by Billy Davis and portrayed a positive message of hope and love, featuring a multicultural collection of teenagers on top of a hill appearing to sing the song.

The popularity of the jingle led to its being re-recorded in two versions: one by The New Seekers and another by The Hillside Singers (as a full-length song) that dropped references to Coca-Cola. The song became a hit record in the US and the UK.

==Origins==
The idea originally came to Bill Backer, an advertising executive working for McCann Erickson, the agency responsible for Coca-Cola. Backer, Roger Cook and Billy Davis were delayed at Shannon Airport in Ireland. After a forced layover with many hot tempers, they noticed their fellow travelers the next morning were talking and joking while drinking Coca-Cola. Backer wrote the line &quot;I&#x27;d like to buy the world a Coke&quot; on a napkin and shared it with Cook and Roger Greenaway.

The melody was derived from a previous song by Cook and Greenaway, originally called &quot;True Love and Apple Pie,&quot; that was recorded in 1971 by Susan Shirley. Cook, Greenaway, Backer and Billy Davis reworked the song into a Coca-Cola radio jingle, which was performed by British pop group The New Seekers and recorded at Trident Studios in London. The radio jingle made its debut in February 1971 before being adapted for the Coca-Cola &quot;Hilltop&quot; television commercial later that year.

The commercial ended with the statement:

The song became so popular that its creators revised it, adding three verses and removing product references to create a full-length song appropriate for commercial release. The full-length song was re-recorded by both The Hillside Singers and The New Seekers and both versions became huge hits.

==TV commercial==

===Lyrics===
&quot;Buy the World a Coke&quot; contains the line &quot;I&#x27;d like to buy the world a Coke&quot; and repeats &quot;It&#x27;s the real thing&quot;, which was Coca-Cola&#x27;s marketing slogan. The Coca-Cola Company introduced that slogan in October 1969.

===Versions as an ad===
Several versions of the ad have been made.
* The song first aired on American radio on February 12, 1971, but not all of the Coca-Cola bottlers were impressed. DJs reported that they were receiving requests to hear the commercial. Backer persuaded McCann-Erickson to film a commercial using the song. The TV commercial, titled &quot;Hilltop&quot;, was directed by Roberto Malenotti. The ad cost $250,000 ($ million today), then the most expensive commercial in history. The first attempt at shooting was ruined by rain and other location problems. The finished product, first aired in July 1971, featured a multicultural group of young people lip synching the song on a hill in the municipality of Manziana outside Rome, Italy. The first woman seen was Linda Neary, who was working as a governor in Rome and accepted the job two days before shooting began, although she never met most of the other young people in commercial. The global unity of the singers is emphasized by showing that the bottles of Coke they are holding are labelled in a variety of languages.
* A Christmas-themed version of the ad debuted in 1977, referred to as &quot;Candles&quot; as distinguished from the &quot;Hilltop&quot; campaign. Instead of standing still while holding bottles of Coca-Cola, young people now held candles and rocked rhythmically while seated on a hillside. It was set after dark to emphasize the points of light. The pop instrumental backing was replaced with a glockenspiel and sleigh bells. By the end, the camera pulled back to an overhead view of the candles to reveal an overall shape of a lit Christmas tree.
* In 1987, a commercial aired which was based on a similar theme of togetherness. It was filmed at St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool, but featured a different song called &quot;I Am the Future of the World&quot; and sung by Wendy Maguire.
* In 1990, a follow-up to this commercial, called &quot;Hilltop Reunion&quot; and directed by Jeff Lovinger, aired during coverage of Super Bowl XXIV. It featured the original cast members, including Linda Neary (now middle-aged adults), now joined by their children, and culminated in a medley of this song and the current &quot;Can&#x27;t Beat the Real Thing&quot; jingle.
* G. Love remade the song for the Coca-Cola Zero commercial &quot;Everybody Chill&quot;, which aired in 2005.
* In 2006, the song was used again in a Coca-Cola commercial in the Netherlands, performed by Dutch singer Berget Lewis.
* In 2010, Coca-Cola once again used the song in a television commercial featuring the entire line of its sponsored NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers. The commercial included the drivers singing the song while driving in a race.
* In 2011, information on how many dollars it would take &quot;to buy the world a Coke&quot; was given in a commercial featuring the red silhouette of a Coke bottle and the melody of the song.
* In 2012, as part of the Google&#x27;s Project Re:Brief campaign, the &quot;Hilltop&quot; ad was reimagined for the digital age. Via the web, people were able to &quot;send&quot; a Coke to special vending machines located around the globe. Recipients of the Coke could then record a thank-you message to send back to the sender. Machines were located in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Cape Town (South Africa), Mountain View (California, United States), and New York City (New York, United States).
* In 2015, a public service announcement was made by Center for Science in the Public Interest about the consequences of excessive soda consumption and contained an altered version of the song. The advert featured hospital doctors and dentists and patients struggling with obesity-induced diseases (type 2 diabetes, hypertension and tooth decay). Near the end, it showed Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Mountain Dew in beverage cups named &quot;Obesity&quot;, &quot;Diabetes Type Two&quot; and &quot;Tooth Decay&quot; in the respective typefaces being poured away. The campaign was named &quot;Change the Tune&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Campaign&quot; magazine called it &quot;one of the best-loved and most influential ads in TV history&quot;. It served as a milestone—the first instance of the recording industry&#x27;s involvement with advertising.

Marketing analysts have noted Coca-Cola&#x27;s strategy of marrying the idea of happiness and universal love of the product illustrated by the song.

The commercial has continued receiving accolades; in 2000, Channel 4 and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ranked the advertising jingle 16th in the 100 Greatest TV Ads while in 2005, ITV ranked the advertisement 10th in its list of the greatest advertisements.

===The Hillside Singers===
After the TV commercial aired, radio stations began to get calls from people who liked it. Billy Davis&#x27; friends in radio suggested he record the song, but not as an advertising jingle. It became so popular that the song was rewritten without brand name references and expanded to three verses. Davis recruited a group of studio singers to take it on because The New Seekers did not have time to record it. The studio group named themselves The Hillside Singers to identify with the ad, and within two weeks the song was on the national charts. The Hillside Singers&#x27; version reached #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, #5 on Billboard&#x27;s Easy Listening chart and #58 on the RPM charts in Canada. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked this version as the No. 97 song for 1972.

===The New Seekers===
The New Seekers later recorded the song and sold 96,000 copies of their record in one day, eventually selling 12 million total. &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot; climbed to #1 in the UK, #3 in Canada and #7 in the US in 1971 and 1972. The song became a gold record in the US and has also sold over a million copies in the UK. The Coca-Cola Company waived royalties to the song and instead donated $80,000 in payments to UNICEF. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked this version as the No. 93 song for 1972.

==Covers and inspiration for other music==
* The British rock band Oasis was sued after their recording &quot;Shakermaker&quot; borrowed its melody and some lyrics directly; they were forced to change their composition as a result.
* Oasis tribute band No Way Sis released a cover of the song that entered the British charts at #27 in 1996.
* In 1997, the rock band Smash Mouth inserted a reference to the song in early lines of their first major single &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sun&quot;.
* A version of the song was included in the &quot;Kidsongs&quot; video of the same name.
* A cover of the song was featured on the &quot;VeggieTales&quot; album &quot;Bob and Larry Sing the 70&#x27;s&quot;.
* In 2016, Lucy Layton (daughter of New Seekers singer and bassist Paul Layton) released a cover of the song. Her official video, posted to YouTube on September 23, depicted the violence faced by Syrian refugees, with the visuals of war being in stark contrast to the song&#x27;s message of peace and harmony.
* In 2018, China promoted its Belt and Road Initiative with a video of a song called &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Build the World a Road&quot; based on the lyrics, melody, and imagery of Coke&#x27;s &quot;Hilltop&quot; ad and song.

==In popular culture==

The commercial was used as the final scene (minus the &quot;It&#x27;s the real thing&quot; statement at the end) in the &quot;Mad Men&quot; series finale &quot;Person to Person&quot;, which was set in November 1970 at an oceanside spiritual retreat in California. It is implied that the show&#x27;s fictional protagonist, Don Draper, was behind the commercial&#x27;s creation.

A version of the song was used in the trailer for the Netflix series &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (adapted from the video game series of the same name).

The song was featured in the film Freddy Got Fingered during a scene in which Tom Green&#x27;s character wears a deer carcass.

The song was also featured in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; episode &quot;Vacation&quot;.

<text>The Special Boat Service (SBS) is the special forces unit of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. The SBS can trace its origins back to the Second World War when the Army Special Boat Section was formed in 1940. After the Second World War, the Royal Navy formed special forces with several name changes—Special Boat Company was adopted in 1951 and re-designated as the Special Boat Squadron in 1974—until on 28 July 1987 when the unit was renamed as the Special Boat Service after assuming responsibility for maritime counter-terrorism. Most of the operations conducted by the SBS are highly classified, and are rarely commented on by the British government or the Ministry of Defence, owing to their sensitive nature.

The Special Boat Service is the naval special forces unit of the United Kingdom Special Forces and is described as the sister unit of the British Army 22 Special Air Service Regiment (22 SAS), with both under the operational control of the Director Special Forces. In October 2001, full command of the SBS was transferred from the Commandant General Royal Marines to the Commander-in-Chief Fleet. On 18 November 2003, the SBS were given their own cap badge with the motto &quot;By Strength and Guile&quot;. SBS operators are mostly recruited from the Royal Marines Commandos.

==Role==
The principal roles of the SBS are Surveillance and Reconnaissance (SR), including information reporting and target acquisition; Offensive Action (OA), including the direction of air strikes, artillery and naval gunfire, designation for precision guided munitions, use of integral weapons and demolitions; and Support and Influence (SI), including overseas training tasks. The SBS also provides immediate response Military Counter Terrorism (CT) and Maritime Counter Terrorism (MCT) teams.

The operational capabilities of the SBS and the SAS are broadly similar. However, the SBS (being the principal Royal Navy contribution to UKSF) has the additional training and equipment required to lead in the maritime, amphibious and riverine environments. Both units come under the operational command of HQ Directorate of Special Forces (DSF) and undergo an identical selection process.

==History==
===Origin: Second World War===
Roger Courtney became a commando in mid-1940 and was sent to the Combined Training Centre at Achnacarry in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , an infantry landing ship anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain&#x27;s cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain and given command of twelve men as the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.

The unit, on the shores of Sannox, Isle of Arran, was initially named the Folboat Troop, after the type of folding canoe employed in raiding operations and then renamed No. 1 Special Boat Section in early 1941. One training exercise required SBS members to navigate folboats over 3 days and 3 nights from Ardrossan to Clachan, via the Isle of Kerrera, where they reconnoitred and sketched RAF Oban. Attached to Layforce, it moved to the Middle East. The unit worked with the 1st Submarine Flotilla based at Alexandria and did beach reconnaissance of Rhodes, evacuated troops left behind on Crete, and carried out a number of small-scale raids and other operations. In December 1941 Courtney returned to the United Kingdom where he formed No2 SBS, and No1 SBS became attached to the Special Air Service (SAS) as the Folboat Section. In June 1942 they took part in the Crete airfield raids. In September 1942 eight men of the SBS carried out Operation Anglo, a raid on two airfields on the island of Rhodes; all but two of the men were captured after carrying out their mission. Destroying three aircraft, a fuel dump and numerous buildings, the two uncaptured SBS men had to hide in the countryside for four days before they could reach the waiting submarine. After the Rhodes raid, the SBS was absorbed into the SAS due to the heavy casualties they had suffered.
The Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment (RMBPD) was formed on 6 July 1942, and based at Southsea, Portsmouth. The RMBPD was under the command of Royal Marines Major Herbert &#x27;Blondie&#x27; Hasler with Captain J. D. Stewart as second in command. The detachment consisted of 34 men and was based at Lumps Fort, and often exercised in the Portsmouth Harbour and patrolled the harbour boom at nights.

In April 1943, 1st SAS was divided, with 250 men from the SAS joining the Small Scale Raiding Force to form the Special Boat Squadron under the command of Major the Earl Jellicoe. They moved to Haifa and trained with the Greek Sacred Regiment for operations in the Aegean.

They later operated among the Dodecanese and Cyclades groups of islands in the Dodecanese Campaign and took part in the Battle of Leros and the Battle of Kos. They, with the Greek Sacred Band, took part in the successful Raid on Symi in July 1944 in which the entire German garrison was either killed or captured. In August 1944 they joined with the Long Range Desert Group in operations in the Adriatic, on the Peloponnese, in Albania, and, finally, in Istria. So effective were they that, by 1944, the 200–300 men of the SBS were holding down six German divisions.

Throughout the war, No.2 SBS did not use the Special Boat Squadron name but instead retained the name Special Boat Section. They accompanied US Major General Mark Clark ashore before the Operation Torch landings in October 1942 on Operation Flagpole. Later, one group, Z SBS, which was based in Algiers from March 1943, carried out the beach reconnaissance for the Salerno landings and a raid on Crete, before moving to Ceylon to work with the Special Operations Executives, Force 136 and later with Special Operations Australia. The rest of No. 2 SBS became part of South-East Asia Command&#x27;s Small Operations Group, operating on the Chindwin and Irrawaddy rivers, and in the Arakan, during the Burma campaign.

Although their roles always overlapped to some extent, the various canoe and boat units became more specialised from late 1942 onwards. The RMBPD focused on ship attack and harbour sabotage, the Special Boat Section and Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPP) undertook covert beach surveys, and the Special Boat Squadron engaged in raiding, sabotage and reconnaissance above the high-water mark.

===Post-war era===
In 1946, the SBS, whether of Commando or SAS parentage, was disbanded. The RMBPD was the only British Special Forces unit to survive the end of World War II intact, and one of three Special Service units to survive (the other two being the RM Commandos and the Parachute Regiment). In 1946, the RMBPD became the School of Combined Operations Beach and Boat Section (SCOBBS) at Fremington, Devon. Lt-Col &quot;Blondie&quot; Hasler RM became the adviser to SCOBBS and wrote the pamphlet &quot;General Notes on the Use of Special Parties&quot;. The basic SCOBBS course of fourteen weeks covered the range of skills of the wartime COPPS, SRU, SBS and Detachment 385. In October 1947 SCOBBS dropped the word School from its name and moved to RM Eastney to become the Small Raids Wing (SRW) of the Amphibious School, Royal Marines. The school&#x27;s Chief Instructor Norman Tailyour established the Royal Marines Special Boat Sections taking on the roles proposed in Hasler&#x27;s paper. Their first missions were in Palestine, involving ordnance removal, and limpet mine removal from ships in Haifa. The SBS went on to serve in the Korean War, deployed on operations along the North Korean coast, as well as operating behind enemy lines destroying lines of communication, installations and gathering intelligence. During the Korean War the SBS operated from submarines like their wartime predecessors.

In the early 1950s, NATO doctrine for the defence of Western Europe called for a rapid fall-back to the west bank of the Rhine River, a natural defensive barrier. Royal Navy Rhine Flotilla’s SBS detachment had the task of demolishing the bridges over the river as well as destroying the many river barges on the river. The SBS teams of a radio operator and two SBS swimmer-canoeists would then stay behind on the eastern side of the river providing reconnaissance and intelligence and to sabotage Warsaw Pact forces logistics. 2 SB Section, and later also the newly formed 3 SB Section, were part of the Rhine Squadron until around 1958 and took part in all major British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) exercises when they would be joined by 4 and 5 SB Section, formed from the Royal Marines Reserve.

In 1952, SBS teams were held at combat readiness in Egypt in case Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s revolution turned more violent than it did. The SBS were also allegedly operating in Cyprus during the emergency and on alert during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and coup against King Idris I of Libya (1959), but in the cases of Egypt and Libya, not seeing action. In 1961, SBS teams carried out reconnaissance missions during the Indonesian Confrontation (see Operation Claret). In the same year, Iraq threatened to invade Kuwait for the first time, and the SBS put a detachment at Bahrain. In 1972, the SBS came into prominence when members of a combined SBS and RAOC team parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean after a bomb threat on board the cruise liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. A thorough search of the ship found no evidence of any device drawing the conclusion that it was a hoax. The SBS conducted operations in Northern Ireland during The Troubles including with submarines. In January 1975, two SBS kayak teams were inserted from HMS &quot;Cachalot&quot; to conduct an anti gun running operation in the area between Torr Head and Garron.

===Special Boat Squadron===
In 1973, their name was changed to the Special Boat Squadron and in 1980 the SBS relinquished North Sea oil rig protection to Comacchio Company, Royal Marines. In 1982, after the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands, they deployed to South Georgia. The only losses to the SBS during the Falklands War occurred when the SBS and SAS were operating behind the lines and two members of the SBS were shot, one fatally, by an SAS patrol, who had mistaken them for Argentinians.

===Special Boat Service===
In 1987, they were renamed Special Boat Service, and became part of the United Kingdom Special Forces Group alongside the Special Air Service and 14 Intelligence Company. In the Gulf War, there was no amphibious role assigned to the SBS. An &quot;area of operations line&quot; was drawn down the middle of Iraq; the SAS would operate west of the line and the SBS to the east. As well as searching for mobile Scud missile launchers, the SBS&#x27;s assigned area contained a mass of fibre-optic cable that provided Iraq with intelligence; the location of the main junction of the network was 32 miles from Baghdad. On 22 January 1991, 36 SBS members were inserted by two Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron RAF into an area full of Iraqi ground and air forces as well as spies and nomads. The SBS team managed to avoid these and destroyed a 40-yard section of the cable with explosives, neutralising what was left of the Iraqi communication grid. The SBS also carried out one of its most high-profile operations when it liberated the British Embassy in Kuwait, abseiling from helicopters hovering above the embassy. They also carried out diversionary raids along the Kuwaiti coast which diverted a number of Iraqi troops away from the main thrust of the coalition buildup, to the SBS area of operations.

In September 1999, about 20 SBS members contributed to the Australian-led International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in East Timor. Together with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service they formed INTERFET&#x27;s special forces element, named Response Force. Response Force departed from Darwin by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and flew into Dili tasked with securing the airport, a seaport and a heli-port to enable regular forces to land and deploy. The SBS were filmed driving a Land Rover Defender out of a Hercules. Response Force was then used to perform a variety of tasks including direct action and special reconnaissance throughout East Timor. The British forces, including the SBS, withdrew in December 1999. Sergeant Mark Andrew Cox was awarded the Military Cross after his patrol came under fire from pro-Indonesian militia.

===21st century===
====Sierra Leone====
In September 2000, the SBS, integrated with the SAS, were involved in Operation Barras, a hostage rescue operation in Sierra Leone that successfully rescued five captured Royal Irish Regiment soldiers.

====Afghanistan====

In November 2001, C and M squadron SBS had an extensive role in the invasion of Afghanistan at the start of the War in Afghanistan, notably, members of M squadron, alongside members of SIS, were involved in the Battle of Tora Bora. The SBS was integrated directly into Task Force Sword – a Black unit, under direct command of JSOC, this was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was capturing or killing senior leadership and High-value targets within al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Troops from C squadron (reinforced by teams from X and Z squadron, with at least one SEAL attached to them) were tasked with several missions, some with Abdul Rashid Dostum&#x27;s Northern Alliance forces at Mazar-e-Sharif. On 10 November, C squadron inserted into the recently captured Bagram Airbase, which caused an immediate political quandary with the Northern Alliance leadership which claimed that the British had failed to consult them on it before the deployment, in addition to fighting with Dostum&#x27;s forces, they worked alongside TF Sword in Shah-i-Kot Valley. Members of M squadron SBS, were involved in a prison revolt during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, members of the SBS along with US and Northern Alliance troops eventually quelled the uprising, however during one close air support mission, a misdirected JDAM bomb wounded four SBS personnel to various degrees. In appreciation for the SBS contribution to the battle, the CIA attempted to recognise the personnel with US decorations, but due to military and political bureaucracy, the decorations were never awarded. The SBS continued to work with Task Force Sword and the CIA.

In Spring 2005, the Director of Special Forces re-balanced British special forces deployments so that Afghanistan would be the responsibility of the SBS and Iraq would be the 22 SAS Regiment&#x27;s. In Spring 2006, the British military deployed over 4,000 troops to southern Afghanistan and the SBS were assigned to take the lead in supporting the deployment. The SBS were part of Task Force 42 the British contingent in the Joint Special Forces command; their deployment with other British special forces units was codenamed Operation Kindle (similar to the SAS and other British SF deployment in Iraq, known as Operation Crichton); the SBS carried out missions all over southern Afghanistan with AgustaWestland Apache helicopters. Along with training and mentoring Afghan Provincial Response Companies, Afghan police tactical units the operated jointly with Coalition SOF, TF 42 conducted operations in direct support of the British Battle Group deployed in Helmand Province and for ISAF SOF Command and operations directly for the Americans in pursuit of high-value targets. The main objective of the SBS (and later on other British special forces units with Afghan forces) was targeting Taliban leaders and drug barons using &quot;Carrot and stick&quot; tactics. On 27 June 2006, a 16-man unit from C Squadron and members of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) carried out Operation Ilois: an operation that silently captured four Taliban leaders in compounds on the outskirts of Sangin, Helmand province. As they returned to their Land Rover vehicles, they were ambushed by an estimated 60–70 Taliban insurgents, with one vehicle disabled by RPG fire, the team took cover in an irrigation ditch and requested assistance while holding off the Taliban force. The Helmand Battle Group had not been informed of the operation until it went wrong; a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) made up of a platoon of Gurkhas responded but ran into another insurgent ambush; one SBS member was seriously injured in the ambush. After an hour-long gunfight (some sources say three hours), Apache attack helicopters, the Gurkha QRF and the 16-man unit, supported by a US A-10 Thunderbolt and two Harrier GR7s managed to break contact and return to the closest FOB; two of the four Taliban leaders were killed in the firefight while the other two escaped in the chaos. Upon reaching the FOB it was discovered that Captain David Patton, SRR, and Sergeant Paul Bartlett, SBS were missing—one was helping wounded out of a vehicle when he was shot and assumed killed, and the other went missing during the firefight. An RAF Chinook carrying a company from the Parachute Regiment took off to find them, a pair of Apaches spotted the bodies and the Paras recovered them. One SBS member was awarded the MC for his actions in the ambush.

On 12 May 2007, an SBS team killed the Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah after JSOC and the ISA tracked him to a compound—where his associates were meeting—near Bahram Chah, Helmand province. The ISA confirmed he was there and an SBS reconnaissance element carried out reconnaissance of the compound which showed that Dadullah was protected by 20 insurgents. That night, with the ISA monitoring the target, the majority of C Squadron were inserted by RAF Chinook HC.2 helicopters while Apache helicopters provided cover. The troops stormed the compound and an hour long firefight took place as small groups of Taliban were hunted down and killed. Four SBS personnel were wounded (one seriously). Eventually Dadullah was shot in the chest and head, a brief site exploitation was conducted and the assault force was picked up by helicopter. On 29 July 2007, members of the SBS were carrying out a special mission in Nimruz when they were involved in a firefight with Taliban insurgents, Lance Corporal Michael Jones was killed and three other members were wounded. On 24 September 2007, members of C squadron SBS and the Italian SOF unit Col Moschin rescued two Italian intelligence agents who were kidnapped two days before by the Taliban in Herat province near Farah. Col Moschin parachuted onto a drop zone and marched overnight to surround the target compound, while the SBS were standing by in Lynx and Chinook helicopters to provide cut off groups in case the insurgents attempted to escape. A US Predator drone also supported the British and Italians. The insurgents brought the hostages out of the compound and loaded them into vehicles before the Italians were in position to rescue them, but the SBS closed in on the vehicles: aerial snipers using M82A1 anti-materiel rifles forced the vehicles to stop. A Chinook dropped off more than a dozen SBS personnel who engaged the Taliban who were disembarking the vehicles. Eight Taliban insurgents were killed and the hostages were rescued, although one died of gunshot wounds.

On 18 February 2008, Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Matin and one of his sub-commanders, Mullah Karim Agha, along with several bodyguards were travelling through the desert near Gereshk, Helmand province on motorbikes when they were ambushed and killed by an SBS unit dropped into his path by helicopter. In February 2009, members of the SBS took part in Operation Diesel, which resulted in the seizure of £50 million of heroin and the killing of at least 20 Taliban insurgents. On 29 August 2009, Sergeant Lee Houltram of the SBS was killed by an IED during a Special Forces operation to destroy a bomb factory near Gereshk in Helmand province. On 9 September 2009, an SBS team supported by the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) rescued &quot;Times&quot; journalist Stephen Farrell from a Taliban safe house in Char Dara District, Kunduz Province after he and his Afghan interpreter had been captured by the Taliban while reporting on the Kunduz airstrike. The British special forces were forced to act when intercepted communications of the Taliban leader showed them discussing moving the hostages into Pakistan. They were inserted before dawn by 160th SOAR helicopters directly onto the target building. While the SFSG set up a cordon, the Afghan interpreter was accidentally shot and killed, and two civilians were killed by an explosive breaching charge on the compound. Although an SFSG soldier was killed, Farrell was successfully rescued. On 1 July 2010 during an operation against insurgents in Haji Wakil, Helmand Province, Corporal Seth Stephens of the SBS was killed during a heavy firefight while clearing a compound, as a result of his actions during that operation, he was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross.

On 15 April 2012, during the Taliban attack on Kabul, SBS members cleared Taliban militants from a central location overlooking foreign embassies. A heavily armed insurgent suicide squad occupied a six-storey, half-built tower block, and began firing small arms and RPGs on nearby buildings including the British and German embassies. SBS and Afghan troops fought a close quarters battle for eight-and-a-half hours to eventually clear the militants from the structure. The mission to end the siege is thought to have been one of the most decorated actions of Britain&#x27;s involvement in Afghanistan, with several gallantry awards given to the participants. A combat assault dog, a Belgian Malinois known as Mali, received the Dickin Medal for his actions during the battle. Despite being badly injured by grenade shrapnel, Mali stayed by the side of his handler and continued to find safe routes for the British and Afghan troops as they fought their way up the tower floor-by-floor, preventing the operators from suffering major casualties. On 23 December 2013, Captain Richard Holloway was serving with the SBS when he was killed by Taliban small arms fire while conducting an operation to suppress the Taliban in a joint SBS-Afghan forces raid (with air support) on Taliban insurgents in a valley east of Kabul ahead of the Afghanistan elections.

====Iraq====
In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, M Squadron deployed to Jordan as Task Force 7, which was part of Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force - West (CJSOTF-West) and were earmarked for a heliborne assault on several Iraqi oil facilities that had their own desert airstrips that once captured would be used for special operations forces&#x27; staging areas. In northern Iraq in early March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron mounted on Honda All-terrain vehicles inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first mission was to conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a US McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen&#x27;s &#x27;noses&#x27;.

M Squadron launched a second operation at full strength (&quot;Zero Six Bravo&quot;) in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 Air Base, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days while unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a T-72, the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so the troops mined the vehicles and abandoned them—though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 personnel on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft could not identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes—although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by an RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.

M Squadron also had a 3-month tour in early 2003. Corporal Ian Plank, an SBS member attached to the SAS was killed by Iraqi insurgents during a house-to-house search for a wanted high-ranking Islamist terrorist in an insurgent compound in Ramadi on 31 October 2003, he was the first UKSF combat casualty of the Iraq War. The SBS was also very active as part of Task Force Black, C squadron deployed to Baghdad as part of the task force in 2004, in its four-month deployment it mounted 22 raids. On 23 July 2005, M squadron, supported by troops from the SAS and US forces carried out Operation Marlborough, killing three members of AQI.

====Libya====
On 27 February 2011, during the First Libyan Civil War, the BBC reported that C Squadron assisted in the evacuation of 150 oil workers in three flights by RAF C-130 Hercules from an airfield near Zella to Valletta in Malta.

====Nigeria====

On 8 March 2012, a small SBS team attempted to rescue two hostages, Chris McManus (British) and Franco Lamolinara (Italian), who were being held in Nigeria by members of the Boko Haram terrorist organisation that was loyal to al-Qaeda. The two hostages were killed by their captors before or during the rescue attempt. All the hostage takers were reportedly killed.

====United Kingdom====
On 21 December 2018, SBS personnel resolved a situation by storming the container ship &quot;Grande Tema&quot; where four stowaways hijacked the ship, demanding to enter the UK.

On 25 October 2020, SBS personnel stormed the oil tanker &quot;Nave Andromeda&quot; south-east of the Isle of Wight. The vessel was suspected to have been hijacked by seven Nigerian stowaways seeking asylum in Britain, who were later handed over to Hampshire Police.

==Present day==
===Organisation===

The Ministry of Defence does not comment on special forces matters, and there is consequently little verifiable information in the public domain. The SBS is under the Operational Command of Director Special Forces and is based in Hamworthy barracks, Poole, Dorset.

According to military sources in 2020, the SBS numbers about a couple of hundred personnel. Members are on standby at all times. While women have been eligible to join since 2018, there is no official information on women serving on the frontline.

In 1987, when renamed the Special Boat Service, the SBS was also reformed along SAS lines, with 16-person troops (each equivalent to a platoon) instead of the traditional sections.
About 200–250 commandos make up the SBS at any one time, and once qualified, personnel are known as &quot;Swimmer Canoeists&quot;. They are experts in swimming, diving, parachuting, navigation, demolition and reconnaissance.

Since the SBS joined the UKSF Group in the 1980s, it has been restructured. Instead of one squadron being tasked with a permanent role the unit adopted the same system of squadron rotation as the SAS. Each Squadron rotates through counter terrorism duties and conventional operations and tasking. For example, in December 2001 C squadron was on MCT Role, and was called in to intercept the MV Nisha while M and Z Squadron were deployed in Afghanistan.

The SBS Reserve (SBS(R)) provides individual reservists to augment the regular SBS. Recruits need to be serving members of UK reserve forces and a high level of commitment is required. The SBS(R) is based at various locations throughout the United Kingdom, but training is carried out in the South of England.

===Structure===

The structure of the SBS is as follows:
* C Squadron
* M Squadron
** HQ Troop, 4 Troop, 5 Troop, 6 Troop
* X Squadron
* Z Squadron
* SBS(R) R Squadron

The SBS has a subunit dedicated to operating Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) known as the SDV Troop.

==Equipment==

In 2019, the SDV Troop operated three Mk8 Mod 1 SDVs, with an order to replace them with three new Mk11 SWCS SDVs. An SDV can be housed in an Astute-class submarine&#x27;s dry deck shelter. SBS members are provided with assistance by Fleet Diving Group divers when using dry deck shelters.

Fast Insertion/Interceptor Craft (FIC) are also in use with the SBS. They have a reported maximum speed of up to 55 knots and the hull features a highly stealthy design and advanced &#x27;wave piercing&#x27; qualities. They are similar to the American Mark V Special Operations Craft. The SBS use Klepper Aerius folding canoes, Rigid Raiders, Avon Searider Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIBs), and Dräger LAR-V rebreathers.

==Recruitment, selection and training==

===Pre-selection aptitude test===

Before progressing to joint UKSF selection, SBS aspirants must pass a 2-week aptitude test, which involves the following:
* Boating phase (1 week)
** Combat fitness test
** SBS swimming test
*** Swim 600 metres in 15 minutes
*** Swim 50 metres clothed with a weapon and belt
*** Swim 25 metres underwater while holding your breath
** Multiple canoe trials including:
*** Carrying a folding canoe and fully loaded bergen for 
*** canoe paddle
* Diving phase (1 week)
** Complete a number of dives with confidence and willingness
** Learn and demonstrate diving drills with sufficient quality

===UKSF selection===

SBS candidates take part in Joint Special Forces Selection alongside SAS candidates, with their selection and training diverging after the end of the JSFS course. JSFS lasts ≈ 6 months. It is broken down into multiple phases, including cross-country marches in the aptitude phase and teaching and testing soldiering skills in the jungle phase. It also involves training in other fields, such escape and evasion and resistance to interrogation (RTI).

Originally, the SBS had its own independent end-to-end selection programme to qualify as a Swimmer Canoeist, but its selection course was integrated into the joint UKSF selection course with candidates for the SAS. In the past, the SBS was staffed almost entirely by the Royal Marines. Today, all members of His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces can be considered for special forces selection. Approximately 40% of all UK Special Forces are recruited from the Royal Marines.

There are two selection courses each year: one in Winter and the other in Summer. Candidates wishing to serve with the Special Boat Service must have completed at least two years regular service and are only accepted into the SBS after completion of the selection process.

====SC3 course====

After passing joint UKSF selection, at which point SAS aspirants have passed, SBS aspirants continue to the Swimmer Canoeist, Third Class (SC3) course, sometimes called the boating and diving course. It lasts eight weeks and covers specialist maritime skills such as canoeing, diving, boating, underwater navigation and demolition, negotiating surf zones, and submarine infiltration. The course includes a course in a canoe. After passing the SC3 course, SBS aspirants have passed selection as a whole and join an operational troop on probation. As SBS marines grow in experience and rank, they take the more advanced SC2 and then SC1 courses.

===Reserve selection===
For SBS(R) selection, only candidates with previous military experience are eligible to enlist. Training is carried out in the South of England and candidates are required to complete the following tests over the four-day initial selection course:
* Combat Fitness Test (CFT) – carrying within 1 hour 50 minutes.
* Swim test – using any stroke in uniform and retrieve an object from .
* Gym tests.
* Advanced CFT 1 – carrying .
* Advanced CFT 2 – carrying .

<text>The Spivak pronouns are a set of gender-neutral pronouns in English promoted on the virtual community &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; based on pronouns used in a book by American mathematician Michael Spivak. Though not in widespread use, they have been employed in writing for gender-neutral language by those who wish to avoid the standard terms &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, or singular &quot;they&quot;.

== History ==
The precise history of the Spivak pronouns is unclear, since they appear to have been independently created multiple times.

The first recorded use of the pronouns was in a January 1890 editorial by James Rogers, who derives &quot;e&quot;, &quot;es&quot;, and &quot;em&quot; from &quot;he&quot; and &quot;them&quot; in response to the proposed &quot;thon&quot;. Coincidentally, Scottish author David Lindsay used the similar forms &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;aer&quot; in his novel &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot;, to refer to non-terrestrial beings &quot;unmistakably of a third positive sex&quot;.

In 1975, Christine M. Elverson of Skokie, Illinois, won a contest by the Chicago Association of Business Communicators to find replacements for &quot;she and he&quot;, &quot;him and her&quot;, and &quot;his and hers&quot;. Her pronouns &quot;ey&quot;, &quot;em&quot;, and &quot;eir&quot; were formed by dropping the &quot;th&quot; from &quot;they&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, and &quot;their&quot;. (See .) The article that first reported the pronouns treated them as something of a joke, concluding with the line, &quot;A contestant from California entered the word &#x27;uh&#x27; because &#x27;if it isn&#x27;t a he or a she, it&#x27;s uh, something else.&#x27; So much of eir humor.&quot;

Writing in 1977, poet, playwright, and linguist Lillian Carlton submitted a letter to the journal &quot;American Speech&quot; reporting (and arguing against) the invention by &quot;an American professor&quot; (likely Donald MacKay) of pronouns based on &quot;the long sound of the vowel e i&quot;. Although her primary argument against the proposed word is her assertion that English &quot;already [has] a perfectly good... word that refers to either sex&quot;, namely &quot;one&quot;, she also raises the observations that &quot;spoken fast, it comes uncomfortably close to the illiterate hisself... [Furthermore], &quot;ee&quot; sounds too much like &quot;he&quot; and would therefore be confusing.&quot; Similar arguments, along with the desire to distance themselves from the male-centric singular &quot;he&quot; and derivatives, are still a primary factor in the proliferation of constructed pronouns.

Also in 1977, Jeffery J. Smith, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy and Humanities at Stanford University, writing under the pen name &quot;Tintajl jefry&quot;, proposed &quot;Em&quot; as &quot;a personal noun-pronoun which in itself gives no indication of sex, age, or number, though these may be shown by its context.&quot; He proposes a vast number of possible uses for &quot;em&quot;, including but not limited to the replacement of &quot;the formal Dear, because em is a thou word, a term of respect for all people, bar none... Dear Em Doe is redundant. Em Doe is enough, and, since it is brief; it makes room for given names: Em John Doe, Em Mary and John Doe, or, better, Em Doe John, Em Doe John and Mary.&quot;

The May 1980 issue of &quot;American Psychologist&quot; reported on another study by MacKay, testing rates at which subjects miscomprehended the gender of a subject in textbook paragraphs when written with &quot;he&quot; meaning &quot;he or she&quot; compared with three epicene pronoun sets: &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;Es&quot;, &quot;Eself&quot;; &quot;e&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;es&quot;, &quot;eself&quot;; and &quot;tey&quot;, &quot;tem&quot;, &quot;ter&quot;, &quot;temself&quot;.

In 1983, mathematician Michael Spivak wrote the AMS-TeX manual &quot;The Joy of TEX: A Gourmet Guide to Typesetting with the AMS-TEX Macro Package &quot; (1986) using &quot;E&quot;, &quot;Em&quot;, and &quot;Eir&quot;. His set was similar to Elverson&#x27;s, but capitalized like one of MacKay&#x27;s sets.

In May 1991, a MOO programmer, Roger Crew, added &quot;spivak&quot; as a gender setting for players on LambdaMOO, causing the game to refer to such players with the pronouns &quot;e&quot;, &quot;em&quot;, &quot;eir&quot;, &quot;eirs&quot;, &quot;emself&quot;. The setting was added along with several other &quot;fake genders&quot; in order to test changes to the software&#x27;s pronoun code, and was left in place as a novelty. To Crew&#x27;s surprise, the Spivak setting caught on among the game&#x27;s players, while the other gender settings were mostly ignored.

Other writers applied Elverson&#x27;s original &quot;th&quot;-dropping rule and revived &quot;ey&quot;, such as Eric Klein in his legal code for a planned micronation called Oceania. John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Gender-neutral Pronoun FAQ&quot; (2004) promoted the original Elverson set (via Klein) as preferable to other major contenders popular on Usenet (singular &quot;they&quot;, &quot;sie&quot;/&quot;hir&quot;/&quot;hir&quot;/&quot;hirs&quot;/&quot;hirself&quot;, and &quot;zie&quot;/&quot;zir&quot;/&quot;zir&quot;/&quot;zirs&quot;/&quot;zirself&quot;).

== Variations ==
Three variants of the Spivak pronouns are in use, Rogers (1890), Elverson (1975), and LambdaMOO (1991), highlighted in the declension table below. The pronoun set used by Lindsay (1920) is also in use, although generally not in the context of Spivak pronouns.

The original &quot;ey&quot; has been argued to be preferable to &quot;e&quot;, because the latter would be pronounced the same as &quot;he&quot; in those contexts where &quot;he, him, his&quot; loses its h sound.

== Usage ==
Spivak is one of the allowable genders on many multi-user dungeons (MUDs) and MOOs (MUD object-oriented). Others might include some selection of: masculine, feminine, neuter, either, both, &quot;splat&quot;, plural, egotistical, royal, and second. The selected gender determines how the game engine refers to a player.

On LambdaMOO, they became standard practice for help texts (&quot;The user may choose any description e likes&quot;), referring to people of unknown gender (&quot;Who was that guest yesterday, eir typing was terrible&quot;), referring to people whose gender was known but without disclosing it (&quot;Yes I&#x27;ve met Squiggle. E was nice.&quot;), or of course characters declaring themselves to be of gender Spivak. Since 2000 this usage has been declining.

Nomic games, especially on the Internet, often use Spivak pronouns in their rulesets, as a way to refer to indefinite players.

===Spivak pronouns and gender in virtual communities===
In online anonymous situations, Spivak and other gender neutral pronouns can be motivated by avoiding gendered speech that would make divisions in the social group more likely and the group possibly less productive or enjoyable. This contact with genderless pronouns in virtual communities is sometimes a person&#x27;s first experience and experimentation with presenting their gender in a genderqueer or transgender manner.

<text>Philipsburg is a borough in Centre County, Pennsylvania. It is located at (40.895, -78.2193). It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania metropolitan statistical area. The borough&#x27;s population was 2,770 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.8 square mile (2.1 km2), all land. Major roads which pass through the area are U.S. Route 322 and PA Routes 53, 350, and 504.

==History==
===Indigenous Peoples===
The first inhabitants of the Philipsburg area came towards the end of the last glacial period. They lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle for thousands of years. The Seneca people were among the native inhabitants who began establishing settlements, farms, and trails throughout the surrounding valleys and water gaps. The Moshannon Creek, which flows along Philipsburg and makes up the border between Centre and Clearfield County, derives its name from the Seneca word Mos’hanna’unk, meaning &quot;elk river place&quot;.

A small group of Seneca would continue to live in the area up until the Cornplanter Tract was established. The Cornplanter Tract, was the only native reservation within the state of Pennsylvania, before being destroyed by the construction of the Kinzua Dam.

===Founding (1795-1864)===
From 1795 to 1796 Henry Philips purchased a larger tract of land covering parts of Centre, Clearfield, and Cambria County. He offered plots of land east of the Moshannon Creek to the first twelve settlers. In 1812 the first screw mill in the United States was built in Philipsburg. The village was established as a borough on the 29th of November, 1864.

===Flooding===
In 1936 the Cold Stream Dam broke, flooding much of downtown Philipsburg. The borough also flooded in 2018 and 2021.

===Historical landmarks===
Philipsburg is home to a number of sites of renovated historical interest, including the Rowland Theater (located on Front Street), the Union Church and Burial Ground, also known as the &quot;Mud&quot; Church, on Presqueisle Street, the Simler House (on North Second St), and the Hardman Philips House, located off Presqueisle Street near Ninth Street, thought to be a stop on the Underground Railroad. The Rowland Mansion on South Centre Street is the former home of U.S. Congressman Charles Hedding Rowland. The Philipsburg commercial district underwent a series of renovations including a $1 million street project to revitalize the main shopping district.

The Philipsburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

<text>Salzgitter (; Eastphalian: &quot;Soltgitter&quot;) is an independent city in southeast Lower Saxony, Germany, located between Hildesheim and Braunschweig. Together with Wolfsburg and Braunschweig, Salzgitter is one of the seven &quot;Oberzentren&quot; of Lower Saxony (roughly equivalent to a metropolitan area). With 101,079 inhabitants and (as of 31 December 2015), its area is the largest in Lower Saxony and one of the largest in Germany. Salzgitter originated as a conglomeration of several small towns and villages, and is today made up of 31 boroughs, which are relatively compact conurbations with wide stretches of open country between them. The main shopping street of the young city is in the borough of Lebenstedt, and the central business district is in the borough of Salzgitter-Bad. Over 70%(76,500) of the population lives within the urban aggomeration of Braunschweig but most of the area is within the urban agglomeration of Hildesheim. The city is part of two urban agglomeration, Hildesheim and Braunschweig, because of its uneven distribution of urban quarters. The city is connected to the Mittellandkanal and the Elbe Lateral Canal by a distributary. The nearest metropolises are Braunschweig, about to the northeast, and Hanover, about to the northwest. The population of the City of Salzgitter has exceeded 100,000 inhabitants since its foundation in 1942 (which made it a city () in contrast to a town () by the German definition), when it was still called &quot;Watenstedt-Salzgitter&quot;. Beside Wolfsburg, Leverkusen and Eisenhüttenstadt, Salzgitter is one of the few cities in Germany founded during the 20th century.

==Name==
Until 31 March 1942, &quot;Salzgitter&quot; was the name of a town where the borough Salzgitter-Bad now is. From then until 1951, &quot;Salzgitter&quot; was the name of a borough of the city Watenstedt-Salzgitter that existed at the time. In 1951, the borough Salzgitter was renamed Salzgitter-Bad; the name Salzgitter, having thus been freed up, became the new and more succinct name of the city that had been called &quot;Watenstedt-Salzgitter&quot; until then. (Nowadays, &quot;Salzgitter-Watenstedt&quot; is the name of a small borough with a few hundred inhabitants.)

==Geography==
Salzgitter is located in a wide dell coated with loess, between the Oderwald Forest and the Salzgitter-Höhenzug (&quot;Salzgitter Hills&quot;). The city stretches up to from north to south and up to from east to west. The highest point is the hill Hamberg (), located northwest of Salzgitter-Bad.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
The following cities, towns and municipalities, listed clockwise beginning in the northeast, border on the city of Salzgitter. (As Salzgitter was founded on the area of the district of Wolfenbüttel, that district borders on Salzgitter in the west and in the east and is therefore listed twice.)

==History==
===1300–1982===
Salzgitter originated in the beginning of the 14th century around salt springs near the village Verpstedt (later Vöppstedt). The name was derived from the neighbouring village Gitter (nowadays a city borough) as &quot;up dem solte to Gytere&quot;, which means &quot;salt near Gitter&quot;; the first mention was in 1347. After 200 years of salt production at various springs, the peasants in the area which is nowadays Salzgitter were chartered around 1350, but lost municipal law again when being transferred to the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in the beginning of the 16th century. Later, Salzgitter belonged to the diocese of Hildesheim. When the diocese was transferred to Prussia in 1803, the municipal law was reconfirmed, but taken away once more in 1815, when Salzgitter became part of the Kingdom of Hanover. In 1830, a brine bath was established in Salzgitter.

After the Kingdom of Hanover was transferred to Prussia in 1866, Salzgitter became a Prussian municipality, which was chartered again in 1929. Prior to that, the towns Vorsalz and Liebenhall had been incorporated (in 1926 and 1928, respectively). Salzgitter now belonged to the Landkreis (district) of Goslar and included, apart from Salzgitter itself, also some small settlements like Gittertor, which is nowadays part of Salzgitter-Bad. In 1936, Kniestedt was incorporated; it is also part of Salzgitter-Bad now.
Due to the large iron ore body in Salzgitter, which had been mentioned first in 1310, the National Socialists founded the &quot;Reichswerke Hermann Göring&quot; for ore mining and iron production in 1937. In order to facilitate an unobstructed development of the smelting works, a unique administration structure in the whole area was conceived. Therefore, it was decreed in the &quot;Order about the area settlement around the Hermann-Göring-Werke Salzgitter&quot;, effective from 1 April 1942, to form a unified city district (independent city). Towards this aim, the town of Salzgitter and the municipalities Beinum, Flachstöckheim, Groß-Mahner, Hohenrode, Ohlendorf and Ringelheim (7 in total, all belonging to the Landkreis Goslar) and Barum, Beddingen, Bleckenstedt, Bruchmachtersen, Calbecht, Drütte, Engelnstedt, Engerode, Gebhardshagen, Hallendorf, Heerte, Immendorf, Lebenstedt, Lesse, Lichtenberg, Lobmachtersen, Osterlinde, Reppner, Salder, Thiede-Steterburg (nowadays simply Thiede) and Watenstedt (21 in total, all belonging to the Landkreis Wolfenbüttel) were merged to form the &quot;Stadtkreis Watenstedt-Salzgitter&quot;. As the neighbouring municipality Gitter had already been incorporated in 1938, the young city initially comprised 29 boroughs in 1942. Together with the remainder of the district of Goslar, the new independent municipality was integrated into the Free State of Brunswick. In return, Braunschweig transferred the Landkreis Holzminden to the Prussian Province of Hanover. In October, 1942, the SS established the Drütte concentration camp, a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp, to provide slave labour for the Hermann Göring Works. This large subcamp held 2,800 inmates. There were three concentration camps located in Salzgitter. During the war, Salzgitter was severely damaged by several American and British bombings. After the war, the State of Braunschweig became part of the Land Lower Saxony, and Watenstedt-Salzgitter became an Independent City in the &quot;Administrative District of Braunschweig&quot; (later Regierungsbezirk Braunschweig).
In 1951, the city was renamed to &quot;Stadt Salzgitter&quot; (City of Salzgitter), while the borough Salzgitter was renamed to &quot;Salzgitter-Bad&quot;, referring to the brine bath there. In the course of the local administrative reform of Lower-Saxony effective from 1 March 1974, the municipalities Üfingen and Sauingen (formerly Landkreis Wolfenbüttel) were incorporated, increasing the number of boroughs to 31. Iron ore continued to be mined in Salzgitter until 1982; in the former mine &quot;Schacht Konrad&quot; (Konrad mine), an ultimate disposal place for radioactive waste has been planned since 1975.

===Modern history===
==Population development==
Population figures in order to the then area, i.e. until 1942 the contemporary quarter Salzgitter-Bad and from 1942 on the Independent City Watenstedt-Salzgitter and Salzgitter respectively. 76% of the population was developing near the City Braunschweig due to urbanization, closer proximity to a major city and other factors. Although a high concentration of the population lives near the larger City Braunschweig, most of the area is near the Hildesheim agglomeration or in other parts 
===Immigration===

The foreigner-born population is 37,048 (32.8% of the total population) in 2023. 46.3% of Salzgitter has a migration background and majority of the nations are Middle eastern or Eastern European countries. Salzgitter has the highest share of migrants to Germans in Lower Saxony. The areas with the highest percentage of migrants in Salzgitter are Steterburg with 57.5%, Seeviertel with 55.7%, Lebenstedt with 54%, Lichtenberg with 52.1%, Watenstedt with 48.4% and Bad with 46.4%. Majority of the migrants live within the Braunschweig urban agglomeration.

==Religions==
The area of the modern city of Salzgitter originally pertained to the diocese of Hildesheim. In 1568, the Reformation was established in Salzgitter, and two ecclesiastical superintendencies came into existence: the southern part of the area of the modern city, the Superintendency of Salzgitter, pertained to the Province of Hanover and thus ecclesiastically to the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover (and, within it, to the Consistory of Hildesheim); the northern part (the Superintendency of Lebenstedt), however, belonged to the Free State of Brunswick and therefore to the Evangelical Lutheran State Church in Brunswick.

When the city of Watenstedt-Salzgitter was created in 1942, the entire area was attached to the state of Brunswick both politically and ecclesiastically. Thus, all parishes of Salzgitter now belong to the Church of Brunswick. The two superintendencies are called &quot;Propstei&quot; (provostry) today, and both the &quot;Propsteien&quot; Salzgitter-Bad and Salzgitter-Lebenstedt comprise additional parishes which are not within the city of Salzgitter.

Roman Catholics who after the Reformation moved into the city belonged, as in the Middle Ages, to the diocese of Hildesheim, which established a separate deanery in Salzgitter. All Roman Catholic parishes of the city now pertain to that deanery.

Besides the two major denominations, there are congregations in Salzgitter which belong to free churches. These include a Baptist parish, the Church of God, Plymouth Brethren, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, as well as several New Apostolic Churches.

Due to the immigration of foreign workers during the 1970s, there are some Islamic mosques. According to calculations based on census data, Salzgitter in 2011 had the highest proportion of Muslim migrants of all major cities in Lower Saxony.

==Politics==
After the creation of Salzgitter a state commissar was set in place as provisional Mayer of the city of Watenstedt-Salzgitter. After World War II, the military government of the British zone of occupation installed the communal constitution of Britain. Furthermore, there is an elected Council in place. The Council elects one of its members to Mayor (German: &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;) as leader and representative of the city. Besides, since 1946 on there was the &quot;Oberstadtdirektor&quot; as the Chief Executive of the City Council. Since 2001, the office of the leader of the Council and the Chief Executive are merged into one, simply called Mayor. Being elected by the people, the Mayor represents the city and leads the Council.

==Coat of arms==

Salzgitter&#x27;s Coat of Arms consists of a silver furnace visible behind a silver pinnacle wall on which there is a buckler whose upper ground is green and adorned with two saltern instruments and whose lower ground is gold and adorned with a black sledge and black iron. On the red ground behind the furnace, there are two wheaten ears.

The Coat of Arms stands for the agriculture, which is important for many villages of Salzgitter, on the one hand, and for the industry, which led to Salzgitter&#x27;s foundation, on the other hand.

This Coat of Arms is from 1951. Before, Watenstedt-Salzgitter had got a different one. Also the former town Salzgitter had got various coats of arms from 1854 on.

Like many German cities, Salzgitter has used the city&#x27;s logo for some years. It is a green field with a white snaking way that narrows towards the horizon.

==Transport==

===Road===
In the north of Salzgitter, there is an Autobahn (A 39) from Braunschweig to the interchange Salzgitter (where it is possible change to Autobahn 7 Kassel-Hanover). Salzgitter has got five grade-separated interchanges to this Autobahn. East from Salzgitter, there is the Autobahn 395 (Braunschweig-Goslar), which can be reached from Salzgitter by four interchanges.
Moreover, two highways go through Salzgitter.

===Railway===
Salzgitter has six railway stations. The most important one is in the quarter Salzgitter-Ringelheim, the most central one in Salzgitter-Lebenstedt. There is no &quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot; (main railway station) in Salzgitter. Salzgitter-Ringelheim&#x27;s station is located on the Halle (Saale)-Goslar-Salzgitter-Hildesheim-Hanover line. Another line leads into the Harz Mountains and to Braunschweig, passing Salzgitter-Bad. Salzgitter-Lebenstedt is the end of a local line coming from Braunschweig and passing the other train stops of Salzgitter.

<text>Blue Swede () were a Swedish rock band fronted by Björn Skifs which was active between the years 1973–1979. Blue Swede released two albums of cover versions, including a rendition of &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;, which brought them international chart success. The band consisted of Anders Berglund (piano), Björn Skifs (lead vocals), Bosse Liljedahl (bass), Hinke Ekestubbe (saxophone), Jan Guldbäck (drums), Michael Areklew (guitar), and Tommy Berglund (trumpet). They disbanded after Skifs decided to embark on his solo career.

==Career==
Blue Swede was first formed in 1973, when Björn Skifs, a top vocalist in Sweden, was looking for a band to accompany him during his concerts.

The band was originally called &quot;Blåblus&quot; (Swedish for &quot;blue blouse&quot; [could be made out of denim], a pun on the word &quot;blues&quot;) and featured Skifs singing the lead vocals. The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1968 B. J. Thomas song &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;. Blue Swede recorded Thomas&#x27;s song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric Jonathan King, which created the &quot;ooga-chaka&quot; introduction. The producer at the recording sessions was Bengt Palmers. Blue Swede released &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached number one in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, where it reached a peak chart position of 26. To capitalize on the success of the song, Blue Swede released the album &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; that same year.

Throughout the rest of 1974, two follow-up singles from the same LP were released: &quot;Silly Milly&quot;, which peaked at position 71 in the U.S., and a cover of The Association&#x27;s &quot;Never My Love&quot;, which made the Top Ten by peaking at position 7. From the band&#x27;s 1974 follow-up album, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, they recorded a medley of &quot;Hush&quot; by Deep Purple and &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; by Tommy James and the Shondells (not The Hollies&#x27; song of the same name), peaking at position 61 in the U.S., and achieving its greatest chart success in Scandinavia. Skifs left the band in 1975 and the band continued as Blåblus, releasing a further two albums.

<doc id="154125" wikidata="Q154494" url="?curid=154125" title="Aktion T4">
<text> (German, ) was a campaign of mass murder by involuntary euthanasia which targeted people with disabilities in Nazi Germany. The term was first used in post-war trials against doctors who had been involved in the killings. The name T4 is an abbreviation of  4, a street address of the Chancellery department set up in early 1940, in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten, which recruited and paid personnel associated with Aktion T4. Certain German physicians were authorised to select patients &quot;deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination&quot; and then administer to them a &quot;mercy death&quot; (). In October 1939, Adolf Hitler signed a &quot;euthanasia note&quot;, backdated to 1 September 1939, which authorised his physician Karl Brandt and &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; Philipp Bouhler to begin the killing.

The killings took place from September 1939 until the end of World War II in Europe in 1945; from 275,000 to 300,000 people were killed in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and Austria, occupied Poland and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now the Czech Republic). The number of victims was originally recorded as 70,273 but this number has been increased by the discovery of victims listed in the archives of the former East Germany. About half of those killed were taken from church-run asylums, often with the approval of the Protestant or Catholic authorities of the institutions.

The Holy See announced on 2 December 1940 that the policy was contrary to divine law and that &quot;the direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed&quot; but the declaration was not upheld by all Catholic authorities in Germany. In the summer of 1941, protests were led in Germany by the bishop of Münster, Clemens von Galen, whose intervention led to &quot;the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich&quot;, according to Richard J. Evans.

Several reasons have been suggested for the killings, including eugenics, racial hygiene, and saving money. Physicians in German and Austrian asylums continued many of the practices of until the defeat of Germany in 1945, in spite of its official cessation in August 1941. The informal continuation of the policy led to 93,521 &quot;beds emptied&quot; by the end of 1941. Technology developed under , particularly the use of lethal gas on large numbers of people, was taken over by the medical division of the Reich Interior Ministry, along with the personnel of , who participated in mass murder of Jewish people. The programme was authorised by Hitler but the killings have since come to be viewed as murders in Germany. The number of people killed was about 200,000 in Germany and Austria, with about 100,000 victims in other European countries. Following the war, a number of the perpetrators were tried and convicted for murder and crimes against humanity.

==Background==
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the sterilisation of people carrying what were considered to be hereditary defects and in some cases those exhibiting what was thought to be hereditary &quot;antisocial&quot; behaviour, was a respectable field of medicine. Canada, Denmark, Switzerland and the US had passed laws enabling coerced sterilisation. Studies conducted in the 1920s ranked Germany as a country that was unusually reluctant to introduce sterilisation legislation. In his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1924), Hitler wrote that one day racial hygiene &quot;will appear as a deed greater than the most victorious wars of our present bourgeois era&quot;.

In July 1933, the &quot;Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring&quot; prescribed compulsory sterilisation for people with conditions thought to be hereditary, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, Huntington&#x27;s chorea and &quot;imbecility&quot;. Sterilisation was also legalised for chronic alcoholism and other forms of social deviance. The law was administered by the Interior Ministry under Wilhelm Frick through special Hereditary Health Courts (), which examined the inmates of nursing homes, asylums, prisons, aged-care homes and special schools, to select those to be sterilised. It is estimated that 360,000 people were sterilised under this law between 1933 and 1939.

The policy and research agenda of racial hygiene and eugenics were promoted by Emil Kraepelin. The eugenic sterilisation of persons diagnosed with (and viewed as predisposed to) schizophrenia was advocated by Eugen Bleuler, who presumed racial deterioration because of &quot;mental and physical cripples&quot; in his &quot;Textbook of Psychiatry&quot;,

Within the Nazi administration, the idea of including in the programme people with physical disabilities had to be expressed carefully, because the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, had a deformed right leg. After 1937, the acute shortage of labour in Germany arising from rearmament, meant that anyone capable of work was deemed to be &quot;useful&quot;, exempted from the law and the rate of sterilisation declined. The term is a post-war coining; contemporary German terms included (euthanasia) and (merciful death). The T4 programme stemmed from the Nazi Party policy of &quot;racial hygiene&quot;, a belief that the German people needed to be cleansed of racial enemies, which included anyone confined to a mental health facility and people with simple physical disabilities. New insulin shock treatments were used by German psychiatrists to find out if patients with schizophrenia were curable.

==Implementation==

Karl Brandt, doctor to Hitler and Hans Lammers, the head of the Reich Chancellery, testified after the war that Hitler had told them as early as 1933—when the sterilisation law was passed—that he favoured the killing of the incurably ill but recognised that public opinion would not accept this. In 1935, Hitler told the Leader of Reich Doctors, Gerhard Wagner, that the question could not be taken up in peacetime; &quot;Such a problem could be more smoothly and easily carried out in war&quot;. He wrote that he intended to &quot;radically solve&quot; the problem of the mental asylums in such an event. began with a &quot;trial&quot; case in late 1938. Hitler instructed Brandt to evaluate a petition sent by two parents for the &quot;mercy killing&quot; of their son who was blind and had physical and developmental disabilities. The child, born near Leipzig and eventually identified as Gerhard Kretschmar, was killed in July 1939. Hitler instructed Brandt to proceed in the same manner in all similar cases.

On 18 August 1939, three weeks after the killing of the boy, the &quot;Reich Committee for the Scientific Registering of Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses&quot; was established to register sick children or newborns identified as defective. The secret killing of infants began in 1939 and increased after the war started; by 1941, more than 5,000 children had been killed. Hitler was in favour of killing those whom he judged to be (&#x27;Life unworthy of life&#x27;). A few months before the &quot;euthanasia&quot; decree, in a 1939 conference with Leonardo Conti, Reich Health Leader and State Secretary for Health in the Interior Ministry, and Hans Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler gave as examples the mentally ill who he said could only be &quot;bedded on sawdust or sand&quot; because they &quot;perpetually dirtied themselves&quot; and &quot;put their own excrement into their mouths&quot;. This issue, according to the Nazi regime, assumed a new urgency in wartime.

After the invasion of Poland, Hermann Pfannmüller (Head of the State Hospital near Munich) said

Pfannmüller advocated killing by a gradual decrease of food, which he believed was more merciful than poison injections.
The German eugenics movement had an extreme wing even before the Nazis came to power. As early as 1920, Alfred Hoche and Karl Binding advocated killing people whose lives were &quot;unworthy of life&quot; (). Darwinism was interpreted by them as justification of the demand for &quot;beneficial&quot; genes and eradication of the &quot;harmful&quot; ones. Robert Lifton wrote, &quot;The argument went that the best young men died in war, causing a loss to the of the best genes. The genes of those who did not fight (the worst genes) then proliferated freely, accelerating biological and cultural degeneration&quot;. The advocacy of eugenics in Germany gained ground after 1930, when the Depression was used to excuse cuts in funding to state mental hospitals, creating squalor and overcrowding.

Many German eugenicists were nationalists and antisemites, who embraced the Nazi regime with enthusiasm. Many were appointed to positions in the Health Ministry and German research institutes. Their ideas were gradually adopted by the majority of the German medical profession, from which Jewish and communist doctors were soon purged. During the 1930s, the Nazi Party had carried out a campaign of propaganda in favour of euthanasia. The National Socialist Racial and Political Office (NSRPA) produced leaflets, posters and short films to be shown in cinemas, pointing out to Germans the cost of maintaining asylums for the incurably ill and insane. These films included &quot;The Inheritance&quot; (, 1935), &quot;Victims of the Past&quot; (, 1937), which was given a major première in Berlin and was shown in all German cinemas, and &quot;I Accuse&quot; (, 1941) which was based on a novel by Hellmuth Unger, a consultant for &quot;child euthanasia&quot;.

==Killing of children==


In mid-1939, Hitler authorised the creation of the Reich Committee for the Scientific Registering of Serious Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses () led by his physician, Karl Brandt, administered by Herbert Linden of the Interior Ministry, leader of German Red Cross Ernst-Robert Grawitz and SS- Viktor Brack. Brandt and Bouhler were authorised to approve applications to kill children in relevant circumstances, though Bouhler left the details to subordinates such as Brack and SA- Werner Blankenburg.

Extermination centres were established at six existing psychiatric hospitals: Bernburg, Brandenburg, Grafeneck, Hadamar, Hartheim, and Sonnenstein. One thousand children under the age of 17 were killed at the institutions Am Spiegelgrund and Gugging in Austria. They played a crucial role in developments leading to the Holocaust. As a related aspect of the &quot;medical&quot; and scientific basis of this programme, the Nazi doctors took thousands of brains from &#x27;euthanasia&#x27; victims for research.
From August 1939, the Interior Ministry registered children with disabilities, requiring doctors and midwives to report all cases of newborns with severe disabilities; the &#x27;guardian&#x27; consent element soon disappeared. Those to be killed were identified as &quot;all children under three years of age in whom any of the following &#x27;serious hereditary diseases&#x27; were &#x27;suspected&#x27;: idiocy and Down syndrome (especially when associated with blindness and deafness); microcephaly; hydrocephaly; malformations of all kinds, especially of limbs, head, and spinal column; and paralysis, including spastic conditions&quot;. The reports were assessed by a panel of medical experts, of whom three were required to give their approval before a child could be killed.

The Ministry used deceit when dealing with parents or guardians, particularly in Catholic areas, where parents were generally uncooperative. Parents were told that their children were being sent to &quot;Special Sections&quot;, where they would receive improved treatment. The children sent to these centres were kept for &quot;assessment&quot; for a few weeks and then killed by injection of toxic chemicals, typically phenol; their deaths were recorded as &quot;pneumonia&quot;. Autopsies were usually performed and brain samples were taken to be used for &quot;medical research&quot;. Post mortem examinations apparently helped to ease the consciences of many of those involved, giving them the feeling that there was a genuine medical purpose to the killings. The most notorious of these institutions in Austria was Am Spiegelgrund, where from 1940 to 1945, 789 children were killed by lethal injection, gas poisoning and physical abuse. Children&#x27;s brains were preserved in jars of formaldehyde and stored in the basement of the clinic and in the private collection of Heinrich Gross, one of the institution&#x27;s directors, until 2001.

When the Second World War began in September 1939, less rigorous standards of assessment and a quicker approval process were adopted. Older children and adolescents were included and the conditions covered came to include

More pressure was placed on parents to agree to their children being sent away. Many parents suspected what was happening and refused consent, especially when it became apparent that institutions for children with disabilities were being systematically cleared of their charges. The parents were warned that they could lose custody of all their children and if that did not suffice, the parents could be threatened with call-up for &#x27;labour duty&#x27;. By 1941, more than 5,000 children had been killed. The last child to be killed under was Richard Jenne on 29 May 1945, in the children&#x27;s ward of the Kaufbeuren-Irsee state hospital in Bavaria, Germany, more than three weeks after US Army troops had occupied the town.

==Killing of adults==

===Invasion of Poland===

Brandt and Bouhler developed plans to expand the programme of euthanasia to adults. In July 1939 they held a meeting attended by Conti and Professor Werner Heyde, head of the SS medical department. This meeting agreed to arrange a national register of all institutionalised people with mental illnesses or physical disabilities. The first adults with disabilities to be killed en masse by the Nazi regime were Poles. After the invasion on 1 September 1939, adults with disabilities were shot by the SS men of 16, and under the command of SS- Rudolf Tröger, overseen by Reinhard Heydrich, during Operation Tannenberg.

All hospitals and mental asylums of the Wartheland were emptied. The region was incorporated into Germany and earmarked for resettlement by following the German conquest of Poland. In the Danzig (now Gdańsk) area, some 7,000 Polish patients of various institutions were shot and 10,000 were killed in the Gdynia area. Similar measures were taken in other areas of Poland destined for incorporation into Germany. The first experiments with the gassing of patients were conducted in October 1939 at Fort VII in Posen (occupied Poznań), where hundreds of prisoners were killed by means of carbon monoxide poisoning, in an improvised gas chamber developed by Albert Widmann, chief chemist of the German Criminal Police (Kripo). In December 1939, Heinrich Himmler witnessed one of these gassings, ensuring that this invention would later be put to much wider uses.
The idea of killing adult mental patients soon spread from occupied Poland to adjoining areas of Germany, probably because Nazi Party and SS officers in these areas were most familiar with what was happening in Poland. These were also the areas where Germans wounded from the Polish campaign were expected to be accommodated, which created a demand for hospital space. The of Pomerania, Franz Schwede-Coburg, sent 1,400 patients from five Pomeranian hospitals to undisclosed locations in occupied Poland, where they were shot. The of East Prussia, Erich Koch, had 1,600 patients killed out of sight. More than 8,000 Germans were killed in this initial wave of killings carried out on the orders of local officials, although Himmler certainly knew and approved of them.

The legal basis for the programme was a 1939 letter from Hitler, not a formal &quot;Führer&#x27;s decree&quot; with the force of law. Hitler bypassed Conti, the Health Minister and his department, who might have raised questions about the legality of the programme and entrusted it to Bouhler and Brandt.

The killings were administered by Viktor Brack and his staff from 4, disguised as the &quot;Charitable Foundation for Cure and Institutional Care&quot; offices which served as the front and was supervised by Bouhler and Brandt. The officials in charge included Herbert Linden, who had been involved in the child killing programme; Ernst-Robert Grawitz, chief physician of the SS and August Becker, an SS chemist. The officials selected the doctors who were to carry out the operational part of the programme; based on political reliability as long-term Nazis, professional reputation and sympathy for radical eugenics. The list included physicians who had proved their worth in the child-killing programme, such as Unger, Heinze and Hermann Pfannmüller. The recruits were mostly psychiatrists, notably Professor Carl Schneider of Heidelberg, Professor Max de Crinis of Berlin and Professor Paul Nitsche from the Sonnenstein state institution. Heyde became the operational leader of the programme, succeeded later by Nitsche.

===Listing of targets from hospital records===
In early October, all hospitals, nursing homes, old-age homes and sanatoria were required to report all patients who had been institutionalised for five years or more, who had been committed as &quot;criminally insane&quot;, who were of &quot;non-Aryan race&quot; or who had been diagnosed with any on a list of conditions. The conditions included schizophrenia, epilepsy, Huntington&#x27;s chorea, advanced syphilis, senile dementia, paralysis, encephalitis and &quot;terminal neurological conditions generally&quot;. Many doctors and administrators assumed that the reports were to identify inmates who were capable of being drafted for &quot;labour service&quot; and tended to overstate the degree of incapacity of their patients, to protect them from labour conscription. When some institutions refused to co-operate, teams of T4 doctors (or Nazi medical students) visited and compiled the lists, sometimes in a haphazard and ideologically motivated way. During 1940, all Jewish patients were removed from institutions and killed.

As with child inmates, adults were assessed by a panel of experts, working at the offices. The experts were required to make their judgements on the reports, not medical histories or examinations. Sometimes they dealt with hundreds of reports at a time. On each they marked a + (death), a - (life), or occasionally a ? meaning that they were unable to decide. Three &quot;death&quot; verdicts condemned the person and as with reviews of children, the process became less rigorous, the range of conditions considered &quot;unsustainable&quot; grew broader and zealous Nazis further down the chain of command increasingly made decisions on their own initiative.

==Gassing==
The first gassings in Germany proper took place in January 1940 at the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre. The operation was headed by Brack, who said &quot;the needle belongs in the hand of the doctor&quot;. Bottled pure carbon monoxide gas was used. At trials, Brandt described the process as a &quot;major advance in medical history&quot;. Once the efficacy of the method was confirmed, it became standard and was instituted at a number of centres in Germany under the supervision of Widmann, Becker and Christian Wirth – a Kripo officer who later played a prominent role in the Final Solution (extermination of Jews) as commandant of newly built death camps in occupied Poland. In addition to Brandenburg, the killing centres included Grafeneck Castle in Baden-Württemberg (10,824 dead), Schloss Hartheim near Linz in Austria (over 18,000 dead), Sonnenstein in Saxony (15,000 dead), Bernburg in Saxony-Anhalt and Hadamar in Hesse (14,494 dead). The same facilities were also used to kill mentally sound prisoners transferred from concentration camps in Germany, Austria and occupied parts of Poland.

Condemned patients were transferred from their institutions to new centres in T4 Charitable Ambulance buses, called the Community Patients Transports Service. They were run by teams of SS men wearing white coats, to give it an air of medical care. To prevent the families and doctors of the patients from tracing them, the patients were often first sent to transit centres in major hospitals, where they were supposedly assessed. They were moved again to &quot;special treatment&quot; () centres. Families were sent letters explaining that owing to wartime regulations, it was not possible for them to visit relatives in these centres. Most of these patients were killed within 24 hours of arriving at the centres and their bodies cremated. Some bodies were dissected for medical research whilst others had their gold teeth extracted. For every person killed, a death certificate was prepared, giving a false but plausible cause of death. This was sent to the family along with an urn of ashes (random ashes, since the victims were cremated ). The preparation of thousands of falsified death certificates took up most of the working day of the doctors who operated the centres.

During 1940, the centres at Brandenburg, Grafeneck and Hartheim killed nearly 10,000 people each, while another 6,000 were killed at Sonnenstein. In all, about 35,000 people were killed in T4 operations that year. Operations at Brandenburg and Grafeneck were wound up at the end of the year, partly because the areas they served had been cleared and partly because of public opposition. In 1941, however, the centres at Bernburg and Sonnenstein increased their operations, while Hartheim (where Wirth and Franz Stangl were successively commandants) continued as before. Another 35,000 people were killed before August 1941, when the T4 programme was officially shut down by Hitler. Even after that date the centres continued to be used to kill concentration camp inmates: eventually some 20,000 people in this category were killed.

In 1971, Gitta Sereny conducted interviews with Stangl, who was in prison in Düsseldorf, having been convicted of co-responsibility for killing 900,000 people, while commandant of the Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps in Poland. Stangl gave Sereny a detailed account of the operations of the T4 programme based on his time as commandant of the killing facility at the Hartheim institute. He described how the inmates of various asylums were removed and transported by bus to Hartheim. Some were in no mental state to know what was happening to them but many were perfectly sane and for them various forms of deception were used. They were told they were at a special clinic where they would receive improved treatment and were given a brief medical examination on arrival. They were induced to enter what appeared to be a shower block, where they were gassed with carbon monoxide (the ruse was also used at extermination camps). Some of the victims knew their fate and tried to defend themselves.

==Number of euthanasia victims==
The SS functionaries and hospital staff associated with in the German Reich were paid from the central office at 4 in Berlin from the spring of 1940. The SS and police from responsible for murdering the majority of patients in the annexed territories of Poland since October 1939, took their salaries from the normal police fund, supervised by the administration of the newly formed &quot;Wartheland&quot; district; the programme in Germany and occupied Poland was overseen by Heinrich Himmler. Before 2013, it was believed that 70,000 persons were murdered in the euthanasia programme, but the German Federal Archives reported that research in the archives of former East Germany indicated that the number of victims in Germany and Austria from 1939 to 1945 was about 200,000 persons and that another 100,000 persons were victims in other European countries. In the German T4 centres there was at least the semblance of legality in keeping records and writing letters. In Polish psychiatric hospitals no one was left behind. Killings were inflicted using gas-vans, sealed army bunkers and machine guns; families were not informed about the murdered relatives and the empty wards were handed over to the SS.

== Technology and personnel transfer to death camps ==

After the official end of the euthanasia programme in 1941, most of the personnel and high-ranking officials, as well as gassing technology and the techniques used to deceive victims, were transferred under the jurisdiction of the national medical division of the Reich Interior Ministry. Further gassing experiments with the use of mobile gas chambers () were conducted at Soldau concentration camp by Herbert Lange following Operation Barbarossa. Lange was appointed commander of the Chełmno extermination camp in December 1941. He was given three gas vans by the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), converted by the Gaubschat GmbH in Berlin and before February 1942, killed 3,830 Polish Jews and around 4,000 Romani, under the guise of &quot;resettlement&quot;. After the Wannsee conference, implementation of gassing technology was accelerated by Heydrich. Beginning in the spring of 1942, three killing factories were built secretly in east-central Poland. The &quot;SS&quot; officers responsible for the earlier , including Wirth, Stangl and Irmfried Eberl, had important roles in the implementation of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; for the next two years. The first killing centre, equipped with stationary gas chambers, modelled on technology developed under , was established at Bełżec in the General Government territory of occupied Poland; the decision preceded the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 by three months.

==Opposition==
In January 1939, Brack commissioned a paper from Professor of Moral Theology at the University of Paderborn, Joseph Mayer, on the likely reactions of the churches in the event of a state euthanasia programme being instituted. Mayera longstanding euthanasia advocatereported that the churches would not oppose such a programme if it was seen to be in the national interest. Brack showed this paper to Hitler in July and it may have increased his confidence that the &quot;euthanasia&quot; programme would be acceptable to German public opinion. Notably, when Sereny interviewed Mayer shortly before his death in 1967, he denied that he formally condoned the killing of people with disabilities but no copies of this paper are known to survive.

Some bureaucrats opposed the T4 programme; Lothar Kreyssig, a district judge and member of the Confessing Church, wrote to Justice Minister Franz Gürtner protesting that the action was illegal since no law or formal decree from Hitler had authorised it. Gürtner replied, &quot;If you cannot recognise the will of the Führer as a source of law, then you cannot remain a judge&quot; and had Kreyssig dismissed. Hitler had a policy of not issuing written instructions for matters which could later be condemned by the international community but made an exception when he provided Bouhler and Brack with written authority for the T4 programme. Hitler wrote a confidential letter in October 1939 to overcome opposition within the German state bureaucracy. Hitler told Bouhler that, &quot;the Führer&#x27;s Chancellery must under no circumstances be seen to be active in this matter&quot;. Gürtner had to be shown Hitler&#x27;s letter in August 1940 to gain his co-operation.

===Exposure===
In the towns where the killing centres were located, some people saw the inmates arrive in buses, saw smoke from the crematoria chimneys and noticed that the buses were returning empty. In Hadamar, ashes containing human hair rained down on the town and despite the strictest orders, some of the staff at the killing centres talked about what was going on. In some cases families could tell that the causes of death in certificates were false, e.g. when a patient was claimed to have died of appendicitis, even though his appendix had been removed some years earlier. In other cases, families in the same town would receive death certificates on the same day. In May 1941, the Frankfurt County Court wrote to Gürtner describing scenes in Hadamar, where children shouted in the streets that people were being taken away in buses to be gassed.
During 1940, rumours of what was taking place spread and many Germans withdrew their relatives from asylums and sanatoria to care for them at home, often with great expense and difficulty. In some places doctors and psychiatrists co-operated with families to have patients discharged or if the families could afford it, transferred them to private clinics beyond the reach of T4. Other doctors &quot;re-diagnosed&quot; patients so that they no longer met the T4 criteria, which risked exposure when Nazi zealots from Berlin conducted inspections. In Kiel, Professor Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt managed to save nearly all of his patients. Lifton listed a handful of psychiatrists and administrators who opposed the killings; many doctors collaborated, either through ignorance, agreement with Nazi eugenicist policies or fear of the regime.

Protest letters were sent to the Reich Chancellery and the Ministry of Justice, some from Nazi Party members. The first open protest against the removal of people from asylums took place at Absberg in Franconia in February 1941 and others followed. The SD report on the incident at Absberg noted that &quot;the removal of residents from the Ottilien Home has caused a great deal of unpleasantness&quot; and described large crowds of Catholic townspeople, among them Party members, protesting against the action. Similar petitions and protests occurred throughout Austria as rumours spread of mass killings at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre and of mysterious deaths at the children&#x27;s clinic, in Vienna. Anna Wödl, a nurse and mother of a child with a disability, vehemently petitioned to Hermann Linden at the Reich Ministry of the Interior in Berlin to prevent her son, Alfred, from being transferred from Gugging, where he lived and which also became a euthanasia center. Wödl failed and Alfred was sent to , where he was killed on 22 February 1941. His brain was preserved in formaldehyde for &quot;research&quot; and stored in the clinic for sixty years.

===Church protests===

The Lutheran theologian Friedrich von Bodelschwingh (director of the Bethel Institution for Epilepsy at Bielefeld) and Pastor Paul-Gerhard Braune (director of the Hoffnungstal Institution near Berlin) protested. Bodelschwingh negotiated directly with Brandt and indirectly with Hermann Göring, whose cousin was a prominent psychiatrist. Braune had meetings with Gürtner, who was always dubious about the legality of the programme. Gürtner later wrote a strongly worded letter to Hitler protesting against it; Hitler did not read it but was told about it by Lammers. Bishop Theophil Wurm, presiding over the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg, wrote to Interior Minister Frick in March 1940 and that month a confidential report from the (SD) in Austria, warned that the killing programme must be implemented with stealth &quot;...to avoid a probable backlash of public opinion during the war&quot;. On 4 December 1940, Reinhold Sautter, the Supreme Church Councillor of the Württemberg State Church, complained to the Nazi Ministerial Councillor Eugen Stähle against the murders in Grafeneck Castle. Stähle said &quot;The fifth commandment Thou shalt not kill, is no commandment of God but a Jewish invention&quot;.

Bishop Heinrich Wienken of Berlin, a leading member of the Caritas Association, was selected by the Fulda episcopal synod to represent the views of the Catholic Church in meetings with T4 operatives. In 2008, Michael Burleigh wrote

Despite a decree issued by the Vatican on 2 December 1940 stating that the T4 policy was &quot;against natural and positive Divine law&quot; and that &quot;The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed&quot;, the Catholic Church hierarchy in Germany decided to take no further action. Incensed by the Nazi appropriation of Church property in Münster to accommodate people made homeless by an air raid, in July and August 1941, the bishop of Münster, Clemens August Graf von Galen, gave four sermons criticising the Nazis for arresting Jesuits, confiscating church property and for the euthanasia program. Galen sent the text to Hitler by telegram, calling on

Galen&#x27;s sermons were not reported in the German press but were circulated illegally in leaflets. The text was dropped by the Royal Air Force over German troops. In 2009, Richard J. Evans wrote that &quot;This was the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich&quot;. Local Nazis asked for Galen to be arrested but Goebbels told Hitler that such action would provoke a revolt in Westphalia and Hitler decided to wait until after the war to take revenge.
In 1986, Lifton wrote, &quot;Nazi leaders faced the prospect of either having to imprison prominent, highly admired clergymen and other protesters – a course with consequences in terms of adverse public reaction they greatly feared – or else end the programme&quot;. Evans considered it &quot;at least possible, even indeed probable&quot; that the T4 programme would have continued beyond Hitler&#x27;s initial quota of 70,000 deaths but for the public reaction to Galen&#x27;s sermon. Burleigh called assumptions that the sermon affected Hitler&#x27;s decision to suspend the T4 programme &quot;wishful thinking&quot; and noted that the various Church hierarchies did not complain after the transfer of T4 personnel to . Henry Friedlander wrote that it was not the criticism from the Church but rather the loss of secrecy and &quot;general popular disquiet about the way euthanasia was implemented&quot; that caused the killings to be suspended.

Galen had detailed knowledge of the euthanasia programme by July 1940 but did not speak out until almost a year after Protestants had begun to protest. In 2002, Beth A. Griech-Polelle wrote:

On 29 June 1943, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical , in which he condemned the fact that &quot;physically deformed people, mentally disturbed people and hereditarily ill people have at times been robbed of their lives&quot; in Germany. Following this, in September 1943, a bold but ineffectual condemnation was read by bishops from pulpits across Germany, denouncing the killing of &quot;the innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped and mentally ill, the incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent&quot;.

==Suspension and continuity==
On 24 August 1941, Hitler ordered the suspension of the T4 killings. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June, many T4 personnel were transferred to the eastern front. The projected death total for the T4 programme of 70,000 deaths had been reached by August 1941. The termination of the T4 programme did not end the killing of people with disabilities; from the end of 1941, on the initiative of institute directors and local party leaders, the killing of adults and children continued, albeit less systematically, until the end of the war. After the bombing of Hamburg in July 1943, occupants of old age homes were killed. In the post-war trial of Dr. Hilda Wernicke, Berlin, August 1946, testimony was given that &quot;500 old, broken women&quot; who had survived the bombing of Stettin in June 1944 were euthanised at the Meseritz-Oberwalde Asylum. The Hartheim, Bernberg, Sonnenstein and Hadamar centres continued in use as &quot;wild euthanasia&quot; centres to kill people sent from all over Germany, until 1945. The methods were lethal injection or starvation, those employed before use of gas chambers. By the end of 1941, about 100,000 people had been killed in the T4 programme. From mid-1941, concentration camp prisoners too feeble or too much trouble to keep alive were murdered after a cursory psychiatric examination under Action 14f13.

==Post-war==

===Doctors&#x27; trial===
After the war trials were held in connection with the Nazi euthanasia programme at various places including Dresden, Frankfurt, Graz, Nuremberg and Tübingen. In December 1946 an American military tribunal (commonly called the Doctors&#x27; trial) prosecuted 23 doctors and administrators for their roles in war crimes and crimes against humanity. These crimes included the systematic killing of those deemed &quot;unworthy of life&quot;, including people with mental disabilities, the people who were institutionalised mentally ill and people with physical impairments. After 140 days of proceedings, including the testimony of 85 witnesses and the submission of 1,500 documents, in August 1947 the court pronounced 16 of the defendants guilty. Seven were sentenced to death; the men, including Brandt and Brack, were executed on 2 June 1948.

The indictment read in part:
Earlier, in 1945, American forces tried seven staff members of the Hadamar killing centre for the killing of Soviet and Polish nationals, which was within their jurisdiction under international law, as these were the citizens of wartime allies. (Hadamar was within the American Zone of Occupation in Germany. This was before the Allied resolution of December 1945, to prosecute individuals for &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; for such mass atrocities.) Alfons Klein, Heinrich Ruoff and Karl Willig were sentenced to death and executed; the other four were given long prison sentences. In 1946, reconstructed German courts tried members of the Hadamar staff for the murders of nearly 15,000 German citizens. The chief physician, Adolf Wahlmann and Irmgard Huber, the head nurse, were convicted.

==Memorials==
The German national memorial to the people with disabilities murdered by the Nazis was dedicated in 2014 in Berlin. It is located in the pavement of a site next to the Tiergarten park, the location of the former villa at Tiergartenstraße 4 in Berlin, where more than 60 Nazi bureaucrats and doctors worked in secret under the &quot;T4&quot; programme to organise the mass murder of sanatorium and psychiatric hospital patients deemed unworthy to live.

<doc id="154143" wikidata="Q353935" url="?curid=154143" title="Edward R. Murrow">
<text>Edward Roscoe Murrow (born Egbert Roscoe Murrow; April 25, 1908 – April 27, 1965) was an American broadcast journalist and war correspondent. He first gained prominence during World War II with a series of live radio broadcasts from Europe for the news division of CBS. During the war he recruited and worked closely with a team of war correspondents who came to be known as the Murrow Boys.

A pioneer of radio and television news broadcasting, Murrow produced a series of reports on his television program &quot;See It Now&quot; which helped lead to the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Fellow journalists Eric Sevareid, Ed Bliss, Bill Downs, Dan Rather, and Alexander Kendrick consider Murrow one of journalism&#x27;s greatest figures. Murrow&#x27;s life has been dramatized in several films, including &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;, which takes its name from the signature sign-off phrase Murrow used to end many of his wartime broadcasts.

==Early life==
Murrow was born Egbert Roscoe Murrow at Polecat Creek, near Greensboro, in Guilford County, North Carolina, to Roscoe Conklin Murrow and Ethel F. (née Lamb) Murrow. His parents were Quakers. He was the youngest of four brothers and was a &quot;mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and German&quot; descent. The firstborn, Roscoe Jr., lived only a few hours. Lacey Van Buren was four years old and Dewey Joshua was two years old when Murrow was born. His home was a log cabin without electricity or plumbing, on a farm bringing in only a few hundred dollars a year from corn and hay.

When Murrow was six years old, his family moved across the country to Skagit County in western Washington, to homestead near Blanchard, south of the Canada–United States border. He attended high school in nearby Edison, and was president of the student body in his senior year and excelled on the debate team. He was also a member of the basketball team which won the Skagit County championship.

After graduation from high school in 1926, Murrow enrolled at Washington State College (now Washington State University) across the state in Pullman, and eventually majored in speech. A member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, he was also active in college politics. By his teen years, Murrow went by the nickname &quot;Ed&quot; and during his second year of college, he changed his name from Egbert to Edward. In 1929, while attending the annual convention of the National Student Federation of America, Murrow gave a speech urging college students to become more interested in national and world affairs; this led to his election as president of the federation. After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1930, he moved back east to New York.

Murrow was assistant director of the Institute of International Education from 1932 to 1935 and served as assistant secretary of the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, which helped prominent German scholars who had been dismissed from academic positions. He married Janet Huntington Brewster on March 12, 1935. Their son, Charles Casey Murrow, was born in the west of London on November 6, 1945.

==Career at CBS==
Murrow joined CBS as director of talks and education in 1935 and remained with the network for his entire career. CBS did not have news staff when Murrow joined, save for announcer Bob Trout. Murrow&#x27;s job was to line up newsmakers who would appear on the network to talk about the issues of the day. But the onetime Washington State speech major was intrigued by Trout&#x27;s on-air delivery, and Trout gave Murrow tips on how to communicate effectively on radio.

Murrow went to London in 1937 to serve as the director of CBS&#x27;s European operations. The position did not involve on-air reporting; his job was persuading European figures to broadcast over the CBS network, which was in direct competition with NBC&#x27;s two radio networks. During this time, he made frequent trips around Europe. In 1937, Murrow hired journalist William L. Shirer, and assigned him to a similar post on the continent. This marked the beginning of the &quot;Murrow Boys&quot; team of war reporters.

===Radio===
Murrow gained his first glimpse of fame during the March 1938 &quot;Anschluss,&quot; in which Adolf Hitler engineered the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. While Murrow was in Poland arranging a broadcast of children&#x27;s choruses, he got word from Shirer of the annexation—and the fact that Shirer could not get the story out through Austrian state radio facilities. Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London. Shirer wrote in his diary:

Shirer flew from Vienna to Berlin, then Amsterdam, and finally to London, where he delivered an uncensored eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered the only transportation available, a 23-passenger plane, to fly from Warsaw to Vienna so he could take over for Shirer.

At the request of CBS management in New York, Murrow and Shirer put together a &quot;European News Roundup&quot; of reaction to the Anschluss, which brought correspondents from various European cities together for a single broadcast. On March 13, 1938, the special was broadcast, hosted by Bob Trout in New York, including Shirer in London (with Labour MP Ellen Wilkinson), reporter Edgar Ansel Mowrer of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in Paris, reporter Pierre J. Huss of the International News Service in Berlin, and Senator Lewis B. Schwellenbach in Washington, D.C. Reporter Frank Gervasi, in Rome, was unable to find a transmitter to broadcast reaction from the Italian capital but phoned his script to Shirer in London, who read it on the air. Murrow reported live from Vienna, in the first on-the-scene news report of his career: &quot;This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna... It&#x27;s now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived.&quot;

The broadcast was considered revolutionary at the time. Featuring multipoint, live reports transmitted by shortwave in the days before modern technology (and without each of the parties necessarily being able to hear one another), it came off almost flawlessly. The special became the basis for &quot;World News Roundup&quot;—broadcasting&#x27;s oldest news series, which still runs each weekday morning and evening on the CBS Radio Network.

On March 19, Shirer returned from London, and Murrow met his plane at Vienna&#x27;s Aspern airport. Returning to Shirer&#x27;s apartment, they encountered SS troops looting the Vienna mansion of the Rothschild family. &quot;We found a quiet bar off the Kärntnerstrasse for a talk,&quot; Shirer wrote.

In September 1938, Murrow and Shirer were regular participants in CBS&#x27;s coverage of the crisis over the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, which Hitler coveted for Germany and eventually won in the Munich Agreement. Their incisive reporting heightened the American appetite for radio news, with listeners regularly waiting for Murrow&#x27;s shortwave broadcasts, introduced by analyst H. V. Kaltenborn in New York saying, &quot;Calling Ed Murrow ... come in Ed Murrow.&quot;

During the following year, leading up to the outbreak of World War II, Murrow continued to be based in London. William Shirer&#x27;s reporting from Berlin brought him national acclaim and a commentator&#x27;s position with CBS News upon his return to the United States in December 1940. Shirer would describe his Berlin experiences in his best-selling 1941 book &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;. When the war broke out in September 1939, Murrow stayed in London, and later provided live radio broadcasts during the height of the Blitz in &quot;London After Dark&quot;. These live, shortwave broadcasts relayed on CBS electrified radio audiences as news programming never had: previous war coverage had mostly been provided by newspaper reports, along with newsreels seen in movie theaters; earlier radio news programs had simply featured an announcer in a studio reading wire service reports.

==World War II==

Murrow&#x27;s reports, especially during the Blitz, began with what became his signature opening, &quot;&quot;This&quot; is London,&quot; delivered with his vocal emphasis on the word &quot;this&quot;, followed by the hint of a pause before the rest of the phrase. His former speech teacher, Ida Lou Anderson, suggested the opening as a more concise alternative to the one he had inherited from his predecessor at CBS Europe, César Saerchinger: &quot;Hello, America. This is London calling.&quot; Murrow&#x27;s phrase became synonymous with the newscaster and his network.

Murrow achieved celebrity status as a result of his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase, at the end of 1940, with every night&#x27;s German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with &quot;good night, and good luck.&quot; The future British monarch, Princess Elizabeth, said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said &quot;good night, and good luck to you all&quot;. So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with &quot;Good night, and good luck.&quot; Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.

When Murrow returned to the U.S. in 1941, CBS hosted a dinner in his honor on December 2 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. 1,100 guests attended the dinner, which the network broadcast. Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a welcome-back telegram, which was read at the dinner, and Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish gave an encomium that commented on the power and intimacy of Murrow&#x27;s wartime dispatches. &quot;You burned the city of London in our houses and we felt the flames that burned it,&quot; MacLeish said. &quot;You laid the dead of London at our doors and we knew that the dead were our dead, were mankind&#x27;s dead. You have destroyed the superstition that what is done beyond 3,000 miles of water is not really done at all.&quot;

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor occurred less than a week after this speech, and the U.S. entered the war as a combatant on the Allied side. Murrow flew on 25 Allied combat missions in Europe during the war, providing additional reports from the planes as they droned on over Europe (recorded for delayed broadcast). Murrow&#x27;s skill at improvising vivid descriptions of what was going on around or below him, derived in part from his college training in speech, aided the effectiveness of his radio broadcasts.

As hostilities expanded, Murrow expanded CBS News in London into what Harrison Salisbury described as &quot;the finest news staff anybody had ever put together in Europe&quot;. The result was a group of reporters acclaimed for their intellect and descriptive power, including Eric Sevareid, Charles Collingwood, Howard K. Smith, Mary Marvin Breckinridge, Cecil Brown, Richard C. Hottelet, Bill Downs, Winston Burdett, Charles Shaw, Ned Calmer, and Larry LeSueur. Many of them, Shirer included, were later dubbed &quot;Murrow&#x27;s Boys&quot;—despite Breckinridge being a woman. In 1944, Murrow sought Walter Cronkite to take over for Bill Downs at the CBS Moscow bureau. Cronkite initially accepted, but after receiving a better offer from his current employer, United Press, he turned down the offer.

Murrow so closely cooperated with the British that in 1943 Winston Churchill offered to make him joint Director-General of the BBC in charge of programming. Although he declined the job, during the war Murrow did fall in love with Churchill&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Pamela, whose other American lovers included Averell Harriman, whom she married many years later. Pamela wanted Murrow to marry her, and he considered it; however, after his wife gave birth to their only child, Casey, he ended the affair.

After the war, Murrow recruited journalists such as Alexander Kendrick, David Schoenbrun, Daniel Schorr and Robert Pierpoint into the circle of the Boys as a virtual &quot;second generation&quot;, though the track record of the original wartime crew set it apart.

On April 12, 1945, Murrow and Bill Shadel were the first reporters at the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. He met emaciated survivors including Petr Zenkl, children with identification tattoos, and &quot;bodies stacked up like cordwood&quot; in the crematorium. In his report three days later, Murrow said:

==Postwar broadcasting career==
===Radio===
In December 1945 Murrow reluctantly accepted William S. Paley&#x27;s offer to become a vice president of the network and head of CBS News, and made his last news report from London in March 1946. His presence and personality shaped the newsroom. After the war, he maintained close friendships with his previous hires, including members of the Murrow Boys. Younger colleagues at CBS became resentful toward this, viewing it as preferential treatment, and formed the &quot;Murrow Isn&#x27;t God Club.&quot; The club disbanded when Murrow asked if he could join.

During Murrow&#x27;s tenure as vice president, his relationship with Shirer ended in 1947 in one of the great confrontations of American broadcast journalism, when Shirer was fired by CBS. He said he resigned in the heat of an interview at the time, but was actually terminated. The dispute began when J. B. Williams, maker of shaving soap, withdrew its sponsorship of Shirer&#x27;s Sunday news show. CBS, of which Murrow was then vice president for public affairs, decided to &quot;move in a new direction,&quot; hired a new host, and let Shirer go. There are different versions of these events; Shirer&#x27;s was not made public until 1990.

Shirer contended that the root of his troubles was the network and sponsor not standing by him because of his comments critical of the Truman Doctrine, as well as other comments that were considered outside of the mainstream. Shirer and his supporters felt he was being muzzled because of his views. Meanwhile, Murrow, and even some of Murrow&#x27;s Boys, felt that Shirer was coasting on his high reputation and not working hard enough to bolster his analyses with his own research. Murrow and Shirer never regained their close friendship.

The episode hastened Murrow&#x27;s desire to give up his network vice presidency and return to newscasting, and it foreshadowed his own problems to come with his friend Paley, boss of CBS.

Murrow and Paley had become close when the network chief himself joined the war effort, setting up Allied radio outlets in Italy and North Africa. After the war, he would often go to Paley directly to settle any problems he had. &quot;Ed Murrow was Bill Paley&#x27;s one genuine friend in CBS,&quot; noted Murrow biographer Joseph Persico.

Murrow returned to the air in September 1947, taking over the nightly 7:45 p.m. ET newscast sponsored by Campbell&#x27;s Soup and anchored by his old friend and announcing coach Bob Trout. For the next several years Murrow focused on radio, and in addition to news reports he produced special presentations for CBS News Radio. In 1950, he narrated a half-hour radio documentary called &quot;The Case of the Flying Saucer&quot;. It offered a balanced look at UFOs, a subject of widespread interest at the time. Murrow interviewed both Kenneth Arnold and astronomer Donald Menzel.

From 1951 to 1955, Murrow was the host of &quot;This I Believe&quot;, which offered ordinary people the opportunity to speak for five minutes on radio. He continued to present daily radio news reports on the CBS Radio Network until 1959. He also recorded a series of narrated &quot;historical albums&quot; for Columbia Records called &quot;I Can Hear It Now&quot;, which inaugurated his partnership with producer Fred W. Friendly. In 1950 the records evolved into a weekly CBS Radio show, &quot;Hear It Now&quot;, hosted by Murrow and co-produced by Murrow and Friendly.

===Television and films===
As the 1950s began, Murrow began his television career by appearing in editorial &quot;tailpieces&quot; on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and in the coverage of special events. This came despite his own misgivings about the new medium and its emphasis on image rather than ideas.

On November 18, 1951, &quot;Hear It Now&quot; moved to television and was re-christened &quot;See It Now&quot;. In the first episode, Murrow explained: &quot;This is an old team, trying to learn a new trade.&quot;

In 1952, Murrow narrated the political documentary &quot;Alliance for Peace&quot;, an information vehicle for the newly formed SHAPE detailing the effects of the Marshall Plan upon a war-torn Europe. It was written by William Templeton and produced by Samuel Goldwyn Jr.

In 1953, Murrow launched a second weekly TV show, a series of celebrity interviews entitled &quot;Person to Person&quot;.

====Criticism of McCarthyism====
&quot;See It Now&quot; focused on a number of controversial issues in the 1950s, but it is best remembered as the show that criticized McCarthyism and the Red Scare, contributing, if not leading, to the political downfall of Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had previously commended Murrow for his fairness in reporting.

On June 15, 1953, Murrow hosted &quot;The Ford 50th Anniversary Show&quot;, broadcast simultaneously on NBC and CBS and seen by 60 million viewers. The broadcast closed with Murrow&#x27;s commentary covering a variety of topics, including the danger of nuclear war against the backdrop of a mushroom cloud. Murrow also offered indirect criticism of McCarthyism, saying: &quot;Nations have lost their freedom while preparing to defend it, and if we in this country confuse dissent with disloyalty, we deny the right to be wrong.&quot; Forty years after the broadcast, television critic Tom Shales recalled the broadcast as both &quot;a landmark in television&quot; and &quot;a milestone in the cultural life of the &#x27;50s&quot;.

On March 9, 1954, Murrow, Friendly, and their news team produced a half-hour &quot;See It Now&quot; special titled &quot;A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy&quot;. Murrow had considered making such a broadcast since &quot;See It Now&quot; debuted and was encouraged to by multiple colleagues including Bill Downs. However, Friendly wanted to wait for the right time to do so. Murrow used excerpts from McCarthy&#x27;s own speeches and proclamations to criticize the senator and point out episodes where he had contradicted himself. Murrow and Friendly paid for their own newspaper advertisement for the program; they were not allowed to use CBS&#x27;s money for the publicity campaign or even use the CBS logo.

The broadcast contributed to a nationwide backlash against McCarthy and is seen as a turning point in the history of television. It provoked tens of thousands of letters, telegrams, and phone calls to CBS headquarters, running 15 to 1 in favor. In a retrospective produced for &quot;Biography&quot;, Friendly noted how truck drivers pulled up to Murrow on the street in subsequent days and shouted &quot;Good show, Ed.&quot;

Murrow offered McCarthy the chance to respond to the criticism with a full half-hour on &quot;See It Now&quot;. McCarthy accepted the invitation and appeared on April 6, 1954. In his response, McCarthy rejected Murrow&#x27;s criticism and accused him of being a communist sympathizer [McCarthy also accused Murrow of being a member of the Industrial Workers of the World which Murrow denied.]. McCarthy also made an appeal to the public by attacking his detractors, stating:

Ultimately, McCarthy&#x27;s rebuttal served only to further decrease his already fading popularity. In the program following McCarthy&#x27;s appearance, Murrow commented that the senator had &quot;made no reference to any statements of fact that we made&quot;.
====Later television career====
Murrow&#x27;s hard-hitting approach to the news cost him influence in the world of television. &quot;See It Now&quot; occasionally scored high ratings (usually when it was tackling a particularly controversial subject), but in general, it did not score well on prime-time television.

When a quiz show phenomenon began and took TV by storm in the mid-1950s, Murrow realized the days of &quot;See It Now&quot; as a weekly show were numbered. (Biographer Joseph Persico notes that Murrow, watching an early episode of &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; air just before his own &quot;See It Now&quot;, is said to have turned to Friendly and asked how long they expected to keep their time slot).

&quot;See It Now&quot; was knocked out of its weekly slot in 1955 after sponsor Alcoa withdrew its advertising, but the show remained as a series of occasional TV special news reports that defined television documentary news coverage. Despite the show&#x27;s prestige, CBS had difficulty finding a regular sponsor, since it aired intermittently in its new time slot (Sunday afternoons at 5 p.m. ET by the end of 1956) and could not develop a regular audience.

In 1956, Murrow took time to appear as the on-screen narrator of a special prologue for Michael Todd&#x27;s epic production, &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. Although the prologue was generally omitted on telecasts of the film, it was included in home video releases.

Beginning in 1958, Murrow hosted a talk show entitled &quot;Small World&quot; that brought together political figures for one-to-one debates. In January 1959, he appeared on WGBH&#x27;s &quot;The Press and the People&quot; with Louis Lyons, discussing the responsibilities of television journalism.

Murrow appeared as himself in a cameo in the British film production of &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; in 1960, recreating some of the wartime broadcasts he did from London for CBS.

On September 16, 1962, he introduced educational television to New York City via the maiden broadcast of WNDT, which became WNET.

====Fall from favor====
Murrow&#x27;s reporting brought him into repeated conflicts with CBS, especially its chairman William Paley, which Friendly summarized in his book &quot;Due to Circumstances Beyond our Control&quot;. &quot;See It Now&quot; ended entirely in the summer of 1958 after a clash in Paley&#x27;s office. Murrow had complained to Paley he could not continue doing the show if the network repeatedly provided (without consulting Murrow) equal time to subjects who felt wronged by the program.

According to Friendly, Murrow asked Paley if he was going to destroy &quot;See It Now&quot;, into which the CBS chief executive had invested so much. Paley replied that he did not want a constant stomach ache every time Murrow covered a controversial subject.

&quot;See It Now&quot;″s final broadcast, &quot;Watch on the Ruhr&quot; (covering postwar Germany), aired July 7, 1958. Three months later, on October 15, 1958, in a speech before the Radio and Television News Directors Association in Chicago, Murrow blasted TV&#x27;s emphasis on entertainment and commercialism at the expense of public interest in his &quot;wires and lights&quot; speech:

The harsh tone of the Chicago speech seriously damaged Murrow&#x27;s friendship with Paley, who felt Murrow was biting the hand that fed him. Before his death, Friendly said that the RTNDA (now Radio Television Digital News Association) address did more than the McCarthy show to break the relationship between the CBS boss and his most respected journalist.

Another contributing element to Murrow&#x27;s career decline was the rise of a new crop of television journalists. Walter Cronkite&#x27;s arrival at CBS in 1950 marked the beginning of a major rivalry which continued until Murrow resigned from the network in 1961. Murrow held a grudge dating back to 1944, when Cronkite turned down his offer to head the CBS Moscow bureau. With the Murrow Boys dominating the newsroom, Cronkite felt like an outsider soon after joining the network. Over time, as Murrow&#x27;s career seemed on the decline and Cronkite&#x27;s on the rise, the two found it increasingly difficult to work together. Cronkite&#x27;s demeanor was similar to reporters Murrow had hired; the difference being that Murrow viewed the Murrow Boys as satellites rather than potential rivals, as Cronkite seemed to be.

Throughout the 1950s the two got into heated arguments stoked in part by their professional rivalry. At a dinner party hosted by Bill Downs at his home in Bethesda, Cronkite and Murrow argued over the role of sponsors, which Cronkite accepted as necessary and said &quot;paid the rent.&quot; Murrow, who had long despised sponsors despite also relying on them, responded angrily. In another instance, an argument devolved into a &quot;duel&quot; in which the two drunkenly took a pair of antique dueling pistols and pretended to shoot at each other. Despite this, Cronkite went on to have a long career as an anchor at CBS.

After the end of &quot;See It Now,&quot; Murrow was invited by New York&#x27;s Democratic Party to run for the Senate. Paley was enthusiastic and encouraged him to do it. Harry Truman advised Murrow that his choice was between being the junior senator from New York or being Edward R. Murrow, beloved broadcast journalist, and hero to millions. He listened to Truman.

After contributing to the first episode of the documentary series &quot;CBS Reports&quot;, Murrow, increasingly under physical stress due to his conflicts and frustration with CBS, took a sabbatical from summer 1959 to mid-1960, though he continued to work on &quot;CBS Reports&quot; and &quot;Small World&quot; during this period. Friendly, executive producer of &quot;CBS Reports&quot;, wanted the network to allow Murrow to again be his co-producer after the sabbatical, but he was eventually turned down.

Murrow&#x27;s last major TV milestone was reporting and narrating the &quot;CBS Reports&quot; installment &quot;Harvest of Shame&quot;, a report on the plight of migrant farmworkers in the United States. Directed by Friendly and produced by David Lowe, it ran in November 1960, just after Thanksgiving.

===Summary of television work===
* 1951–1958 – &quot;See It Now&quot; (host)
* 1953–1959 – &quot;Person to Person&quot; (host)
* 1958–1960 – &quot;Small World&quot; (moderator and producer)

===United States Information Agency (USIA) Director===
Murrow resigned from CBS to accept a position as head of the United States Information Agency, parent of the Voice of America, in January 1961. President John F. Kennedy offered Murrow the position, which he viewed as &quot;a timely gift.&quot; CBS president Frank Stanton had reportedly been offered the job but declined, suggesting that Murrow be offered the job.

His appointment as head of the United States Information Agency was seen as a vote of confidence in the agency, which provided the official views of the government to the public in other nations. The USIA had been under fire during the McCarthy era, and Murrow reappointed at least one of McCarthy&#x27;s targets, Reed Harris. Murrow insisted on a high level of presidential access, telling Kennedy, &quot;If you want me in on the landings, I&#x27;d better be there for the takeoffs.&quot; However, the early effects of cancer kept him from taking an active role in the Bay of Pigs Invasion planning. He did advise the president during the Cuban Missile Crisis but was ill at the time the president was assassinated. Murrow was drawn into Vietnam because the USIA was assigned to convince reporters in Saigon that the government of Ngo Dinh Diem embodied the hopes and dreams of the Vietnamese people. Murrow knew the Diem government did no such thing. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Murrow did so but resigned in early 1964, citing illness. Before his departure, his last recommendation was of Barry Zorthian to be chief spokesman for the U.S. government in Saigon, Vietnam.

Murrow&#x27;s celebrity gave the agency a higher profile, which may have helped it earn more funds from Congress. His transfer to a governmental position—Murrow was a member of the National Security Council, led to an embarrassing incident shortly after taking the job; he asked the BBC not to show his documentary &quot;Harvest of Shame,&quot; in order not to damage the European view of the USA; however, the BBC refused as it had bought the program in good faith. British newspapers delighted in the irony of the situation, with one &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; writer saying: &quot;if Murrow builds up America as skillfully as he tore it to pieces last night, the propaganda war is as good as won.&quot;

==Death==
A chain smoker throughout his life, Murrow was almost never seen without his trademark Camel cigarette. It was reported that he smoked between sixty and sixty-five cigarettes a day, equivalent to roughly three packs. &quot;See It Now&quot; was the first television program to have a report about the connection between smoking and cancer. During the show, Murrow said, &quot;I doubt I could spend a half hour without a cigarette with any comfort or ease.&quot; He developed lung cancer and lived for two years after an operation to remove his left lung.

Murrow died at his home in Pawling, New York, on April 27, 1965, two days after his 57th birthday. His colleague and friend Eric Sevareid said of him, &quot;He was a shooting star; and we will live in his afterglow a very long time.&quot; CBS carried a memorial program, which included a rare on-camera appearance by William S. Paley, founder of CBS.

==Legacy==

After Murrow&#x27;s death, the Edward R. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy was established at Tufts University&#x27;s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Murrow&#x27;s library and selected artifacts are housed in the Murrow Memorial Reading Room that also serves as a special seminar classroom and meeting room for Fletcher activities. Murrow&#x27;s papers are available for research at the Digital Collections and Archives at Tufts, which has a website for the collection and makes many of the digitized papers available through the Tufts Digital Library.

The center awards Murrow fellowships to mid-career professionals who engage in research at Fletcher, ranging from the impact of the New World Information Order debate in the international media during the 1970s and 1980s to current telecommunications policies and regulations. Many distinguished journalists, diplomats, and policymakers have spent time at the center, among them David Halberstam, who worked on his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1972 book, &quot;The Best and the Brightest&quot;, as a writer-in-residence.

Veteran journalist Crocker Snow Jr. was named director of the Murrow Center in 2005.

In 1971 the RTNDA (Now Radio Television Digital News Association) established the Edward R. Murrow Awards, honoring outstanding achievement in the field of electronic journalism. There are four other awards also known as the &quot;Edward R. Murrow Award&quot;, including the one at Washington State University.

In 1973, Murrow&#x27;s alma mater, Washington State University, dedicated its expanded communication facilities the Edward R. Murrow Communications Center and established the annual Edward R. Murrow Symposium. In 1990, the WSU Department of Communications became the Edward R. Murrow School of Communication, followed on July 1, 2008, with the school becoming the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication. Veteran international journalist Lawrence Pintak is the college&#x27;s founding dean.

Several movies were filmed, either completely or partly about Murrow. In 1986, HBO broadcast the made-for-cable biographical movie, &quot;Murrow&quot;, with Daniel J. Travanti in the title role, and Robert Vaughn in a supporting role. In the 1999 film &quot;The Insider&quot;, Lowell Bergman, a television producer for the CBS news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, played by Al Pacino, is confronted by Mike Wallace, played by Christopher Plummer, after an exposé of the tobacco industry is edited down to suit CBS management and then, itself, gets exposed in the press for the self-censorship. Wallace passes Bergman an editorial printed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which accuses CBS of betraying the legacy of Edward R. Murrow. &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; is a 2005 Oscar-nominated film directed, co-starring and co-written by George Clooney about the conflict between Murrow and Joseph McCarthy on &quot;See It Now&quot;. Murrow is portrayed by actor David Strathairn, who received an Oscar nomination. In the film, Murrow&#x27;s conflict with CBS boss William Paley occurs immediately after his skirmish with McCarthy.

In 2003, Fleetwood Mac released their album &quot;Say You Will&quot;, featuring the track &quot;Murrow Turning Over in His Grave&quot;. On the track, Lindsey Buckingham reflects on current news media and claims &quot;Ed Murrow&quot; would be shocked at the bias and sensationalism displayed by reporters in the new century if he was alive.

In 2024, it was announced a stage adaption of the film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; co-written and starring George Clooney and directed by David Cromer will debut on Broadway.

<text>Karen Blanche Black (née Ziegler; July 1, 1939 – August 8, 2013) was an American actress, screenwriter, singer, and songwriter. She rose to prominence for her work in various studio and independent films in the 1970s, frequently portraying eccentric and offbeat characters, and established herself as a figure of New Hollywood. Her career spanned over 50 years and includes nearly 200 credits in both independent and mainstream films. Black received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Golden Globe Awards, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

A native of suburban Chicago, Black studied theater at Northwestern University before dropping out and relocating to New York City. She performed on Broadway in 1965 before making her major film debut in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; (1966). Black relocated to California and was cast as an LSD-tripping prostitute in Dennis Hopper&#x27;s road film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). That led to a co-starring role in the drama &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), in which she played a hopeless waitress, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. Black made her first major commercial picture with the disaster film &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), and her subsequent appearance as Myrtle Wilson in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974) won her a second Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.

Black played a glamorous country singer in Robert Altman&#x27;s ensemble musical drama &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), also writing and performing two songs for the soundtrack, for which she received a nomination for a Grammy Award. Her portrayal of an aspiring actress in John Schlesinger&#x27;s drama &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (also 1975) earned her a third Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actress. Black subsequently took on four roles in Dan Curtis&#x27; anthology horror film &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; (1975), followed by Curtis&#x27; supernatural horror feature, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (1976). The same year, she played a kidnapping accomplice in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s final film, &quot;Family Plot&quot;.

In 1982, Black played a transsexual in the Robert Altman-directed Broadway debut of &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;, a role she also reprised in Altman&#x27;s subsequent film adaptation. She next starred in the comedy &quot;Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?&quot; (1983), followed by Tobe Hooper&#x27;s remake of &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1986). For much of the 1990s and 2000s, Black starred in a variety of arthouse, independent, and horror films, as well as writing her own screenplays. She had a leading role as a villainous mother in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; (2003), which cemented her status as a cult horror icon. Black continued to star in low-profile films throughout the early 2010s, as well as working as a playwright before her death from ampullary cancer in 2013.

==Early life==

Black was born Karen Blanche Ziegler on July 1, 1939, in Park Ridge, Illinois, the third child of Elsie Mary (née Reif), a writer of several prize-winning children&#x27;s novels, and Norman Arthur Ziegler, an engineer and businessman. Her paternal grandfather was Arthur Charles Ziegler, a classical musician and first violinist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She had a brother and a sister, Gail Brown. Black was of German, Czech, and Norwegian descent. The Zieglers came to the United States from Neukirch, Württemberg, Germany.

Black and her siblings were raised at 224 N. Greenwood Ave. in Park Ridge, and often spent time on her uncle&#x27;s farm near Green Bay, Wisconsin. As a young teenager, she aspired to have a career as a stage actress, seeking out summer stock theater job opportunities. &quot;From the age of 13 I&#x27;d rush out during vacations to find work in summer stock,&quot; Black recalled. &quot;I started by cleaning toilets and by the time I was 16 I was a prop-girl and in the chorus line singing, and at 17 I got my first real acting, paid job.&quot;

Black attended Maine East High School for her freshman year and part of her sophomore year. She resumed her education at Jefferson High School in Lafayette, Indiana and attended Purdue University for one year, then transferred to Northwestern University, where she majored in theatre arts, studying under Alvina Krause. Black completed two years of studies at NU before dropping out. She later reflected on her training unfavorably, stating: 

==Career==
===1960–1970: Stage and film beginnings===

In 1960, Black moved to New York City to pursue an acting career, residing in a cold water flat in Manhattan. She took odd jobs working as a secretary, a front desk person at a hotel, and at an insurance office, and lived on &quot;thirty dollars a week.&quot; Black initially began performing with the Rockefeller Players, a theater troupe in Westwood, New Jersey. She briefly joined at the Actors Studio, but left shortly after enrolling, later commenting: &quot;How can a man who isn&#x27;t an actor teach you how to act?&quot;

Black made her screen debut with a minor role in the independent film &quot;The Prime Time&quot; (1960), which she would later deem &quot;the worst film ever made.&quot; Disillusioned by this foray into film, Black returned to work in theater. She worked as an understudy in the Broadway production of &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; in December 1961 under director George Abbott. She made her formal Broadway debut in 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Playroom&quot;, which received favorable reviews and for which she was nominated for a New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Actress.

In 1966, she appeared with José Ferrer in a stage production of &quot;After the Fall&quot; at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, earning an Angel award for best supporting actress. Black returned to film with a leading role in the comedy &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; (1966), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, portraying the love interest of a young male student. The film earned Black favorable reviews, and the experience prompted her to relocate to Los Angeles. Beginning in 1967, she appeared in guest roles in several television series, including &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

Her feature film career expanded in 1969, playing the role of an acid-tripping prostitute opposite Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in the counterculture film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;; the first choice for the role was Lana Wood, who had turned it down. Black&#x27;s sequence in the film was cut from 16 hours of footage. The following year, Black appeared as Rayette, the waitress girlfriend of Jack Nicholson, in the film &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and earned her first Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.

===1971–1979: Hollywood breakthrough and heyday===

Black had a supporting role as the girlfriend of a heroin addict in &quot;Born to Win&quot; (1971) opposite George Segal and Robert De Niro, followed by a role in Jack Nicholson&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Drive, He Said&quot;, as a promiscuous faculty wife; and the Western &quot;A Gunfight&quot;, opposite Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash, in which she portrayed a saloon barmaid. Black followed these roles with a part in &quot;Cisco Pike&quot; (1972) opposite Kris Kristofferson and Gene Hackman, and subsequently played a foul-mouthed fashion model in &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; (1972). She had a lead role opposite Christopher Plummer in the Canadian-produced horror film &quot;The Pyx&quot; (1973), playing a prostitute embroiled in a series of occult murders, and later appeared in &quot;The Outfit&quot; (1973) with Robert Duvall. Black had the titular role of Laura in the crime film &quot;Little Laura and Big John&quot; (1973), playing a runaway moll of the Ashley gang, a film which &quot;aped&quot; the success of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). Shortly after, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (1974) with Gene Wilder.

Black&#x27;s first major commercial film was the disaster feature &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), in which she played Nancy Pryor, a stewardess forced to fly a plane after a midair collision. She subsequently portrayed an unfaithful wife, Myrtle Wilson, in the 1974 version of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, a performance that earned her a second Golden Globe Award in the same category. In 1975, she played multiple roles in Dan Curtis&#x27; televised anthology film &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot;: The segments, all written by Richard Matheson, were named after the women involved in the plot — a plain college professor seemingly seduced by a handsome cad of a student (&quot;Julie&quot;), a pair of sisters who squabble over their father&#x27;s inheritance (&quot;Millicent and Therese&quot;), and the unknowing purchaser of a cursed Zuni fetish that comes to life and pursues her relentlessly (&quot;Amelia&quot;).

Black received her third Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for her role as an aspiring starlet in 1930s Hollywood in John Schlesinger&#x27;s tragic drama &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975). Though the film earned her critical notice, Black recalled the production being profoundly troubled and possibly hindering her career: 

The same year, she starred as a glamorous country singer in Robert Altman&#x27;s ensemble film &quot;Nashville&quot;. In addition to acting in the film, Black also wrote and performed two songs for the soundtrack, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack.

In 1976, Black appeared as a femme fatale jewel thief Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s final film, &quot;Family Plot&quot;. The film received mixed reviews, though Roger Ebert commented that Black &quot;does a good job in a role that doesn&#x27;t give her much to do.&quot; She also reunited with director Dan Curtis to star opposite Oliver Reed and Bette Davis in the supernatural horror film &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, playing the wife of a family living in a haunted house. Released in the fall of 1976, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; was deemed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as an &quot;outstanding terror movie&quot; with &quot;solid actors.&quot; Additionally, she had a lead role in the independent crime comedy &quot;Crime and Passion&quot; (1976), co-starring with Omar Sharif. Due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Family Plot&quot;, Black turned down Valerie Perrine&#x27;s role in &quot;W.C. Fields and Me&quot; (1976).

In September 1976, Black traveled to Toronto to be a guest star on the variety program &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot;, which aired across the United States and Canada. Black sang &quot;Lonely Now&quot;, and joined Bobby in a medley of country oldies. She played a dual role in the 1977 made-for-television thriller, &quot;The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver&quot;, followed by a minor role in &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978) opposite Elliott Gould. In 1979, Black appeared in the erotic drama &quot;In Praise of Older Women&quot;, which she regretted because she thought its title aged her.

===1980–1985: Career comedown===
In 1980, Black starred in a made-for-TV movie &quot;Police Story: Confessions of a Lady Cop&quot;. She subsequently starred in the drama &quot;Killing Heat&quot; (1981), based on Doris Lessing&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;The Grass Is Singing&quot;, which focused on race relations in South Africa in the 1960s; in the film, Black portrayed an urban woman who relocates to a rural farm with her husband. She also appeared as Émilienne d&#x27;Alençon in the French film &quot;Chanel Solitaire&quot; (1981), a biographical feature detailing the early life of Coco Chanel.

In 1982, Black starred opposite Cher and Sandy Dennis in a Robert Altman-directed Broadway production of &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;. She subsequently co-starred with Cher and Dennis in Altman&#x27;s film adaptation, also released in 1982. In both renditions, she portrayed the role of Joanne, a trans woman in a small Texas town. Black spent months preparing for the role, and &quot;did research into pretty depressing statistics about people who&#x27;ve become transsexuals and how they still don&#x27;t feel complete. I had to become a man, and I am not a man...  And that transition was so painful to me, to become a man, that I could use the pain of my actual transition for Joanne.&quot; While the Broadway production garnered Black some unfavorable reviews, Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Black&#x27;s performance in the film, writing that &quot;watching her in the movie, you can understand that what she&#x27;s doing as Joanna &quot;[sic]&quot; might depend on the intimacy of the camera to be both witty and credible.&quot;

Black next starred in the Henry Jaglom-directed comedy &quot;Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?&quot; (1983) playing a divorcee who becomes involved with a bachelor, followed by a lead in the teen-themed black comedy &quot;Bad Manners&quot; (1984). She also appeared in television during this period, with a guest-starring role as Sheila Sheinfeld on &quot;E/R&quot; between 1984 and 1985. She starred in several feature films in 1985, including the Italian exploitation horror film &quot;Cut and Run&quot;, directed by Ruggero Deodato; the Canadian supernatural horror film &quot;The Blue Man&quot;; and the action film &quot;Savage Dawn&quot;, co-starring with Lance Henriksen as a kidnappee.

===1986–2002: Independent films and horror roles===
In 1986, Black co-starred with her son, Hunter, in Tobe Hooper&#x27;s science fiction horror film &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;. She had a supporting role as a mutant&#x27;s mother in Larry Cohen&#x27;s horror sequel &quot;It&#x27;s Alive III: Island of the Alive&quot; (1987), and in the youth-themed comedy &quot;The Invisible Kid&quot; (1988). She co-starred with Jim Belushi and Whoopi Goldberg in &quot;Homer and Eddie&quot; (1989), a comedy about a woman (Goldberg) with a psychologically-impairing brain tumor, and a mentally-challenged man (Belushi). In 1990, Black had a supporting role in &quot;The Children&quot; (1990), a British adaptation of a novel by Edith Wharton, opposite Ben Kingsley, and in the science fiction comedy &quot;Zapped Again!&quot;.

Beginning in the 1990s, Black was more frequently cast in horror films. Among them were &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; (1990), in which she played a troubled mother; Gary Graver&#x27;s low-budget supernatural film &quot;Evil Spirits&quot; (1990); and &quot;Children of the Night&quot; (1991), in which she played an ancient vampire. She also had roles in the British comedy &quot;Rubin and Ed&quot; (1991), the martial arts film &quot;The Roller Blade Seven&quot; (also 1991), and a cameo in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot; (1992). Black reprised her role from &quot;The Roller Blade Seven&quot; in its 1992 and 1993 sequels, and appeared in the direct-to-video comedy &quot;The Double 0 Kid&quot; (1993), with Corey Haim and Nicole Eggert. Also in 1993, Black had a supporting role in George Sluizer&#x27;s drama &quot;Dark Blood&quot; opposite River Phoenix and Judy Davis, a film that remained incomplete and unreleased for two decades after Phoenix died during the production. In 1995, she starred in &quot;Plan 10 from Outer Space&quot;, a science fiction satire of Mormon theology, directed by Trent Harris.

In 1996, Black appeared as a paranoid mother in small-town Nebraska in &quot;Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering&quot;, opposite Naomi Watts. She had supporting roles in a number of other independent films that year, including as a public defender in Ulli Lommel&#x27;s drama &quot;Every Minute is Goodbye&quot;, and the exploitation comedy &quot;Dinosaur Valley Girls&quot;. The following year, she co-starred with Tilda Swinton as Lady Byron in the feminist science fiction feature &quot;Conceiving Ada&quot; (1997), about a contemporary scientist who uses software to make contact with the Victorian pioneer of computer programming Ada Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron. She also had supporting roles in the independent drama &quot;Men&quot;, and as a singer in rural Missouri in George Hickenlooper&#x27;s &quot;Dogtown&quot;.

She continued to star in independent films in 1998, including the camp comedy &quot;I Woke Up Early the Day I Died&quot;, the drama &quot;Charades&quot;, as well as the short film &quot;Waiting for Dr. MacGuffin&quot;. In 2000, Black began filming Rob Zombie&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, in which she portrayed Mother Firefly, the matron of a family of psychotic murderers. Upon its release in 2003, the film received largely unfavorable reviews, though it helped cement Black&#x27;s status as a cult icon in the horror genre.

===2003–2013: Establishment as cult figure; playwriting and later works===
As her later career progressed, Black gained a cult following, as alluded to by &quot;Family Guy&quot; television anchor Tom Tucker in his remark, &quot;Karen Black: what an obscure reference.&quot; in the episode &quot;Death Is a Bitch&quot; (season 2, episode 6). She co-starred with Natasha Lyonne in &quot;America Brown&quot; (2004), which won the Golden Zenith Award for Best Picture at the Montreal World Film Festival. In 2005, Black received the Best Actress Award at the Fantasporto International Film Festival in Porto, Portugal, for her work in the critically acclaimed Steve Balderson film &quot;Firecracker&quot; (2005), in which she played two roles, Sandra and Eleanor. She and actor John Hurt were also presented with Career Achievement Awards.

Black launched a career as a playwright in May 2007 with the opening of &quot;Missouri Waltz&quot; at the Blank Theater in Los Angeles; Black starred in the play as well. She also performed live narrations of Guy Maddin&#x27;s experimental film &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; in 2007, touring the show around the United States. 

In 2009, Black worked with director Steve Balderson for &quot;Stuck!&quot;, a homage to film noir women-in-prison dramas, which co-starred Mink Stole, Pleasant Gehman and Jane Wiedlin. She starred in John Landis&#x27; 2010 thriller &quot;Some Guy Who Kills People&quot;, as well as Aïda Ruilova&#x27;s surrealist short film &quot;Meet the Eye&quot; (2009). Later that year, Black appeared on Cass McCombs&#x27; song &quot;Dreams-Come-True-Girl&quot; from the album &quot;Catacombs&quot;.

The experimental hip-hop group Death Grips released a video on YouTube called &quot;Bottomless Pit&quot; in October 2015. The video shows footage of Black reciting lines from a film script written by the group&#x27;s drummer/co-producer Zach Hill. The footage was shot in early 2013.

==Image and acting style==

Due to her work in various independent and mainstream films in the 1970s, Black is considered by film historians as a prominent figure of New Hollywood, and was described in 2004 by Howard Feinstein in the LGBT magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s off-center icon.&quot; She was prolific throughout her career, sometimes appearing in as many as seven films a year, and favored working in independent films: &quot;That&#x27;s my world—independent features,&quot; she stated in 2007. &quot;That&#x27;s how I started. That&#x27;s what I like. It&#x27;s playful and comfortable and not stressful, and it&#x27;s an individual&#x27;s way of creating. You&#x27;re not in the studio system imitating other people and yourself. I&#x27;m having a good life.&quot;

In her later life, Black spoke unfavorably of the formal study of acting, and commented that she found her training both in the university (under Alvina Krause) and at the Actors Studio unhelpful and oppressive. Also a writer, Black likened her acting process to that of writing screenplays or other literature: &quot;Everything that occurs in this zone is imagination-based. In that sense you mock up a life, and then you become the effect of what you&#x27;ve mocked up, so it&#x27;s cause and effect. So the more you can mock it up so that it seems real to you, the more you can react to the effect. That&#x27;s what acting is, and that&#x27;s what writing involves for me, too. That&#x27;s the simplicity of it. It sounds simple, because it is.&quot; Black considered herself a character actress.

Throughout her career, Black was noted for her distinctive eyes, which gave her a slightly &quot;cross-eyed&quot; appearance, although she stated in a 1982 interview that she had not been clinically diagnosed as such. One reviewer once described her as a &quot;lopsided caricature of a pretty face.&quot; For much of her career, Black was typecast as an unglamorous or lowly woman of limited intelligence. Beginning in the 1990s, Black began garnering a cult following for her appearances in horror films, though she clarified in 2008 that she had acted only in &quot;about 14&quot; out of her wide-ranging filmography. &quot;When I did &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot;, with that [demon] doll, I filled the role very well,&quot; she recalled. &quot;It was very real to people, and they just fell in love with it. And that got to be incredibly popular. With my last name being Black ... so it got to be kind of an unconscious thing, [my association with horror movies]. But I&#x27;m not interested in blood.&quot;

==Beliefs==
In 1964, Black became a Scientologist, and practiced it for the remainder of her life. She was a vocal proponent of gay rights, commenting in 2007: &quot;I&#x27;m for gay rights. Who you are is very sacred, and should be honored—no matter what gender you were born. You shouldn&#x27;t feel like you have to dodge some sort of conformity.&quot; Black also advocated animal rights and was critical of the fur industry, once posing in a Halloween-themed anti-fur advertisement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

==Personal life==
Black was married four times and called off two engagements. Three of her marriages ended in divorce, while the fourth lasted nearly 30 years and ended only at death.

She became pregnant the first time she had sex, with her boyfriend Charles Black. He was 18; she was 15. They were driven to Alabama where they could marry with parental consent, then moved to Muncie, Indiana, where Charles attended college. Black had a miscarriage, to her relief, but when she returned home, her father barred her from returning, so she drove back to Muncie. The marriage was short-lived, although she retained Charles&#x27; surname, under which she would come to be credited throughout her career.

While a student at Northwestern University, Black began dating classmate Robert Benedetti. She got pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter on March 4, 1959. She did not tell her parents about the pregnancy, and put her daughter up for adoption at birth; she reconnected with her in 2012.

Boyfriends during the 1960s included writer Henry Jaglom and actors Peter Kastner and Paul Sorvino. From 1971 to 1972, Black was engaged to music manager Peter Rachtman. Rachtman&#x27;s daughter Karyn would remain a lifelong friend, delivering a eulogy at Black&#x27;s memorial service.

On April 17, 1973, Black married actor Robert &quot;Skip&quot; Burton. They appeared together in the first segment of &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; (1975), but had separated by the time it premiered.

In January 1975, Black met screenwriter L. M. Kit Carson in Beverly Hills during an interview for &quot;Oui&quot; magazine. They married on July 4 of that year when she was pregnant with their son Hunter. Black and Carson separated in 1980 and divorced in 1983. In 1989, when Hunter was 13, he decided to live with his father and stepmother in Dallas; he did not see Black for a decade.

In 1981, Black announced her engagement to Michael Raeburn, who wrote the screenplay for her low-budget star vehicle &quot;Killing Heat&quot;. The two did not marry. Black&#x27;s next significant relationship was with Paul Williams, who directed her in 1982&#x27;s &quot;Miss Right&quot;.

In August 1983, Black met her fourth husband, film editor Stephen Eckelberry, at a Scientology retreat in Clearwater, Florida. The couple married on September 27, 1987, and adopted a daughter, who acted with her parents in the film &quot;Movies Money Murder&quot;. Black and Eckelberry remained married until her death in 2013.

Fellow Scientologist actress Lee Purcell was Black&#x27;s best friend for 43 years. Other close friends included Harriet Schock and Angela Garcia Combs.

==Illness and death==
In November 2010, Black was diagnosed with ampullary cancer. She had a portion of her pancreas removed and underwent two further operations. She was invited to attend the premiere of the salvaged feature film &quot;Dark Blood&quot;, in which she had played a small part in the original early 1990s shoot. Black was unable to attend the event, held in the Netherlands in September 2012, due to her illness.

On August 8, 2013, Black died at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles, from the ampullary cancer, aged 74. It was a relatively early death, as her mother had lived to be 97. Black&#x27;s funeral was held on August 19 in Oceanside, California, followed by a Hollywood memorial on September 17.

Actress Juliette Lewis paid tribute, saying &quot;Karen Black was my mentor and a second mother to me. She inspired everyone she came in contact with.&quot; Peter Fonda, her co-star in &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, commented upon her death: &quot;[Karen] managed to play kooky, she managed to play sexy, she managed to play crazed. She managed to play all the different ways of human nature.&quot; Black is interred at Eternal Hills Memorial Park in Oceanside.

<doc id="154147" wikidata="Q1210705" url="?curid=154147" title="Limerence">
<text>Limerence is a state of mind resulting from romantic feelings for another person. It typically involves intrusive and melancholic thoughts, or tragic concerns for the object of one&#x27;s affection, along with a desire for the reciprocation of one&#x27;s feelings and to form a relationship with the object of love.

Psychologist Dorothy Tennov coined the term &quot;limerence&quot; as an alteration of &quot;amorance&quot; without other etymologies to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the 1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love. In her book &quot;Love and Limerence&quot;, she writes that &quot;to be in a state of limerence is to feel what is usually termed &#x27;being in love. She coined the term to disambiguate the state from other less-overwhelming emotions, and to avoid the implication that those who do not experience it are not capable of experiencing love.

According to Tennov and others, limerence can be considered falling in love, romantic love, passionate love, infatuation or lovesickness. Later in her life, Tennov compared limerence to love madness. Limerence is also sometimes compared and contrasted with a crush, with limerence being much more intense.

&quot;Love and Limerence&quot; has been called the seminal work on romantic love. Anthropologist and author Helen Fisher wrote that data collection on romantic attraction started with Tennov collecting survey results, diaries, and other personal accounts. Fisher, who knew Tennov and corresponded with her, has commented that Tennov&#x27;s concept had a sad component to it.

==Overview==
Dorothy Tennov&#x27;s concept represents a scientific attempt at studying the nature of romantic love. She identified a suite of psychological traits associated with being in love, which she called limerence. Other authors have also considered limerence to be an emotional and motivational state for focusing attention on a preferred mating partner or an attachment process.

Joe Beam calls limerence the feeling of being madly in love. Nicky Hayes describes it as &quot;a kind of infatuated, all-absorbing passion&quot;, the type of love Dante felt towards Beatrice or that of Romeo and Juliet. It is this unfulfilled, intense longing for the other person which defines limerence, where the individual becomes &quot;more or less obsessed by that person and spends much of their time fantasising about them&quot;. Hayes suggests that &quot;it is the unobtainable nature of the goal which makes the feeling so powerful&quot;, and occasional, intermittent reinforcement may be required to support the underlying feelings.

Severus Snape&#x27;s love for Lily Evans, the mother of Harry Potter, is a modern fictional representation of limerence. Another famous historical example was the tumultuous affair between Lord Byron and Lady Caroline Lamb.

A central feature of limerence for Tennov was the fact that her participants really saw the object of their affection&#x27;s personal flaws, but simply overlooked them or found them attractive. Tennov calls this &quot;crystallization&quot;, after a description by the French writer Stendhal. This &quot;crystallized&quot; version of a love object, with accentuated features, is what Tennov calls a &quot;limerent object&quot;, or &quot;LO&quot;.

Limerence has psychological properties akin to passionate love, but in Tennov&#x27;s conception, limerence begins outside of a relationship and before the person experiencing it knows for certain whether it&#x27;s reciprocated. Tennov observes that limerence is therefore frequently unrequited and argues that some type of situational uncertainty is required for the intense mental preoccupation to occur. Uncertainty could be, for example, barriers to the fulfillment of a relationship such as physical or emotional distance from the LO, or uncertainty about how the LO reciprocates the feeling. Some people may also fear intimacy so that they distance themselves and avoid a real connection.

Not everyone experiences limerence. Tennov estimates that 50% of women and 35% of men experience limerence based on answers to certain survey questions she administered. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often derided and dismissed as undesirable, some kind of pathology, ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction. According to Tennov, limerence is not a mental illness, although it can be &quot;highly disruptive and extremely painful&quot;, &quot;irrational, silly, embarrassing, and abnormal&quot; or sometimes &quot;the greatest happiness&quot; depending on who is asked.

==Components==
The original components of limerence, from &quot;Love and Limerence&quot;, were:
* intrusive thinking about the object of your passionate desire (the limerent object or &quot;LO&quot;), who is a possible sexual partner
* acute longing for reciprocation
* dependency of mood on LO&#x27;s actions or, more accurately, your interpretation of LO&#x27;s actions with respect to the probability of reciprocation
* inability to react &quot;limerently&quot; to more than one person at a time (exceptions occur only when limerence is at low ebb—early on or in the last fading)
* some fleeting and transient relief from unrequited limerent passion through vivid imagination of action by LO that means reciprocation
* fear of rejection and sometimes incapacitating but always unsettling shyness in LO&#x27;s presence, especially in the beginning and whenever uncertainty strikes
* intensification through adversity (at least, up to a point)
* acute sensitivity to any act or thought or condition that can be interpreted favorably, and an extraordinary ability to devise or invent &quot;reasonable&quot; explanations for why the neutrality that the disinterested observer might see is in fact a sign of hidden passion in the LO
* an aching of the &quot;heart&quot; (a region in the center front of the chest) when uncertainty is strong
* buoyancy (a feeling of walking on air) when reciprocation seems evident
* a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background
* a remarkable ability to emphasize what is truly admirable in LO and to avoid dwelling on the negative, even to respond with a compassion for the negative and render it, emotionally if not perceptually, into another positive attribute.

== Relation to other concepts ==

=== Love ===
Dorothy Tennov gives several reasons for inventing a term for the state denoted by limerence (usually termed &quot;being in love&quot;). One principle reason is to resolve ambiguities with the word &quot;love&quot; being used both to refer to an act which is chosen, as well as to a state which is endured:Many writers on love have complained about semantic difficulties. The dictionary lists two dozen different meanings of the word &quot;love&quot;. And how does one distinguish between love and affection, liking, fondness, caring, concern, infatuation, attraction, or desire? [...] Acknowledgment of a distinction between love as a verb, as an action taken by the individual, and love as a state is awkward. Never having fallen in love is not at all a matter of not loving, if loving is defined as caring. Furthermore, this state of &quot;being in love&quot; included feelings that do not properly fit with love defined as concern.(The type of love that focuses on caring for others is called compassionate love or agape.)

The other principle reason given is that she encountered people who do not experience the state. The first such person Tennov discovered was a long-time friend, Helen Payne, whose unfamiliarity with the state of limerence emerged during a conversation on an airplane flight together. Tennov writes that &quot;describing the intricacies of romantic attachments&quot; to Helen was &quot;like trying to describe the color red to one blind from birth&quot;. Tennov labels such people &quot;nonlimerents&quot; (a person not currently experiencing limerence), but cautions that it seemed to her that there is no nonlimerent personality and that potentially anyone could experience the state of limerence. Tennov says:I adopted the view that never being in this state was neither more nor less pathological than experiencing it. I wanted to be able to speak about this reliably identifiable condition without giving love&#x27;s advocates the feeling something precious was being destroyed. Even more important, if using the term &quot;love&quot; denoted the presence of the state, there was the danger that absence of the state would receive negative connotations.Tennov addresses the issue of whether limerence is love in several other passages. In one passage she clearly says that limerence is love, at least in certain cases:In fully developed limerence, you feel &quot;additionally&quot; what is, in other contexts as well, called love—an extreme degree of feeling that you want LO to be safe, cared for, happy, and all those other positive and noble feelings that you might feel for your children, your parents, and your dearest friends. That&#x27;s probably why limerence is called love in all languages. [...] Surely limerence is love at its highest and most glorious peak.However, Tennov then switches in tone and tells a fairly negative story of the pain felt by a woman reminiscing over the time she wasted pining for a man she now feels nothing towards, something which occupied her in a time when her father was still alive and her children &quot;were adorable babies who needed their mother&#x27;s attention.&quot; Tennov says this is why we distinguish limerence (this &quot;love&quot;) from other loves.

In another passage, Tennov says that while affection and fondness do not demand anything in return, the return of feelings desired in the limerent state means that &quot;Other aspects of your life, including love, are sacrificed in behalf of the all-consuming need.&quot; and that &quot;While limerence has been called love, it is not love.&quot;

=== Romantic love ===
Dorothy Tennov sometimes considers limerence to be synonymous with the term &quot;romantic love&quot;. This term has a complicated history with an evolving definition, but the sense in which Tennov uses it originates from a literary tradition of stories depicting tragic or unfulfilled love. Some examples of romantic love stories in this vein are Layla and Majnun, Tristan and Iseult, Dante and Beatrice (from &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;), Romeo and Juliet and &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;.

In this sense, romantic love is idealized, unrealistic and irrational, the kind of love often found in a fairy-tale depicting a tragedy. This can be contrasted with rational, practical and pragmatic love, or the kind of love found in steady, long-term relationships.

The literary genre of romantic love dates back to troubadour poetry from the middle-ages (or earlier) and the doctrine of courtly love. Tennov credits the cleric Andreas Capellanus as describing the state of limerence &quot;very accurately&quot; in &quot;The Art of Courtly Love&quot;, a book of statutes for the &quot;proper&quot; conduct of lovers. The work includes rules such as &quot;A true lover is constantly and without intermission possessed by the thoughts of his beloved.&quot; and &quot;The easy attainment of love makes it of little value; difficulty of attainment makes it prized.&quot; This work helped spread the cultural doctrine of romantic love throughout Europe. Because of the literary and cultural origins of the term, the romantic love phenomenon is sometimes held to be socially constructed (especially by critics, according to Tennov); however, Tennov argues that limerence has a biological basis and evolutionary purpose.

Romantic love is also often used as a synonym for passionate love, also called &quot;being in love&quot;, and also often associated with limerence. Academic literature has never universally adopted a single term for this. Helen Fisher has commented that she prefers the term &quot;romantic love&quot; because she thinks it has meaning in society.

=== Passionate and companionate love ===
Limerence has been compared to passionate love, with Elaine Hatfield considering them synonymous or commenting in 2016 that they are &quot;much the same&quot;. Passionate love is described as:

A state of intense longing for union with an other. Reciprocated love (union with the other) is associated with fulfillment and ecstasy. Unrequited love (separation) with emptiness; with anxiety, or despair. A state of profound physiological arousal.

Many other academics also consider these synonymous, such as Bianca Acevedo &amp; Arthur Aron:Passionate love, &quot;a state of intense longing for union with another&quot; (Hatfield &amp; Rapson, 1993, p. 5), also referred to as &quot;being in love&quot; (Meyers &amp; Berscheid, 1997), &quot;infatuation&quot; (Fisher, 1998), and &quot;limerence&quot; (Tennov, 1979), includes an obsessive element, characterized by intrusive thinking, uncertainty, and mood swings.Passionate love is linked to &quot;passion&quot;, as in intense emotion, for example, joy and fulfillment, but also anguish and agony. Hatfield notes that the original meaning of passion &quot;&quot;was&quot; agony—as in Christ&#x27;s passion.&quot; Passionate love is contrasted with companionate love, which is &quot;the affection we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply entwined&quot;. Companionate love is felt less intensely and often follows after passionate love in a relationship.

In &quot;Love and Limerence,&quot; Dorothy Tennov also lists passionate love among several synonyms for limerence, and refers to one of Hatfield&#x27;s early writings on the subject. However, Tennov says that one of the guiding points of her study was to focus on the aspects of love that produced distress. She has also said that one of the problems she encountered in her studies is that her interview subjects would use terms like &quot;passionate love&quot;, &quot;romantic love&quot; and &quot;being in love&quot; to refer to mental states other than what she refers to as limerence. For example, some of her nonlimerent interviewees would use the word &quot;obsession&quot;, yet not report the intrusive thoughts necessary to limerence, only that &quot;thoughts of the person are frequent and pleasurable&quot;.

=== Infatuation ===
Various authors have considered &quot;infatuation&quot; to be a synonym for both passionate love and limerence. Dorothy Tennov has stated that she did not use the word &quot;infatuation&quot; because while there is overlap, the word evokes different connotations. In one type of distinction, people use &quot;infatuation&quot; to express disapproval or to refer to unsatisfactory relationships, and &quot;love&quot; to refer to satisfactory ones. In &quot;Love and Limerence&quot;, Tennov considers &quot;infatuation&quot; to be a pejorative, for example often being used as a label for teenage limerent fantasizing and obsession with a celebrity.

In the triangular theory of love, by Robert Sternberg, &quot;infatuation&quot; refers to romantic passion without intimacy (or closeness) and without commitment. Sternberg has stated that infatuation in his theory is essentially the same as limerence. Another related concept (which also has qualities reminiscent of limerence) is &quot;fatuous love&quot;, which is romantic passion &quot;with&quot; a commitment made in the absence of intimacy. This can be, for example, lovers in the throes of new passion who commit to marry without really knowing each other well enough to know if they are suitable partners. In this situation, their passion usually wanes over time, turning into a commitment alone (called &quot;empty love&quot;) and they become unhappy.

=== Independent emotion systems ===
Helen Fisher&#x27;s popular theory of independent emotion systems posits that there are three primary biological systems involved with human reproduction, mating and parenting: &quot;lust&quot; (the sex drive, or sexual desire), &quot;attraction&quot; (passionate love, infatuation or limerence) and &quot;attachment&quot; (companionate love). These three systems regularly work in concert together but serve different purposes and can also work independently. Independent emotions theory has been critiqued as being oversimplified, but the general idea of separate systems remains useful.

When limerence is a component in an affair, for example, Fisher&#x27;s theory can be used to help explain this. Fisher&#x27;s theory is that while a person can feel deep attachment for a long-term spouse, they can &quot;also&quot; feel limerence for somebody else, just as how one can also feel sexual attraction towards other people. Joe Beam comments that if somebody in a committed relationship ends up in limerence like this, it will pull them out of their relationship.

Fisher&#x27;s theory has also been used to explain why some people can feel &quot;platonic&quot; limerence without sexual desire, because sexual desire is separate from romantic love. Lisa Diamond argues this is possible even in contradiction to one&#x27;s sexual orientation, because the brain systems evolved by repurposing the systems for mother-infant bonding (a process called exaptation). According to this theory, it would not have been adaptive for a parent to only be able to bond with an opposite sex child, so the systems must have evolved independent of sexual orientation. People most often fall in love because of sexual desire, but Diamond suggests time spent together and physical touch can serve as a substitute. In Dorothy Tennov&#x27;s conception, sexual attraction was an essential component of limerence (as a generalization); however she did note that occasionally people described to her what seemed to fit the pattern of limerence, but without sexual attraction. Additionally, for those who do have a sexual interest, their desire for emotional union and commitment is a far greater concern to them.

=== Attachment theory ===
Attachment theory refers to John Bowlby&#x27;s concept of an &quot;attachment system&quot;, a system evolved to keep infants in proximity of their caregiver (or &quot;attachment figure&quot;). A person uses their attachment figure as a &quot;secure base&quot; to feel safe exploring the environment, seeks proximity with the attachment figure when threatened, and suffers distress when separated. A prominent theory suggests this system is reused for adult pair bonds, as an exaptation or co-option, whereby a given trait takes on a new purpose. Attachment style refers to differences in attachment-related thoughts and behaviors, especially relating to the concept of security vs. insecurity. This can be split into components of anxiety (worrying the partner is available, attentive and responsive) and avoidance (preference not to rely on others or open up emotionally).

In Helen Fisher&#x27;s taxonomy, limerence and attachment are considered different systems with different purposes. In the past, other authors have also suggested that limerence could be related to the anxious attachment style. However, in their original 1987 paper conceptualizing romantic love as an attachment process (and relating limerence to attachment style), Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver also caution that they are not implying that the early phase of romance is equivalent to being attached.

A 1990 study found that the 15% of participants who self-reported an anxious attachment style scored highly on limerence measures (especially obsessive preoccupation and emotional dependence scales), but found considerable overlap of distributions between all three attachment styles and limerence. Studies and a meta-analysis by Bianca Acevedo &amp; Arthur Aron found that while romantic obsession is associated with relationship satisfaction in short-term relationships, it is associated with slightly decreased satisfaction over the long-term and they speculate this could be related to insecure attachment.

=== Love styles ===
Love styles are a concept invented by the sociologist John Alan Lee which can be understood as different ways to love, or different kinds of love stories. Limerence is sometimes considered similar or related to the love style mania (or manic love), named after the Greek &quot;theia mania&quot; (the madness from the gods). Lee developed his concept of manic love in relation to some of the same sources as Tennov, such as Andreas Capellanus and courtly love.

A manic lover is obsessively preoccupied with the beloved. When asked to recall their childhood, a typical manic lover recalls it as unhappy, and they are usually lonely, dissatisfied adults. They are anxious to fall in love; however, they are unsure of which physical type they prefer. Because they are unsure of who to fall in love with, they often fall in love with somebody quite inappropriate (even somebody they initially dislike) and project onto them qualities they want but do not actually have. According to Lee, &quot;Mania can become almost an addiction nearly impossible for the addict to end on his own initiative.&quot; Mania is often the first love style of a young person, but others may not experience it until middle age—for example, after a marriage has lost its interest. According to Lee, a cycle of manic loves is often caused by a desperate need to be in love, the cause of which the manic lover must locate and remedy to break free.

While Lee describes the manic lover as jealous, Tennov states that people can be limerent and not be jealous. Rather, according to Tennov, what a limerent person desires is exclusivity and this is often mistaken for jealousy.

Among the other love styles, mania can be closely compared to eros (or erotic love). Both are often considered &quot;romantic love&quot;, and mania and eros taken together correspond to passionate love. Like the manic lover, the erotic lover is also intensely preoccupied with their beloved, but the thoughts are optimistic while a manic lover is insecure. Unlike a manic lover, the erotic lover is aware of which physical type they consider ideal. As such, eros begins with a powerful initial attraction, referred to by Stendhal as &quot;a sudden sensation of recognition and hope&quot;. The erotic lover also recalls their childhood as happy and eros has been associated with secure attachment, while mania has been associated with attachment anxiety.

According to Lee, the love style ludus (noncommittal love as a game, avoidance and juggling multiple partners) and mania possess a &quot;fatal attraction&quot; for one another. It&#x27;s surprisingly common, but not a good match for happy, mutual love.

===Erotomania===

Limerence is sometimes compared to erotomania; however, erotomania is defined as a delusional disorder where the sufferer has a delusional belief that the object of their affection is madly in love with them when they are not. A person suffering from erotomania might interpret subtle, irrelevant details (such as their love object wearing a particular accessory) as coded declarations of love, and the sufferer will invent ways to interpret outright rejections as unserious so they can continue believing the object is secretly in love with them.

According to Dorothy Tennov, a person experiencing limerence might misinterpret signals and falsely believe that their LO reciprocates the feeling when they do not, but they are receptive to negative cues, especially when receiving a clear rejection.

=== Love addiction ===
Because limerence is compared to addiction, it is sometimes compared to or contrasted with what is called &quot;love addiction&quot;, although according to modern research all romantic love may work like an addiction at the level of the brain. There&#x27;s an academic discussion over whether all love is an addiction, or whether &quot;love addiction&quot; only refers to brain processes which could be considered abnormal. The term has had an amorphous definition over the years and it does not yet denote a psychiatric condition, but recently one definition has been developed that &quot;Individuals addicted to love tend to experience negative moods and affects when away from their partners and have the strong urge and craving to see their partner as a way of coping with stressful situations.&quot; This definition is given in terms of a relationship, although limerence is usually unrequited.

==Evolutionary purpose==
In a 1998 essay, as well as in &quot;Love and Limerence&quot;, Dorothy Tennov has speculated that limerence has an evolutionary purpose.

For what ultimate cause might the state of limerence be a proximate cause? In other words, why were people who became limerent successful, maybe more successful than others, in passing their genes on to succeeding generations back a few hundred thousand or million years ago when heads grew larger and fathers who left mother and child to fend for themselves were less &quot;reproductively successful&quot;—in the long run, that is (Morgan 1993). Did limerence evolve to cement a relationship long enough to get the offspring up and running? [...] The most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment, the establishment of a shared domicile in the form of a cozy nest built for the enjoyment of ecstasy, for reproduction, and for the rearing of children.

Helen Fisher&#x27;s components of romantic attraction are largely derived from Tennov&#x27;s components of limerence, and in a similar vein as Tennov, Fisher has theorized that this &#x27;attraction&#x27; system evolved to facilitate mammalian mate choice. Tennov has suggested that if the neurophysiological &quot;machinery&quot; for limerence is not a universal among all humans, then having both phenotypes (limerent and nonlimerent) in the population might be beneficial and an evolutionarily stable strategy.

==Characteristics==

=== Addiction ===
Limerence has been called an addiction. The early stage of romantic love is comparable to a behavioral addiction (i.e. addiction to a non-substance) but the &quot;substance&quot; involved is the loved person. A team led by Helen Fisher used fMRI to find that people who had &quot;just fallen madly in love&quot; showed activation in an area of the brain called the ventral tegmental area, which projects dopamine to other brain areas, while looking at a photograph of their beloved. This as well as activity in other key areas supports the theory that people in love experience what is called incentive salience in response to the loved person, which could be a result of oxytocin activity in motivation pathways in the brain.

Incentive salience is the property by which cues in the environment stand out to a person and become attention-grabbing and attractive, like a &quot;motivational magnet&quot; which pulls a person towards a particular reward. The phenomenon Tennov describes as a loved one taking on a &quot;special meaning&quot; to the person in love is believed to be related to this heightened salience in response to the loved one.

In addiction research, a distinction is also drawn between &quot;wanting&quot; a reward (i.e. incentive salience, tied to mesocorticolimbic dopamine) and &quot;liking&quot; a reward (i.e. pleasure, tied to hedonic hotspots), aspects which are dissociable. People can be addicted to drugs and compulsively seek them out, even when taking the drug no longer results in a high or the addiction is detrimental to one&#x27;s life. They can also &quot;want&quot; (i.e. feel compelled towards, in the sense of incentive salience) something which they do not cognitively wish for. In a similar way, people who are in love may &quot;want&quot; a loved person even when interactions with them are not pleasurable. For example, they may want to contact an ex-partner after a rejection, even when the experience will only be painful. It is also possible for a person to be &quot;in love&quot; with somebody they do not like, or who treats them poorly. Fisher&#x27;s team proposes that romantic love is a &quot;positive addiction&quot; (i.e. not harmful) when requited and a &quot;negative addiction&quot; when unrequited or inappropriate.

In brain scans of long-term romantic love (involving subjects who professed to be &quot;madly&quot; in love, but were together with their partner 10 years or more), attraction similar to early-stage romantic love was associated with dopamine reward center activity (&quot;wanting&quot;), but long-term attachment was associated with the globus palludus, a site for opiate receptors identified as a hedonic hotspot (&quot;liking&quot;). Long-term romantic lovers also showed lower levels of obsession compared to those in the early stage.

===Lovesickness===
Limerence is usually unrequited, and a horrible experience for the limerent person. Limerence is debilitating for some people. Lovesickness is a state of mind characterized by addictive cravings, frustration, depression, melancholy and intrusive thinking. In Dorothy Tennov&#x27;s survey group, 42% reported being &quot;severely depressed about a love affair&quot;. Other effects are distraction and self-isolation. Fisher&#x27;s fMRI scans of rejected lovers showed activation in brain areas associated with physical pain, craving and assessing one&#x27;s gains and losses. Tennov describes being under the spell herself, saying &quot;Before it happened, I couldn&#x27;t have imagined it[.] Now, I wouldn&#x27;t want to have it happen again.&quot; Some people even described to her incidents of self-injury, but Tennov maintains that limerence on its own is normal and tragedies involve additional factors.

Lovesickness has been pathologized in previous centuries, but is not currently in the ICD-10, ICPC or DSM-5. Author and psychologist Frank Tallis has made the argument that all love—even normal love—is largely indistinguishable from mental illness. In his view, the ethical dilemma behind the notion that love could be a psychopathology can be resolved by suggesting that there is no difference between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; when it comes to love. There is also an ethical debate over the implications of using modern drugs for this type of thing. Bioethicist Brian Earp and colleagues have argued that the voluntary use of anti-love biotechnology (for example, a drug made to cause the person who uses it to fall out of love) could be ethical. However, there is currently no drug which is a realistic candidate.

Although limerence was not intended to denote an abnormal state and lovesickness is no longer recognized as a medical condition, symptoms still bear a resemblance to many entries in the DSM. For example, when people fall in love, there are four core symptoms: preoccupation, episodes of melancholy, episodes of rapture and instability of mood. These correspond with conventional diagnoses of obsessionality (or OCD), depression, mania (or hypomania) and manic depression. Other examples are physical symptoms similar to panic attacks (pounding heart, trembling, shortness of breath and lightheadedness), excessive worry about the future which resembles generalized anxiety disorder, appetite disturbance and sensitivity about one&#x27;s appearance which resembles anorexia nervosa, and the feeling that life has become a dream which resembles derealization and depersonalization.

There&#x27;s a scholarly debate about the involuntary nature of romantic love. The notion that falling in love is an involuntary process is different from the issue of whether one&#x27;s behavior can be considered autonomous while in love. Tallis argues that love evolved to override rationality so that one finds a lover and reproduces regardless of the personal costs of bearing and raising a child. He uses the example of Charles Darwin who, never being romantic, is said to have sat and made a list of reasons to marry or not to marry. Being accustomed to total freedom and worrying about such things as financial austerities that would limit his expenditure on books, Darwin found his reasons not to marry greatly outweighed his reasons to marry. However, shortly thereafter Darwin unexpectedly fell in love, suddenly becoming preoccupied with cozy images of married life and thus quickly converting from bachelor to husband. Tallis writes:At first sight, it seems extraordinary that evolutionary forces might conspire to shape something that looks like a mental illness to ensure reproductive success. Yet, there are many reasons why love should have evolved to share with madness several features—the most notable of which is the loss of reason. Like the ancient humoral model of love sickness, evolutionary principles seem to have necessitated a blurring of the distinction between normal and abnormal states. Evolution expects us to love madly, lest we fail to love at all.

According to Tennov, &quot;Love has been called a madness and an affliction at least since the time of the ancient Greeks and probably earlier than that.&quot; Historical accounts of lovesickness attribute it, for example, to being struck by an arrow shot by Eros, to a sickness entering through the eyes (similar to the evil eye), to an excess of black bile, or to spells, potions and other magic. Attempts to treat lovesickness have been made throughout history using a variety of plants, natural products, charms and rituals. The first known treatise on lovesickness is &quot;Remedia Amoris&quot;, by the poet Ovid.

=== Crystallization ===
Crystallization, for Tennov, is the &quot;remarkable ability to emphasize what is truly admirable in LO and to avoid dwelling on the negative, even to respond with a compassion for the negative and render it, emotionally if not perceptually, into another positive attribute.&quot; Tennov borrows the term from the French writer Stendhal from his 1821 treatise on love, &quot;De l&#x27;Amour&quot;, in which he describes an analogy where a tree branch is tossed into a salt mine. After remaining there for several months, the tree branch (or twig) becomes covered in salt crystals which transform it &quot;into an object of shimmering beauty&quot;. In the same way, unattractive characteristics of an LO are given little to no attention so that the LO is seen in the most favorable light. One of Tennov&#x27;s interviewees, Lenore, says:Yes I knew he gambled, I knew he sometimes drank too much, and I knew he didn&#x27;t read a book from one year to the next. &quot;I knew&quot; and I didn&#x27;t know. I knew it but I didn&#x27;t incorporate it into the overall image. I dwelt on his wavy hair, the way he looked at me, the thought of his driving to work in the morning, his charm (that I believed must surely affect everyone he met), the flowers he sent, the considerations he had shown to my sister&#x27;s children at the picnic last summer, the feeling I had when we were in close physical contact, the way he mixed a martini, his laugh, the hair on the back of his hand. Okay! I know it&#x27;s crazy, that my list of &#x27;positives&#x27; sounds silly, but those &quot;are&quot; the things I think of, remember, and, yes, want back again!This kind of &quot;misperception&quot; or &quot;love is blind&quot; bias is more often referred to as &quot;idealization&quot;, which modern research considers to be a form of positive illusions. For example, a 1996 study found that &quot;Individuals were happier in their relationships when they idealized their partners and their partners idealized them.&quot; However, Tennov argues against the term &quot;idealization&quot;, because she says that it implies that the image seen by the person experiencing romantic passion &quot;is molded to fit a preformed, externally derived, or emotionally needed conception&quot;. In crystallization, she says, &quot;the actual and existing features of LO merely undergo enhancement.&quot;

A limerent person may overlook red flags or incompatibilities. Tennov notes that the bias can be an impediment to a limerent person wishing to recover from the condition, as another of her interviewees says:I decided to make a list in block letters of everything about Elsie that I found unpleasant or annoying. It was a very long list. On the other side of the paper, I listed her good points. It was a short list. But it didn&#x27;t help at all. The good points seemed &quot;so much more important&quot;, and the bad things, well, in Elsie they weren&#x27;t so bad, or they were things I felt I could help her with.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
Intrusive thinking is an oft-reported feature of romantic love. Tennov wrote that &quot;Limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession.&quot; One study found that on average people in love spent 65% of their waking hours thinking about the beloved. Arthur Aron says &quot;It is obsessive-compulsive when you&#x27;re feeling it. It&#x27;s the center of your life.&quot; At the height of obsessive fantasy, people experiencing limerence may spend 85 to nearly 100% of their days and nights doting on the LO, lose ability to focus on other tasks and become easily distracted.

A limerent person can spend time fantasizing about future events even if they never come true, as the anticipation on its own yields dopamine. According to Tennov, limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality, because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic enough to be somewhat possible. The fantasies can nevertheless be wildly unrealistic, for example, one person related to her an elaborate rescue fantasy in which he saves an LO&#x27;s 5-year-old cousin from a group of motorcycles only to be bitten by a snake and die in his LO&#x27;s lap. This fantasizing along with the replaying of actual memories forms a bridge between one&#x27;s ordinary life and the eventual hoped for moment of consummation. Tennov says that limerent fantasy is &quot;inescapable&quot;, something that just &quot;happens&quot; as opposed to something one &quot;does&quot;.

One theory of obsessive thinking draws from the parallel with drug addiction: as the early stage of romantic love is compared to addiction to a person, and drug addicts also exhibit obsessive thinking about drug use. Tennov has written that limerent fantasy based in reality &quot;can be conceived as intricate strategy planning&quot;. In the late 1990s, it had also been speculated that being in love may lower serotonin levels in the brain, which could cause the intrusive thoughts. The serotonin hypothesis is based in part on a comparison to obsessive–compulsive disorder, but the experimental evidence is ambiguous. The experiments have tested blood levels of serotonin, with the first experiment finding lowered serotonin levels, but the second experiment finding that men and women were affected differently. This second experiment found that obsessive thinking was actually associated with increased serotonin levels in women.

For some people who have a fear of intimacy or a history of trauma, limerent fantasy might be an escape or a means of having what feels like a relationship but without the threat of real intimacy.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Tennov&#x27;s conception of fear of rejection was characterized by nervous feelings and shyness around the limerent object, &quot;worried that your own actions may bring about disaster&quot;. Awkwardness, stammering, confusion and shyness predominate at the behavioral level. She quotes the poet Sappho who writes &quot;Sweat runs down in rivers, a tremor seizes [...] Lost in the love-trance.&quot; One of Tennov&#x27;s interviewees, a 28-year-old truck driver, said &quot;It was like what you might call stage fright, like going up in front of an audience. [...] I was awkward as hell.&quot; Fisher et al. has suggested that fear in the presence of the beloved is caused by elevated levels of dopamine.

Many of the people Tennov interviewed described being normally confident, but suddenly shy when the limerent object is around, or being only in this state of fear with certain limerent objects but not others. Tennov wondered if fear of rejection even serves an evolutionary purpose, by drawing out the courtship process to ensure a greater chance of finding a compatible partner.

=== Uncertainty and hope ===
According to Tennov, the goal of limerence is &quot;oneness&quot; with the LO, i.e. mutual reciprocation or return of feelings. Limerence subsides in a relationship when the limerent person receives adequate reciprocation from the LO. However, mutual reciprocation is a matter of perception on the part of the limerent person, therefore she says the goal of limerence is &quot;removing uncertainty&quot; about whether or not the LO reciprocates. Some authors have conceptualized limerence as an attachment process. In the early stages of romantic love, individuals may start out hypervigilant (hyperaware and sensitive to cues) due to uncertainty and novelty, but become synchronized over time as a relationship progresses.

During the early period of limerence (which may begin as a crush or with a physical attraction), Tennov estimates the limerent person may spend up to 30% of their waking hours thinking about the LO, feel a sense of freedom, elation and buoyancy, and enjoy the preoccupation. Then, when elements of doubt and uncertainty are added to the situation, the time spent preoccupied can soar to even 100% of waking hours, provided there is always some hope the LO might return the feelings. At 100%, this might be joy or despair, depending on whether the limerent person perceives the LO as returning the feelings or rejecting them. One of Tennov&#x27;s interviewees says &quot;When I felt [Barry] loved me, I was intensely in love and deliriously happy; when he seemed rejecting, I was still intensely in love, only miserable beyond words.&quot; Much of the time preoccupied is spent replaying events, searching for their meaning to determine this. These thoughts are felt to be involuntary by the individual, occurring intrusively, even to the point of distraction.

Uncertainty can also be introduced by the presence of barriers to a relationship, or what Tennov calls &quot;intensification through adversity&quot;. She writes:

The recognition that some uncertainty must exist has been commented on and complained about by virtually everyone who has undertaken a serious study of the phenomenon of romantic love. Psychologists Ellen Bersheid and Elaine Walster discussed this common observation made, they note, by Socrates, Ovid, the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, and &quot;Dear Abby,&quot; that the presentation of a hard-to-get as opposed to an immediately yielding exterior is a help in eliciting passion.

The presence of barriers was crucial to the mutual limerence of Romeo and Juliet, hence this is often called &quot;the Romeo and Juliet effect.&quot; Helen Fisher calls this &quot;frustration attraction&quot;, and suggests that attraction increases because dopamine levels increase in the brain when an expected reward is delayed. Another theory promoted by Fisher is that separation evokes panic and stress, or activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.

Uncertainty can also come in the form of intermittent reinforcements, which prolong the duration of limerence, keeping the brain &quot;hooked&quot; in. Robert Sternberg has written that passionate or infatuated love essentially thrives under these conditions:The available evidence suggests that such love may survive only under conditions of intermittent reinforcement, when uncertainty reduction plays a key role in one&#x27;s feelings for another [...]. Tennov&#x27;s (1979) analysis suggests that limerence can survive only under conditions in which full development and consummation of love is withheld and in which titillation of one kind or another continues over time. Once the relationship is allowed to develop or once the relationship becomes an utter impossibility, extinction seems to take place.Hence, Judson Brewer characterizes the uncertainty of receiving an occasional message from an LO as &quot;gasoline poured on the fire&quot;. &quot;Limerence can live a long life sustained by crumbs,&quot; says Tennov, who compares this to the uncertainty of gambling: &quot;Both gamblers and limerents find reason to hope in wild dreams.&quot; Tennov writes that &quot;It is limerence, not love, that increases when lovers are able to meet only infrequently or when there is anger between them.&quot;

However, uncertainty can just be a matter of perception on the part of the limerent person, rather than it being based on actual obstacles or events. One married couple Tennov interviewed was mutually limerent in high school, but each was too shy to make the first move so that each was unaware of the other&#x27;s attraction. They then met again in college 5 years later and married, but only found out about their mutual limerence in high school through a chance conversation several years after that. Tennov notes that there were no obstacles to their relationship, but suggests their inaccurate perceptions that each was not interested probably increased their limerence in high school.

According to Tennov, because limerence only occurs when there is at least some hope of reciprocation, one can attempt to extinguish limerence by removing any hope that the LO will reciprocate. For example, an individual who is the object of unwanted attraction should give the clearest possible rejection to the limerent person, and not say something such as &quot;I like you as a friend, but...&quot; which is too ambiguous.

=== Physiology ===
The physiological effects of limerence can include trembling, pallor, flushing, weakness, sweating, butterflies in the stomach and a pounding heart. Tennov wrote that the sensation of limerence is associated primarily with the heart, even speculating that intrusive thinking results in mutual feedback where thinking of the limerent object causes an increase in heart rate, which in turn changes thought patterns. She says:

When I asked interviewees in the throes of the limerent condition to tell &quot;where&quot; they felt the sensation of limerence, they pointed unerringly to the midpoint in their chest. So consistently did this occur that it would seem to be another indication that the state described is indeed limerence, not affection (described by some as located &quot;all over&quot;, or even in &quot;the arms&quot; when held out in a gesture of embrace) or in sexual feelings (located, appropriately enough, in the genitals).

=== Readiness ===
Some people may have a heightened susceptibility to limerence, a state Tennov calls &quot;readiness&quot;, &quot;longing for limerence&quot; or being &quot;in love with love&quot;. This may occur due to biological factors such as adolescence, but also psychological factors like loneliness and discontent. Sometimes readiness can be so intense that a person falls in love with somebody who only has a minimal appeal.

Shaver and Hazan observed that those suffering from loneliness are more susceptible to limerence, arguing that &quot;if people have a large number of unmet social needs, and are not aware of this, then a sign that someone else might be interested is easily built up in that person&#x27;s imagination into far more than the friendly social contact that it might have been. By dwelling on the memory of that social contact, the lonely person comes to magnify it into a deep emotional experience, which may be quite different from the reality of the event.&quot;

=== Duration ===

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that limerence most commonly lasts between 18 months and three years with an average of two years, but may be as short as mere days or as long as a lifetime. One woman wrote to Tennov about her mother&#x27;s limerence which lasted 65 years. Tennov calls it the worst case when the limerent person cannot get away, because the LO is a coworker or lives nearby. Limerence can last indefinitely sometimes when it is unrequited, especially when reciprocation is uncertain. This could be such as when receiving mixed signals from an LO, or because of the intermittent reinforcement of an LO ignoring the limerent person for awhile and then suddenly calling.

Tennov&#x27;s estimate of 18 months to 3 years is sometimes used as the normal duration of romantic love. The other common estimate, 12–18 months, comes from Donatella Marazziti&#x27;s experiment comparing the serotonin levels of people in love with OCD patients. In this experiment, subjects who had fallen in love within the past 6 months (who were in a relationship) were measured to have serotonin levels which were different from controls, levels which returned to normal after 12–18 months.

According to Tennov, ideally limerence will be replaced by another type of love. In this way, feelings may evolve over the duration of a relationship: &quot;Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say, &#x27;We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much. The more stable type of love which is usually the characteristic of long-term relationships is commonly called companionate love, storge or attachment.

== Love regulation ==
Love regulation is &quot;the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love.&quot; For example, looking at pictures of the beloved has been shown to increase feelings of infatuation (i.e. passionate love) and attachment (i.e. companionate love). Sandra Langeslag notes that it&#x27;s a common misconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, or even should not be controlled; however studies using EEG and psychometrics have shown that love regulation is possible and may be useful. In some cases, love feelings may be stronger than desired such as after a breakup, or love feelings may be weaker than desired such as when they decline throughout a long-term relationship.

In a technique called cognitive reappraisal, one focuses on positive or negative aspects of the beloved, the relationship, or imagined future scenarios:

* In &quot;positive&quot; reappraisal, one focuses on positive qualities of the beloved (&quot;he&#x27;s kind&quot;, &quot;she&#x27;s spontaneous&quot;), the relationship (&quot;we have so much fun together&quot;) or imagined future scenarios (&quot;we&#x27;ll live happily ever after&quot;). Positive reappraisal increases attachment and can increase relationship satisfaction.
* In &quot;negative&quot; reappraisal, one focuses on negative qualities of the beloved (&quot;he&#x27;s lazy&quot;, &quot;she&#x27;s always late&quot;), the relationship (&quot;we fight a lot&quot;) or imagined future scenarios (&quot;he&#x27;ll cheat on me&quot;). Negative reappraisal decreases feelings of infatuation and attachment, but decreases mood in the short term. Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood.

Preliminary results from a 2024 study of online limerence communities conducted by Langeslag found that negative reappraisal decreased limerence for the study participants. A therapist named Brandy Wyant has also had her limerent clients list reasons their LO is not perfect, or reasons they and their LO are not compatible. Love regulation doesn&#x27;t switch feelings on or off immediately, so Langeslag recommends, for example, writing a list of things once a day to feel a lasting change.

Based on the addiction theory of romantic love, Helen Fisher and colleagues recommend that rejected lovers remove all reminders of their beloved, such as letters or photos, and avoid contact with the rejecting partner. Reminders can cause cravings which prolong recovery. Fisher et al. also suggests that positive contact with friends could reduce cravings. Rejected lovers should stay busy to distract themselves, and engage in self-expanding activities.

==Controversy==
In 2008, Albert Wakin, a professor who knew Tennov at the University of Bridgeport but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student, suggested that limerence is similar to obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorder (SUD). They presented work to an American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences conference, but suggested that much more research is needed before it could be proposed to the APA that limerence be included in the DSM. They began conducting an unpublished study and reported to &quot;USA Today&quot; that about 25% or 30% of their participants had experienced a limerent relationship as they defined it.

While limerence and romantic love in general have been compared to OCD since 1998 according to a hypothesis invented by other authors, experimental evidence for a connection with serotonin is ambiguous. This hypothesis was based on a superficial comparison between features of preoccupation shared between the two conditions, for example focusing on trivial details or worrying about the future. A 2025 study found no association between SSRI use and obsessive thinking about a loved one or the intensity of romantic love.

Helen Fisher has commented on Wakin &amp; Vo in 2008, stating that limerence is romantic love and that &quot;They are associating the negative aspects of it with the term, and that can be a disorder.&quot; Fisher is one of the original authors to compare limerence to OCD, and has proposed that romantic love is a &quot;natural addiction&quot; which can be either positive or negative depending on the situation. Fisher stated again in 2024 that she does not think there is any difference between limerence and romantic love.

In 2017, Wakin has stated that he feels that brain scans of limerence would help establish it as &quot;something unlike everything that has been diagnosed already&quot;, but brain scans have actually been described since as far back as 2002. In Fisher et al.&#x27;s original brain scan experiments, all participants spent more than 85% of their waking hours thinking about their loved one. Wakin also claims that a person experiencing limerence can never be satiated, even if their feelings are reciprocated. Tennov found many cases of nonlimerent people who described their limerent partners being &quot;stricken with a kind of insatiability&quot; in this way, and that &quot;no degree of attentiveness was ever sufficient&quot;. However, according to Tennov&#x27;s theory, the intensity of limerence diminishes when the limerent person perceives sustained reciprocation, so it is prolonged inside of a relationship when the LO behaves in a nonlimerent manner. Other authors who are in the mainstream have speculated that unwanted obsession inside a relationship could be related to self-esteem and an insecure attachment style.

In the 1999 preface to her revised edition of &quot;Love and Limerence&quot;, Dorothy Tennov describes limerence as an aspect of basic human nature and remarks that &quot;Reaction to limerence theory depends partly on acquaintance with the evidence for it and partly on personal experience. People who have not experienced limerence are baffled by descriptions of it and are often resistant to the evidence that it exists. To such outside observers, limerence seems pathological.&quot; Tennov states that limerence is normal and says that even those of her interviewees who experienced limerence of a distressing variety were &quot;fully functioning, rational, emotionally stable, normal, nonneurotic, nonpathological members of society&quot; and &quot;could be characterized as responsible and quite sane&quot;. She suggests that limerence is too often interpreted as &quot;mental illness&quot; in psychiatry. Tragedies such as violence, she says, involve limerence when it is &quot;augmented and distorted&quot; by other conditions, which she contrasts with &quot;pure limerence&quot;.

In a 2005 Q&amp;A, Tennov is asked if limerence can ever lead to a situation such as depicted in the movie &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, but Tennov replies that the movie character seemed to her to be a caricature. Most romantic stalkers are an ex-partner, erotomanic, have a personality disorder, are intellectually limited or socially incompetent.

One writer who investigated the phenomenon of limerence videos on TikTok in 2024 has written that it seemed to her that the many videos created by the relationship coaches there were actually about social media stalking rather than having anything at all to do with limerence.

<text>Edvard Kardelj (; 27 January 1910 – 10 February 1979), also known by the pseudonyms Bevc, Sperans, and Krištof, was a Yugoslav politician and economist. He was one of the leading members of the Communist Party of Slovenia before World War II. During the war, Kardelj was one of the leaders of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People and a Slovene Partisan. After the war, he was a federal political leader in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He led the Yugoslav delegation in peace talks with Italy over the border dispute in the Julian March.

Kardelj was the main creator of the Yugoslav system of workers&#x27; self-management. He was an economist and a full member of both the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts and the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He also played a major role in foreign policy by designing the fundamental ideological basis for the Yugoslav policy of nonalignment in the 1950s and the 1960s.

==Early years==
Kardelj was born in Ljubljana. At the age of 16 he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, where he was drafted under the influence of the Slovenian journalist Vlado Kozak. He studied to become a teacher but never worked as one. In 1930, he was arrested in Belgrade and convicted of being a member of the illegal Communist Party. He was released in 1932 and returned to Ljubljana, where he became one of the leaders of the Slovenian section of the party after most of its former members had either left the party or perished in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges.

In 1935, he went to Moscow to work for the Comintern. He was part of a group that survived Stalin&#x27;s purge of the Yugoslav Communist leadership. Following Stalin&#x27;s appointment of Josip Broz Tito as party leader, Kardelj became a leading member of the Party. The new leadership, centered around Tito, Aleksandar Ranković and Kardelj, returned to Yugoslavia in 1937 and launched a new party policy, calling for a common antifascist platform of all Yugoslav left-wing forces and for a federalization of Yugoslavia. The same year, an autonomous Communist Party of Slovenia was formed, with Kardelj as one of its leaders, together with Franc Leskošek (sl) and Boris Kidrič.

On 15 August 1939, Kardelj married Pepca Kardelj, sister of the (later) People&#x27;s Hero and communist functionary Ivan Maček (a.k.a. Matija).

After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he became one of the leaders of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. In summer and autumn 1941, he helped to set up the armed resistance in Slovenia which fought against the occupying forces till May 1945, jointly with Tito&#x27;s Partisans in what became known as the People&#x27;s Liberation War of Yugoslavia.

==Postwar years==
After 1945, he rose to the highest positions in the Yugoslav government and moved into a luxury house in the Tacen neighborhood of Ljubljana that was confiscated from its previous owner, the industrialist Ivan Seunig. The house had been built in 1940 by the architect Bojan Stupica (1910–1970) and was initially occupied by the communist politician Boris Kraigher.

Between 1945 and 1947, Kardelj led the Yugoslav delegation that negotiated peace talks with Italy over the border dispute in the Julian March. After the Tito–Stalin split in 1948, he helped, with Milovan Đilas and Vladimir Bakarić, to devise a new economic policy in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, known as workers&#x27; self-management. In the 1950s, especially after Đilas&#x27;s removal, he rose to become the main theorist of Titoism and Yugoslav workers&#x27; self-management.

Kardelj was shot and wounded in 1959 by Jovan Veselinov. Although the official police investigation concluded that Veselinov had been shooting at a wild boar and Kardelj was struck by a ricochet from a rock, it was suggested at the time that the assassination attempt was orchestrated by his political rival Aleksandar Ranković or Ranković&#x27;s, ally Slobodan Penezić.

Kardelj&#x27;s role diminished in the 1960s, for reasons that have yet to become clear. He again rose to prominence after 1973, when Tito removed the Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian reformist Communist leaderships, and restored a more orthodox party line. The following year he was one of the main authors of the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution which decentralized decision-making in the country, leaving the single republics under the leadership of their respective political leaderships.

==Death and legacy==
In 1974, Kardelj was diagnosed with colon cancer, and after diagnosed, his doctors consulted with American and Swedish doctors about further treatment. Shortly after returning from Washington D.C. in 1977, his health began to deteriorate. Later in 1977, Kardelj underwent two operations after it was discovered that the cancer had spread to his lungs and liver. At the end of 1978, he fell seriously ill. In January 1979, his health did not improve, so he was admitted to Ljubljana University Medical Centre in the beginning of February, where he fell into a coma on the 9th. On 10 February 1979, after being in a coma for 20 hours, Kardelj died at the age of 69.

Kardelj&#x27;s funeral was held on 13 February 1979 in Ljubljana. His body was cremated and buried in the Ljubljana tomb of national heroes. 

During his lifetime, he was given several honors. He was appointed a member of the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts and was officially honored as a People&#x27;s Hero of Yugoslavia. Apart from many streets, the entire coastal town of Ploče in southern Croatia was renamed &quot;Kardeljevo&quot; in his honour from 1950 to 1954 and again from 1980 to 1990. Immediately after his death, the University of Ljubljana changed its name to &quot;Edvard Kardelj University of Ljubljana&quot; ().

After the collapse of Yugoslavia, most of these were restored to their previous names, but in Slovenia there are still some street and square names that bear his name; for example, a square in Nova Gorica and in Velenje.

Edvard Kardelj was the father of the poet , who committed suicide in 1971. His wife Pepca Kardelj died of a heart attack in 1990 but was widely rumored to have committed suicide. His grandson is Igor Šoltes, a lawyer and politician.

<doc id="154155" wikidata="Q1592719" url="?curid=154155" title="Aerial (dance move)">
<text>An Aerial (also acrobatic, air step or air) is a dance move in Lindy Hop or Boogie Woogie where one&#x27;s feet leave the floor. As opposed to a lift, aerial is a step where a partner needs to be thrown into the air and then landed in time with the music. Each aerial consists of a preparation (&#x27;prep&#x27;), jump or trick itself and the landing.

The first Lindy Hop aerial was performed by Frankie Manning in 1935. Frankie Manning and George &quot;Shorty&quot; Snowden competed in weekly dance contests at the Savoy Ballroom. Shorty George and his partner Big Bea had a move, where they stood back-to-back; they locked arms; Big Bea bent over, picking Shorty George up on her back; and then she carried him off the floor, while he kicked his feet. Frankie Manning wanted to outdo Shorty George, so he convinced his partner Freda Washington, to flip over his back. Called the &#x27;over the back&#x27;, this flip is considered the first Lindy aerial.

Aerials quickly caught on in Lindy Hop. In 1935, the troupe Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers (aka the Harlem Congeroos) formed and performed at private parties in New York. From 1936 to 1941, they toured the world and performed in movies and some after 1945, showing Lindy Hop and aerials to the world.

Moves similar to aerials had been performed in other dances before 1935. For example, the Nicholas Brothers used leaps and flips in their tap dance routines in the early 1930s at the Cotton Club. Flash dancers, who toured with big bands in the United States in the early twentieth century, performed acrobatic dances, often matched with tap dancers and contortionists in traveling shows.

<doc id="154156" wikidata="Q516992" url="?curid=154156" title="Cloak">
<text>A cloak is a type of loose garment worn over clothing, mostly but not always as outerwear for outdoor wear, serving the same purpose as an overcoat, protecting the wearer from the weather. It may form part of a uniform. People in many different societies may wear cloaks. Over time cloak designs have changed to match fashion and available textiles.

Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder, and vary in length from the hip all the way down to the ankle – mid-calf being the normal length. They may have an attached hood and may cover and fasten down the front, in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass through. However, cloaks are almost always sleeveless.

Christian clerics may wear a cappa or a [[cope]] – forms of cloak – as liturgical vestments or as part of a religious habit.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cloak&quot; comes from Old North French &quot;cloque&quot; (Old French &quot;cloche&quot;, &quot;cloke&quot;) meaning &quot;bell&quot;, from Medieval Latin &quot;clocca&quot; &quot;travelers&#x27; cape,&quot; literally &quot;a bell,&quot; so called from the garment&#x27;s bell-like shape. Thus the word is related to the word &quot;clock&quot;.

==History==
Ancient Greeks and Romans were known to wear cloaks. Greek men and women wore the &quot;himation&quot;, from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods ( 750–30 BC). Romans would later wear the Greek-styled cloak, the &quot;pallium&quot;. The &quot;pallium&quot; was quadrangular, shaped like a square, and sat on the shoulders, not unlike the &quot;himation&quot;.

Romans of the Republic would wear the toga as a formal display of their citizenship. It was denied to foreigners and was worn by magistrates on all occasions as a badge of office. The toga allegedly originated with Numa Pompilius ( BC), the second semi-legendary king of Rome.

Eminent personages in Kievan Rus&#x27; adopted the Byzantine &quot;chlamys&quot; in the form of a fur-lined &quot;&quot;

Powerful noblemen and elite warriors of the Aztec Empire would wear a tilmàtli; a Mesoamerican cloak/cape used as a symbol of their upper status. Cloth and clothing was of utmost importance for the Aztecs. The more elaborate and colorful tilmàtlis were strictly reserved for élite high priests, emperors; and the Eagle warriors as well as the Jaguar knights.

==Opera cloak==

In full evening dress in the Western countries, ladies and gentlemen frequently use the cloak as a fashion statement, or to protect the fine fabrics of evening wear from the elements, especially where a coat would crush or hide the garment. Opera cloaks are made of quality materials such as wool or cashmere, velvet and satin.

Ladies may wear a long (over the shoulders or to ankles) cloak usually called a cape, or a full-length cloak. Gentlemen wear an ankle-length or full-length cloak. Formal cloaks often have expensive, colored linings and trimmings such as silk, satin, velvet and fur.

The term was the title of a 1942 operatic comedy.

==In literature and the arts==
According to the King James Version of the Bible, Matthew recorded Jesus of Nazareth saying in Matthew 5:40: &quot;And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.&quot; The King James Version of the Bible has the words recorded a little differently in Luke 6:29: &quot;...and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also.&quot;

Cloaks are a staple garment in the fantasy genre due to the popularity of medieval settings. They are also usually associated with witches, wizards, and vampires; the best-known stage version of &quot;Dracula,&quot; which first made actor Bela Lugosi prominent, featured him wearing it so that his exit through a trap door concealed on the stage could seem sudden. When Lugosi reprised his role as Dracula for the 1931 Universal Studios motion picture version of the play, he retained the cloak as part of his outfit, which made such a strong impression that cloaks came to be equated with Count Dracula in nearly all non-historical media depictions of him.

Fantasy cloaks are often magical. For example, they may grant the person wearing it invisibility as in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J. K. Rowling. A similar sort of garment is worn by the members of the Fellowship of the Ring in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien, although instead of granting complete invisibility, the Elf-made cloaks simply appear to shift between any natural color (e.g. green, gray, brown) to help the wearer to blend in with his or her surroundings. In the Marvel comic book stories and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the sorcerer Doctor Strange is associated with a magical Cloak of Levitation, which not only enables its wearer to levitate, but has other mystical abilities as well. Doctor Strange also uses it as a weapon. Alternatively, cloaks in fantasy may nullify magical projectiles, as the &quot;cloak of magic resistance&quot; in NetHack.

==Metaphor==
Figuratively, a cloak may be anything that disguises or conceals something. In many science fiction franchises, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, there are cloaking devices, which provide a way to avoid detection by making objects appear invisible. A real device, albeit of limited capability, was demonstrated in 2006.

Because they keep a person hidden and conceal a weapon, the phrase &quot;cloak and dagger&quot; has come to refer to espionage and secretive crimes: it suggests murder from hidden sources. &quot;Cloak and dagger&quot; stories are thus mystery, detective, and crime stories of this. The vigilante duo of Marvel comics Cloak and Dagger is a reference to this.
