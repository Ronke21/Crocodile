<text>Dubai International Airport () is the primary international airport serving Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and is the world&#x27;s busiest airport by international passenger traffic as of 2023. It is also the busiest airport in the Middle East as of 2023, the second-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic as of 2023, the busiest airport for Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 movements, and the airport with the highest average number of passengers per flight. In 2023, the airport handled 87 million passengers and 1.81 million tonnes of cargo and registered 416,405 aircraft movements.

Dubai International Airport is situated in the Al Garhoud district, east of the city center of Dubai and spread over an area of of land. Terminal 3 is the third-largest building in the world by floor space and the largest airport terminal in the world. In July 2019, Dubai International airport installed the largest solar energy system in the region&#x27;s airports as part of Dubai&#x27;s goal to reduce 30 per cent of the city energy consumption by 2030.

Emirates Airline has its hub airport in Dubai International (DXB) and has its own terminal 3 with three concourses that they share with Flydubai. The Emirates hub is the largest airline hub in the Middle East; Emirates handles 51% of all passenger traffic and accounts for approximately 42% of all aircraft movements at the airport. Dubai Airport is also the base for low-cost carrier flydubai which handles 13% of passenger traffic and 25% of aircraft movements at DXB. The airport has a total capacity of 90 million passengers annually. As of January 2024, over 8,000 weekly flights are operated by 100 airlines to over 262 destinations across all inhabited continents. Over 63% of travelers using the airport in 2018 were connecting passengers.

In 2014, Dubai International indirectly supported over 400,000 jobs and contributed over US$26.7 billion to the economy, representing around 27% of Dubai&#x27;s GDP and 21% of the employment in Dubai.

Due to the announced expansion of Al Maktoum Airport on 28 April 2024, Dubai International Airport will be shut down once Al Maktoum Airport expansion will be completed. 
==History==
The history of civil aviation in Dubai started in July 1937 when an air agreement was signed for a flying boat base for aircraft of Imperial Airways with the rental of the base at about 440 rupees per month – this included the guards&#x27; wages. The Empire Flying Boats started operating once a week flying eastbound to Karachi from the UK and westbound to Southampton, England. By February 1938, there were four flying boats a week.

In the 1940s, flying from Dubai was by flying boats operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), operating the Horseshoe route from Southern Africa via the Persian Gulf to Sydney.

===Construction===
Construction of the airport was ordered by the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in 1959. It officially opened on 30 September 1960, at which time it was able to handle aircraft the size of a Douglas DC-3 on a runway made of compacted sand. Three turning-areas, an apron and small terminal completed the airport that was constructed by Costain.

In May 1963, construction of a asphalt runway started. This new runway, alongside the original sand runway and taxiway opened in May 1965, together with several new extensions to the terminal Building, hangars were erected, and Airport and Navigational aids were installed. The installation of the lighting system continued after the official opening and was completed in August 1965. During the second half of the 1960s several extensions, equipment upgrades like a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and an instrument landing system (ILS), as well as new buildings, were constructed. By 1969, the airport was served by 9 airlines serving some 20 destinations.

The inauguration on 15 May 1966 was marked by the visits of the first big jets, De Havilland Comets of Middle East Airlines and Kuwait Airways.

The advent of wide-body aircraft required further airport development in the 1970s and plans for a new terminal, runways, and taxiways capable of coping with international flights were drawn up. The construction of a new terminal building consisting of a three-story building long with an enclosed floor area of . A new control tower was also constructed.

Expansion continued in the early 1970s including ILS Category II equipment, lengthening the existing runway to , installation of a non-directional beacon (NDB), diesel generators, taxiways, etc. This work made handling the Boeing 747 and Concorde possible. Several runway and apron extensions were carried out through the decade to meet growing demand.

The new precision category 2 Approach and Runway Lighting System was commissioned in 1971. The construction of the Airport Fire Station and the installation of the generators were completed in December 1971 and were fully operational in March 1972. The ruler of Dubai also commissioned and inaugurated the Long-range Surveillance System on 19 June 1973.

With the expansion of the Airport Fire Services, it became necessary to find more suitable hangars. A hangar-style building was made available for use at the end of 1976. This building was strategically located midway between the runway ends to facilitate efficient operations. Additionally, a new building was constructed to house the Airport Maintenance Engineer, Electronics Engineering section, and Stores unit.

Expansion and refurbishment of the Airport Restaurant and Transit Lounge, including a new kitchen, were completed in December 1978.

The next phase of development included the construction of a new runway, which was completed three months ahead of schedule and opened in April 1984. This runway, located 360 metres north of and parallel to the existing runway, was equipped with the latest meteorological, airfield lighting, and instrument landing systems, giving the airport a Category II classification.  

Several extensions and upgrades were also made to the terminal facilities and supporting systems. On December 23, 1980, the airport became an ordinary member of the Airports Council International (ACI). The decline of Karachi Airport is often attributed to the traffic Dubai diverted from it.

During the 1980s, Dubai was a stopping point for airlines such as Air India, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and others traveling between Asia and Europe that needed a refueling point in the Persian Gulf. Later made redundant with the availability of Russian airspace due to the breakup of the Soviet Union and the advent of longer-range aircraft introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s such as the Airbus A340, the Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 777 series aircraft, which had the ability to fly between Europe and Southeast Asia nonstop. British Airways flights from Islamabad to Manchester also stopped for short times during the 1980s.

===Expansion===

The opening of Terminal 2 in 1998 saw the first step of phase 1 of the new development master plan launched in 1997. In the second stage, Concourse 1, named Sheikh Rashid Terminal opened in April 2000. The concourse is in length connects to the check-in area via a tunnel containing moving walkways (conveyor belt/travelators). It also contains a hotel, business center, health club, exchanges, dining and entertainment facilities, internet services, a medical center, a post office, and a prayer room. The next step was runway reconfiguration, already part of phase 2, and aprons and taxiways were expanded and strengthened in 2003–2004. In addition, the Dubai Flower Centre opened in 2005 as part of the development. The airport saw the need for this as the city is a hub for the import and export of flowers and the airport required a specialist facility since flowers need special conditions.

Construction of Terminal 3 began in 2004 as the next stage of phase 2 of the development, with an estimated cost of around $4.55  billion. Completion was originally planned for 2006 but was delayed by two years.

On 30 May 2008, a topping-out ceremony was conducted. The terminal became operational on 14 October 2008, with Emirates Airline (EK2926) from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, being the first flight to arrive at the new terminal and EK843 to Doha, Qatar being the first departing flight. The terminal increased the airport&#x27;s maximum annual passenger capacity by 47  million, bringing the total annual capacity to 75 million passengers.

On 29 October 2010, the airport marked its 50th anniversary. The airport has seen over 402 million passengers at an average annual growth rate of 15.5% and handled over 3.87 million aircraft at an average annual growth rate of 12.4%.

With the arrival of the Airbus A380, the airport made modifications costing $230 million. These included the building of 29 gates capable of handling large aircraft, five of which are in Terminal 3 and two are in Terminal 1. Other important projects at the airport include the next stage of phase 2 development, which includes the construction of Concourse 3. This will be a smaller version of Concourse 2, connected to Terminal 3.

Also as part of the expansion, the airport now handles at least 75 million (an increase of 19 million) passengers per annum with the opening of Concourse 3, part of Terminal 3. However, recent communications predict a further increase to 80 million passengers with additional reassessments of existing capacities. In 2009, Terminal 2 expanded its facilities to handle 5 million (an increase of 2 million) passengers annually, taking the airport&#x27;s total capacity to 62 million passengers. Terminal 2 capacity was planned to bring the total capacity of the airport from the initial 75 million passengers to 80 million passenger capacity by 2012.

The Cargo Mega Terminal, which will have the capacity to handle 3 million tonnes of cargo a year, is a major development; it will be built in the long term. The completion of the mega terminal will be no later than 2018. Terminal 2 will be completely redeveloped to match the status of the other two terminals. With all of these projects completed by 2013, the airport expects to handle at least 75–80 million passengers and over 5 million tonnes of cargo.

The airport&#x27;s landside facilities were modified to allow the construction of two stations for the Red Line of Dubai Metro. One station was built at Terminal 1 and the other at Terminal 3. The line began service on 9 September 2009 and opened in phases over the next year. The second Metro line, the Green Line, runs near the Airport Free Zone and has served the airport&#x27;s north-eastern area with the Terminal 2 starting in September 2011.

With phase 2 of DXB&#x27;s expansion plan complete, the airport now has three terminals and three concourses, two cargo mega terminals, an airport-free zone, an expo center with three large exhibition halls, a major aircraft maintenance hub and a flower center to handle perishable goods. A phase 3 which has been included in the master plan involves the construction of a new Concourse 4.

The airport revealed its future plans in May 2011, which involve the construction of a new Concourse D for all airlines currently operating from Concourse C. Concourse D is expected to bring the total capacity of the airport to over 90 million passengers and will open in early 2016. The plan also involves Emirates solely operating from Concourse C along with Concourse A and B.

In September 2012, Dubai Airports changed the names of concourses to make it easier for passengers to navigate the airport. Concourse 1, in which over 100 international airlines operate, became Concourse C (C1-C50). Concourse 2 became Concourse B (B1-B32) and Concourse 3 became Concourse A (A1-A24). The gates in Terminal 2 were changed and are now numbered F1 to F12. The remaining alpha-numeric sequences are being reserved for future airport facilities that are part of the Dubai Airports&#x27; $7.8 billion expansion programm, including Concourse D.

In December 2024, CEO Paul Griffiths declared that Dubai International Airport is rapidly expanding, with plans to enhance passenger experiences through advanced technologies like facial recognition and a focus on reducing wait times while maximizing shopping opportunities. He highlighted a $35 billion expansion of Dubai World Central, aiming to create smaller, more intimate airport experiences within a vast complex, ultimately positioning it to become the world&#x27;s largest airport.

Dubai&#x27;s government announced the construction of a new airport in Jebel Ali, named Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International Airport. It is expected to be the second-largest airport in the world by physical size, though not by passenger metrics. It opened 27 June 2010; however, construction is not expected to finish until 2027. The airport is expected to be able to accommodate up to 160 million passengers. There has been an official plan to build the Dubai Metro Purple Line to connect Al Maktoum International Airport to Dubai International Airport; construction was set to begin in 2012. The proposed Purple Line will link Dubai International Airport and Al Maktoum International Airport.

Concourse D opened on 24 February 2016 for all international airlines and moved out of Terminal 1. Emirates now operates from Concourses A, B, and C, all under Terminal 3. while FlyDubai operates from Terminal 2 (Concourse F).

On 20 December 2018 the airport celebrated its one billionth passenger.

In April 2024, the airport was submerged in water by floods and suffered extensive damage.

==Air traffic==

===Main airlines based at DXB===
* Emirates is the largest airline operating at the airport, with an all-wide-body fleet of over 200 Airbus and Boeing aircraft based at Dubai, providing scheduled services to the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia and New Zealand.

==Infrastructure==

Dubai International Airport was conceptualized to function as Dubai&#x27;s primary airport and the region&#x27;s busiest for the foreseeable future without the need for relocation or the building of another airport when passenger figures increased. The area was chosen near Dubai, to attract passengers from the city of Dubai, rather than travel to the busier Sharjah International Airport. The planned location originally was Jebel Ali.

The original master plan for the existing airport initially involved a dual-terminal and one runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the near future. Phase 1 included the construction of the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 70 aircraft parking bays, support facilities, and structures, including large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops, and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents&#x27; buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and an control tower. Construction for the second phase would commence immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 50 new aircraft parking bays in addition to the existing 70 bays, a second fire station, and a third cargo agent building.

The third phase included the construction of a new terminal (now the parts of Terminal 1&#x27;s main building and Concourse C) and an additional 60 parking bays, as well as a new aircraft maintenance facility. Then, in the early 2000s (decade) a new master plan was introduced which began the development of the current concourses and terminal infrastructure.

Paul Griffiths (Dubai Airports&#x27; CEO) in his interview with &quot;Vision&quot; magazine, cited plans to build infrastructure to support the expansion of Emirates and budget airline flydubai and ascend the ranks of global aviation hubs.

===Control tower===
The airport traffic control tower (ATCT) was constructed as part of phase two of the then-development plan.

===Terminals===
Dubai International Airport has three terminals. Terminal 1 has one concourse (Concourse D), Terminal 2 is set apart from the other two main buildings and Terminal 3 is divided into Concourse A, B, and C. The cargo terminal is capable of handling 3 million tonnes of cargo annually and a general aviation terminal (GAT) is close by.


===Passenger terminals===
Dubai Airport has three passenger terminals. Terminals 1 and 3 are directly connected with a common transit area, with airside passengers being able to move freely between the terminals without going through immigration, while Terminal 2 is on the opposite side of the airport. For transiting passengers, a shuttle service runs between the terminals, with a journey time of around 20 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 and 30 minutes to Terminal 3. Passengers in Terminal 3 who need to transfer between Concourse A and the rest of the Terminal have to travel via an automated people mover. Also after early 2016 when the construction of Concourse D was done, there is now an automated people mover between concourse D and Terminal 1.

Situated beside Terminal 2 is the Executive Flights Terminal, which has its own check-in facilities for premium passengers and where transportation to aircraft in any of the other terminals is by personal buggy.

The three passenger terminals have a total handling capacity of around 80 million passengers a year.

Terminals 1 and 3 cater to international passengers, whilst Terminal 2 is for budget passengers and passengers flying to the subcontinent and Persian Gulf region; Terminals 1 and 3 handle 85% of the passenger traffic, and the Executive Flights terminal is for the higher-end travelers and important guests.

====Terminal 1====

Terminal 1 has a capacity of 45 million passengers. It is used by over 100 airlines and is connected to Concourse D by an automated people mover. It is spread over an area of and offers 221 check-in counters.

The Terminal was originally built within the airport&#x27;s old building to handle 18 million passengers; however, with extreme congestion at the terminal, the airport was forced to expand the terminal to accommodate the opening of 28 remote gates. Over the years, more mobile gates were added to the airport bringing the total as of 2010 to 28.

In 2013, Dubai Airports announced a major renovation for Terminal 1 and Concourse C. The renovations include upgraded baggage systems, replacement of check-in desks and a more spacious departure hall. Arrivals will also see improvements to help reduce waiting times. The renovation was completed by the middle of 2015.

;Concourse D
Planning began for further expansion of Dubai Airport, with the construction of Terminal 4, it was revealed on the day Emirates completed its phased operations at the new Terminal 3, on 14 November 2008.
According to Dubai Airport officials, plans for Terminal 4 had begun and extensions would be made to Terminal 3. These are required to bring the capacity of the airport to 80–90 million passengers a year by 2015.

In May 2011, Paul Griffiths, chief executive of Dubai Airports revealed the Dubai Airport masterplan. It involves the construction of Concourse D (previously Terminal 4). With a capacity of 15 million, it would bring the total capacity of the airport to 90 million passengers by 2018—an increase of 15 million. It also will see Emirates take over the operation at Concourse C, along with Concourse A and B which it will already be operating. All remaining airlines will shift to Concourse D, or move to Al Maktoum International Airport. The airport projects that international passenger and cargo traffic will increase at an average annual growth rate of 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively, and that by 2020 passenger numbers at Dubai International Airport will reach 98.5 million and cargo volumes will top 4.1 million tonnes.

Concourse D will have a capacity of 15 million passengers, include 17 gates and will be connected to Terminal 1 via an automated people mover. On 6 February 2016, members of the public were invited to trial the concourse in preparation for its opening. On Wednesday, 24 February 2016, Concourse D officially opened with the first British Airways flight arriving at gate D8.

Concourse D and Terminal 1 reopened on 24 June 2021 following a year&#x27;s closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Terminal 2====
Terminal 2, built in 1998, has an area of and has a capacity of 10 million as of 2013, after several, decent reconstructions and a major expansion in 2012 which saw capacity double. It is used by over 50 airlines, mainly operating in the Persian Gulf region. Most flights operate to India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In June 2009, Terminal 2 became the hub of Air India Express and flydubai, and the terminal houses the airline&#x27;s corporate head office.

Terminal 2 has undergone a major refurbishment recently, extending check-in and boarding facilities, changing the interior and exterior décor, and offering more dining choices to passengers. Capacity was increased to allow for 10 million passengers, an increase of 5 million.

The terminal has now increased the number of facilities available to passengers. Check-in counters have increased to 37. The boarding area is more spacious, with more natural light. Also, the new open boarding gates allow several flights to board simultaneously, improving passenger and aircraft movements. There are a total of 43 remote stands at the terminal. However, passengers cannot move between Terminal 2 to 1 or from 2 to 3 and vice versa inside the airport. They have to make use of Taxi services or public transport available outside.

The Dubai duty-free shopping area covers in departures and in arrivals. The extension included a larger arrivals hall as well.

Terminal 2 has no jetbridges and so passengers are bussed to the aircraft at gates F1-F12.

====Terminal 3====

The partly underground Terminal 3 was built at a cost of US$4.5 billion, exclusively for Emirates, and has a capacity of 65 million passengers. The terminal has 20 Airbus A380 gates at Concourse A and 5 at Concourse B and 2 at Concourse C. It was announced on 6 September 2012 that Terminal 3 would no longer be Emirates-exclusive, as Emirates and Qantas had set up an extensive code-sharing agreement. Qantas would be the second and only one of two airlines to fly in and out of Terminal 3. This deal also allows Qantas to use the A380 dedicated concourse. Qantas services to and from Dubai ceased in 2018 in favour of a Singapore stopover instead. flydubai, Emirates&#x27; low cost subsidiary also currently operates certain selected routes, including most European destinations, to and from Terminal 3.

In March 2023, United began services from Newark to Dubai, operating out of Terminal 3, becoming the only airline other than Emirates and flydubai to currently operate out of the terminal.

Upon completion, Terminal 3 was the largest building in the world by floor space, with over of space, capable of handling 60 million passengers in a year. A large part is located under the taxiway area and is directly connected to Concourse B: the departure and arrival halls in the new structure are beneath the airport&#x27;s apron. Concourse A is connected to the terminal via a Terminal 3 APM. It has been operational since 14 October 2008, and opened in four phases to avoid collapse of baggage handling and other IT systems.

The building includes a multi-level underground structure, first and business class lounges, restaurants, 180 check-in counters, and 2,600 car-parking spaces. The terminal offers more than double the previous retail area of Concourse C, by adding about and Concourse B&#x27;s of shopping facilities.

In arrivals, the terminal contains 72 immigration counters and 14 baggage carousels. The baggage handling system—the largest system and also the deepest in the world—has a capacity to handle 8,000 bags per hour. The system includes 21 screening injection points, 49 make-up carousels, of conveyor belts capable of handling 15,000 items per hour at a speed of and 4,500 early baggage storage positions.

The facility makes EFC the largest dedicated business aviation terminal in the Middle East.

====Cargo Mega Terminal====
The cargo village at Dubai International Airport is one of the world&#x27;s largest and most central cargo hubs, with most of the cargo for Asia and Africa coming through the facility. Forecasts in 2004 for cargo growth predicted that additional major cargo handling facilities were needed to satisfy demands. Plans were put in place to construct the first stage of the cargo mega terminal, which by 2018 will have the ability to handle three million tons of freight. Phase 1 of the cargo mega terminal was completed by 2004 and the next phase of expansion was scheduled for completion in late 2007. Presently the airport has a cargo capacity of 2.5 million tonnes, and will be expanded to handle 3 million.

====Flower centre====
Dubai Airport has constructed a flower center to handle flower imports and exports, as Dubai is a major hub for the import and export of flowers, and the airport requires a specialist facility since these products need special conditions. The flower center&#x27;s first phase was completed in 2004 at a cost of $50 million.

The center when completed and functioning will have a floor area of approximately including different export chambers and offices. The handling capacity of the center is expected to be more than 300,000 tonnes of product throughput per annum. The entire facility (with the exception of the offices) will be maintained at an ambient temperature of just .

===Runways===
Dubai Airport has two closely spaced parallel runways, 12R/30L is , 12L/30R is . The gap between the centrelines of the two runways is . The runways are equipped with four sets of ILS to guide landing aircraft safely under very poor weather conditions. The runways were expanded to accommodate the Airbus A380 which came into service in 2007. In 2009, it was announced that the airport installed a Category III landing system, allowing planes to land in low-visibility conditions, such as fog. This system was the first of its kind in the United Arab Emirates.

In 2013 Dubai Airports announced an 80-day runway refurbishment program which started on 1 May 2014 and was completed on 21 July 2014. The northern runway was resurfaced while lighting upgrades and additional taxiways were built on the southern runway to help boost its capacity. The southern runway was closed from 1 to 31 May 2014, while the northern runway was closed from 31 May to 20 July 2014. Due to extra congestion on one runway, all freighter, charter and general aviation flights were diverted to Al Maktoum International Airport. Flights at DXB were reduced by 26% and 14 airlines moved to Al Maktoum International Airport whilst the runways works were being done. Emirates cut 5,000 flights and grounded over 20 aircraft during the period.

Dubai Airport plans to close the southern runway (12R/30L) for complete resurfacing and replacement of the airfield lighting and supporting infrastructure. This will be done during a 45-day period from 16 April 2019 to 30 May 2019. This upgrade will boost safety, service and capacity levels at DXB. Airlines will be required to reduce flight operations at DXB due to single runway operations.

===Accommodating the Airbus A380===
With Dubai-based Emirates being one of the launch customers for the Airbus A380 and also the largest customer, Dubai Airport needed to expand its existing facilities to accommodate the very large aircraft. The Department of Civil Aviation spent $120 million in upgrading both of its terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate holdrooms, new finger piers, an enlarged runway, new airbridges and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal . Dubai Airport also invested $3.5 billion into a new Concourse A, exclusively for handling Emirates A380s. With the changes made, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does for Boeing 747-400s, which carry fewer passengers. On 16 July 2008, Dubai Airport unveiled the first of two specially-built gates capable of handling the aircraft. Costing $10 million, the gates will enable passengers to get on the upper cabin of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged to cater for the larger number of passengers flying the A380s. In addition to the two gates at Terminal 1, five more A380-capable gates were opened at concourse B on 14 October 2008. Concourse A opened on 2 January 2013.

==Labor controversy==

Workers building a new terminal at Dubai International Airport went on a sympathy strike in March 2006. Another strike took place in October 2007. Four thousand strikers were arrested. Most of them were released some days later and those who were not local were then deported from Dubai.

===Passenger services===
The airport has over of retail space spread between its three main terminals and includes many shopping and eating outlets. The Dubai duty-free shopping area in Terminal 2 covers in departures and in arrivals. The extension included a larger arrivals hall as well.

Extensive upgrading work on existing retail areas since 2004 in Terminals 1 and 2 has increased sales. Dubai Duty Free Company announced annual sales of Dhs5.9 billion (US$1.6 billion) in 2012, representing a 10 per cent increase on the previous year. In 2008, Dubai Duty Free doubled its retail space from with the inauguration of the new Emirates Terminal 3 in October 2008. Dubai Duty Free recorded more than 23.5 million transactions in 2012. As of August 2009, Dubai Duty Free was the biggest single airport retail operation in the world ahead of London&#x27;s Heathrow and Seoul&#x27;s Incheon airports.

In addition to a wide array of duty-free shops and eating outlets, Dubai Airport has two open-air garden areas. Dubai Airport has numerous business centres located around the airport. Within the international transit area of the interconnected Terminals 1 and 2, internet and games facilities, prayer rooms, showers, spas, gym, swimming pool and three hotels are provided. Various lounge areas are provided, some including children&#x27;s play areas or televisions showing news, movies and sports channels. Terminal 3 has a left luggage facility operated by Emirates in the Arrivals area where layover passengers can leave their luggage for a fee while they go sightseeing.

==Safety and security==
The Civil Aviation Authority of Dubai manages the overall safety and security of the airport. Pre-screening takes place in all terminals at the entrance of the airport. Iris scanning has been implemented in all UAE airports. This type of scanning prevents those deported from the UAE for serious criminal charges from returning again using fraudulent documents.

The airport uses highly sensitive equipment to conduct thorough searches on travellers into the UAE, including screening for smuggling, possessing or taking illegal drugs in the country. A senior Dubai judge was quoted on 11 February 2008, by &quot;Seven Days&quot; saying, &quot;These laws help discourage anyone from carrying or using drugs. Even if the amount of illegal drugs found on someone is 0.05 grams, they will be found guilty. The penalty is a minimum four years if it is for personal use. The message is clear—drugs will not be tolerated&quot;. A number of travellers have been held pending charge while Dubai authorities test their possessions, blood and urine for any trace of contraband.

In 2018, Houthi rebel group claimed that Dubai airport had been attacked by drones launched by Houthi rebels from Yemen. In response, Dubai Airports stated “With regards to reports by questionable sources this morning, Dubai Airports can confirm that Dubai International (DXB) is operating as normal without any interruption”.

==Operations==

Since there are international flights operating out from the airport, the terminals are equipped with immigration processing facilities and security scanning for all passengers including domestic, and regional passengers. Terminals 1 and 3 handle 95% of the international flights, whilst Terminal 2 mainly caters to regional flights and international flights routed to other airports in Middle East. Emirates Airline operates from only Terminal 3. Conversely, low-cost carriers such as flydubai operate flights out of Terminal 2.

Passenger growth at the airport has been growing at an average rate of 18%. The airport reached its capacity of 33 million passengers per annum by 2007; however, this was still not enough to handle the growing over congestion at the airport. In 2013, the airport&#x27;s capacity reached 75 million with the opening of concourse A and expansion of Terminal 2.

Passenger traffic for 2014 grew by 7.5% as 70.48 million passengers passed through Dubai International, compared to 66.43 million during the corresponding period in 2013. Growth slowed down in 2014 due to the 80-day runway resurfacing project, which saw DXB operate with only one runway between May and July.

In 2014, India was DXB&#x27;s biggest destination with 8.91 million passengers. The UK, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan followed with 5.38 million, 4.88 million and 3.13 million, respectively. London&#x27;s Heathrow became the top city destination, recording 2,626,357 passengers. Doha followed it with 2,355,959. 

In 2020, Dubai International Airport&#x27;s first quarter passenger traffic fell down by 67.8 per cent and reached 5.75 million. This is even lower than the statistics presented last year in the same quarter.

In 2022, Dubai International Airport registered strong recovery and robust growth in its customer base that propelled the annual passenger numbers to 66 million. The airport’s growth outpaced the annual forecast in the final months of the year following an exceptionally strong fourth quarter.

===Cargo===
The airport handled 2.37 million tonnes of air cargo in 2014, a decrease of 3.1 per cent over 2013, making it the sixth-busiest airfreight hub in the world and the busiest in the Middle East. The decline was due to the runway closure, and the shifting of many cargo flights from DXB to Al Maktoum International Airport.

==Ground transportation==

===Road===
The airport is connected by the road D 89. One of the longest intra-city roads, D 89 begins at the Deira Corniche and runs perpendicular to D 85 (Baniyas Road). From Deira, the road progresses south-eastward towards Dubai International Airport, intersecting with E311 (Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road) past the airport. A road tunnel underneath one of the runways was built in 2003, known as the Airport Tunnel.

===Metro===

The airport is served by Dubai Metro, which operates two lines through or near the airport. The Red Line has a station at each of Terminal 3 and Terminal 1. The stations are located in front of both terminals and can be accessed directly from the arrivals areas.

The Green Line has at a station near the Airport Free Zone, from which passengers can connect to Terminal 2.

===Bus===
Dubai Buses operated by RTA run a number of routes to the city, but mainly Deira, and are available at the Airport Ground Transportation center and the Arrivals at every terminal.

Passengers who need to transfer between Terminals 1 and 3, and Terminal 2 can use the inter-terminal shuttle bus service which operates frequently.

Bus stations are situated opposite both Terminal 1, 2 and 3. Local buses CO1, 11, 15, 24, N30, 32C, 33, 64A and 77 can be used to connect with Terminal 1 and 3, while Bus 13B, 20, C26, N30, 31, and 43 connects with Terminal 2. Dubai International Airport Buses provide air-conditioned transport into the city center and over 80 hotels in the city.

Emirates offers a complimentary coach service, which operates three daily services to and from Al Ain, and four daily, to and from Abu Dhabi. So does Etihad.

===Taxi===
The airport is served by the Government owned Dubai Taxi Agency, which provides 24-hour service at the arrivals in every terminal. The Airport Taxi fares are rather quite higher than the usual 5 AED fare for normal taxis but rather 500% of the fare starting from 25 dirhams.

<text>Ilmenite is a titanium-iron oxide mineral with the idealized formula . It is a weakly magnetic black or steel-gray solid. Ilmenite is the most important ore of titanium and the main source of titanium dioxide, which is used in paints, printing inks, fabrics, plastics, paper, sunscreen, food and cosmetics.

== Structure and properties ==
Ilmenite is a heavy (specific gravity 4.7), moderately hard (Mohs hardness 5.6 to 6), opaque black mineral with a submetallic luster. It is almost always massive, with thick tabular crystals being quite rare. It shows no discernible cleavage, breaking instead with a conchoidal to uneven fracture.

Ilmenite crystallizes in the trigonal system with space group &quot;R&quot;. The ilmenite crystal structure consists of an ordered derivative of the corundum structure; in corundum all cations are identical but in ilmenite Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions occupy alternating layers perpendicular to the trigonal c axis.

Pure ilmenite is paramagnetic (showing only very weak attraction to a magnet), but ilmenite forms solid solutions with hematite that are weakly ferromagnetic and so are noticeably attracted to a magnet. Natural deposits of ilmenite usually contain intergrown or exsolved magnetite that also contribute to its ferromagnetism.

Ilmenite is distinguished from hematite by its less intensely black color and duller appearance and its black streak, and from magnetite by its weaker magnetism.

==Discovery==
In 1791 William Gregor discovered a deposit of black sand in a stream that runs through the valley just south of the village of Manaccan (Cornwall), and identified for the first time titanium as one of the constituents of the main mineral in the sand. Gregor named this mineral manaccanite. The same mineral was found in the Ilmensky Mountains, near Miass, Russia, and named &quot;ilmenite&quot;.

== Mineral chemistry ==
Pure ilmenite has the composition . However, ilmenite most often contains appreciable quantities of magnesium and manganese and up to 6 wt% of hematite, , substituting for in the crystal structure. Thus the full chemical formula can be expressed as . Ilmenite forms a solid solution with geikielite () and pyrophanite () which are magnesian and manganiferous end-members of the solid solution series.

Although ilmenite is typically close to the ideal composition, with minor mole percentages of Mn and Mg, the ilmenites of kimberlites usually contain substantial amounts of geikielite molecules, and in some highly differentiated felsic rocks ilmenites may contain significant amounts of pyrophanite molecules.

At temperatures above , there is a complete solid solution between ilmenite and hematite. There is a miscibility gap at lower temperatures, resulting in a coexistence of these two minerals in rocks but no solid solution. This coexistence may result in exsolution lamellae in cooled ilmenites with more iron in the system than can be homogeneously accommodated in the crystal lattice. Ilmenite containing 6 to 13 percent is sometimes described as &quot;ferrian ilmenite&quot;.

Ilmenite alters or weathers to form the pseudo-mineral leucoxene, a fine-grained yellowish to grayish or brownish material enriched to 70% or more of . Leucoxene is an important source of titanium in heavy mineral sands ore deposits.

== Paragenesis ==
Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral found in metamorphic and igneous rocks. It is found in large concentrations in layered intrusions where it forms as part of a cumulate layer within the intrusion. Ilmenite generally occurs in these cumulates together with orthopyroxene or in combination with plagioclase and apatite (&quot;nelsonite&quot;).

Magnesian ilmenite is formed in kimberlites as part of the MARID association of minerals (mica-amphibole-rutile-ilmenite-diopside) assemblage of glimmerite xenoliths. Manganiferous ilmenite is found in granitic rocks and also in carbonatite intrusions where it may also contain anomalously high amounts of niobium.

Many mafic igneous rocks contain grains of intergrown magnetite and ilmenite, formed by the oxidation of ulvospinel.

== Processing and consumption ==
Most ilmenite is mined for titanium dioxide production. Ilmenite and titanium dioxide are used in the production of titanium metal.

Titanium dioxide is most used as a white pigment and the major consuming industries for TiO2 pigments are paints and surface coatings, plastics, and paper and paperboard. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in China is about 1.1 kilograms per year, compared with 2.7 kilograms for Western Europe and the United States.

Titanium is the ninth most abundant element on Earth and represents about 0.6 percent of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Ilmenite is commonly processed to obtain a titanium concentrate, which is called &quot;synthetic rutile&quot; if it contains more than 90 percent TiO2, or more generally &quot;titaniferous slags&quot; if it has a lower TiO2 content. More than 80 percent of the estimated global production of titanium concentrate is obtained from the processing of ilmenite, while 13 percent is obtained from titaniferous slags and 5 percent from rutile.

Ilmenite can be converted into pigment grade titanium dioxide via either the sulfate process or the chloride process. Ilmenite can also be improved and purified to titanium dioxide in the form of rutile using the Becher process.

Ilmenite ores can also be converted to liquid iron and a titanium-rich slag using a smelting process.

Ilmenite ore is used as a flux by steelmakers to line blast furnace hearth refractory.

Ilmenite can be used to produce ferrotitanium via an aluminothermic reduction.

== Feedstock production ==

Most ilmenite is recovered from heavy mineral sands ore deposits, where the mineral is concentrated as a placer deposit and weathering reduces its iron content, increasing the percentage of titanium. However, ilmenite can also be recovered from &quot;hard rock&quot; titanium ore sources, such as ultramafic to mafic layered intrusions or anorthosite massifs. The ilmenite in layered intrusions is sometimes abundant, but it contains considerable intergrowths of magnetite that reduce its ore grade. Ilmenite from anorthosite massifs often contain large amounts of calcium or magnesium that render it unsuitable for the chloride process.

The proven reserves of ilmenite and rutile ore are estimated at between 423 and 600 million tonnes titanium dioxide. The largest ilmenite deposits are in South Africa, India, the United States, Canada, Norway, Australia, Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. Additional deposits are found in Bangladesh, Chile, Mexico and New Zealand.

Australia was the world&#x27;s largest ilmenite ore producer in 2011, with about 1.3 million tonnes of production, followed by South Africa, Canada, Mozambique, India, China, Vietnam, Ukraine, Norway, Madagascar and United States.

The top four ilmenite and rutile feedstock producers in 2010 were Rio Tinto Group, Iluka Resources, Exxaro and Kenmare Resources, which collectively accounted for more than 60% of world&#x27;s supplies.

The world&#x27;s two largest open cast ilmenite mines are:
* The Tellnes mine located in Sokndal, Norway, and run by Titania AS (owned by Kronos Worldwide Inc.) with 0.55 Mtpa capacity and 57 Mt contained reserves.
* The Rio Tinto Group&#x27;s Lac Tio mine located near Havre Saint-Pierre, Quebec in Canada with a 3 Mtpa capacity and 52 Mt reserves.

Major mineral sands based ilmenite mining operations include: 
* Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa, majority-owned by the Rio Tinto Group.
* Kenmare Resources&#x27; Moma mine in Mozambique.
* Iluka Resources&#x27; mining operations in Australia including Murray Basin, Eneabba and Capel.
* The Kerala Minerals &amp; Metals Ltd (KMML), Indian Rare Earths (IRE), VV Mineral mines in India.
* TiZir Ltd.&#x27;s Grande Cote mine in Senegal
* QIT Madagascar Minerals mine, majority-owned by the Rio Tinto Group, which began production in 2009 and is expected to produce 0.75 Mtpa of ilmenite, potentially expanding to 2 Mtpa in future phases.

Attractive major potential ilmenite deposits include:
* The Karhujupukka magnetite-ilmenite deposit in Kolari, northern Finland with around 5 Mt reserves and ore containing about 6.2% titanium.
* The Balla Balla magnetite-iron-titanium-vanadium ore deposit in the Pilbara of Western Australia, which contains 456 million tonnes of cumulate ore horizon grading 45% , 13.7% and 0.64% , one of the richest magnetite-ilmenite ore bodies in Australia
* The Coburn, WIM 50, Douglas, Pooncarie mineral sands deposits in Australia.
* The Magpie titano-magnetite (iron-titanium-vanadium-chrome) deposits in eastern Quebec of Canada with about 1 billion tonnes containing about 43% Fe, 12% TiO2, 0.4% V2O5, and 2.2% Cr2O3.
* The Longnose deposit in Northeast Minnesota is considered to be &quot;the largest and richest ilmenite deposit in North America.&quot;

In 2020, China has by far the highest titanium mining activity. About 35 percent of the world’s ilmenite is mined in China, representing 33 percent of total titanium mineral mining (including ilmenite and rutile). South Africa and Mozambique are also important contributors, representing 13 percent and 12 percent of worldwide ilmenite mining, respectively. Australia represents 6 percent of the total ilmenite mining and 31 percent of rutile mining. Sierra Leone and Ukraine are also big contributors to rutile mining.

China is the biggest producer of titanium dioxide, followed by the United States and Germany. China is also the leader in the production of titanium metal, but Japan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan have emerged as important contributors to this field.

==Patenting activities==
Patenting activity related to titanium dioxide production from ilmenite is rapidly increasing. Between 2002 and 2022, there have been 459 patent families that describe the production of titanium dioxide from ilmenite, and this number is growing rapidly. The majority of these patents describe pre-treatment processes, such as using smelting and magnetic separation to increase titanium concentration in low-grade ores, leading to titanium concentrates or slags. Other patents describe processes to obtain titanium dioxide, either by a direct hydrometallurgical process or through two industrially exploited processes, the sulfate process and the chloride process. Acid leaching might be used either as a pre-treatment or as part of a hydrometallurgical process to directly obtain titanium dioxide or synthetic rutile (&gt;90 percent titanium dioxide, TiO2). The sulfate process represents 40 percent of the world’s titanium dioxide production and is protected in 23 percent of patent families. The chloride process is only mentioned in 8 percent of patent families, although it provides 60 percent of the worldwide industrial production of titanium dioxide.&lt;br&gt;Key contributors to patents on the production of titanium dioxide are companies from China, Australia and the United States, reflecting the major contribution of these countries to industrial production. Chinese companies Pangang and Lomon Billions Groups are the main contributors and hold diversified patent portfolios covering both pre-treatment and the processes leading to a final product.

In comparison, patenting activity related to titanium metal production from ilmenite remains stable. Between 2002 and 2022, there have been 92 patent families that describe the production of titanium metal from ilmenite, and this number has remained quite steady. These patents describe the production of titanium metal starting from mineral ores, such as ilmenite, and from titanium dioxide (TiO2) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a chemical obtained as an intermediate in the chloride process. The starting materials are purified if needed, and then converted to titanium metal by a chemical reduction process using a reducing agent. Processes mainly differ in regard to the reducing agent used to transform the starting material into titanium metal: magnesium is the most frequently cited reducing agent and the most exploited in industrial production.&lt;br&gt;Key players in the field are Japanese companies, in particular Toho Titanium and Osaka Titanium Technologies, both focusing on reduction using magnesium. Pangang also contributes to titanium metal production and holds patents describing reduction by molten salt electrolysis.

==Lunar ilmenite==
Ilmenite has been found in lunar samples, particularly in high-Ti lunar mare basalts common from Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 sites, and on average, constitutes up to 5% of lunar meteorites. Ilmenite has been targeted for ISRU water and oxygen extraction due to a simplistic reduction reaction which occurs with CO and H2 buffers.

<doc id="154748" wikidata="Q415729" url="?curid=154748" title="Baddeleyite">
<text>Baddeleyite is a rare zirconium oxide mineral (ZrO2 or zirconia), occurring in a variety of monoclinic prismatic crystal forms. It is transparent to translucent, has high indices of refraction, and ranges from colorless to yellow, green, and dark brown. See etymology below.

Baddeleyite is a refractory mineral, with a melting point of 2700 °C. Hafnium is a substituting &quot;impurity&quot; and may be present in quantities ranging from 0.1 to several percent.

It can be found in igneous rocks containing potassium feldspar and plagioclase. Baddeleyite is commonly not found with zircon (ZrSiO4), because it forms in silica-undersaturated rocks, such as mafic rocks. This is because, when silica is free in the system (silica-saturated/oversaturated), zircon is the dominating phase, not baddeleyite. It belongs to the monoclinic-prismatic class, of the P21/c crystal system. It has been used for geochronology.

==Geologic occurrence==

Baddeleyite was first found in Sri Lanka in 1892. It can be found in numerous terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks. Some of these terrestrial rocks are carbonatite, kimberlite, alkaline syenite, some rocks of layered mafic intrusions, diabase dikes, gabbroid sills and anorthosite. Some examples of extraterrestrial rocks are tektites, meteorites and lunar basalt. Studies have shown that zircon and baddeleyite can be recovered from some anorthositic rocks in Proterozoic anorthosite complexes. Places where these Proterozoic anorthosite complexes can be found are: the Laramie Anorthosite Complex in Wyoming, the Nain and Grenville provinces of Canada, the Vico Volcanic Complex in Italy, and Minas Gerais and Jacupiranga, São Paulo, Brazil. Baddeleyite forms in igneous rocks low in silica, it can be found in rocks containing potassium feldspar and plagioclase. It has been observed in thin section that baddeleyite forms within plagioclase grains. Associated minerals include ilmenite, zirkelite, apatite, magnetite, perovskite, fluorite, nepheline, pyrochlore and allanite.

Because of their refractory nature and stability under diverse conditions, baddeleyite grains, along with zircon, are used for uranium-lead radiometric age determinations.
==Structure==
There has been some dispute in the structure of baddeleyite. Originally, the mineral was assigned to the 8-fold coordination by Naray Szabo. This structure was ruled out due to the inaccuracy of the data used to establish it.

Baddeleyite has the group symmetry P21/c with four ZrO2 in the unit cell. It has unit cell dimensions of:
a = 5.169 b = 5.232 c = 5.341 Å (all ± 0.008 Å), β = 99˚15ˊ ± 10ˊ.

The coordination number for ZrO2 has been found to be 7. The mineral has two types of separations. The first being the seven shortest Zr-O, ranging from 2.04 to 2.26 Å, and the second Zr-O separation is 3.77 Å. Because of this, the coordination of baddeleyite was determined to be sevenfold. Baddeleyite&#x27;s structure is a combination of tetrahedrally coordinated oxide ions parallel to (100) with triangular coordinated oxide ions. This explains baddeleyite&#x27;s tendency to twin along the (100) planes. It has been observed that baddeleyite without twinning is extremely rare.

==Composition==
Baddeleyite belongs to the oxide group, having a composition of ZrO2. Similar minerals belonging to the same group are the rutile group: rutile (TiO2), pyrolusite (MnO2), cassiterite (SnO2), uraninite (UO2) and thorianite (ThO2). Baddeleyite is chemically homogeneous, but it may contain impurities such as Ti, Hf, and Fe. Higher concentrations of Ti and Fe are restricted to mafic-ultramafic rocks.

==Physical properties==
Baddeleyite is black in color with a submetallic lustre. It has a 6.5 hardness, and a brownish-white streak. Baddeleyite can also be brown, brownish black, green, and greenish brown. Its streak is white, or brownish white. It has a distinct cleavage along {001} and tends to twin along (100). It belongs to the monoclinic system and is part of the P21/c group.

==Origin of the name==
It was named for Joseph Baddeley. The mineral was discovered in Rakwana, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Baddeley was a superintendent of a railroad project in Rakwana. As recounted by J.J.H. Teall – director of the British Geological Survey in the early 1900s – baddeleyite was discovered consequent to the discovery of geikielite.

Baddeley sent specimens of several pebbles from the Rakwana railroad excavations to the Museum of Practical Geology in London, where a Mr. Pringle examined them and attempted to classify them.
Pringle was unable to assign the specimens to a known mineral species and submitted them to Teall. After analyzing the specimens, Teall concluded that the mineral was mainly composed of titanic acid and magnesia, with an incidental mixture of protoxide of iron. Geikielite has the composition of .
Teall and Pringle decided to name the new mineral &quot;geikielite&quot;, naming it after Sir Archibald Geikie, then the Director General of the Geological Survey.

Baddeley sent more specimens to Teall, in order to provide an exemplary specimen for display at the Museum of Practical Geology. While trying to find the specimens, Teall noticed that one of them was different from the rest: This new mineral was black in color, with a submetallic lustre, and a hardness of 6.5 . After analyzing it, the odd mineral was determined to not be (geikielite), but instead . Teall proposed mineral name &quot;baddeleyite&quot;, after Joseph Baddeley, to honor the man who brought the two new minerals to notice.

<doc id="154750" wikidata="Q36200" url="?curid=154750" title="Zirconium dioxide">
<text>Zirconium dioxide (), sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zirconium silicate or zircon), is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium. Its most naturally occurring form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the mineral baddeleyite. A dopant stabilized cubic structured zirconia, cubic zirconia, is synthesized in various colours for use as a gemstone and a diamond simulant.

==Production, chemical properties, occurrence==
Zirconia is produced by calcining zirconium compounds, exploiting its high thermostability.

===Structure===
Three phases are known: monoclinic below 1170 °C, tetragonal between 1170 °C and 2370 °C, and cubic above 2370 °C. The trend is for higher symmetry at higher temperatures, as is usually the case. A small percentage of the oxides of calcium or yttrium stabilize in the cubic phase. The very rare mineral tazheranite, , is cubic. Unlike , which features six-coordinated titanium in all phases, monoclinic zirconia consists of seven-coordinated zirconium centres. This difference is attributed to the larger size of the zirconium atom relative to the titanium atom.

===Chemical reactions===
Zirconia is chemically unreactive. It is slowly attacked by concentrated hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid. When heated with carbon, it converts to zirconium carbide. When heated with carbon in the presence of chlorine, it converts to zirconium(IV) chloride. This conversion is the basis for the purification of zirconium metal and is analogous to the Kroll process.

==Engineering properties ==

Zirconium dioxide is one of the most studied ceramic materials. adopts a monoclinic crystal structure at room temperature and transitions to tetragonal and cubic at higher temperatures. The change of volume caused by the structure transitions from tetragonal to monoclinic to cubic induces large stresses, causing it to crack upon cooling from high temperatures. When the zirconia is blended with some other oxides, the tetragonal and/or cubic phases are stabilized. Effective dopants include magnesium oxide (MgO), yttrium oxide (, yttria), calcium oxide (), and cerium(III) oxide ().

Zirconia is often more useful in its phase &#x27;stabilized&#x27; state. Upon heating, zirconia undergoes disruptive phase changes. By adding small percentages of yttria, these phase changes are eliminated, and the resulting material has superior thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. In some cases, the tetragonal phase can be metastable. If sufficient quantities of the metastable tetragonal phase is present, then an applied stress, magnified by the stress concentration at a crack tip, can cause the tetragonal phase to convert to monoclinic, with the associated volume expansion. This phase transformation can then put the crack into compression, retarding its growth, and enhancing the fracture toughness. This mechanism, known as transformation toughening, significantly extends the reliability and lifetime of products made with stabilized zirconia.

The band gap is dependent on the phase (cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic, or amorphous) and preparation methods, with typical estimates from 5–7 eV.

A special case of zirconia is that of tetragonal zirconia polycrystal, or TZP, which is indicative of polycrystalline zirconia composed of only the metastable tetragonal phase.
==3Y stabilised ZrO2 and 5Y ZrO2 stabilised==
When ZrO₂ is stabilised by adding 3 mol% of yttrium oxide (3Y-ZrO₂) at high temperatures (~1500 °C), its mechanical properties such as fracture toughness, flexural strength, and hardness are significantly improved. This is because 3Y-ZrO₂ retains a metastable tetragonal phase at room temperature, which undergoes a stress-induced transformation to the monoclinic phase, leading to phase transformation toughening mechanism under high stress intensity. 

In contrast, when ZrO₂ is stabilised with 5 mol% of yttrium oxide (5Y-ZrO₂), it is primarily in the cubic phase, and does not undergo transformation toughening mechanism when stress is applied. As a result, while 5Y-ZrO₂ exhibits better optical properties i.e, enhanced translucency due to fewer grain boundaries to scatter light, its mechanical properties (fracture toughness, strength, and hardness) do not improve in the same way as 3Y-ZrO₂.
==Uses==
The main use of zirconia is in the production of hard ceramics, such as in dentistry, with other uses including as a protective coating on particles of titanium dioxide pigments, as a refractory material, in insulation, abrasives, and enamels.

Stabilized zirconia is used in oxygen sensors and fuel cell membranes because it has the ability to allow oxygen ions to move freely through the crystal structure at high temperatures. This high ionic conductivity (and a low electronic conductivity) makes it one of the most useful electroceramics. Zirconium dioxide is also used as the solid electrolyte in electrochromic devices.

Zirconia is a precursor to the electroceramic lead zirconate titanate (&quot;PZT&quot;), which is a high-κ dielectric, which is found in myriad components.

===Niche uses===
The very low thermal conductivity of cubic phase of zirconia also has led to its use as a thermal barrier coating, or TBC, in jet and diesel engines to allow operation at higher temperatures. Thermodynamically, the higher the operation temperature of an engine, the greater the possible efficiency. Another low-thermal-conductivity use is as a ceramic fiber insulation for crystal growth furnaces, fuel-cell stacks, and infrared heating systems.

This material is also used in dentistry in the manufacture of subframes for the construction of dental restorations such as crowns and bridges, which are then veneered with a conventional feldspathic porcelain for aesthetic reasons, or of strong, extremely durable dental prostheses constructed entirely from monolithic zirconia, with limited but constantly improving aesthetics. Zirconia stabilized with yttria (yttrium oxide), known as yttria-stabilized zirconia, can be used as a strong base material in some full ceramic crown restorations.

Transformation-toughened zirconia is used to make ceramic knives. Because of the hardness, ceramic-edged cutlery stays sharp longer than steel edged products.

Due to its infusibility and brilliant luminosity when incandescent, it was used as an ingredient of sticks for limelight.

Zirconia has been proposed to electrolyze carbon monoxide and oxygen from the atmosphere of Mars to provide both fuel and oxidizer that could be used as a store of chemical energy for use with surface transportation on Mars. Carbon monoxide/oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use, as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced by zirconia electrolysis without requiring use of any of the Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed for the production of methane or any hydrogen-based fuels.

Zirconia can be used as photocatalyst since its high band gap (~ 5 eV) allows the generation of high-energy electrons and holes. Some studies demonstrated the activity of doped zirconia (in order to increase visible light absorption) in degrading organic compounds and reducing Cr(VI) from wastewaters.

Zirconia is also a potential high-κ dielectric material with potential applications as an insulator in transistors.

Zirconia is also employed in the deposition of optical coatings; it is a high-index material usable from the near-UV to the mid-IR, due to its low absorption in this spectral region. In such applications, it is typically deposited by PVD.

In jewelry making, some watch cases are advertised as being &quot;black zirconium oxide&quot;. In 2015 Omega released a fully watch named &quot;The Dark Side of The Moon&quot; with ceramic case, bezel, pushers, and clasp, advertising it as four times harder than stainless steel and therefore much more resistant to scratches during everyday use.

In gas tungsten arc welding, tungsten electrodes containing 1% zirconium oxide (a.k.a. zirconia) instead of 2% thorium have good arc starting and current capacity, and are not radioactive.

===Diamond simulant===
Single crystals of the cubic phase of zirconia are commonly used as diamond simulant in jewellery. Like diamond, cubic zirconia has a cubic crystal structure and a high index of refraction. Visually discerning a good quality cubic zirconia gem from a diamond is difficult, and most jewellers will have a thermal conductivity tester to identify cubic zirconia by its low thermal conductivity (diamond is a very good thermal conductor). This state of zirconia is commonly called &quot;cubic zirconia&quot;, &quot;CZ&quot;, or &quot;zircon&quot; by jewellers, but the last name is not chemically accurate. Zircon is actually the mineral name for naturally occurring zirconium(IV) silicate ().

<text>Lazare Hippolyte Carnot (6 October 1801, Saint-Omer – 16 March 1888) was a French politician.
He was the younger brother of the founder of thermodynamics Sadi Carnot and the 
second son of the revolutionary politician and general Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot, who also served in the government 
of Napoleon, as well as the father of French president Marie François Sadi Carnot.

== Early life ==
Hippolyte Carnot was born in Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais. After the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, his father went into exile. Hippolyte Carnot lived at first in exile with his father, returning to France only in 1823. Unable to enter active political life, he turned to literature and philosophy, publishing in 1828 a collection of &quot;Chants helléniens&quot; translated from the German of Wilhelm Müller, and in 1830 an &quot;Exposé de la doctrine Saint-Simonienne&quot;, and collaborating in the Saint-Simonian journal &quot;Le Producteur&quot;. He paid several visits to Britain and travelled in other countries of Europe.

== Overview ==
In March 1839 after the dissolution of the chamber by Louis Philippe, he was elected deputy for Paris (re-elected in 1842 and in 1846), and sat in the group of the Radical Left, being one of the leaders of the party hostile to Louis Philippe. On 24 February 1848 he pronounced in favour of the republic. Alphonse de Lamartine chose him as minister of education in the provisional government, and Carnot set to work to organize the primary school systems, proposing a law for obligatory and free primary instruction, and another for the secondary education of girls. He opposed purely secular schools, holding that &quot;the minister and the schoolmaster are the two columns on which rests the edifice of the republic.&quot; By this attitude he alienated both the Right and the Republicans of the Extreme Left, and was forced to resign on 5 July 1848. He was one of those who protested against the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December 1851 but was not proscribed by Louis Napoleon. He refused to sit in the Corps Législatif until 1864, in order not to have to take the oath to the emperor.

From 1864 to 1869 he was in the republican opposition, taking a very active part. He was defeated at the election of 1869. On 8 February 1871 he was elected deputy for the Seine-et-Oise &quot;département&quot;. He joined the &quot;Gauche républicaine&quot; parliamentary group and participated in the drawing up of the Constitutional Laws of 1875. 
On 16 December 1875 he was named by the National Assembly senator for life. 
He died three months after the election of his elder son, Marie François Sadi Carnot, to the presidency of the republic.

He had published &quot;Le Ministère de l&#x27;Instruction Publique et des Cultes, depuis le 24 février jusqu&#x27;au 5 juillet 1848&quot;, &quot;Mémoires sur Carnot par son fils&quot; (2 vols., 1861–1864), &quot;Mémoires de Barère de Vieuzac&quot; (with David d&#x27;Angers, 4 vols 1842–1843). 
His second son, Marie Adolphe Carnot (b. 1830), became a distinguished mining engineer and director of the École des Mines (1899), his studies in analytical chemistry placing him in the front rank of French scientists. He was made a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1895.

<text>Marie François Sadi Carnot (; 11 August 1837 – 25 June 1894) was a French statesman who served as President of France from 1887 until his assassination in 1894.

His presidency was marked by a series of poorly handled crises. General Boulanger&#x27;s rapid rise and failed attempt to march on the Élysée in 1889 posed the first serious threat to the Republic during Carnot&#x27;s term. Then came a series of ministerial crises, financial scandals, labour turmoil, anarchist violence, and finally Carnot&#x27;s own assassination in 1894. The Panama scandals, involving bribes to parliamentarians, resulted in major financial losses and deeply embarrassed those involved. The extreme right-wing newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, run by anti-Semitic publicist Édouard Drumont, escalated intolerance towards Third Republic politics.

Carnot presided over a few achievements. He was well received when he travelled around France and when he inaugurated the 1889 exhibition celebrating the French Revolution, and he facilitated a rapprochement with Russia. His term in office bolstered the power and influence of the presidency.

==Early life==
Marie François Sadi Carnot was the son of the statesman Hippolyte Carnot and was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne. His third given name Sadi was in honour of his uncle Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, the engineer who formulated the second law of thermodynamics and is generally regarded as the founder of the subject, who in turn was named after the Persian poet Sadi of Shiraz. Like his uncle, Marie François came to be known as Sadi Carnot. In his scientific-mindedness and Republican leanings, he resembled his grandfather, Lazare Carnot, the military modernizer and member of the Directory of the French Revolution.

He was educated as a civil engineer and was a highly distinguished student at both the École Polytechnique and the École des Ponts et Chaussées. After his academic course, he obtained an appointment in the public service. His hereditary republicanism caused the Government of National Defense to entrust him in 1870 with the task of organizing resistance in the of the Eure, Calvados and Seine-Inférieure, and he was made prefect of Seine-Inférieure in January 1871. In the following month he was elected to the French National Assembly by the Côte-d&#x27;Or. He joined the Opportunist Republican parliamentary group, . In August 1878 he was appointed secretary to the minister of public works. He became minister in September 1880 and again in April 1885, moving almost immediately to the ministry of finance, which post he held under both the Ferry and the Freycinet administrations until December 1886.

==Presidency==
When the Daniel Wilson scandals occasioned the downfall of Jules Grévy in December 1887, Carnot&#x27;s reputation for integrity made him a candidate for the presidency, and he obtained the support of Georges Clemenceau and many others, so that he was elected by 616 votes out of 827. He assumed office at a critical period, when the republic was all but openly attacked by General Boulanger.

Carnot&#x27;s ostensible part during this agitation was confined to augmenting his popularity by well-timed appearances on public occasions, which gained credit for the presidency and the republic. When, early in 1889, Boulanger was finally driven into exile, it fell to Carnot to appear as head of the state on two occasions of special interest, the celebration of the centenary of the French Revolution in 1889 and the opening of the Paris Exhibition of the same year. The success of both was regarded as a popular ratification of the republic, and though continually harassed by the formation and dissolution of ephemeral ministries, by socialist outbreaks, and the beginnings of anti-Semitism, Carnot had only one serious crisis to surmount, the Panama scandals of 1892, which, if they greatly damaged the prestige of the state, increased the respect felt for its head, against whose integrity none could breathe a word.

Carnot was in favour of the Franco-Russian Alliance and received the Order of St Andrew from Alexander III.

==Assassination==
President Carnot was reaching the zenith of his popularity, when, on 24 June 1894, after delivering a public banquet speech in Lyon at the Palais du Commerce, in which he appeared to imply that he would not seek re-election, he was stabbed on the Rue de la République by an Italian anarchist named Sante Geronimo Caserio.
Carnot, transported to the Préfecture du Rhône nearby, died shortly after midnight on 25 June. The stabbing aroused widespread horror and grief, and the president was honoured with an elaborate funeral ceremony in the Panthéon on 1 July 1894, after which he was interred in the Panthéon&#x27;s crypt alongside other notable figures in French history.

Caserio called the assassination a political act, and was executed on 16 August 1894.

<text>Comte de Lautréamont (; ) was the &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Isidore Lucien Ducasse (; 4 April 1846 – 24 November 1870), a French poet born in Uruguay. His only works, &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; and &quot;Poésies&quot;, had a major influence on modern arts and literature, particularly on the Surrealists and the Situationists. Ducasse died at the age of 24.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Ducasse was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, to François Ducasse, a French consular officer, and his wife Jacquette-Célestine Davezac. Very little is known about Isidore&#x27;s childhood, except that he was baptized on 16 November 1847 in the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral and that his mother died soon afterwards, possibly due to an epidemic. Jean-Jacques Lefrère suggests she may have committed suicide, although concludes there is no way to know for certain. In 1851, as a five-year-old, he experienced the end of the eight-year Siege of Montevideo in the Uruguayan Civil War. He was brought up speaking three languages: French, Spanish, and English.

In October 1859, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to high school in France by his father. He was trained in French education and technology at the Imperial Lycée in Tarbes. In 1863 he enrolled in the Lycée Louis-Barthou in Pau, where he attended classes in rhetoric and philosophy. He excelled at arithmetic and drawing and showed extravagance in his thinking and style. Isidore was a reader of Edgar Allan Poe and particularly favored Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron, as well as Adam Mickiewicz, Milton, Robert Southey, Alfred de Musset, and Baudelaire (see the letter of 23 October 1869 cited extensively below). At school he was fascinated by Racine and Corneille, and by the scene of the blinding in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. According to his schoolmate Paul Lespès, he displayed obvious folly &quot;by self-indulgent use of adjectives and an accumulation of terrible death images&quot; in an essay. After graduation he lived in Tarbes, where he started a friendship with Georges Dazet, the son of his guardian, and decided to become a writer.

===Years in Paris===
After a brief stay with his father in Montevideo, Ducasse settled in Paris at the end of 1867. He began studies in view of entering the École Polytechnique, only to abandon them one year later. Continuous allowances from his father made it possible for Ducasse to dedicate himself completely to his writing. He lived in the &quot;Intellectual Quarter&quot;, in a hotel in the &quot;Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires&quot;, where he worked intensely on the first canto of &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;. It is possible that he started this work before his passage to Montevideo, and also continued the work during his ocean journey.

Ducasse was a frequent visitor to nearby libraries, where he read Romantic literature, as well as scientific works and encyclopaedias. The publisher Léon Genonceaux described him as a &quot;large, dark, young man, beardless, mercurial, neat and industrious&quot;, and reported that Ducasse wrote &quot;only at night, sitting at his piano, declaiming wildly while striking the keys, and hammering out ever new verses to the sounds&quot;. However, this account has no corroborating evidence, and is considered unreliable.

In late 1868, Ducasse published (anonymously and at his own expense) the first canto of &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; (Chant premier, par ***), a booklet of thirty-two pages.

On 10 November 1868, Ducasse sent a letter to the writer Victor Hugo, in which he included two copies of the first canto, and asked for a recommendation for further publication. A new edition of the first canto appeared at the end of January 1869, in the anthology &quot;Parfums de l&#x27;Âme&quot; in Bordeaux. Here Ducasse used his pseudonym &quot;Comte de Lautréamont&quot; for the first time. His chosen name may have been based on the title character of Eugène Sue&#x27;s popular 1837 gothic novel &quot;&quot;, a haughty and blasphemous antihero similar in some ways to Isidore&#x27;s Maldoror. The pseudonym was possibly paraphrasing , although it can also be interpreted as &quot;l&#x27;autre Amon&quot; (the other Amon) or &quot;l&#x27;autre Amont&quot; (the other side of the river: &#x27;En amont&#x27; = French for: &#x27;Upstream&#x27;) or, finally, from &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;autre Mond&quot; (the other world&#x27;s count). Lefrère considers another possibility: le Comte de Lautréamont = le compte de l&#x27;autre à Mont (the account of the other at Montevideo); this could be interpreted as a joke at his father&#x27;s expense, who supported Ducasse with a generous allowance.

Thanks to his father&#x27;s money and the banker Darasse&#x27;s good offices, a total of six cantos were to be published during late 1869, by Albert Lacroix in Brussels, who had also published Eugène Sue. The book was already printed when Lacroix refused to distribute it to the booksellers as he feared prosecution for blasphemy or obscenity. Ducasse considered that this was because &quot;life in it is painted in too harsh colors&quot; (letter to the banker Darasse from 12 March 1870).

Ducasse urgently asked Auguste Poulet-Malassis, who had published Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; (&quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;) in 1857, to send copies of his book to the critics. They alone could judge &quot;the commencement of a publication which will see its end only later, and after I will have seen mine&quot;. He tried to explain his position, and even offered to change some &quot;too strong&quot; points for future editions:

Poulet-Malassis announced the forthcoming publication of the book the same month in his literary magazine &quot;Quarterly Review of Publications Banned in France and Printed Abroad&quot;. Otherwise, few people took heed of the book. Only the &quot;Bulletin du Bibliophile et du Bibliothécaire&quot; noticed it in May 1870, saying: &quot;The book will probably find a place under the bibliographic curiosities&quot;.

===Death===
During spring 1869, Ducasse frequently changed his address, from 32 Rue du Faubourg Montmartre to 15 Rue Vivienne, then back to Rue Faubourg Montmartre, where he lodged in a hotel at number 7. While still awaiting the distribution of his book, Ducasse worked on a new text, a follow-up to his &quot;phenomenological description of evil&quot;, in which he wanted to sing of good. The two works would form a whole, a dichotomy of good and evil. The work, however, remained a fragment.

In April and June 1870, Ducasse published the first two installments of what was obviously meant to be the preface to the planned &quot;chants of the good&quot; in two small brochures, &quot;Poésies&quot; I and II; this time he published under his real name, discarding his pseudonym. He differentiated the two parts of his work with the terms philosophy and poetry, announcing that the beginning of a struggle against evil was the reversal of his other work:

At the same time Ducasse took texts by famous authors and cleverly inverted, corrected and openly plagiarized for &quot;Poésies&quot;:

Among the works plagiarized were Blaise Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot; and La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s &quot;Maximes&quot;, as well as the work of Jean de La Bruyère, Luc de Clapiers, Dante, Kant and La Fontaine. It even included an improvement of his own &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;. The brochures of aphoristic prose did not have a price; each customer could decide which sum they wanted to pay for it.

On 19 July 1870, Napoleon III declared war on Prussia, and after his capture, Paris was besieged on 17 September, a situation with which Ducasse was already familiar from his early childhood in Montevideo. The living conditions worsened rapidly during the siege, and according to the owner of the hotel he lodged at, Ducasse became sick with a &quot;bad fever&quot;.

Lautréamont died at the age of 24, on 24 November 1870, at 8 am in his hotel. On his death certificate, &quot;no further information&quot; was given. Since many were afraid of epidemics while Paris was besieged, Ducasse was buried the next day after a service in Notre-Dame-de-Lorette in a provisional grave at the Cimetière du Nord. In January 1871, his body was put into another grave elsewhere.

In his &quot;Poésies&quot; Lautréamont announced: &quot;I will leave no memoirs&quot;, and as such, the life of the creator of &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; remains for the most part unknown.

==&quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;==

&quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; is based on a character called Maldoror, a figure of unrelenting evil who has forsaken God and mankind. 
The book combines a violent narrative with vivid and often surrealistic imagery.

The critic Alex De Jonge writes: &quot;Lautréamont forces his readers to stop taking their world for granted. He shatters the complacent acceptance of the reality proposed by their cultural traditions and makes them see that reality for what it is: an unreal nightmare all the more hair-raising because the sleeper believes he is awake&quot;.

There is a wealth of Lautréamont criticism, interpretation and analysis in French (including an esteemed biography by Jean-Jacques Lefrère), but little in English.

Lautréamont&#x27;s writing has many bizarre scenes, vivid imagery and drastic shifts in tone and style. There is much &quot;black humor&quot;; De Jonge argues that Maldoror reads like &quot;a sustained sick joke&quot;.

==&quot;Poésies&quot;==

&quot;Poésies&quot; (Poems, Poetry) is Ducasse&#x27;s other, minor surviving work, and is divided into two parts. Unlike &quot;Maldoror&quot;, &quot;Poésies&quot; was published under Ducasse&#x27;s given name.

Both parts consist of a series of maxims or aphorisms in prose, which express aesthetic opinions concerning literature and poetry. These statements frequently refer to authors of the western canon and compare their works and talents in rhetorical language; cited authors include the Greek tragedians, Edgar Allan Poe, and especially many French authors of Ducasse&#x27;s period, including Charles Baudelaire, Alexander Dumas, and Victor Hugo. &quot;Poésies&quot; is therefore not a collection of &quot;poetry&quot; as its title suggests, but instead a work of literary criticism, or poetics. &quot;Poésies&quot; also contrasts with the negative themes of &quot;Maldoror&quot; in the sense that it uses far more positive, uplifting, and humanistic language. Goodness and conventional moral values are regularly praised, even as authors familiar to Ducasse are sometimes denigrated:

Despite this, there are commonalities with &quot;Maldoror&quot;. Both works regularly describe animals by way of simile or colorful analogy, and although God is praised, other passages suggest on the contrary a humanism which places man above God: &quot;Elohim is made in man&#x27;s image.&quot;

==Surrealism==
In 1917, French writer Philippe Soupault discovered a copy of &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; in the mathematics section of a small Parisian bookshop, near the military hospital to which he had been admitted. In his memoirs Soupault wrote:

By the light of a candle that was permitted to me, I began reading. It was like an enlightenment. In the morning I read the &quot;Chants&quot; again, convinced that I had dreamed... The day after, André Breton came to visit me. I gave him the book and asked him to read it. The following day he brought it back, enthusiastic as I had been.

Due to this find, Lautréamont was introduced to the Surrealists. Soon they called him their prophet. As one of the &quot;poètes maudits&quot; (accursed poets), he was elevated to the Surrealist pantheon beside Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, and acknowledged as a direct precursor to Surrealism. In the first edition of the Manifeste du Surréalisme (1924) Breton wrote: &quot;With &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; the Surrealism was born. Older examples can only be traced all the way back to the time of prophets and oracles&quot;. André Gide regarded him — even more than Rimbaud — as the most significant figure, as the &quot;gate-master of tomorrow&#x27;s literature&quot;, meriting Breton and Soupault &quot;to have recognized and announced the literary and ultra-literary importance of the amazing Lautréamont&quot;.

Louis Aragon and Breton discovered the only copies of the &quot;Poésies&quot; in the National Library of France, and published the text in April and May 1919 in two sequential editions of their magazine &quot;Literature&quot;. In 1925, a special edition of the Surrealist magazine &quot;Le Disque Vert&quot; was dedicated to Lautréamont, under the title &quot;Le cas Lautréamont&quot; (The Lautréamont case). It was the 1927 publication by Soupault and Breton that assured him a permanent place in French literature and the status of patron saint in the Surrealist movement. In 1930, Aragon called Lautréamont the &quot;veritable initiator of the modern marvelous&quot;, with &quot;the marvelous&quot; being a primary feature of Breton&#x27;s Surrealism. In 1940, Breton incorporated him into his &quot;Anthology of Black Humour&quot;.

The title of an object by American artist Man Ray, called &quot;L&#x27;énigme d&#x27;Isidore Ducasse&quot; (&quot;The Enigma of Isidore Ducasse&quot;), created in 1920, contains a reference to a famous line in Canto VI, Chapter 3. Lautréamont describes a young boy as &quot;beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting-table of a sewing-machine and an umbrella&quot;. Similarly, Breton often used this line as an example of Surrealist dislocation. In direct reference to Lautréamont&#x27;s &quot;chance meeting on a dissection table&quot;, Max Ernst defined the structure of the surrealist painting as &quot;a linking of two realities that by all appearances have nothing to link them, in a setting that by all appearances does not fit them&quot;. Referencing this line, the debut record by the experimental/industrial music group Nurse with Wound is titled &quot;Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella&quot;.

&quot;Maldoror&quot; inspired many artists: Fray De Geetere, Salvador Dalí, Man Ray, Jacques Houplain, Jindřich Štyrský, René Magritte, Georg Baselitz and Victor Man. Individual works have been produced by Max Ernst, Victor Brauner, Óscar Domínguez, André Masson, Joan Miró, Aimé Césaire, Roberto Matta, Wolfgang Paalen, Kurt Seligmann and Yves Tanguy. The artist Amedeo Modigliani always carried a copy of the book with him and used to walk around Montparnasse quoting from it.
Félix Vallotton and Dalí made &quot;imaginary&quot; portraits of Lautréamont, since no photograph was available.

==Influence on others==
Kadour Naimi realized an adaptation of &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;, in theater in 1984, and as a film in 1997.

A portion of &quot;Maldoror&quot; is recited toward the end of Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Week End&quot;.

Situationist founder, filmmaker and author Guy Debord developed a section from &quot;Poésies II&quot; as thesis 207 in &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;. The thesis covers plagiarism as a necessity and how it is implied by progress. It explains that plagiarism embraces an author&#x27;s phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea. His fellow Situationist Raoul Vaneigem placed considerable importance on the insights of Lautréamont, stating in the Introduction to &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot; that: &quot;For as long as there have been men — and men who read Lautréamont — everything has been said and few people have gained anything from it.&quot;

The writers Jean Paulhan and Henri Michaux have both counted Lautréamont as an influence on their work.

Kenneth Anger claimed to have tried to make a film based on &quot;Maldoror&quot;, under the same title, but could not raise enough money to complete it.

In recent years, invoking an obscure clause in the French civil code, Article 171, modern performance artist Shishaldin petitioned the government for permission to marry the author posthumously.
John Ashbery, an American poet influenced by surrealism, entitled his 1992 collection &quot;Hotel Lautréamont&quot;, and the English edition notes that Lautréamont is &quot;one of the forgotten presences alive&quot; in the book.

Brazilian author Joca Reiners Terron depicts the character of Isidoro Ducasse as one of the seven angels of the Apocalypse in his first novel, &quot;Não Há Nada Lá&quot;. Ducasse&#x27;s character becomes obsessed with an edition of &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; in the novel, while taking a trip by train through Europe. Both Ducasse and his &quot;Chants de Maldoror&quot; are also briefly mentioned in Jô Soares&#x27; 1995 novel &quot;O Xangô de Baker Street&quot;, and musician Rogério Skylab has a song inspired by, and named after, the &quot;Chants of Maldoror&quot; in his 2021 album &quot;Caos e Cosmos, Vol. 1&quot;.

Isidore Ducasse is the given name of the fashion creator in William Klein&#x27;s 1966 movie &quot;Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?&quot;.

Lautréamont, as an unnamed &quot;South American&quot;, appears as a character in Julio Cortázar&#x27;s short story &quot;The Other Heaven&quot;, which also uses quotations from &quot;Maldoror&quot; as epigraphs.

French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychiatrist Félix Guattari cited Lautréamont twice over the course of their joint two-volume work, &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;, once in each volume. 

Róbert Wittinger composed a &quot;Maldoror Requiem&quot;, for 8 soloists, mixed choir, narrator and large orchestra, Op.42 (1984-86).

<text>Sante Geronimo Caserio (; 8 September 187316 August 1894) was an Italian anarchist and the assassin of Sadi Carnot, President of the French Third Republic. Caserio was born in Motta Visconti, Lombardy. On 24 June 1894, he fatally stabbed President Carnot after a banquet, to avenge the executions of anarchist bombers Auguste Vaillant and Émile Henry.

==Biography==
Sante Caserio was a Lombardy-born son of a peasant family, who had many brothers and sisters. His father was a boatman who died of pellagra, at the time a common disease among farmers whose poor diet was often almost exclusively corn. At ten years old, Sante Caserio left the family home and went to Milan, where he got a job as an apprentice baker and had his first contacts with anarchists.

In Milan he joined a small group called &quot;On Foot&quot; (, at the time signifying &quot;without money&quot;). Pietro Gori, referring to Caserio, remembered him as a generous person. Among the workers and unemployed, he divided bread and anarchist pamphlets he printed with his meager salary. In 1892, he was sentenced to eight months in prison for distributing anarchist leaflets. Identified and singled out during a public demonstration, he was forced to flee from Italy at the age of 18. Declared a deserter, he first went to Switzerland and sought a job as a baker in Vienne, France. He then moved to Lyon on 21 July 1893 where he worked as a messenger.

==Trial and execution==
At his trial, Caserio described the assassination in detail:
He also stated to those in attendance:Well, if the rulers can use against us rifles, shackles and prisons, we must, we anarchists to defend our lives, we must stick to our principles? No. On the contrary, our response to the rulers will be dynamite, pump, stiletto, dagger. In short, we must do everything possible to destroy the bourgeoisie and the government. You who are representatives of bourgeois companies, if you want my head, you can take it!He never attempted to deny his actions or ask the judges for mercy. He was offered the opportunity to plead insanity, in exchange for giving the names of some of his accomplices, but he refused. He told the police &quot;Caserio is a baker, never an informer.&quot; The Board of Pardons decided against all appeals for clemency on 14 August. Caserio was executed by guillotine in Lyon at 5am, 16 August 1894. In front of the guillotine, he exclaimed &quot;Coraggio cugini—evviva l&#x27;anarchia!&quot; (&quot;Courage, cousins—long live anarchy!&quot;) His death mask was in the possession of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the French party National Front.

<text>Joseph Athanase Doumer, commonly known as Paul Doumer (; 22 March 18577 May 1932), was a French politician who served as the President of France from June 1931 until his assassination in May 1932. He is described as &quot;the Father of French Indochina,&quot; and was seen as one of the most active and effective governors general of Indochina.

==Early life==
Joseph Athanase Doumer was born in Aurillac, in the Cantal &quot;département&quot;, in France on 22 March 1857, into a family of modest means. Alumnus of the , he became a professor of mathematics at Mende in 1877.

In 1878 Doumer married Blanche Richel, whom he had met at college. They had eight children, four of whom were killed in the First World War (including the French air ace René Doumer).

== Career ==
From 1879 until 1883 Doumer was professor at Remiremont, before leaving on health grounds. He then became chief editor of &quot;Courrier de l&#x27;Aisne&quot;, a French regional newspaper. Initiated into Freemasonry in 1879, at &quot;L&#x27;Union Fraternelle&quot; lodge, he became Grand Secretary of Grand Orient de France in 1892.
He made his debut in politics in 1885 as &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; to Charles Floquet, then president of the Chamber of Deputies (a post equivalent to the speaker of the House of Commons). In 1888, Doumer was elected Radical deputy for the department of Aisne. Defeated in the general elections of September 1889, he was elected again in 1890 by the arrondissement of Auxerre. He was briefly Minister of Finance of France (1895–1896) when he tried without success to introduce an income tax.

Doumer was Governor-General of French Indochina from 1897 to 1902. Upon his arrival the colonies were losing millions of francs annually. Determined to put them on a paying basis, he levied taxes on opium, wine and the salt trade. The Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians who could not or would not pay these taxes, lost their houses and land, and often became day laborers. He established Indochina as a market for French products and a source of profitable investment by French businessmen. Doumer set about outfitting Indochina, especially Hanoi, the capital, with modern infrastructure befitting property of France. Tree-lined avenues and a large number of French colonial buildings were constructed in Hanoi during his governance. The Long Bien Bridge and the Grand Palais in Hanoi were among large-scale projects built during his term; the bridge was originally named after him. The palace was destroyed by airstrikes toward the end of World War II. The bridge survived, and became a well-known landmark and target for US pilots during the Vietnam War.

With a view to annexing south Yunnan to French Indochina, Doumer successfully lobbied the French government to approve construction of the Indochina-Yunnan railway in 1898.

After returning to France, Doumer was elected by Laon to the Chamber of Deputies as a Radical. He refused to support the ministry of Émile Combes, and formed a Radical dissident group, which grew in strength and eventually caused the fall of the ministry. He then served as President of the Chamber from 1902 to 1905.

Doumer became Minister of Finance of France again in 1925 when Louis Loucheur resigned. He then served as President of the French Senate from 1927 until the 1931 presidential election. He was elected President of the French Republic on 13 May 1931, defeating the better known Aristide Briand, and replacing Gaston Doumergue.

==Death==
On 6 May 1932, Paul Doumer was in Paris at the opening of a book fair at the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild, talking to author Claude Farrère. Suddenly several shots were fired by Paul Gorguloff, a Russian émigré. Two of the shots hit Doumer, at the base of the skull and in the right armpit, and he fell to the ground. Claude Farrère wrestled with the assassin before the police arrived. Doumer was rushed to the hospital in Paris, where he died at 04:37 on 7 May. He is the only French president to die of a gunshot wound (although president Sadi Carnot had been assassinated by being stabbed 38 years before).

===Trial===
Gorguloff was indicted for murder and executed by the guillotine four months later, after a swift trial.

==Aftermath==
André Maurois was an eyewitness to the assassination, having come to the book fair to autograph copies of his book. He later described the scene in his autobiography, &quot;Call No Man Happy&quot;. As Maurois notes, because the President was assassinated at a meeting of writers, it was decided that writers - Maurois among them - should stand guard over the body while he lay in state at the Élysée.

==Writings==
As an author he is known by his &quot;L&#x27;Indo-Chine française&quot; (1904), and &quot;Le Livre de mes fils&quot; (1906).

<doc id="154781" wikidata="Q23063" url="?curid=154781" title="Disley">
<text>Disley is a village and civil parish in Cheshire, England. It is located on the edge of the Peak District in the Goyt Valley, south of Stockport and close to the county boundary with Derbyshire at New Mills. The population at the 2011 Census was 4,294. To the north, the River Goyt and the Peak Forest Canal, which opened in 1800, pass along the edge of the village. Today, it is a commuter town, retaining a semi-rural character.

The parish includes part of the neighbouring area of Newtown, the bulk of which is in Derbyshire.

==History==
Its Anglo-Saxon name was &quot;Dystiglegh&quot;, meaning &quot;wood or clearing by a mound&quot; or possibly &quot;windy settlement&quot;. In the 13th century, in the time of Edward I, there are references to confirmatory grants of land made to Jordan de Dystelegh of Disley Hall and Roger de Stanley-de-Dystelegh of Stanley Hall in the district, pointing to even older local settlements. It later had the name &quot;Dystelegh&quot;.

Disley was the home of several farmsteads, including one at Stanley, where the golf club is now located. The barn, erected sometime around the 15th or 16th-century, still stands.

Sir Piers Legh of Lyme founded St Mary the Virgin Church, completed in 1524 and consecrated as parish church in 1558. The earliest parish register is from 1591.

In 1724, the road from Manchester to Buxton became a turnpike road and in the early 1800s the road was rerouted from its original route along Jackson&#x27;s Edge road to the current line of the A6.

At the time of the first census, Disley had a population of 995 residents. By 1881, this had increased to 3,312 and, as of 2019, the population is now in the region of 4,600.

The fountain in Fountain Square was donated by the Orfords in 1837 to provide the village with clean water, the stone coming from the Jacksons Edge Quarry. It was used until the 1920s.

The village had at least one cotton mill by the mid-19th century. As the cotton industry declined, more varied employment became the norm. As of 2005, there is a paper mill and some light engineering works, but most people travel out to work.

==Governance==

The parish of Disley was included in the 19th-century as one of three parishes in Hayfield rural sanitary district, alongside Hayfield and Mellor in Derbyshire. In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, rural sanitary districts became rural districts, but were required to be entirely within one county or another – this led to Disley, the only Cheshire parish of the sanitary district, to form the Disley Rural District on its own – one of only a few single-parish rural districts to exist. This remained in existence until 1974, when it was merged into the new Borough of Macclesfield, whilst retaining a parish council.

In April 2008, a referendum was announced for Disley residents because the Borough of Macclesfield was to become part of the new Cheshire East unitary authority, as a result of major local government changes in Cheshire in April 2009. Some residents believed that the village would be better served if it were part of the neighbouring boroughs of Stockport in Greater Manchester or High Peak in Derbyshire. On 8 May 2008, this referendum was held, with an overwhelming result in favour of staying within Cheshire; less than a third of electors wished to become part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport and an even lower proportion of the population wished the village to become part of High Peak Borough. Macclesfield Borough Council was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the new unitary authority of Cheshire East.

==People==
===Past===
Nearby Wyberslegh Hall (sometimes spelled Wybersley Hall), which stands between Disley and High Lane, was the birthplace of the Anglo-American novelist Christopher Isherwood.

The historian A. J. P. Taylor lived in Higher Disley in the 1930s, whilst he was a lecturer at the University of Manchester.

The playwright, critic, essayist and novelist Allan Monkhouse lived at the Grey Cottage on Jackson&#x27;s Edge Road from 1893 to 1902, and then at Meadow Bank on the same road until his death in 1936.

Lord John Hunt, who led the first successful Mount Everest expedition in 1953, also lived in Disley.

The director and writer Ian Clark was brought up in Disley and attended Disley Primary School.

===Present===
Disley is also the home of:
* Presenter of the BBC &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; TV programme David Dickinson, who had his first antique shop there.
* 2008 Paralympic Games cycling gold medal-winning couple Sarah and Barney Storey.
* 2008 Olympic Games cycling gold medal winner Jamie Staff, who moved to Disley for access to Manchester Velodrome.

==Transport==
Disley railway station is a stop on the Manchester to Buxton line. There is generally an hourly service in each direction between and , via ; services reduce to every two hours on Sundays.

High Peak Buses operates bus route 199, which provides a regular service between Buxton, New Mills, Stockport and Manchester Airport.

The A6, which connects Carlisle in Cumbria with Luton in Bedfordshire, passes through Disley; it connects the village with Stockport to the north-west and the Peak District to the south-east.

==Places of interest==
The Rams Head Inn, in the centre of the village, was built by the Legh family in c.1640, though the current exterior was built around 1840. It was formerly a lodge belonging to the Lyme Park estate. It became a main coaching stop on the Manchester to London route. In 1790, after three visits, Viscount Torrington voted it the best inn in England. The Rams Head is now a restaurant and pub; only part of what once was its extensive stabling block still remains. The pub and its adjoining former stables are Grade II listed buildings.

Lyme Park is in the civil parish of Lyme Handley, rather than in the Disley parish, but it is sufficiently close to be associated with the village. It is owned and managed by the National Trust. The hall was used by the BBC as a setting in its 1995 adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

The Bowstones are two upright crosses on moorland above Lyme Park on the route of the Gritstone Trail. Their origins are unknown but they are believed to be religious. From here it is possible to see seven counties: Derbyshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire and Clwyd.

The village is home to Disley Cricket Club, a member of the TACS Cheshire Cricket League, playing their home games at Disley Amalgamated Sports Club (DASC). The 1st XI play in Division 1, having won the Division 2 championship in 2014 and Division 3 in 2013.

Moorside Golf Club, in Higher Disley, first appeared in the 1930s; it continued to operate until the late 1950s. Disley Golf Club, still in operation to the north of the village, opened in 1889 and is &quot;one of the oldest inland courses in the UK&quot;.

Stanley Hall Farmhouse is a Grade-II-listed building from the 16th-century. Stanley Hall was given to the Stanleys by the Black Prince in 1388 and bought by the Leghs in 1488. Part of the barn, also Grade II listed, was used as the first clubhouse of the Disley golf club.

==Education==
Disley has a primary school, Disley Primary School, which in 2020 became an academy as part of The TRUE Learning Partnership, and two nurseries, Blue Grass Purple Cow and Disley Under Fives.

<text>Lyme Park is a large estate south of Disley, Cheshire, England, managed by the National Trust and consisting of a mansion house surrounded by formal gardens and a deer park in the Peak District National Park. The house is the largest in Cheshire, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

The estate was granted to Sir Thomas d&#x27;Anyers in 1346 and passed to the Leghs of Lyme by marriage in 1388. It remained in the possession of the Legh family until 1946 when it was given to the National Trust. The house dates from the latter part of the 16th century. Modifications were made to it in the 1720s by Giacomo Leoni, who retained some of the Elizabethan features and added others, particularly the courtyard and the south range. It is difficult to classify Leoni&#x27;s work at Lyme, as it contains elements of both Palladian and Baroque styles. Further modifications were made by Lewis Wyatt in the 19th century, especially to the interior. Formal gardens were created and developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The house, gardens and park have been used as locations for filming and they are open to the public. The Lyme Caxton Missal, an early printed book by William Caxton, is on display in the Library.

== History ==
The land now occupied by Lyme Park was granted to Piers Legh and his wife Margaret d&#x27;Anyers, by letters patent dated 4 January 1398, by Richard II, son of Edward, the Black Prince. Margaret d&#x27;Anyers&#x27; father, Sir Thomas d&#x27;Anyers, had taken part in retrieving the standard of the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy in 1346, and was rewarded with annuity of 40 marks a year by the Black Prince, drawn on his Cheshire estate, and which could be exchanged for land of that value belonging to the Black Prince. Sir Thomas died in 1354, and the annuity passed to his daughter Margaret, who in 1388 married the first Piers Legh (Piers Legh I). Richard II favoured Piers and granted his family a coat of arms in 1397, and the estate of Lyme Handley in 1398 redeeming the annuity. However, Piers was executed two years later by Richard&#x27;s rival for the throne, Henry Bolingbroke.

When in 1415 Sir Piers Legh II was wounded in the Battle of Agincourt, his mastiff stood over and protected him for many hours through the battle. The mastiff was later returned to Legh&#x27;s home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. They were bred at the hall and kept separate from other strains, figuring prominently in founding the modern breed. The strain died out around the beginning of the 20th century.

The first record of a house on the site is in a manuscript folio dated 1465, but that house was demolished when construction of the present building began during the life of Piers Legh VII, in the middle of the 16th century. This house, by an unknown designer, was L-shaped in plan with east and north ranges; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17th century. In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni, an architect from Venice, added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan, and made other changes. While he retained some of its Elizabethan features, many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles. During the latter part of the 18th century Piers Legh XIII bought most of the furniture which is in the house today. However, the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate. In the early 19th century the estate was owned by Thomas Legh, who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822. Wyatt&#x27;s alterations were mainly to the interior, where he remodelled every room. Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised. Instead, Wyatt added a tower-like structure (a hamper) to provide bedrooms for the servants. He also added a one-storey block to the east range, containing a dining-room. Later in the century William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, added stables and other buildings to the estate, and created the Dutch Garden. Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20th century. During the Second World War, the park was used as a Royal Air Force lorry depot. In 1946 Richard Legh, 3rd Baron Newton, gave Lyme Park to the National Trust. From 1947 the estate was managed by Stockport Corporation and its successor Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council until 1994 when the National Trust took direct control.

== House ==

===Exterior===

The house is the largest in Cheshire, measuring overall by round a courtyard plan. The older part is built in coursed, squared buff sandstone rubble with sandstone dressings; the later work is in ashlar sandstone. The whole house has a roof of Welsh slates. The symmetrical north face is of 15 bays in three storeys; its central bay consists of a slightly protruding gateway. The arched doorway in this bay has Doric columns with a niche on each side. Above the doorway are three more Doric columns with a pediment, and above this are three further columns. Over all this are four further columns with an open pediment bearing an image of Minerva. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner referred to this gateway as &quot;the craziest Elizabethan frontispiece&quot;. The endmost three bays on each side project slightly forwards. The ground floors of the three outer bays on each side are rusticated, and their upper storeys are divided by large Composite pilasters. The west front is also in three storeys, with nine bays, the outer two bays on each side projecting forward. The ground floor is rusticated and the upper floors are smooth.

The symmetrical 15-bay three-storey south front overlooking the lake is the work of Leoni. Although Leoni had been influenced by the works and principles of Andrea Palladio, both Pevsner and the authors of the citation in the &quot;National Heritage List for England&quot; agree that the design of this front is more Baroque than Palladian. The bottom storey is rusticated with arched windows, and the other storeys are smooth with rectangular windows. The middle three bays consist of a portico of which the lowest storey has three arches. Above this arise four giant fluted Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment. Standing on the pediment are three lead statues, of Neptune, Venus and Pan. The pediment partly hides Wyatt&#x27;s blind balustraded ashlar attic block. The other bays are separated by plain Ionic pilasters and the end three bays on each side protrude slightly. The nine-bay three-storey east front is mostly Elizabethan in style and has Wyatt&#x27;s single-storey extension protruding from its centre. The courtyard was remodelled by Leoni, who gave it a rusticated cloister on all sides. Above the cloister the architecture differs on the four sides although all the windows on the first (piano nobile) floor have pediments. On the west side is a one-bay centrepiece with a window between two Doric pilasters; on the south and north are three windows with four similar pilasters; and on the east front is the grand entrance with a portal in a Tuscan aedicule. This entrance is between the first and second storeys and is approached by symmetrical pairs of stairs with iron balusters, which were made in 1734 by John Gardom of Baslow, Derbyshire. In the centre of the courtyard is an Italian Renaissance well-head, surrounded by chequered pink and white stone, simulating marble.

===Interior===

The Entrance Hall, which is in the east range, was remodelled by Leoni. It is asymmetrical and contains giant pilasters and a screen of three fluted Ionic columns. The doorway to the courtyard has an open pediment. A hinged picture can be swung out from the wall to reveal a squint looking into the Entrance Hall. Also in the Entrance Hall are tapestries which were woven at the Mortlake Tapestry Works between 1623 and 1636. They were originally in the Leghs&#x27; London home in Belgrave Square and were moved to Lyme in 1903. In order to accommodate them, the interior decorator, Amadée Joubert, had to make alterations, including the removal of a tabernacle and cutting out four of the pilasters. To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Library, and to the east is Wyatt&#x27;s Dining Room, which has a stucco ceiling and a carved overmantel both in a late 17th-century style, as well as a frieze. The decoration of this room is considered to be a rare early example of the Wrenaissance style.

To the north of the Entrance Hall are the two principal Elizabethan rooms, the Drawing Room and the Stag Parlour. The Drawing Room is panelled with intersecting arches above which is a marquetry frieze. The ceiling has studded bands, strapwork cartouches and a broad frieze. Over the fireplace is a large stone overmantel, which is decorated with pairs of atlantes and caryatids framing the arms of Elizabeth I. The stained glass in this room includes medieval glass that was moved from the original Lyme Hall to Disley Church and returned to Lyme in 1835. The Stag Parlour has a chimneypiece depicting an Elizabethan house and hunting scenes, and it includes the arms of James I. The other Elizabethan rooms in the house are the Stone Parlour on the ground floor, and the Long Gallery, which is on the top floor of the east range. The Long Gallery also has a chimneypiece with the arms of Elizabeth I. The Grand Staircase dates from the remodelling by Leoni and it has a Baroque ceiling. The Saloon is on the first floor of the south range, behind the portico. Its ceiling is decorated in rococo style, and the room contains wooden carvings that have been attributed to Grinling Gibbons. The Chapel, in the northeast corner of the ground floor, also contains detailed carvings.
===Lyme Caxton Missal===
This missal (a liturgical book) had been owned by the Legh family since at least 1508. It is the only known nearly complete copy of the earliest edition of a missal according to the Sarum Rite still in existence. When the family moved from the house in 1946, the missal went with them, and was held for safe-keeping in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it, and it was decided to return it to Lyme Park. To celebrate this the décor of the library was restored to the way it had been during the 19th century. This included re-graining of its ceiling, reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains, and re-papering the room with replica wallpaper, based on its original design.

== Grounds ==
The house is surrounded by formal gardens of in a deer park of about which are listed at Grade II* in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In the gardens and deer park are a number of structures.

===Gardens===

To the west of the house is the former mill pond. From the south side a lawn slopes down to another pond beyond which is a small ravine with a stone bridge, this area being known as &quot;Killtime&quot;. To the west of the lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden, which was created by William Legh. It consists of formal flower beds with a central fountain. To the west, south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens, including rose gardens.

===Deer park===

The park was enclosed in the 14th century by Piers Legh I. In the 17th century Richard Legh planted avenues of sycamore and lime trees. Richard&#x27;s son, Peter Legh XII carried out more extensive tree-planting in the park, giving it its current appearance. Red deer descended from the original deer present when the park was enclosed graze in the grounds, as do Highland cattle. Formerly an unusual breed of wild white cattle with red ears grazed in the park but they became extinct in 1884. 
Sheep also graze in the park. The Gritstone Trail and the Peak District Boundary Walk long-distance footpaths both cross the park.

===Structures===


The most obvious structure in the park, other than the house, is a tower called the Cage which stands on a hill to the east of the approach road to the house (). It was originally a hunting lodge and was later used as a park-keeper&#x27;s cottage and as a lock-up for prisoners. The first structure on the site was built about 1580; this was taken down and rebuilt in 1737, possibly to a design by Leoni for Peter Legh X. The tower is built in buff sandstone rubble with ashlar sandstone dressings. It is square in plan, in three storeys, with attached small square towers surmounted by cupolas at the corners. The Cage is a Grade II* listed building. Also in the park is the Paddock Cottage which was erected by Peter Legh IX and restored in the early 21st century. To the east of this are the remains of the Stag House (). To the left of the house in Lantern Wood is a belvedere known as the Lantern (). It is built in sandstone and has three storeys and a spire; the lowest storey is square in plan while the other storeys and the spire are octagonal. The top storey and spire date from about 1580 and originally formed a bellcote on the north gatehouse. This was removed during the restoration of the house by Wyatt and rebuilt on the present site. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Immediately to the northeast of the house is the Orangery which was designed in 1862 by Alfred Darbyshire. The Orangery is joined to the house by a covered passage known as the Dark Passage. This was designed by Wyatt for Sir Thomas Legh in 1815 and is a Grade II listed building. Further from the house, to the northeast of the orangery, are the stables (). These are dated 1863 and were also designed by Darbyshire. They are built in sandstone on a courtyard plan and are listed at Grade II. Other structures in the grounds listed at Grade II are the Pheasant House dating from about 1870, an Italian white marble wellhead in the centre of the courtyard of the house dating from the 18th century and probably brought to the house from Venice in about 1900, sandstone kennels in an H-plan dating from around 1870, a pair of gardener&#x27;s cottages dated 1871, terrace revetment walls to the west of the house containing some 17th-century masonry with later repairs, the lodge, gate piers and gates on Lyme Park Drive, the forward gatepiers to Lyme Park Drive, dating from the late 17th century and moved to their present position about 1860, the gate piers in Red Lane, and the gate piers, gates and railings to the north of the north front of the house.
==Preservation ==

Lyme Park is owned and administered by the National Trust. The house, garden and park are open to the public at advertised hours. An entrance fee to the house, garden and park is payable by non-members of the National Trust. In the grounds are shops, a refreshment kiosk, a coffee shop and a restaurant. The Lyme Caxton Missal is on display in the saloon. Events are held in the park. The Bowmen of Lyme use the park for archery.

In August 2019, the park was hit by severe flooding and was evacuated. Though staff attempted to rescue antiques and collectables, a large section of the garden was washed away.

== Film location ==
Lyme Park and its hall have been used in several films and television programmes. The exterior of the hall was used as Pemberley, the seat of Mr Darcy, in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and as a location for the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Timeslides&quot;. It was also used as a location in the 2011 film &quot;The Awakening&quot; and in the second series of &quot;The Village&quot; in 2014.

<doc id="154787" wikidata="Q769166" url="?curid=154787" title="Farndon, Cheshire">
<text>Farndon is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It is on the banks of the River Dee, south of Chester, which here forms the England–Wales border. The Welsh village of Holt lies just over the River Dee from Farndon. 

In the 2001 census, the village had a population of 1,517, increasing to 1,653 by the 2011 census.

==Toponymy==
The village&#x27;s English name was first recorded in Old English in 924 AD. It has been recorded as &quot;Fearndune&quot;, &quot;Farndune&quot;, &quot;Pharndoon&quot;, &quot;Ferentone&quot;, &quot;Ferendon&quot;, &quot;Faryngdon&quot; and &quot;Ferneton&quot;. The name means &quot;Fern Hill&quot;.

As Farndon is adjacent to the England–Wales border (Farndon Bridge across the River Dee separates the village from Holt, Wrexham), it is also known as &quot;Rhedynfre&quot; in Welsh. Its dual name reflects the area&#x27;s historical importance as a place of conflict and cultural exchange since the Angles settled the area in the 8th century. As the political border moved back and forth during the following centuries, Farndon has been either part of Wales or England several times.

==History==
The area was inhabited during the Roman occupation of Britain. Archaeological assessments in the village have concluded there was a Roman villa in the area or even a small military outpost.

Edward the Elder, King of the Anglo-Saxons, died in the ancient parish of Farndon in 924, shortly after quelling a revolt of an alliance of Mercians and Welshmen. This involved Edward successfully taking Chester from the occupying Mercians and Welshmen, and then re-garrisoning it, and this happened shortly before his death. Up to the 14th century, Farndon also included the chapelry of Holt in Denbighshire, Wales.

Referenced in the Domesday Book as &quot;Ferentone&quot;, the settlement consisted of 34 households. Ownership was divided between the Bishop of Chester (Robert de Limesey) and Bigot de Loges (from Les Loges in France). 

Some historians believe that Farndon was the location of the first ever competitive horse race with riders, in a local field on the banks of the River Dee. Nearby Chester Racecourse is said to be the oldest racecourse in Britain.

During the English Civil War, Farndon was the scene of bitter fighting over the Bridge that was controlling access to Chester from Wales. There is a fine memorial window in the parish church to the Civil War Royalists.

The village was at one time renowned for its strawberries, which were grown in the surrounding fields. This is no longer the case. The nearest fields are now in Holt.

==Governance==
There is an electoral ward that has the same name. This ward stretches from Saighton in the north to Church Shocklach in the south. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,011. 

==Landmarks==


Farndon Bridge spans the Dee connecting Farndon to the nearby Welsh village of Holt on higher ground. The bridge, made of sandstone and originally of medieval construction, is said to be haunted. Holt Castle is located on the opposite side of the river; it was constructed in the 13th and 14th centuries. The castle fell to the forces of Oliver Cromwell in 1647.

Next to Farndon Bridge is a small picnic area beside the river. At the entrance to the picnic area are Farndon Cliffs. This area has been classed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The sandstone cliffs contain interesting rock formations.

St Chad&#x27;s is the old parish church in Farndon. It is thought that some portions of the church date back to Sir Patrick de Bartun, a knight of King Edward III, whose effigy lies in the nave. The Church was damaged during the English Civil War and later repaired. The church contains a unique Civil War memorial window, and features an image thought to be that of William Lawes, the famous court musician, who was slain at the battle of Rowton Heath. The church tower still shows signs of Civil War musket ball damage. The churchyard contains war graves of two British soldiers of World War I, Sergeant Joseph Easter and Private Thomas Harrison.

The village used to have four public houses: the Hare (formerly the Greyhound), the Nags Head, the Masons Arms and the Farndon Arms (formerly the Raven). Two of these, the Farndon Arms and the Nags Head, closed in the summer of 2007, though the Farndon Arms has since reopened as The Farndon; the Nags Head was demolished to make way for a small retail development. The Masons Arms closed in 1928 and has been a private residence since that time.

A restaurant called The Brasserie closed late 2008. Since that time, the premises have reopened under the name of Little Churtons.

The village also has a Methodist Chapel at nearby Crewe by Farndon, a short walk from the village. Crewe was a civil parish in its own right until it was merged into Farndon in 2015.

==Notable residents==
* Major Roger Barnston (1826–1857), served in the Crimean War and was killed in the Indian rebellion of 1857.
* Paul Burrell, former butler to Diana, Princess of Wales, maintained a home in the village and had a shop bearing his name, which he has since sold. It is now an antique shop called Botany House.
* Bob Mills, comedian and host of &quot;In Bed With Medinner&quot; and &quot;Win Lose or Draw&quot;, spent his childhood in the village and attended the old site Primary School.
* John Speed (1542–1629), cartographer, was born in Farndon.

<text>Quo Vadis (Latin for &quot;Where are you going?&quot;) is a 1951 American religious epic film set in ancient Rome during the final years of Emperor Nero&#x27;s reign, based on the 1896 novel of the same title by Polish Nobel Laureate author Henryk Sienkiewicz. Produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and filmed in Technicolor, it was directed by Mervyn LeRoy from a screenplay by S. N. Behrman, Sonya Levien, and John Lee Mahin. It is the fourth screen adaptation of Sienkiewicz&#x27;s novel. The film stars Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Leo Genn, and Peter Ustinov, and features Patricia Laffan, Finlay Currie, Abraham Sofaer, Marina Berti, Buddy Baer, and Felix Aylmer. Future Italian stars Sophia Loren and Bud Spencer appeared as uncredited extras. The score is by Miklós Rózsa and the cinematography by Robert Surtees and William V. Skall. The film was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on 2 November 1951.

The story, set between 64 and 68 AD, combines both historical and fictional events and characters, and compresses the key events of that period into the space of only a few weeks. Its main theme is the Roman Empire’s conflict with Christianity and persecution of Christians in the final years of the Julio-Claudian line. Unlike his illustrious and powerful predecessor, Emperor Claudius, Nero proved corrupt and destructive, and his actions eventually threatened to destroy Rome&#x27;s previously peaceful social order. The title refers to an incident in the apocryphal Acts of Peter.

The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and it was such a huge box office success that it was credited with single-handedly rescuing MGM from the brink of bankruptcy. Peter Ustinov won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, and Robert Surtees and William V. Skall won the award for Best Cinematography.

==Plot==

Marcus Vinicius is a Roman military commander and the legate of the XIV Gemina. Returning from wars in Britain and Gaul, he stays in the house of Aulus Plautius, a retired Roman general, and becomes smitten with Lygia, a Lygian hostage of Rome in the old general&#x27;s care. Unbeknownst to Marcus, Lygia, Aulus, and his household are devout Christians, who host Paul the Apostle that very night. Petronius, Marcus&#x27; uncle, persuades Nero to give the girl to his nephew as a reward for his services. Lygia resents this arrangement, but eventually falls in love with Marcus.

Meanwhile, Nero&#x27;s atrocities become increasingly outrageous and his behavior more irrational. After Nero burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus sets out to rescue Lygia and her family. Nero arrests them, along with all the other Christians, and condemns them to be slaughtered in his Circus; some are killed by lions. Petronius, Nero&#x27;s most trusted advisor, warns him that the Christians will be celebrated as martyrs, but he cannot change the emperor&#x27;s mind. Then, tired of Nero&#x27;s insanity and suspecting that he may be about to turn on him, too, Petronius composes a letter to Nero expressing his derision for the emperor (which he previously had concealed to avoid being murdered by him) and commits suicide by severing an artery in his wrist. His slavegirl Eunice (who has fallen in love with him) elects to die with him, despite being freed. The Christian apostle Peter has also been arrested after returning to Rome in response to a sign from the Lord, and he marries Marcus and Lygia in the Circus prisons. Peter is later crucified upside-down, a form of execution conceived by Nero&#x27;s Praetorian Guard as an expression of mockery.

Poppaea, Nero&#x27;s wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a stake in the Circus and a wild bull is released into the arena. Lygia&#x27;s bodyguard Ursus must attempt to kill the bull with his bare hands to save Lygia from being gored to death. Marcus is taken to the emperor&#x27;s box and forced to watch. This act outrages his loyal officers who are among the spectators. Ursus is able to topple the bull, though, and break its neck. At that moment Marcus manages to break free from his bonds and leaps into the arena to get to Lygia. Massively impressed by Ursus&#x27;s victory and seeing that Lygia is the beloved of Marcus who is still regarded as a great war hero, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare the couple. He refuses to do so, even after four of his courtiers, Seneca, architect Phaon, poet Lucan, and musician Terpnos add their endorsement of the mob&#x27;s demands. The decision enrages the crowd and Marcus&#x27;s loyal troop members rush to the arena to save the three. Marcus accuses Nero of burning Rome and announces that General Galba is at that moment marching on the city, intent on replacing Nero, and hails him as new Emperor of Rome.

The crowd revolts, now firmly believing that Nero, not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea, blaming her for inciting him to scapegoat the Christians. Then Acte, Nero&#x27;s discarded mistress who is still in love with him, appears and offers him a dagger to end his own life before the mob storming the palace kills him. Nero cannot do it, so Acte helps him to push the dagger into his chest, and he dies.

Marcus, Lygia, and Ursus are now free, and they leave Rome for Marcus&#x27; estate in Sicily to begin a new life together. By the roadside, Peter&#x27;s crook, which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has sprouted blossoms. A radiant light appears and a chorus intones, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life,&quot; words spoken by Jesus (John 14:6, New Testament).

==Cast==
The film features many uncredited supporting parts and cameos: including Elizabeth Taylor as a Christian prisoner in arena, Sophia Loren as a Lygian slave, Christopher Lee as a chariot driver, Clelia Matania as Parmenida the hairdresser, Marika Aba as the Assyrian Dancer at Nero&#x27;s banquet, Richard Garrick as a slave with Marcus at Triumph, Giuseppe Tosi as a wrestler at Nero&#x27;s banquet, Adrienne Corri as an imprisoned Christian woman, Bud Spencer as an Imperial Guard, and Robin Hughes as Jesus in a flashback tableau. The narration was provided by an uncredited Walter Pidgeon.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
In the late 1930s, MGM bought the talking-picture rights to the 1896 novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; from author Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s heirs. (At the same time they had to buy the 1924 silent-screen version.) The company originally intended to make the film in Italy, but the outbreak of WWII caused it to be postponed. After the war, production was restarted. A lease was obtained on the huge Cinecitta Studios, eight miles outside Rome, with its 148 acres and nine soundstages.

After months of preparation, the art director, costume designer, and set decorator arrived in Rome in 1948. Construction of the outdoor sets began at once: the huge Circus of Nero and exterior of Nero&#x27;s palace, a whole section of Ancient Rome, a great bridge, and the Plautius villa. The manufacture of thousands of costumes for extras began, along with drapes and carpets, metal and glass goblets, and 10 chariots. Official permission was granted to refurbish a section of the Appian Way. One of Hollywood&#x27;s foremost animal experts began to procure lions, horses, bulls, and other animals from around Europe. Well in advance of filming, the producer, director, chief cinematographer, and casting director arrived in Rome. The film finally went into production on Monday, 22 May 1950.

===Casting===



The film was originally cast in 1949 with Elizabeth Taylor as Lygia and Gregory Peck as Marcus Vinicius. When the production changed hands the following year, the roles went to Deborah Kerr and Robert Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor had an uncredited cameo role as a Christian in the Circus prisons.

Although most of the cast was British and a few Italian (Marina Berti, Alfredo Varelli, Roberto Ottaviano), Robert Taylor was certainly not the only American. Others included Buddy Baer (Ursus), Peter Miles (Nazarius), Arthur Walge (Croton), and William Tubbs (Anaxander). Also, several were among the uncredited cast; perhaps the most notable of these was 70-year-old Irish-American character actor Richard Garrick as the public slave who stands behind Marcus in his Triumph chariot, holding a victory laurel above his head, and repeating &quot;Remember thou art only a man.&quot; Ustinov recalled how he was cast as Nero in 1949:
&quot;An exciting proposition came my way when I was 28 years old. MGM were going to remake &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, and I was a candidate for the role of Nero. Arthur Hornblow [Jr] was to be the producer, and I was tested by [the director] John Huston. I threw everything I knew into this test, and to my surprise, John Huston did little to restrain me, encouraging me in confidential whispers to be even madder. Apparently the test was a success, but then the huge machine came to a halt, and the project was postponed for a year. At the end of the year, the producer was Sam Zimbalist and the director Mervyn LeRoy. They also approved my test, but warned me in a wire that I might be found to be a little young for the part. I cabled back that if they postponed again, I might be too old, since Nero died at 31. A second cable from them read &#x27;Historical Research Has Proved You Correct Stop The Part Is Yours&#x27;.

Clark Gable turned down the role of Marcus Vinicius very early in the film&#x27;s production history because he thought he would look ridiculous in Roman costumes.

Sophia Loren appeared in the film as an extra. Italian star Bud Spencer (real name: Carlo Pedersoli) also had an uncredited extra role as a Praetorian guardsman inside Nero&#x27;s summer palace at Antium. (He answers Nero, but his voice may be dubbed.)

Audrey Hepburn, still widely unknown when the film was released, was considered for the part of Lygia. Director Mervyn LeRoy wanted to cast her, but the role went to established MGM contract star Deborah Kerr. Wardrobe stills of her in costume for the film still exist.

Patricia Laffan was selected by the producer and director for the major role of Poppaea after they watched a screen test she made for a smaller part in the film.

Ustinov relates in his autobiography &quot;Dear Me&quot; that director Mervyn LeRoy summarized the manner in which he envisioned Ustinov should play the Emperor Nero, very salaciously, as

Nero ... The way I see him ... He&#x27;s a guy plays with himself nights... At the time I thought it a preposterous assessment, but a little later I was not so sure. It was a profundity at its most workaday level, and it led me to the eventual conviction that no nation can make Roman pictures as well as the Americans ... The inevitable vulgarities of the script contributed as much to its authenticity as its rare felicities. I felt then as I feel today, in spite of the carping of critical voices, that &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, good or bad according to taste, was an extraordinarily authentic film, and the nonsense Nero was sometimes made to speak was very much like the nonsense Nero probably did speak.

===Filming===
Produced for $7 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the time. It became MGM&#x27;s largest grosser since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Filmed at the sprawling Cinecitta Studios that had been opened by Benito Mussolini in 1937 as part of the dictator&#x27;s master plan to make Rome the pre-eminent world capital. (Mussolini&#x27;s son Vittorio Mussolini and Hollywood producer Hal Roach negotiated to form the R.A.M. [&quot;Roach and Mussolini&quot;] Corporation later in 1937, which was ultimately aborted. This business alliance with the Fascist state horrified 1930s Hollywood moguls and ultimately led to Roach defecting from his MGM distribution deal to United Artists in 1938.)&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/167559&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming in postwar Italy offered American studios immense facilities and cheap Italian labor and extras, of which thousands were required. Hollywood returned to Cinecitta often, producing many of its biggest spectacles there, including &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1956), &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), with the latter two dwarfing &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in scale. The studio would later be used by many Italian producers and directors, including Federico Fellini. The first use of the phrase &quot;Hollywood on the Tiber&quot;, which has come to refer to a golden era of American runaway film production in Italy, was as the title of a &quot;Time&quot; article in the issue dated 26 June 1950, published while &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; was being shot in Rome.

Composer Miklós Rózsa said that he wrote most of his score at the Culver City studios while the film was being shot in Italy:

[The] rushes were being sent back to Hollywood for cutting at the same time as they were being cut back in Rome ... I set to work so that at least something was ready, even if it had to be modified later. I worked with the chief supervising editor, Margaret Booth, whose technical knowledge is incomparable ... Finally, the Rome contingent arrived home with their version. It wasn&#x27;t so very different from the one that Margaret had put together, and there were no insuperable problems. Sam Zimbalist was amazed and delighted that I had all the music ready in three weeks, thanks to the work Margaret and I had already done.

Ten Italian locations were used in the film. With the exception of the Via Appia, most of these have not been identified, but the final stage of the chariot chase was filmed along the 2000-year-old &quot;Viale dei Cipressi&quot; (Avenue of Cypresses) near the village Bolgheri. This landmark in Livorno Province, Tuscany, is easily recognizable.

In the summer of 1950, when &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; was in production, Rome was in the grip of an intense heatwave, as Peter Ustinov recalled: &quot;Rome was in the throes of Holy Year, and bursting with pilgrims. It was also one of the hottest summers on record.&quot; The heat affected not only the cast and crew, but also the lions. Mervyn LeRoy recalled that because of the heat, the lions were reluctant to enter the arena.

Due to equipment shortages in Italy, MGM had to import a reported two hundred tons of generators, lights and other electrical equipment from Culver City.
The film holds the record for the most costumes used in one movie: 32,000.

At one point in the film, Nero shows his court a scale model illustrating his plans for the rebuilding of Rome as a new city to be called Neropolis. Studio publicity claimed that this was the model of Ancient Rome housed in the Museum of Roman Civilization and that it had been borrowed from the Italian government. (This was originally constructed by Mussolini&#x27;s government for a 1937 exhibition of Roman architecture.) However, the museum model is of fourth-century Rome, not of first-century Rome as it would have looked when rebuilt after the Great Fire of AD 64. The screen model looks nothing like the museum model. (It was almost certainly constructed especially for the film – perhaps by its special effects model-maker, Donald Jahraus.)

Anthony Mann worked on the film as an uncredited second-unit director. He spent 24 nights (four working weeks) on the Cinecitta backlot shooting scenes for the Burning of Rome sequence. However, he was not the co-director of the film, as some of his admirers have claimed. The soundstage scenes for the same sequence were directed by Mervyn LeRoy.

==Reception==
===Box-office performance===
The film was a major commercial success. It was number one at the US box office for 6 consecutive weeks and 11 weeks in total. According to MGM&#x27;s records, during its initial theatrical release, it earned $11,143,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $9,894,000 elsewhere, making it the highest-grossing film of 1951, and resulting in a profit to the studio of $5,440,000.

===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a mixed review, &quot;Here is a staggering combination of cinema brilliance and sheer banality, of visual excitement and verbal boredom, of historical pretentiousness and sex.&quot; Crowther thought that even Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; &quot;had nothing to match the horrendous and morbid spectacles of human brutality and destruction that Director Mervyn LeRoy has got in this. But within and around these visual triumph and rich imagistic displays is tediously twined a hackneyed romance that threatens to set your teeth on edge.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;right up there with &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; for box-office performance. It has size, scope, splash, and dash, giving for the first time in a long while credence to the now-clichéd &#x27;super-colossal&#x27; term. This is a super-spectacle in all its meaning.&quot; Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared it &quot;one of the most tremendous if not the greatest pictures ever made ... Its pictorial lavishness has never been equaled in any other production.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a fabulously entertaining movie. Though the expansive, expensive film from the celebrated novel runs over three hours on the Palace screen, you won&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ve been there nearly that long.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; declared, &quot;For sheer opulence, massiveness of sets, size of cast, and beauty of Technicolor photography, no picture ever produced matches &#x27;Quo Vadis&#x27;. It is a super-collosal [sic] spectacle in every sense of the meaning, and on that score alone it is worth a premium price of admission.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was negative, writing that the film &quot;demonstrates how inordinately boring the convention of size and spectacle can be, when divorced from taste, feeling, and, to a surprising extent, creative talent. The film is unimaginatively directed, at a very slow pace in keeping with the general larger than life proportions, and its technical qualities are not impressive.&quot;

The film holds a score of 83% on &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10.

===Awards and nominations===
==Music==
The music score by Miklós Rózsa is notable for its historical authenticity. Since no Ancient Roman music had survived, Rózsa incorporated a number of fragments of Ancient Greek and Jewish melodies such as the Seikilos epitaph, the &quot;Hymn to Nemesis&quot; and &quot;Hymn to the Sun&quot; by Mesomedes into his own choral-orchestral score.
* In 1950, before film production began, Rózsa made prerecordings of numerous fanfares, marches, songs and dances with the M-G-M Studio Orchestra in Culver City, and these survive. In 1951, he recorded the full score at M-G-M&#x27;s British studios with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but these recordings were reportedly lost later on in a fire at the Culver City studios. However, &#x27;dubdowns&#x27; of all of those recordings that were used in the film (about two-thirds with added sound effects) do survive. In 1951, MGM Records issued gramophone discs, in three different editions and speeds, of 12 tracks from the original soundtrack music (without sound effects). Consequently, much of the original recorded score is still available in various formats. In 2009, Film Score Monthly collected and issued these elements on two CDs.
* In 1963, MGM Records brought out a stereo compilation of excerpts from Rózsa&#x27;s film scores played by the Symphony Orchestra of Rome, conducted by Rózsa and Carlo Savina. Rózsa conducted the Triumphal March.
* In 1967, Rózsa conducted the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra in a stereo compilation of excerpts from his epic film scores. This included three selections from &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;.
* In 1977, Rózsa made a stereo recording of 12 selections from his score, once again conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
* In 2012, Nic Raine, conducting the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded the entire score (a total of 38 tracks on two CDs). This included several pieces of music that were originally recorded by Rózsa, but not used on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

At the end of the film, a triumphal march heralds the success of the armies of the new emperor, Galba. This theme would be reused by Rózsa in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) as the brief &quot;Bread and Circuses March&quot; preceding &quot;The Parade of the Charioteers&quot;, prior to the famous chariot race.

In his 1982 autobiography, Miklós Rózsa expressed his regret at the way his score was handled by producer Sam Zimbalist, &#x27;a dear personal friend&#x27;: &quot;[He] didn&#x27;t use the music in any way as effectively as he might have done. After all the trouble I went to, much of my work was swamped by sound effects, or played at such a low level as to be indistinguishable ... It was a great disappointment to me.&quot; However, he was mistaken when he wrote: &quot;&quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, because it was produced abroad, was completely boycotted by Hollywood and received no Academy nominations.&quot; Although it did not win any Academy Awards, it did, in fact, receive eight nominations – including one for Rózsa&#x27;s score.

Rózsa&#x27;s love theme for Lygia (&quot;Lygia&quot;) was set to words by Paul Francis Webster and Mario Lanza sang it for the first time on his radio show broadcast of January 1952.

==Home media==
* A two-disc special edition of the movie was released on DVD in the U.S. on 11 November 2008, after a long photochemical restoration process.
* A high-definition Blu-ray version was released 17 March 2009.

==Comic-book adaptation==
* &quot;Thriller Comics&quot; No 19, July 1952 (Amalgamated Press, London) Full-color photo-cover [image reversed] • 64 pages in black-and-white (Adapted by Joan Whitford • Drawn by Geoff Campion) [Remarkably faithful to the look of the film. However, apparently for reasons of space, both Marcus&#x27; friend Nerva and Petronius&#x27; slavegirl Eunice are excised.]

<doc id="154796" wikidata="Q3297878" url="?curid=154796" title="Masterpiece (TV series)">
<text>Masterpiece (formerly known as Masterpiece Theatre) is a drama anthology television series produced by WGBH Boston. It premiered on PBS on January 10, 1971. The series has presented numerous acclaimed British productions. Many of these are produced by the BBC, but the lineup has also included programs shown on the UK commercial channels ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5.

== Overview ==
&quot;Masterpiece&quot; is known for presenting adaptations of novels and biographies, but it also shows original television dramas. The first title to air was &quot;The First Churchills&quot;, starring Susan Hampshire as Sarah Churchill. Other programs presented on the series include &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII;&quot; &quot;Elizabeth R;&quot; &quot;I, Claudius;&quot; &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs;&quot; &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street;&quot; &quot;The Citadel;&quot; &quot;The Jewel in the Crown;&quot; &quot;Reckless;&quot; &quot;House of Cards;&quot; &quot;Traffik,&quot; and &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;. More recent popular titles include &quot;Prime Suspect,&quot; &quot;The Forsyte Saga,&quot; &quot;Sherlock,&quot; and &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.

The theme music played during the opening credits is the Fanfare-Rondeau from &quot;Suite of Symphonies for brass, strings and timpani No. 1&quot; by French composer Jean-Joseph Mouret. The theme was performed by Collegium Musicum de Paris. Roland Douatte was the conductor. It was recorded in 1954 by Vogue Records in Paris, France, and was later remastered in stereo and re-released by Nonesuch Records in the 1960s.

During the first seasons in the 1970s, the theme music accompanied varying closeup shots of a waving British flag, which panned out into a still image of a British flag on a staff serving as the P in &quot;Masterpiece&quot;. In the late 1970s, the opening video switched to views of antique books and other literary artifacts, many of which titles had been dramatized on the program.

In 1980, &quot;Masterpiece&quot; gained a sister series, &quot;Mystery!&quot;, featuring a mix of contemporary and classic British detective and crime series, such as &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple&quot;, and &quot;Touching Evil&quot;. In 2000, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the show, it presented &quot;Masterpiece&quot;: &quot;The American Collection&quot;, nine works by American writers, including Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;, starring Paul Newman.

== Awards and nominations ==
One of television&#x27;s most honored series, the various shows aired on &quot;Masterpiece&quot; have won numerous Emmy and Peabody Awards.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #3 in its list of the 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and #16 in its list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.

== History ==
The success of the broadcast of the 1967 version of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; on NET (the precursor of PBS) led Stanford Calderwood, then serving as president of WGBH, to investigate whether the BBC would sell programs to the station. Suggestions for the series format came from, among others, Frank Gillard in the UK and Christopher Sarson in the US. In looking for an underwriter for the series, Calderwood eventually met with Herb Schmertz of Mobil Corporation. Schmertz was able to gain funding for the show, and with Joan Wilson of WGBH-TV bought the US distribution rights for fifty hours of British dramas for about $1 million per year. He and several other men, including Frank Marshall, met in London and made a selection of programs to be broadcast.

Decisions on the format of the show were finalized and the series premiered on January 10, 1971, with the first episode of &quot;The First Churchills&quot;. The working title for the series had been &quot;The Best of the BBC&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; before the first broadcast, with Sarson insisting upon the British spelling for &quot;Theatre&quot;. The series was hosted by British-American broadcaster and author / journalist Alistair Cooke (1908–2004), who initially had been reluctant to take the role. Cooke appeared for two decades until 1992; native Baltimorean, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and longtime columnist for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Russell Baker (1925–2019), was next and hosted for over a decade from 1992 to 2004. From 2004 to 2008, it was broadcast without a host.

The original series producer was Sarson. He was succeeded in 1973 by Joan Wilson. The current series producer, Rebecca Eaton, took over in 1985 after Wilson&#x27;s death from cancer. Mobil pulled out in 2004. In 2011 Eaton launched the Masterpiece Trust as a fundraising initiative, in collaboration with WGBH Boston. The Trust gives donors the opportunity to support their local PBS station and also &quot;secure the future of superb British drama...invest upfront in the development of new scripts and programs, and grow the &quot;[Masterpiece]&quot; series both on-air and online&quot;. In the same year the series attracted new sponsors Viking River Cruises and Ralph Lauren (Ralph Lauren was subsequently replaced by Farmers Insurance). In the first three years the Trust raised $12 million from 45 donors.

The Masterpiece approach has been reported as being to put up about 10% of the production budget, in return for distribution rights and a degree of consultation on casting and content, but not editorial control. Masterpiece licences programs for several years, after which the broadcast rights revert to the original owners, generally the British producer or distributor. Interviewed in 2017, Eaton described her role at &quot;Masterpiece&quot; as &quot;the person who chooses which British programs will be included in Masterpiece...looking at a lot of shows that are already made, reading scripts, and choosing the ones that would suit this audience.&quot;

== Format change ==
In 2008, the word &quot;Theatre&quot; was dropped, and the show, officially known as &quot;Masterpiece&quot;, was split into three different sections. &quot;Masterpiece Classic&quot; was initially hosted by Gillian Anderson; the following year, Laura Linney took her place. &quot;Masterpiece Mystery!&quot; is hosted by Alan Cumming. &quot;Masterpiece Contemporary&quot; was hosted initially by Matthew Goode, who was replaced by David Tennant in 2009.

All three versions received their own opening sequences and theme music with a common signature based upon the First Suite in D by Mouret (originally chosen by Sarson, who had heard it played at a Club Med resort in Sicily, because it sounded &quot;British and heraldic&quot;). In the opening to the &quot;Classic&quot; strand of shows, the word &quot;Theatre&quot; appears for a brief moment, apparently in order to maintain WGBH&#x27;s trademark registration on the former name (in 2011, the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, the opening was altered to show &quot;Classic&quot; briefly before showing &quot;40 years&quot;). The theme music was composed by Man Made Music, Inc; the opening sequences were designed by Kyle Cooper of Prologue.

As of 2017&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Victoria&quot; series 1, &quot;Masterpiece Classic&quot; no longer aired with a regular host and the series was no longer branded as &quot;Masterpiece Classic&quot; but simply &quot;Masterpiece&quot;.

== &quot;The Best of Masterpiece Theatre&quot; ==
In March 2007, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show, PBS aired an entertainment special produced and directed by Darcy Corcoran. &quot;The Best of Masterpiece&quot; was hosted by Sir Derek Jacobi and featured interviews with Dame Helen Mirren, Hugh Laurie, Damian Lewis, Robson Green, Ian Richardson, Gillian Anderson, Charles Dance, Alex Kingston, Anthony Andrews and Jean Marsh. The countdown special was based on more than 20,000 survey responses posted to the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; and PBS affiliate websites, the top 12 series were:
* &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;
* &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (2002 adaptation)
* &quot;I, Claudius&quot;
* &quot;Bleak House&quot; (2005 adaptation)
* &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; parts 4–7
* &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;
* &quot;Poldark&quot; (1970s version)
* &quot;House of Cards&quot;
* &quot;Reckless&quot;
* &quot;The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders&quot;
* &quot;Wives &amp; Daughters&quot; (1999 adaptation)
* &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;

At the end of the program, Anthony Andrews thanked the audience for voting the 1981 serial &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; as the seventh favorite series. He then pointed out that it had not aired as a part of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. Rather, it had aired as a part of the PBS series entitled &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

== Parodies ==
* A series of film, theatre, and television show parodies appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot;, hosted by Cookie Monster as &quot;Alistair Cookie&quot;. The theme music for &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; (composed by Sam Pottle) was similar to the theme composed by Mouret.
* Disney Channel had a show titled &quot;Mousterpiece Theater&quot; hosted by George Plimpton, featuring Disney animated shorts.
* On &quot;In Living Color&quot; during Season 5 a sketch titled &quot;Parody of Masterpiece&quot; aired in which Jamie Foxx and David Alan Grier recited the lyrics of popular gangster rap songs of the early 1990s by artist such as Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. Cast member Marc Wilmore was the host imitating James Earl Jones.
* Fox&#x27;s long running sketch comedy show &quot;Mad TV&quot; did a parody called &quot;Master P&#x27;s Theater&quot;, featuring a parody of the New Orleans rapper of the same name.
* In 2008, &quot;Boing Boing Video&quot; featured a web series called &quot;SPAMasterpiece Theater&quot; where humorist John Hodgman read unsolicited email spam in dramatizations in the parody of &quot;Masterpiece&quot;.

<text>Hossam Mohammed Amin (; 12 March 1950 – 8 July 2021) was an Iraqi general under Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government. He is stated to have said in 2002 that Iraq would submit a list of chemical, biological and nuclear programs to UNMOVIC, but that the report would not disclose any banned weapons, &quot;because, really, we have no weapons of mass destruction.&quot;

==Biography==
Originally from Saddam&#x27;s home town of Tikrit, Amin studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Mosul, then Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Belgrade in Yugoslavia.

He participated as an Iraqi member delegation in the discussions conducted between Iraq and the United Nations and the IAEA for the period 1991–2003. He was number 49 on the US list of 55 most wanted Iraqis during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was the 13th on the list taken into custody on or around 26 April 2003. Before his capture, American intelligence agents had previously urged Amin to defect and provide the United States with key information on the Iraqi weapons program, as well as Saddam Hussein&#x27;s inner circle. He was released from U.S. custody on 23 December 2005.

Amin worked as officer engineer in the army and military industrialization corporation in Iraq and was considered to be one of the scientists who developed missile systems.

He died from COVID-19 complications in the United Arab Emirates on 8 July 2021.

<text>Consort Qi (224? – 194 BC), also known as Lady Qi, was a consort of Emperor Gaozu, founder of the Han dynasty.

==Biography==

It is important to note that most of our information about Lady Qi comes from sources whose accuracy might be in question and authors known for hyperbole. Her rival, Empress Lü Zhi, was used to symbolize the supposed dangers of women in power; thus, Lady Qi and her alleged fate have been formed into a rhetorical tool.

Qi was born in Dingtao, Shandong. She bore Emperor Gaozu a son Liu Ruyi, who was later installed as Prince of Zhao. Gaozu felt that the crown prince Liu Ying, the future Emperor Hui of Han (his second son) was an unsuitable heir to his throne. He tried several times, fruitlessly, to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi, over the objections of Liu Ying&#x27;s mother, Empress Lü Zhi. Because of this, Lü Zhi hated Qi deeply. Nevertheless, Gaozu ordered Liu Ruyi to proceed to his principality of Zhao (capital in present-day Handan, Hebei) on his deathbed. Qi did not accompany Liu Ruyi.

Lü Zhi became the empress dowager when her son Liu Ying succeeded to the throne as Emperor Hui after Gaozu&#x27;s death, and moved to dispatch Qi and Liu Ruyi. The empress dowager had Qi arrested and treated her like a convict (dressed in prison garb, head shaved, and in stocks). She then summoned Liu Ruyi to the capital Chang&#x27;an in an attempt that was initially resisted by Liu Ruyi&#x27;s chief of staff Zhou Chang (周昌), whom she respected because he was one of the officials who insisted on Liu Ying being the rightful heir. Instead of directly moving against Zhou Chang and Liu Ruyi, Lü Zhi circumvented Zhou by first summoning him to Chang&#x27;an, and then summoning Liu Ruyi. She then consummated her plot to put Qi and Liu Ruyi to death, which was documented in Volume 9 of the historical text &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; as follows:

::Emperor Xiaohui (Emperor Hui of Han) kept his step-brother King of Zhao (Liu Ruyi, King Yin of Zhao) by his side in the palace and checked for poison in any aliment delivered to him. Emperor Xiaohui also brought Liu Ruyi with him wherever he went. In one early morning in the twelfth month of the first year of Emperor Xiaohui, the emperor went on a hunting trip; this time King of Zhao was left alone because he could not wake up early. Emperor Xiaohui supposed his mother would not plot against King of Zhao as several months had passed without any occurrence. Nevertheless, Empress Dowager had an assassin force venom down King of Zhao&#x27;s throat...When the Emperor came back, Liu Ruyi was already dead. She then had Concubine Qi&#x27;s limbs chopped off, blinded her by gouging out her eyes, cut off her tongue, cut off her nose, cut off her ears, forced her to drink a potion that made her mute, made her dumb with toxins, and locked her in the pigsty, and called her a &quot;human swine&quot; (人彘). Several days after, Emperor Xiaohui saw the &quot;human swine&quot;, and after realising who the &quot;human swine&quot; was, the emperor was so sick of his mother&#x27;s cruelty that he virtually relinquished his authority and indulged in carnal pleasures.

Both Qi and her son died in the first year of Emperor Hui&#x27;s reign.

== Connection to the game of weiqi ==

According to &quot;Xijing Zaji&quot; (西京雜記) by Hong Ge, Qi had a maid named Jia Peilan (賈佩蘭) who escaped and later married to a commoner named Duan Ru (段儒) from Fufeng Prefecture (west of present-day Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi). She described Qi as a very beautiful woman, a great songwriter and weiqi player. On the fourth day of the eighth lunar month every year, Qi would play a weiqi game with Emperor Gaozu in the bamboo forest on the north side of the palace. The winner would make a wish that they believed to come true, while the loser would suffer from illness for the year; however loser can avoid this bad luck by cutting off a strand of hair and praying to the North Star.

Qi won every year and wished for good fortune for the Han dynasty.

Jia Peilan is credited in passing out Han dynasty court customs of Double Ninth Festival to commoners.

<text>Active voice is a grammatical voice prevalent in many of the world&#x27;s languages. It is the default voice for clauses that feature a transitive verb in nominative–accusative languages, including English and most Indo-European languages. In these languages, a verb is typically in the active voice when the subject of the verb is the doer of the action.

In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action expressed by the main verb and is thus the agent. For example, in the sentence &quot;The cat ate the fish&quot;, &#x27;the cat&#x27; is the agent performing the action of eating. This contrasts with the passive voice, where the subject is the recipient of the action, such as in &quot;The fish was eaten by the cat.&quot; The use of both active and passive voices in languages enhances versatility in sentence construction, allowing either the semantic agent or patient to assume the syntactic role of the subject.

Even in sentences with impersonal verbs, where no agent is specified, the verb form remains active, such as &quot;It rains.&quot;

==Examples==
Below are examples demonstrating the active and passive voices with pairs of sentences using the same transitive verb across various languages.

<text>The Conversational Monitor System (CMS, originally Cambridge Monitor System) is a simple interactive single-user operating system. CMS was originally developed as part of IBM&#x27;s CP/CMS operating system, which went into production use in 1967. CMS is part of IBM&#x27;s VM family, which runs on IBM mainframe computers. VM was first announced in 1972, and is still in use today as z/VM.

CMS runs as a &quot;guest&quot; operating system in a private virtual machine created by the VM &quot;control program&quot;. The control program plus CMS together create a multi-user time-sharing operating system.

==History==
CMS was originally developed as part of IBM&#x27;s CP/CMS operating system. At the time, the acronym meant &quot;Cambridge Monitor System&quot; (but also: &quot;Console Monitor System&quot;). 
* CMS first ran under CP-40, a one-off research system using custom hardware at IBM&#x27;s Cambridge Scientific Center. Production use at CSC began in January 1967. The CMS user interface drew heavily on experience with the influential first-generation time-sharing system CTSS, some of whose developers worked on CP/CMS. (CTSS was used as an early CP/CMS development platform.)
* Later in 1967, CP/CMS became generally available on the IBM System/360 Model 67, where, although the new control program CP-67 was a substantial re-implementation of CP-40, CMS remained essentially the same. IBM provided CP/CMS &quot;as is&quot; – without any support, in source code form, as part of the IBM Type-III Library. CP/CMS was thus an open source system. Despite this lack of support from IBM, CP/CMS achieved great success as a time-sharing platform; by 1972, there were some 44 CP/CMS systems in use, including commercial sites that resold access to CP/CMS.

In 1972, IBM released its VM/370 operating system, a re-implementation of CP/CMS for the System/370, in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the System/370 series. Unlike CP/CMS, VM/370 &quot;was&quot; supported by IBM. VM went through a series of versions, and is still in use today as z/VM.

Through all its distinct versions and releases, the CMS platform remained still quite recognizable as a close descendant of the original CMS version running under CP-40. Many key user interface decisions familiar to today&#x27;s users had already been made in 1965, as part of the CP-40 effort. See CMS under CP-40 for examples.

Both VM and CP/CMS had checkered histories at IBM. VM was not one of IBM&#x27;s &quot;strategic&quot; operating systems, which were primarily the OS and DOS families, and it suffered from IBM political infighting over time-sharing versus batch processing goals. This conflict is why CP/CMS was originally released as an unsupported system, and why VM often had limited development and support resources within IBM. An exceptionally strong user community, first established in the self-support days of CP/CMS but remaining active after the launch of VM, made substantial contributions to the operating system, and mitigated the difficulties of running IBM&#x27;s &quot;other operating system&quot;.

==Architecture==
CMS is an intrinsic part of the VM/CMS architecture, established with CP/CMS. Each CMS user has control over a private virtual machine – a simulated copy of the underlying physical computer – in which CMS runs as a stand-alone operating system. This approach has remained consistent through the years, and is based on:
* Full virtualization, used to create multiple independent virtual machines that each completely simulate the underlying hardware
* Paravirtualization, used to provide a hypervisor interface that CMS uses to access VM services; this is implemented by the non-virtualized DIAG (diagnose) instruction

More details on how CMS interacts with the virtual machine environment can be found in the VM and CP/CMS articles.

CMS was originally built as a stand-alone operating system, capable of running on a bare machine (though of course nobody would choose to do so). However, CMS can no longer run outside the VM environment, which provides the hypervisor interface needed for various critical functions.

==Features==
CMS provides users an environment for running applications or batch jobs, managing data files, creating and debugging applications, doing cross-platform development, and communicating with other systems or users.

CMS is still in development and wide use today.

===Basic environment===
Users log into VM, providing a userid and password, and then boot their own virtual machine. This can be done by issuing the command &quot;IPL CMS&quot; (&quot;IPL&quot; = &quot;initial program load&quot;, traditional IBM jargon for booting a machine); though this is normally done automatically for the user. Personal customization is done by a standard shell script file named &quot;PROFILE EXEC&quot;, which sets up user-specified environmental defaults, such as which disks and libraries are accessed.

===Terminal support===
CMS started in the era of teletype-style paper terminals, and the later &quot;glass teletype&quot; dumb terminals. By the late 1970s, however, most VM users were connecting via full-screen terminals – particularly the IBM 3270, the ubiquitous transaction processing terminal on IBM mainframes. The 3270 played a strategic role in IBM&#x27;s product line, making its selection a natural choice for large data centers of the day. Many other manufacturers eventually offered bisync terminals that emulated the 3270 protocol.

3270s had local buffer storage, some processing capabilities, and generally dealt with an entire screen of data at a time. They handled editing tasks locally, and then transmitted a set of fields (or the entire page) at once when the ENTER key or a program function key (PFK) was pressed.

The 3270 family incorporated &quot;smart&quot; control units, concentrators, and other network processing elements, communicating with the mainframe over dedicated circuits at relatively high speeds, via a bisync synchronous communication protocol. (These mainframe-oriented communication technologies provided some of the capabilities taken for granted in modern communication networks, such as device addressing, routing, error correction, and support for a variety of configurations such as multipoint and multidrop topologies.)

The 3270 approach differed from lower-cost dumb terminals of the period, which were point-to-point and asynchronous. Commercial time-sharing users, an important segment of early CP/CMS and VM sites, relied on such devices because they could connect via 300- or 1200 bit/s modems over normal voice-grade telephone circuits. Installing a dedicated circuit for a 3270 was often not practical, economical, or timely.

The 3270&#x27;s block-oriented approach was more consistent with IBM&#x27;s batch- and punched card-oriented view of computing, and was particularly important for IBM mainframes of the day. Unlike contemporary minicomputers, most IBM mainframes were not equipped for character-at-a-time interrupts. Dumb terminal support relied on terminal control units such as the IBM 270x (see IBM 3705) or Memorex 1270. These asynchronous terminal controllers assembled a line of characters, up to a fixed maximum length, until the RETURN key was pressed. Typing too many characters would result in an error, a familiar situation to users of the day. (Most data centers did not include this equipment, except as needed for dial-up access. The 3270 approach was preferred.)

Block-oriented terminals like the 3270 made it practical to implement screen-oriented editors on mainframes – as opposed to line-oriented editors, the previous norm. This had been an important advantage of contemporary minicomputers and other character-oriented systems, and its availability via the 3270 was warmly welcomed.

A gulf developed between the 3270 world, focused on page-oriented mainframe transaction processing (especially via CICS), and the asynch terminal world, focused on character-oriented minicomputers and dial-up timesharing. Asynchronous terminal vendors gradually improved their products with a range of smart terminal features, usually accessed via escape sequences. However, these devices rarely competed for 3270 users; IBM maintained its dominance over mainframe data center hardware purchase decisions.

Viewed in retrospect, there was a major philosophical divergence between block-oriented and character-oriented computing. Asynchronous terminal controllers and 3270s both provided the mainframe with block-oriented interactions – essentially, they made the terminal input look like a card reader. This approach, preferred by IBM, led to the development of entirely different user interface paradigms and programming strategies. Character-oriented systems evolved differently. The difference is apparent when comparing the atomic transaction approach of dominant CICS with the interactive, stream-oriented style of UNIX. VM/CMS evolved somewhere between these extremes. CMS has a command-driven, stateful, interactive environment, rather than adopting the CICS approach of a stateless transaction-oriented interface. Yet CMS responds to page- or line-at-a-time interaction, instead of character interrupts.

===Performance===
CMS earned a very good reputation for being efficient, and for having good human factors for ease of use, relative to the standards of the time (and of course prior to widespread use of graphical user interface environments such as are commonly used today). It was not uncommon to have hundreds (later: thousands) of concurrent CMS interactive users on the same VM mainframe, with sub-second response times for common, &#x27;trivial&#x27; functions. VM/CMS consistently outperformed MVS and other IBM operating systems in terms of support for simultaneous interactive users.

===Programming and major applications===
Many CMS users programmed in such languages as COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, C/370, APL, and the scripting language REXX. VM/CMS was often used as a development platform for production systems that ran under IBM&#x27;s other operating systems, such as MVS.

Other CMS users worked with commercial software packages such as FOCUS, NOMAD, SPSS, and SAS.

At one time, CMS was also a major environment for e-mail and office productivity; an important product was IBM&#x27;s PROFS (later renamed OfficeVision).

Two commonly used CMS tools are the editor XEDIT and the REXX programming language. Both of these products have been ported to other platforms, and are now widely used outside the mainframe environment.

<text>Helmstedt is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Wolfenbüttel, the City of Braunschweig, the District of Gifhorn, the City of Wolfsburg and the State of Saxony-Anhalt (districts of Börde and Harz).

==Geography==
The district is bounded by the Elm (a hill chain) in the west and the Lappwald (a riparian forest) in the east. Large parts of the district are part of the &quot;Elm-Lappwald Nature Park&quot;.

==History==
In the Elm, limestone was mined in medieval times; limestone from the region was used for the tomb of Henry the Lion as well as for the imperial cathedral of Königslutter. In the Middle Ages, Königslutter was among the wealthiest cities of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1576, the University of Helmstedt was founded, which was the largest university of protestant Germany.

The Duchy of Brunswick (deriving from Brunswick-Lüneburg) created administrative districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) in 1833; the District of Helmstedt was one of those districts. It was subdivided into the Ämter of Calvörde, Königslutter, Helmstedt, Schöningen, and Vorsfelde.
In 1944, the Amt of Calvörde, which formed an exclave, was moved to the District of Haldensleben, Province of Saxony. During the administrative reforms of the 1970s, northern areas of the district were moved to the District of Gifhorn and to the City of Wolfsburg; the district gained areas in the west from the District of Gifhorn and the District of Brunswick (see List of territorial changes to the District of Helmstedt).

During the 20th century, the area between Helmstedt and Schöningen was used for lignite mining by the Braunschweigische Kohlenbergwerke AG. Several villages (Alversdorf, Büddenstedt and Runstedt) were destroyed by surface mining; their inhabitants moved to Helmstedt, Schöningen and to the newly built village of Neu Büddenstedt, later on renamed Büddenstedt.

==Coat of arms==

In the upper part the heraldic horse of Lower Saxony is displayed. In the bottom there are symbols for mining and agriculture.

<text>McDonnell Douglas Corporation was a major American aerospace manufacturing corporation and defense contractor, formed by the merger of McDonnell Aircraft and the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967. Between then and its own merger with Boeing in 1997, it produced well-known commercial and military aircraft, such as the DC-10 and the MD-80 airliners, the F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter, and the F/A-18 Hornet multirole fighter.

The corporation&#x27;s headquarters were at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, near St. Louis, Missouri.

==History==
===Background===

The company was formed from the firms of James Smith McDonnell and Donald Wills Douglas in 1967. Both men were of Scottish ancestry, were graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and had worked for the aircraft manufacturer Glenn L. Martin Company.
Douglas had been chief engineer at Martin before leaving to establish Davis-Douglas Company in early 1920 in Los Angeles. The following year, he bought out his backer and renamed the firm the Douglas Aircraft Company.

McDonnell founded J.S. McDonnell &amp; Associates in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1926 to produce a personal aircraft for family use. The economic depression from 1929 ruined his ideas and the company collapsed. He worked at three companies, joining Glenn Martin Company in 1933. He left Martin in 1938 to try again with his own firm, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, this time based at Lambert Field, outside St. Louis, Missouri.
Douglas Aircraft profited during World War II. The company produced about 10,000 C-47s, a military variant of the Douglas DC-3, from 1942 to 1945. The workforce swelled to 160,000.

Both companies suffered at the end of the war, facing an end of government orders and a surplus of aircraft. Douglas continued to develop new aircraft, including the DC-6 in 1946 and the DC-7 in 1953. The company moved into jet propulsion, producing the F3D Skyknight in 1948 and then the more &quot;jet age&quot; F4D Skyray in 1951. In 1955, Douglas introduced the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first attack jet, the A4D Skyhawk. Designed to operate from the decks of the World War II s, the Skyhawk was small, reliable, and tough. Variants of it continued in use in the Navy for almost 50 years, finally serving in large numbers in a two-seat version as a jet trainer.
Douglas also made commercial jets, producing the DC-8 in 1958 to compete with the Boeing 707. McDonnell was also developing jets, but being smaller it was prepared to be more radical, building on its successful FH-1 Phantom to become a major supplier to the Navy with the F2H Banshee and F3H Demon; and producing the F-101 Voodoo for the United States Air Force (USAF). The Korean War-era Banshee and later the F-4 Phantom II produced during the Vietnam War helped push McDonnell into a major military fighter supply role. Douglas created a series of experimental high-speed jet aircraft in the Skyrocket family, with the Skyrocket DB-II being the first aircraft to travel at twice the speed of sound in 1953.
Both companies were eager to enter the new missile business, Douglas moving from producing air-to-air rockets and missiles to entire missile systems under the 1956 Nike program and becoming the main contractor of the Skybolt ALBM program and the Thor ballistic missile program. McDonnell made a number of missiles, including the unusual ADM-20 Quail, as well as experimenting with hypersonic flight, research that enabled it to gain a substantial share of the NASA projects Mercury and Gemini. Douglas also gained contracts from NASA, notably for part of the enormous Saturn V rocket.

The two companies were now major employers, but both were having problems. McDonnell was primarily a defense contractor, without any significant civilian business. It frequently suffered lean times during downturns in military procurement. Meanwhile, Douglas was strained by the cost of the DC-8 and DC-9. The two companies began to sound each other out about a merger in 1963. Douglas offered bid invitations from December 1966 and accepted that of McDonnell. The two firms were officially merged on April 28, 1967, as the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC). Earlier, McDonnell bought 1.5 million shares of Douglas stock to help its partner meet &quot;immediate financial requirements&quot;. The two companies seemed to be a good fit for each other. McDonnell&#x27;s military contracts provided an instant solution for Douglas&#x27; cash flow problems, while the revenue from Douglas&#x27; civil contracts would be more than enough for McDonnell to withstand peacetime declines in procurement.

===Formation===
McDonnell Douglas retained McDonnell Aircraft&#x27;s headquarters location at what was then known as Lambert–St. Louis International Airport, in Berkeley, Missouri, near St. Louis. James McDonnell became executive chairman and CEO of the merged company, with Donald Douglas Sr. as honorary chairman.
In 1967, with the merger of McDonnell and Douglas Aircraft, David S. Lewis, then president of McDonnell Aircraft, was named chairman of what was called the Long Beach, Douglas Aircraft Division. At the time of the merger, Douglas Aircraft was estimated to be less than a year from bankruptcy. Flush with orders, the DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft were 9 to 18 months behind schedule, incurring stiff penalties from the airlines. Lewis was active in DC-10 sales in an intense competition with Lockheed&#x27;s L-1011, a rival tri-jet aircraft. In two years, Lewis had the operation back on track and in positive cash flow. He returned to the company&#x27;s St. Louis headquarters where he continued sales efforts on the DC-10 and managed the company as a whole as president and chief operating officer through 1971.
The DC-10 began production in 1968 with the first deliveries in 1971.

As early as 1966 and for decades thereafter, McDonnell Douglas considered building a twin-engined aircraft named the &quot;DC-10 Twin&quot; or DC-X. This would have been an early twinjet similar to the Airbus A300, but it never progressed to a prototype. Such an aircraft might have given McDonnell Douglas an early lead in the huge twinjet market that developed in the 1970s, as well as commonality with many of the DC-10&#x27;s systems.

===1970–1980===
In 1977, the next generation of DC-9 variants, dubbed the &quot;Super 80&quot; (later renamed the MD-80) series, was launched.

In 1977, the KC-10 Extender became the second McDonnell Douglas transport aircraft to be purchased by the U.S. Air Force, after the C-9 Nightingale/Skytrain II.
Through the Cold War, McDonnell Douglas had introduced and manufactured dozens of successful military aircraft, including the F-15 Eagle in 1974 and the F/A-18 Hornet in 1978, as well as other products such as the Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles.

The oil crisis of the 1970s was a serious shock to the commercial aviation industry. McDonnell Douglas was hit by the economic shift and forced to contract while diversifying into new areas to protect against more downturns.

===1980–1989===
In 1984, McDonnell Douglas expanded into helicopters by purchasing Hughes Helicopters from the Summa Corporation for $470 million. Hughes Helicopters was made a subsidiary initially and renamed McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems in August 1984. McDonnell Douglas Helicopters&#x27;s most successful product was the Hughes-designed AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.
In 1986, the MD-11 was introduced, an improved and upgraded version of the DC-10. The MD-11 was the most advanced trijet aircraft to be developed. Since 1990 it sold 200 units, but was discontinued in 2001 after the merger with Boeing as it competed with the Boeing 777. The final commercial aircraft design to be produced by McDonnell Douglas came in 1988. The MD-90 was a stretched version of the MD-80, powered by International Aero Engines V2500 turbofans, the largest rear-mounted engines ever used on a commercial jet. The MD-95, a modern regional airliner closely resembling the DC-9-30, was the last McDonnell Douglas designed commercial jet to be produced.
On January 13, 1988, McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics won the US Navy Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) contract. The US$4.83 billion contract was to develop the A-12 Avenger II, a stealth, carrier-based, long-range flying wing attack aircraft that would replace the A-6 Intruder.

In January 1989, Robert Hood, Jr was appointed president to lead the Douglas Aircraft Division, replacing retiring President Jim Worsham. McDonnell Douglas then introduced a major reorganization called the Total Quality Management System (TQMS). TQMS ended the functional setup where engineers with specific expertise in aerodynamics, structural mechanics, materials, and other technical areas worked on several different aircraft. This was replaced by a product-oriented system where they focus on one specific airplane. As part of reorganization, 5,000 managerial and supervisory positions were eliminated at Douglas. The former managers could apply for 2,800 newly created posts; the remaining 2,200 would lose their managerial responsibilities. The reorganization reportedly led to widespread loss of morale at the company and TQMS was nicknamed &quot;Time to Quit and Move to Seattle&quot; by employees referring to the competitor Boeing headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

===1990–1997===
Technical issues, development cost overruns, growing unit costs, and delays led to the termination of the A-12 Avenger II program on January 13, 1991, by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Years of litigation would proceed over the contract&#x27;s termination: the government claimed that the contractors had defaulted on the contract and were not entitled to the final progress payments, while McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics believed that the contract was terminated out of convenience, and thus the money was owed. The case was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014. The chaos and financial stress created by the collapse of the A-12 program led to the layoff of 5,600 employees. The advanced tactical aircraft role vacated by the A-12 debacle would be filled by another McDonnell Douglas program, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

However the purchasing of aircraft was curtailed as the Cold War came to an abrupt end in the 1990s. This curtailment in military procurements combined with the loss of the contracts for two major projects, the Advanced Tactical Fighter and Joint Strike Fighter, severely hurt McDonnell Douglas. McDonnell Douglas built only a small wind tunnel test model. At its peak in mid-1990, McDonnell Douglas employed 132,500 people, but dropped to about 87,400 by the end of 1992.

In 1991, the MD-11 was not quite a success; ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft&#x27;s performance. An important prospective carrier, Singapore Airlines, required a fully laden aircraft capable of flying from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter; the MD-11 did not have sufficient range for this at the time. Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, Singapore Airlines canceled its order for 20 MD-11s on August 2, 1991, and ordered 20 Airbus A340-300s instead.
In 1992, McDonnell Douglas unveiled a study of a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12. Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft, and the study quickly sank without a trace. A similar double deck concept was used in Boeing&#x27;s later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747, but ultimately the double deck concept would not see the light of day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.

Following Boeing&#x27;s 1996 acquisition of Rockwell&#x27;s North American division, McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in August 1997 in a US$13 billion stock swap, with Boeing as the surviving company. Boeing introduced a new corporate identity based on the McDonnell Douglas logo, which showed the globe being encircled in tribute to the first aerial circumnavigation which was accomplished in 1924 by Douglas aircraft. It was designed by graphic designer Rick Eiber, who had been the corporate identity consultant for Boeing over ten years.

Between 1993 and just after the merger in 1997, McDonnell Douglas performed studies on the feasibility of a twin-engine jet using MD-11 components, and ultimately made a pitch for such a jet with Boeing wings, but nothing came of any of the proposals.

In 1999, Boeing completed the spin off of the civilian line of helicopters to form MD Helicopters, which was formerly part of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems.

Starting August 17, 2006, Boeing closed down the Long Beach factory as orders for the C-17 ceased.

===McDonnell Automation Company legacy===
Some of the company&#x27;s lasting legacies are non-aviation related. They are the computer systems and companies developed in the company&#x27;s subsidiary McDonnell Automation Company (McAuto) which was created in the 1950s initially used for numerical control for production starting in 1958 and computer-aided design (CAD) starting in 1959. Its CAD program MicroGDS remains in use with the latest official version 11.5.1 issued in October 2023.

By the 1970s, McAuto had 3,500 employees and $170 million worth of computer equipment. This made it one of the largest computer processors in the world during this era.

In 1981, McAuto acquired Bradford Systems and Administrative Services for $11.5 million and began processing medical claims. In 1983, two principals of Bradford who had to come work at McAuto—Joseph T. Lynaugh and Howard L. Waltman—formed the Sanus Corporation, a health maintenance organization that was a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas. In 1986, after McDonnell Douglas reduced its control, Sanus announced a partnership with St. Louis pharmacy chain Medicare-Glaser Corp. to form Express Scripts to provide drugs for the Sanus HMO.

<text>The Edge of Night is an American mystery crime drama television series and soap opera, created by Irving Vendig and produced by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions. 
It debuted on CBS on April 2, 1956, and ran as a live broadcast on that network for most of its run until November 28, 1975. The series then moved to ABC, where it aired from December 1, 1975, until December 28, 1984. 7,420 episodes were produced, of which some 1,800 are available for syndication.

Writer Sir P. G. Wodehouse, actresses Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead, as well as Eleanor Roosevelt, were all reportedly devoted fans.

==Concept==
&quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, whose working title was &quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot;, premiered on April 2, 1956, as one of the first two half-hour serials on television, the other being &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Prior to the debuts of both shows, 15-minute-long shows had been the standard. Both shows aired on CBS, sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble.

The show was originally conceived as the daytime television version of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, which was popular in novel and radio formats at the time. Mason&#x27;s creator Erle Stanley Gardner was to create and write the show, but a last-minute tiff between the CBS network and him caused Gardner to pull his support from the idea. CBS insisted that Mason be given a love interest to placate daytime soap opera audiences, but Gardner refused to take Mason in that direction. Gardner eventually patched up his differences with CBS, and &quot;Perry Mason&quot; debuted in prime time on September 21, 1957.

In 1956, a writer from the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; radio show, Irving Vendig, created a retooled idea of the show for daytime television—and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; was born. John Larkin, radio&#x27;s best identified Perry Mason, was cast as the protagonist-star, initially as a detective, eventually as an attorney, in a thinly veiled copy of Perry Mason.

===Setting===
Unlike &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, whose adventures took place in Southern California, the daytime series was set in the fictional city of Monticello, located in the Midwestern United States. A frequent backdrop for the show&#x27;s early scenes was a restaurant called the Ho-Hi-Ho. The state capital, however, was known generically as &quot;Capital City&quot;; the state in which Monticello was located had never been identified. From its beginning in 1956 until roughly 1980, the downtown skyline of the city of Cincinnati stood in as Monticello. Procter &amp; Gamble, which produced the show, is based in Cincinnati. In later years, the Los Angeles skyline replaced that of Cincinnati. The skyline motif was eventually eliminated altogether in the final two years of the show, as was the word &quot;The&quot; in the title.

===Format===
During most of the show&#x27;s run, viewers were treated to an announcer enthusiastically and energetically announcing the show&#x27;s title, &quot;The Eeedge...of Night!&quot; Bob Dixon was the first announcer in 1956, followed by Herbert Duncan. The two voices most identified with the show, however, were those of Harry Kramer (1957–1972) and Hal Simms, who announced until the series ended in 1984.

&quot;The Edge of Night&quot; played on more artistic levels than probably any other soap of its time. It was unique among daytime soap operas in that it focused on crime, rather than domestic and romantic matters. The police, district attorneys, and medical examiners of fictional Monticello, United States, dealt with a steady onslaught of gangsters, drug dealers, blackmailers, cultists, international spies, corrupt politicians, psychopaths, and murderous debutantes, while at the same time coping with more usual soap opera problems like courtship, marriage, divorce, child custody battles, and amnesia. The show&#x27;s particular focus on crime was recognized in 1980, when, in honor of its 25 years on the air, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; was given a special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; had more prominent male characters than most soap operas, and included genuine humor in its scripts to balance the heaviness of the storylines.

==Cast and characters==

The show&#x27;s central protagonist was Mike Karr, tireless crimefighter, introduced as a police officer who was finishing law school. This character evolved from the earlier Perry Mason character on radio. He then progressed to the district attorney&#x27;s office as an assistant district attorney, hung his own shingle as a defense attorney for several years, then became district attorney of Monticello. Karr was portrayed by three actors: John Larkin (radio&#x27;s Perry Mason), Laurence Hugo, and Forrest Compton.

Among the show&#x27;s cast members who appeared on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; early in their careers and later gained fame were Mariann Aalda, Leah Ayres, Conrad Bain, David Birney, Dixie Carter, Kate Capshaw, Philip Casnoff, Thom Christopher, Margaret Colin, James Coco, Jacqueline Courtney, John Cullum, Marcia Cross, Irene Dailey, Frances Fisher, Jennifer Joan Taylor, Lucy Lee Flippin, David Froman, Penny Fuller, Scott Glenn, Sam Groom, Don Hastings, Patrick Horgan, Earle Hyman, Željko Ivanek, Peter Kastner, Lori Loughlin, Bill Macy, Nancy Marchand, Kiel Martin, Doug McKeon, Julianne Moore, John Allen Nelson, Barry Newman, Bebe Neuwirth, Christopher Norris, Antony Ponzini, Lawrence Pressman, Tony Roberts, Reva Rose, Mark Rydell, Dolph Sweet, Millee Taggart, Holland Taylor, Richard Thomas, John Travolta, Ann Wedgeworth and Jacklyn Zeman.

Over the years, the show featured many notable performers and celebrities, usually in small cameo appearances, but some in roles important to the storylines. Among the show&#x27;s guest stars were Willie Aames, Amanda Blake, Dick Cavett, Nancy Coleman, Professor Irwin Corey, Selma Diamond, James Douglas, Alfred Drake, John Fiedler, Betty Guarde, Rita Gam, Eva Gabor, Jack Gilford, Frank Gorshin, Farley Granger, Cynthia Gregory, Micki Grant, Lisa Howard, Kim Hunter, Leon Janney, Rita Jenrette, Arch Johnson, Larry King, Nancy Marchand, Ed Marinaro, Donald May, Sam McMurray, James Mitchell, Meg Myles, Tom Nardini, Wade Nichols, Peaches and Herb, Minerva Pious, Anne Revere, Rosemary Rice, Hugh Reilly, Wallace Shawn, Pat Stanley, Shirley Stoler, Elaine Stritch, Jane White, Ann Williams, and Jerry Zaks.

==Storylines==
For the show&#x27;s duration, the stories either revolved around or touched upon Monticello lawyer (and former Monticello police officer) Mike Karr.

===The 1950s===
As the show began, Mike Karr&#x27;s relationship with Sara Lane (Teal Ames) reproduced the radio serial&#x27;s Perry Mason/Della Street relationship. Adding a complication for Mike Karr, Sara&#x27;s family was involved in organized crime. In the early years of the show, Sara&#x27;s younger brother, Jack (Don Hastings), was drawn into the criminal world by corrupt uncle Harry Lane (Lauren Gilbert). Nevertheless, Mike and Sara eventually married. Their happiness was short-lived when Sara was written out of the show, killed as she saved the life of their daughter Laurie Ann, who ran into the street into the path of an automobile. By the 1960s, Laurie Ann was a teenager, supplying many plots for the show, and a young wife and mother by the 1970s.

===The 1960s===
Mike later married Nancy Pollock (Ann Flood), a journalist who helped in many of his cases. Nancy had two siblings: Lee, who eventually married Geri McGrath, and Elaine (nicknamed &quot;Cookie&quot;). Cookie, was also involved in major story arcs. Cookie was married first to Malcom Thomas, who cheated on her, and then made her a widow. Later she married Ron Christopher, whose dealings with loan sharks affected Mike&#x27;s good friends Louise and Philip Capice.

Other important characters were Police chief Bill Marceau (Mandel Kramer), who was one of Karr&#x27;s best friends and shared a tremendous mutual respect, rare between a defense attorney and a chief of police (perhaps because Mike had once been a police officer himself), Marceau&#x27;s secretary (and later wife) Martha (Teri Keane), fellow attorney Adam Drake (Donald May), his client, then secretary (and later on, his wife) Nicole Travis (Maeve McGuire; Jayne Bentzen; Lisa Sloan), and wealthy socialite Geraldine Whitney (Lois Kibbee).

In one storyline, Nicole Travis (later, Drake) was victimized by two different women, Stephanie Martin (Alice Hirson) and Pamela Stewart (Irene Dailey), who both wanted Nicole gone but for different reasons. Pamela was Adam Drake&#x27;s ex-wife, and she knew Adam was falling in love with Nicole. She reasoned that Adam might return to her if Nicole were not there. Although Stephanie did attempt to kill Nicole on at least one occasion (by poisoning her bourbon), she more interested in terrorising her in revenge for the deaths of her husband and daughter. Stephanie&#x27;s husband had borrowed money from loan sharks who answered to Nicole&#x27;s gangster father. He could not repay the debt, so Nicole&#x27;s father ordered his men to cut the brakelines on his car. The whole family, including Stephanie, her husband, their son, and identical twin daughters Karen and Debbie were in the resulting accident, which only Stephanie and Debbie survived. (Debbie was struck dumb by the incident and was receiving in-patient therapy; while Stephanie unwittingly compounded the problem by calling her &quot;Karen,&quot; thus making it clear she wished it had been the other twin who had survived.) Nicole&#x27;s father was in prison, so Stephanie went after his daughter instead - gradually moving closer and closer, and eventually taking a job as one Nicole&#x27;s two shop assistants. Stephanie was working late at the shop when she stabbed in the back, just as Nicole arrived to confront her - having learned earlier that evening that Stephanie was behind the threats on her life. Debbie, who had been sleeping on a window seat until just before the stabbing occurred, saw her mother on the floor with the dagger in her back and shouted &quot;Pull it out! Pull it out!&quot;; which Nicole did. Thus, Nicole was accused of murdering Stephanie because her fingerprints were on the weapon; and Debbie was struck dumb again. Adam Drake defended Nicole against increasingly impossible odds, eventually realising that Debbie was the key to Nicole&#x27;s exoneration. He had to find a way to make her speak again. Knowing Debbie had strong affection for the therapist who was helping her, he proceed to accuse the woman of being the killer. This proved to be the catalyst the restored Debbie&#x27;s ability to speak again, to defend her friend. Adam then showed Debbie a picture of Nicole and asked if it was the woman who killed her mother and Debbie answered no. In a classic Perry Mason-like climax, Debbie was called to testify at Nicole&#x27;s trial; and when asked on the stand if the woman who killed her mother was in court, she said &quot;Yes. Her!&quot; as she pointed to Pamela Stewart - who had killed Stephanie by mistake. In the darkness and because she attacked from behind, Pamela thought she was stabbing Nicole.

===The 1970s===
Adam subsequently left Mike Karr&#x27;s law firm as partner and opened his own practice. He hired Nicole as his secretary, and their romance blossomed. But when Nicole sensed his lack of interest in marriage, she went to work for another attorney, Jake Berman (Ward Costello). She continued to date Adam and told him if he did not propose to her by New Year&#x27;s Eve, their relationship was finished. Shortly afterward, she got a marriage proposal from her new boss, widower Jake Berman. She did not accept it but moved to New York City with him when he decided to become a partner at another law firm. Adam then searched for Nicole in New York until he found her at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve and proposed to her. When Adam and Nicole returned to Monticello, so did Jake, determined to prevent them from marrying. He plotted with ex-convict Johnny Dallas (John LaGioia) to frame Adam for attempted murder. Johnny did not show up, but Jake was murdered by Joel Gantry (Paul Henry Itkin, Nicholas Pryor) and Adam was arrested for the murder immediately following his wedding to Nicole at the Karr residence. The day before the jury would have found Adam guilty, Joel Gantry was found by Kevin Jamison (Dick Shoberg) in San Francisco. Joel was really Edith Berman&#x27;s son from her previous marriage, and he was convinced that Jake had murdered his mother. Adam and Nicole thus were reunited and settled into married life. Sometime later, she was believed to have died in a boating accident in the Caribbean but was discovered alive 18 months later by Kevin Jamison (then played by John Driver) in France. At the same time, Adam proposed to Assistant District Attorney Brandy Henderson (Dixie Carter). Adam and Nicole eventually reunited about six months after Nicole was discovered alive, and Brandy left town another six months later. Their marriage ended when Adam was murdered. A young doctor, Miles Cavanaugh, came along and became interested in Nicole. Although the actress who played Nicole was only four years older than the actor playing Miles, the producers replaced her with another actress who was ten years younger than he - a rarity in the soap opera genre, presumably done to break completely with the prior Nicole storylines. Nicole and Miles eventually married but the new actress was herself replaced four years later by another actress. Two years after that, Nicole died after her makeup powder was poisoned.

In the show&#x27;s later years, Mike&#x27;s beautiful daughter Laurie Ann (Emily Prager), by now a young adult, was an important character. Her relationship with Jonah Lockwood, a sociopath, almost cost her her life, but he was revealed to be an alternate persona of Keith Whitney, scion of the wealthy Whitney family, nemesis of the Karrs and Marceau. Laurie subsequently became engaged to marry Mike Karr&#x27;s law associate Vic Lamont (Ted Tinling). During this time Mike Karr was being stalked by a gangster Lobo Haynes (Fred J. Scollay) over a shipment of drugs which led to Vic being pleading guilty to murder and going to prison to conduct undercover work where he was almost stabbed to death in a prison shower but his life was saved by inmate Johnny Dallas. Johnny was later released from prison and became the owner of a restaurant The New Moon Cafe. Laurie (now played by Jeanne Ruskin) played the piano at the restaurant leading to her and Johnny falling in love. When Vic found out Laurie and Johnny were together in Chicago when he didn&#x27;t show up to shoot and wound Jake Berman, he left Laurie. In a drunken stupor, Vic married client Kay Reynolds (Elizabeth Farley). Laurie and Johnny eventually married and Vic was murdered saving Johnny&#x27;s life in a staged holdup at the New Moon Cafe when it was revealed that Johnny was doing undercover work. Laurie (now played by Linda Cook) and Johnny had a baby they named John Victor. However, Laurie developed mental problems that led her to being placed in a mental institution, and Johnny ran away.

Another major character introduced in the later years was Assistant District attorney Draper Scott (Tony Craig), who started out working alongside Brandy Henderson and tried to date her but she was still in love with Adam Drake. Draper prosecuted Nicole&#x27;s cousin Serena Faraday (Louise Shaffer) for the murder of her ex-husband Mark Faraday (Bernie McInery) but Adam defended her and proved it was her alternate personality &quot;Josie&quot; and she was sent to a mental institution. Draper left the D. A. office and joined forces with Mike Karr after Adam Drake was shot and killed. He eventually married April Cavanaugh (Terri Davis) sister of Dr. Miles Cavanaugh. One of the later major story arcs was about a train wreck where Draper had been unjustly convicted of murder, escaping from the train accident. There was also a storyline in the mid-1970s involving a troubled woman (Nicole&#x27;s cousin, Serena Faraday) who changed her personality to Josie as she donned a frizzy, black wig in perhaps a nod to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;&#x27;s popular Victoria Lord/Niki Smith storyline. Another notable character was Charlotte &quot;Raven&quot; Alexander Jamison Swift Whitney (Juanin Clay, then Sharon Gabet), a duplicitous coquette who became more stable and faithful in the latter years.

Whitney family matriarch, tough Geraldine Whitney (Lois Kibbee) suffered the misfortune of losing most of those close to her to untimely deaths: her first husband, two sons, a beloved daughter-in-law, a nephew, and she herself was nearly killed, having been pushed down a flight of stairs in 1975 by her ne&#x27;er-do-well son-in-law Noel Douglas (Dick Latessa). She became close to Raven Alexander and Raven&#x27;s ex-husband Logan Swift during later years (and became de facto grandmother to Raven and Logan&#x27;s son). However, when Logan was killed in 1984, Geraldine could hardly bear the grief to learn that, through a series of events, she had accidentally shot him.

===The 1980s===
Near the end of the series&#x27; run came a rather unusual story wherein Mike and Nancy, after sleeping in twin beds for nearly their entire married life, decided to &quot;go all out, and buy a double bed&quot;, thereby retiring their twin beds for good.

Uniquely among daytime dramas at the time, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; finished its run with an ominous (and intentional) cliffhanger, revealing that an old enemy—Louis Van Dine, who had supposedly been sent to the state penitentiary—had returned to settle some scores, and none of the main protagonists were safe. In addition, police detective Chris Egan (Jennifer Taylor) - spying a supposedly deceased henchman of Van Dine, Donald Hext - followed Hext into a previously unknown Monticello Street called &quot;Wonderland Lane.&quot; There, she discovered Van Dine&#x27;s sister, Alicia Van Dine (Chris Weatherhead), in a shop. Alicia&#x27;s brother viciously stabbed her in the back; her allegedly dying words to Chris Egan were: &quot;...Off, off with her head...&quot; Egan barely escaped from the shop after Van Dine and Hext attempted to capture her and ran out of Wonderland Lane, briefly falling by the post next to the street sign, a stuffed white rabbit propped against it.

The final scene of the series is of Chris Egan telling Mike Karr and others of her encounter with Louis Van Dine and Donald Hext, in addition to Alicia Van Dine&#x27;s stabbing. The show&#x27;s theme plays over the dialogue, masking Karr&#x27;s words, but the audience is left to know that the story of Monticello continues onward, albeit off the air. The reason for the cliffhanger was that Procter &amp; Gamble believed that they could find another network to take over production of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, or possibly continue the show in first-run syndication, but in 1984, there were no cable networks willing to take on such an expensive endeavor.

==Broadcast history==
===CBS===
Unlike most soap operas, which build a solid audience slowly over many years, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; was an instant hit with daytime viewers; it amassed an audience of nine million in its first year, in some respects because the public perceived it as a daytime &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, as the producers of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; had intended. Through the 1960s, the show continued to gain popularity; it consistently ranked as one of the top six rated soap operas, alongside the rest of CBS&#x27; daytime lineup. It peaked at #2 (behind &quot;As the World Turns&quot;) in the 1966–67 television season and came in at #2 between 1969 and 1971.

At one point, the audience for &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; was estimated to be more than 50% male, largely due to the show&#x27;s crime format and its late start time of 4:30 p.m. (3:30 Central). On July 1, 1963, the show was moved to the 3:30/2:30 time period after CBS gave the 4:30/3:30 slot back to its affiliates, primarily used by them for children&#x27;s programs, local or syndicated. &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; dominated the 3:30 slot even over otherwise-hit programs like NBC&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. However when &quot;Edge&quot; was moved to 2:30 p.m. (1:30 Central) on September 11, 1972, per Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s insistence upon running all of its shows back-to-back, the change caused fellow P&amp;G soap &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; to be shifted 30 minutes earlier to 2 p.m. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, P&amp;G&#x27;s other two soaps, were not affected by the timeslot changes nor was the interrupted affiliate break, usually for local newscasts, at 1 p.m./noon). This timeslot change caused a drastic slide in &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;″s viewership, dropping from fourth in the Nielsen ratings—among the 17 daytime serials on the air at the time—to 10th place, presumed to be because many male viewers and teenagers were unable to make it home from work or school earlier in the afternoon to watch; as a consequence, &quot;Edge&quot; became CBS&#x27;s lowest-rated soap. This would not be the last time that a Procter &amp; Gamble soap airing on CBS experienced a dramatic ratings decline after being moved to the 2:30 p.m. timeslot; the same problem would affect its long-running sister soap &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; in that same slot seven years later.

By summer 1975, CBS began considering expansions of two of its Procter &amp; Gamble-owned soap operas, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, to 45 minutes daily, in response to NBC&#x27;s full-hour expansions of &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; some months earlier. The network changed its mind, however, when it realized that doing so would force them to take the 30-minute affiliate break slot at 1/noon away from local stations. CBS was also put in a bind because it had already decided to expand another of its daytime shows, game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, to an hour starting in November (a move that would prove to be a major ratings success for the network, more-so than the expansion of &quot;ATWT&quot;). CBS decided to simply expand &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which was still the top-rated soap opera on television, to 60 minutes starting in December. Since CBS decided against taking the 1 p.m. slot from the affiliates, and the network did not intend to move &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from its 1:30 p.m. slot, this made the low-rated &quot;Edge of Night&quot; expendable, and CBS told Procter &amp; Gamble that it would not be renewing the series (although the network conceivably could have returned the soap to late afternoons, keeping control of the 50% male audience it had previously before the move to 2:30 p.m.).

===ABC===
Despite CBS canceling it, Procter &amp; Gamble wanted to continue &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, and soon inquired with the other networks about picking up the series. ABC expressed interest in bringing &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; to its daytime lineup, and was willing to return it to late afternoons where it had previously done so well. It was the only network that did not have, then or in the past, a P&amp;G serial on its schedule, and was excited to work with the company. However, a major issue almost resulted in the outright cancellation of the serial before such a move, the first of its kind, would take place.

CBS had originally planned on expanding &quot;As the World Turns&quot; at the beginning of the new season in September 1975. ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule was full at the time with programs whose contracts it had to honor, and the earliest it could have a spot open on the schedule would be in December. This meant that it would be approximately three months at least before &quot;Edge&quot; would air its first episode on ABC, and the network was worried that a three-month absence would result in a loss of viewers. Instead, a compromise was struck where CBS would keep &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; on its schedule for the time being, and once ABC found a place for it, which it did when it canceled &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot; on December 1, 1975, the expansion of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and network change of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; would take place. On the date of the network switch, CBS placed &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in &quot;Edge&quot;″s former 2:30 slot, returning to the timeslot where that network originally placed the show when it expanded to a half-hour broadcast seven years earlier.

The last CBS episode of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, aired on November 28, 1975, ending with the discovery that Nicole Drake was alive. She had been presumed dead in an explosion 18 months earlier while on a boating trip with her husband Adam. ABC aired the show beginning on December 1, with a 90-minute premiere. This episode picked up where CBS had left off the previous Friday, with Geraldine Whitney still in a coma after having been pushed down a flight of stairs in a murder attempt by her daughter-in-law Tiffany&#x27;s second husband, Noel Douglas&#x27; girlfriend Tracy Dallas. Nicole—with the help of Geraldine&#x27;s adopted &quot;son&quot;, Kevin Jamison—regained her identity after suffering from amnesia since the boating-trip explosion. The final scene of that day&#x27;s episode was a climax in which Serena Faraday, in her &quot;Josie&quot; split personality, shot and killed her husband on the steps of the courthouse.

The move to ABC made &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; the first serial to change from one broadcast network to another. (The only other soap to do so was its former CBS stablemate and fellow Procter &amp; Gamble serial &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, which moved to NBC in 1982, following a dispute with CBS over its 1981 shift from 12:30, where the show had aired since its 1952 premiere, to the 2:30 slot that caused the viewership decline that led to &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;″s initial cancellation by CBS over six years earlier.)

Initially, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; showed promise when it began airing on ABC. ABC aired &quot;Edge&quot; in the 4:00/3:00 p.m. late-afternoon time slot in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and, due to a different scheduling pattern for ABC&#x27;s West Coast feed, at noon in the Pacific Time Zone. At first, the show&#x27;s overall ratings declined because fewer homes had access to it; this happened because many ABC affiliates had opted to run local or syndicated programming in the 4:00/3:00 slot, instead of the network feed, for many years and decided not to abandon the practice. As a result, in some markets, &quot;Edge&quot; disappeared after relocating from CBS to ABC. In other markets, stations (either a local ABC affiliate or an independent station that picked the show up) taped the program for delayed broadcast in a morning slot. Nevertheless, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; was typically either first (or a close second) in its timeslot in markets where the local ABC station cleared it at 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time); this was due mainly to the weakness of competing programs on CBS and NBC. &quot;Somerset&quot;, the spinoff to NBC&#x27;s highly rated &quot;Another World&quot;, was the only other soap still airing in that timeslot, but never got the ratings that the mother show received from airing one hour earlier; that show ended up being canceled the following year. Furthermore, the show&#x27;s demographics were significantly better on ABC because the show got its youth and some of its male demographics back; thus, ABC was able to charge higher advertising rates for it than several series with higher audience ratings.

Despite never recovering the ground it lost from its CBS days, even sliding into the lowest third tier in the ratings by 1977, ratings for &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; improved slightly during the early 1980s, thanks in no small part to the overall rise of ABC&#x27;s other soaps in the ratings, with &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; all winning their respective timeslots, along with fresh new characters (such as Steve, Draper, Logan, Deborah, April, Raven and Damian). While the numbers were less solid, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; still pulled in ratings in the 5.0 range and improved its position in the Nielsens, peaking at 11th in both 1981 and 1982. However, from 1982 on, ratings fell as even more ABC affiliates dropped the show in favor of the aforementioned syndicated offerings. At the end of the 1981-82 television season, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; pulled in a 5.0 rating, but with the resulting preemptions, the show&#x27;s rating dropped to a 3.8 in 1983. This caused Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s profit margins on the program to shrink with each passing year.

The series was also broadcast in Canada on CBC Television beginning in the early 1970s, but after more than a decade, CBC opted in the fall of 1982 to drop &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from its daytime afternoon lineup and replace it with the ABC-owned soap opera, &quot;All My Children&quot;.

In May 1983, Procter &amp; Gamble dismissed the show&#x27;s head writer, Henry Slesar, whose 15-year job with the soap opera was at that time the longest in daytime serial history, and appointed as its new head writer Lee Sheldon, a writer and producer of primetime television shows. (He had been a writer on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Witch&quot; earlier in the season.) Although Sheldon&#x27;s emphasis on humor (an attribute he had honed while working on &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Witch&quot;) reflected an attempt to boost ratings, the show&#x27;s ratings slump only worsened as even more ABC affiliates dropped the show.

By fall 1984, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; aired on only 106 of ABC&#x27;s 213 affiliate stations. A further two dozen affiliates planned to drop the series in the first quarter of 1985, with many station managers doing so because they wanted local or syndicated programming to air in the 4:00 timeslot. Although ABC intended to continue &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, even offering to move it to a mid-morning timeslot, Procter &amp; Gamble could no longer afford to continue producing the show due to the constant loss of revenue from frequent preemptions. Thus, on October 26, 1984, ABC and Procter &amp; Gamble made a joint announcement that the final telecast of &quot;Edge of Night&quot; (whose title had been shortened to three words) would take place on December 28 of that year. At this point, the show&#x27;s ratings were less than half of what they had been at the beginning of the decade; at the end of the 1984–85 television season, it finished last in the daytime ratings race with a 2.6 rating in only four months of episodes.

To date, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; is the last regularly-scheduled ABC network program to have aired in the 4:00–4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) time slot; ABC returned the half-hour slot to its affiliates after &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; finished its run. NBC had done this in 1977, while CBS, which programmed the 4:00 p.m. time slot with &quot;Body Language&quot; when &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; left the air, followed suit in September 1986 after canceling &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; a month prior.

==== Post-cancellation aftermath ====
The cancellation of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, along with ABC&#x27;s relinquishing of what had become a death slot at the time of the show&#x27;s demise, had a major impact on the first-run syndication market as ABC affiliates sought new programming to fill the open timeslot in the midst of the 1984-85 television season. The most significant impact occurred in the New York City market, where the cancellation of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; created an opening on ABC&#x27;s East Coast flagship, WABC-TV. Taking advantage of this opening, distributor King World Productions reached an agreement to move the syndicated revival of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, already in the middle of its first season, over to WABC&#x27;s open 4 p.m. slot from WNBC-TV, where it had been airing in an overnight time slot.&quot;&quot;

In December 1986, after struggling to find a strong lead-out to complement &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; before its 5 p.m. newscast, WABC filled the entire hour with &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; (also distributed by King World, which came to dominate the 4 p.m. timeslot in New York and many other markets). At the same time, WABC moved &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; to 7 p.m., pushing ABC&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; ahead by a half-hour and reducing the length of its 6 p.m. newscast to 30 minutes; locally, this move would later repeat itself at WNBC and WCBS-TV, and eventually at network affiliates in many other markets where such scheduling patterns are now considered standard practice.&quot;&quot;

As of 2021, the 4 p.m. time slot is now largely filled by local newscasts on most major network affiliates, including most of ABC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, since the conclusion of &quot;Oprah&quot; in 2011.

==Episode status==
Most CBS episodes of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; no longer exist as the series was broadcast live until September 1975, shortly before the move to ABC. The network had terminated its wiping practice of shows it owned in September 1972, but Procter &amp; Gamble continued wiping tapes until 1978. Many monochrome episodes and some color episodes of the show were kinescoped; the color episodes in this format survive in black-and-white. Forty-five episodes of the CBS era are known to exist, the best-known of which include the Christmas Day 1974 episode and a September 1975 episode depicting the attempted murder of Geraldine. Some fans also have the second episode of the series (April 3, 1956), which featured Don Hastings, John Larkin and Teal Ames. The first two years of the ABC run also followed the tape-erasure practice, which ceased in 1978 for ABC and all Procter &amp; Gamble shows.

From August 5, 1985, to January 19, 1989, reruns aired in a daily late-night timeslot on cable&#x27;s USA Network, airing episodes from June 1981 up to the 1984 series finale.

From August 2006 to January 2009, Procter &amp; Gamble made several of its classic soap operas available, a few episodes at a time, through AOL Video Service, downloadable free of charge. AOL downloads of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; commenced with episode #6051, from July 17, 1979, and concluded with episode #6380, from November 6, 1980.

<doc id="154815" wikidata="Q14956950" url="?curid=154815" title="Return to the Forbidden Planet">
<text>Return to the Forbidden Planet is a jukebox musical by Bob Carlton based on the 1956 science fiction film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, which, in turn, is loosely based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The show features a score of 1950s and 1960s rock and roll classics and dialogue largely adapted from well-known passages from Shakespeare.

Often billed as &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s forgotten rock and roll masterpiece&quot;, &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; has been performed all over the world since its premiere in London in the 1980s. It won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical for both 1989 and 1990.

Conceived for a cast of actor-musicians, the space ship sets conceals keyboards and drums. The campy sci-fi setting consists of silvered space suits and the robot, Ariel, is performed by an actor on roller skates, with a costume reminiscent of the original movie&#x27;s Robby the Robot. There is a part for narrator (known as &quot;the newsreader&quot;) on pre-recorded video, who has been performed by celebrities including Patrick Moore, Brian May, Richard O&#x27;Brien and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

==Plot==
===Act 1===
The bosun of the starship Albatross welcomes the audience as passengers aboard a routine survey flight, departing momentarily under the command of Captain Tempest. After takeoff, Captain Tempest converses with the ship&#x27;s new Science Officer, who is a woman, and they argue about the importance of men and women on earth. During their argument, the ship gets caught in a meteor shower. The Science Officer suggests that they use the shuttle craft and abandon ship, but Captain Tempest insists on flying through the storm. During the confusion, the Science Officer escapes the ship via shuttle craft. Their spaceship is drawn mysteriously to the planet D&#x27;Illyria where the crew meet mad scientist Doctor Prospero, who has been marooned on the planet since his wife and science partner Gloria sent him and their daughter Miranda into space. Doctor Prospero offers to help repair the broken starship and he, his daughter, and their robot Ariel come aboard. The ship&#x27;s cook, Cookie, is instantly taken by Miranda&#x27;s beauty and falls in love with her, a love he thinks she returns. In fact she has fallen in love with Captain Tempest, against the will of her father. During discussions about locating the missing Science Officer, Ariel reveals information about Doctor Prospero&#x27;s new formula &#x27;X Factor’, which can enhance the brain and mind. After an argument with his daughter over her love for the captain, Doctor Prospero takes the draught of &#x27;X Factor&#x27;. Soon afterwards, the ship is attacked by a foul monster, but during the attack it is revealed that Ariel is in the airlock with the missing Science Officer. To save them both, Captain Tempest orders the airlock opened, which allows the monster to gain access to the ship. During the confusion of the attack it is revealed that the Science Officer is Doctor Prospero&#x27;s wife Gloria, who is then taken by the monster, as its tentacles attack the rest of the ship.

===Act 2===
The story continues with the attack unfolding again, but this time Gloria isn&#x27;t kidnapped by the monster, and Ariel the robot is able to attack the monster to make it retreat. After the attack, more is revealed about Doctor Prospero and Gloria&#x27;s past. Captain Tempest puts Gloria under ship arrest for her crimes against her husband. She forms a quick alliance with Cookie, whom she persuades to release her and help steal the recipe for Doctor Prospero&#x27;s &#x27;X Factor&#x27; in exchange for helping him win over Miranda&#x27;s heart. Gloria talks to Cookie, as Bosun, the ship&#x27;s First Mate, talks to Captain Tempest about how to gain the love of Miranda. When the monster returns, it is revealed that it is created by Doctor Prospero&#x27;s mind due to his having taken the &#x27;X Factor&#x27;. Gloria tells Doctor Prospero that what she did to him was so that he could keep himself and their daughter safe from the &#x27;X Factor&#x27;. Doctor Prospero has no choice but to leave the ship and sacrifice himself to save the others. Once Doctor Prospero has left, it is then revealed that D&#x27;Illyria is nothing other than a figment of Doctor Prospero&#x27;s imagination, as it starts to destroy itself once the doctor has died. The ship escapes. Once again in space Gloria blesses the union of Miranda and Captain Tempest, and Cookie is pardoned for his behaviour towards Miranda and Captain Tempest. The show ends with the crew safe and well with their Science Officer back and Captain Tempest with a new bride.

==Productions==

=== United Kingdom ===
&quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; was first performed by the Bubble Theatre Company in a tented theatre in Blackheath, London, on 23 May 1983. Following revisions to the material, versions of the show followed at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool and the Tricycle Theatre, London, before opening, on 18 September 1989 at the Cambridge Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. The London production won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical for both 1989 and 1990. A West End cast album was released in 1990 by Virgin Records.

The show was revived for touring productions in the United Kingdom in 1999, 2001 and 2002, with Patrick Moore reprising his pre-recorded role as the newsreader. A new production toured the UK in 2006 with Brian May as the newsreader.

In August and September 2012, a revival of &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; played the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch. The production was directed by the show&#x27;s creator, Bob Carlton, who was then the theatre&#x27;s artistic director. Richard O&#x27;Brien appeared as the newsreader. The production&#x27;s musical supervisor was Julian Littman, the musical director was Greg Last, and the choreographer was Frido Ruth. In November 2014, the production returned to the Queen&#x27;s Theatre for the a 25th anniversary prior to a UK tour.

=== Australia ===
When the musical opened in Sydney, Australia, the beginning of a national tour, the newsreader was played by Clive &quot;Robbo&quot; Robertson, who performed a futuristic parody of his own late-night TV news show, &quot;Newsworld&quot;. An Australian cast album was released in 1991 by ATA Records.

=== North America ===
On September 27, 1991, &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; opened Off-Broadway at the Variety Arts Theatre, the first theatrical production in a former nickelodeon. The cast included Julee Cruise, known to audiences from her role in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The newsreader was James Doohan, known for his role as &quot;Scotty&quot; in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It was nominated for two Outer Critics Circle Awards, but played to mixed reviews from critics and closed, after 243 performances, on April 26, 1992.

In Los Angeles, the ARK Theatre Company mounted a production of the musical, under the direction of Vanessa Claire Smith.

New Line Theatre in St. Louis, MO staged the show in March 2009. Critic Paul Friswold of The Riverfront Times wrote about the production, “Bob Carlton&#x27;s whimsical take on &quot;The Tempest&quot; as refracted through a 1950s sci-fi prism features a galaxy&#x27;s worth of fantastic rock &amp; roll songs, punning wordplays on snippets of Shakespearean monologues and intentionally ‘Pigs in Space’ costuming. But this is no parlor trick of a musical; there&#x27;s a rich vein of Shakespeare&#x27;s favorite ingredient — the wondrous depths of the human heart — that elevates the show from cunning stunt to artful meditation on the destructive nature of power and the redemptive power of love.”

In 2019, Red Bull Theater mounted a one-night-only concert performance at Symphony Space in New York, benefitting the theater&#x27;s upcoming productions. The production featured Tony Award nominees Steven Boyer, Robert Cuccioli, Patrick Page, Mary Testa, Kim Exum, Kevin R. Free, Jo Lampert, Amy Spanger, Charlotte Maltby, Jeffrey Eugene Johnson, Ben Jones and Salisha Thomas, with direction by Gabriel Barre and Music Direction by Greg Pliska. Astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson also made a special appearance.

<text>Holzminden () is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany, with the town of Holzminden as its administrative capital. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Hamelin-Pyrmont, Hildesheim and Northeim, and by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (districts of Höxter and Lippe).

==History==
The district was established in 1833 within the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. It was moved to the Prussian Province of Hanover as part of a territorial exchange in 1942. The last territorial modification was in 1974.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Weserbergland mountains, roughly between Hamelin and Göttingen. The Weser River forms the southwestern border of the district and runs through its northern parts.

==Coat of arms==
The lion is taken from the arms of the County of Everstein; the counts ruled over the region in the 14th century and were the founders of the City of Holzminden. The bar in the bottom is symbolising the Weser River.

<doc id="154820" wikidata="Q115215358" url="?curid=154820" title="List of princes of Wallachia">
<text>This is a list of princes of [[Wallachia]], from the first mention of a medieval polity situated between the Southern Carpathians and the Danube until the union with Moldavia in 1859, which led to the creation of Romania.

==Notes==
Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe, given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family. On principle, princes were chosen from any family branch, including a previous ruler&#x27;s bastard sons, being defined as &quot;os de domn&quot;, &quot;of Voivode marrow&quot;, or as having &quot;heregie&quot;, &quot;heredity&quot; (from the Latin &quot;hereditas&quot;); the institutions charged with the election, dominated by the boyars, had fluctuating degrees of influence. The system itself was challenged by usurpers, and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch, when rulers were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans; between 1821 and 1878 (the date of Romania&#x27;s independence), various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice. Wallachian rulers, like the Moldavian rulers, bore the titles of &quot;Voivode&quot; (&quot;duke&quot;) or/and Hospodar (&quot;lord, master&quot;); when writing in Romanian, the term Domn (from the Latin &quot;dominus&quot;) was used.

Most rulers did not use the form of the name they are cited with, and several used more than one form of their own name; in some cases, the ruler was only mentioned in foreign sources. The full names are either modern versions or ones based on mentions in various chronicles.

==List==
===Early rulers===
* Bezerenbam and Mișelav
* Seneslau
* John (knez)
* Farcaș
* Litovoi
* Bărbat
* Thocomerius

===House of Basarab===
From the early 15th-century the family was divided in two main branches:
:

=== House of Basarab, with interventions of Bogdan-Muşat and Movilești dynasties ===

=== Pre-Phanariote period ===

The Ottoman influence in the Wallachian rulers&#x27; election grows from the mid-17th century onward. From 1659, the rulers elected are mostly scions of Greek families, and increasingly less linked to the original Wallachian ruling family. The process reached its peak with the called Phanariote period (1715-1859), where, between the rulers, there was already no connection (or a very distant one) with the dynasty of Basarab.

====Various dynasties====

===Phanariotes (1715–1821)===

===Post-Phanariote period ===

<doc id="154823" wikidata="Q626503" url="?curid=154823" title="Swinging (sexual practice)">
<text>Swinging, earlier commonly known as wife-swapping, is a sexual activity in which both singles and partners in a committed relationship sexually engage with others for recreational purposes. Swinging is a form of non-monogamy. People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Practitioners cite an increased quality and quantity of sex. Some people may engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.
The term &quot;wife swapping&quot; was introduced by the media in the United States during the 1950s to describe this emerging phenomenon. Swinging, or its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the contraceptive pill, and the emergence of treatments for many of the sexually transmitted infections that were known at that time. The adoption of safe sex practices became more common in the late 1980s. It is also a recurring theme in pornography. 

The swingers community sometimes refers to itself as &quot;the lifestyle&quot;, or as &quot;the alternative lifestyle&quot;. 

==Description==
John Stossel produced an investigative news report into the swinging lifestyle. Stossel&#x27;s report in 2005 cited Terry Gould&#x27;s research, which concluded that &quot;couples swing in order to not cheat on their partners&quot;. When Stossel asked swinging couples whether they worry their spouse will &quot;find they like someone else better&quot;, one male replied, &quot;People in the swinging community swing for a reason. They don&#x27;t swing to go out and find a new wife&quot;, a woman asserted, &quot;It makes women more confident – that they are the ones in charge&quot;. Stossel interviewed 12 marriage counselors. According to Stossel, &quot;not one of them said don&#x27;t do it&quot;, though some said &quot;getting sexual thrills outside of marriage can threaten a marriage&quot;. Swingers whom Stossel interviewed said &quot;their marriages are stronger because they don&#x27;t have affairs and they don&#x27;t lie to each other&quot;.

Swinging can take place in a number of contexts, ranging from spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping or adding a third or more participants at an informal gathering of friends to planned regular social meetings to &quot;hooking up&quot; with like-minded people at a sex club (also known as a swinger club, not to be confused with a strip club). Different clubs offer varied facilities and atmospheres, and often hold &quot;theme&quot; nights.

Swinging is also known to take place in semi-public venues such as hotels, resorts, or cruise ships, or often in private homes. Furthermore, many websites that cater to swinging couples now exist, some having hundreds of thousands of members.

In 2018, a study of the prevalence of non-monogamous practices in the United States estimated that 2.35% of Americans currently self-identify as swingers and 4.76% had identified as swingers at some point in their lifetime.

== Effects ==

=== Relationship quality ===
Research on swinging has been conducted in the United States since the late 1960s. One 2000 study, based on an Internet questionnaire addressed to visitors of swinger-related sites, found swingers reported happiness is higher in their relationships than the norm-reported happiness.
Some believe sexual attraction is part of human nature and should be openly enjoyed by a committed or married couple. An analysis of multiple studies showed 37% of husbands and 29% of wives admitted at least one extramarital affair.

===Sexually-transmitted infections===
Swingers are exposed to the same types of risks as people who engage in casual sex, with the main concerns being the risk of pregnancy or contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Some swingers engage in unprotected sex, a practice known as barebacking, while others follow safe sex practices and will not engage with others who do not also practice safe sex. In most swingers&#x27; clubs, condoms are freely available and sometimes the club may require their use. Swingers may reduce the risk of STI by exchanging STI test results and serosorting. Proponents of swinging argue that safe sex is accepted within the swinging community and the risk of sexual disease is the same for them as for the general population – and that some populations of sexually non-monogamous people have clearly lower rates of STIs than the general population. Opponents are also concerned about the risk of pregnancy and STIs such as HIV, arguing that even protected sex is risky given that some STIs may be spread regardless of the use of condoms, such as Herpes and HPV. In a 1992 study, an overall 7% of swingers had quit swinging because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It was also stated that 62% of swingers changed their sex practices, by becoming more selective with partners or by practicing safe sex.

A Dutch study that compared the medical records of self-reported swingers to that of the general population found that STI prevalence was highest in young people, homosexual men, and swingers. However, this study has been criticized as not being representative of swinger populations as a whole: its data was formulated solely on patients receiving treatment at an STI clinic. In addition, according to the conclusions of the report, the STI rates of swingers were in fact nearly identical to those of non-swinging straight couples, and concluded that the safest demographic for STI infection were female prostitutes. According to the Dutch study, &quot;the combined rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea were just over 10% among straight people, 14% among gay men, just under 5% in female prostitutes, and 10.4% among swingers.&quot;

=== Pregnancy ===

While unwanted pregnancy is a risk with heterosexual vaginal sex in general, the possibility of impregnation by someone other than the committed-to partner adds a layer of concern, and may require prior discussion between the involved parties to establish consent about handling such a scenario.

==In North American society==
According to Terry Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Lifestyle: A look at the erotic rites of swingers&quot;, swinging began among American Air Force pilots and their wives during World War II before pilots left for overseas duty. The mortality rate of pilots was so high, as Gould reports, that a close bond arose between pilot families that implied that pilot husbands would care for all the wives as their own – emotionally and sexually – if the husbands were lost. The realities of the demographics and basing of US Army Air Force (USAAF) pilots and crew suggest that this arrangement did not evolve during WWII, instead evolving later. US military personnel in WWII were not accompanied by their families (and many, especially in the USAAF, were single) – the giant military bases where families live while accompanying a deployed soldier, sailor, aviator, or Marine are mostly Cold War creations. By the time the Korean War ended, swinging had spread from the military to the suburbs. This phenomenon was usually referred to as wife-swapping.

Later in the 1960s at the height of the &quot;Free Love&quot; movement, the activities associated with swinging became more widespread in a variety of social classes and age levels. In the 1970s, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Swinging &#x27;70s&quot;, swinging activities became more prevalent, but were still considered &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;fringe&quot; because of their association with non-mainstream groups such as communes.

In 2002, swingers&#x27; rights were added to the mission of the [American] National Coalition for Sexual Freedom.

A common myth claims that a &quot;key party&quot; is a form of swinger party, in which male partners place their car or house keys into a common bowl or bag on arriving, and at the end of the evening the female partners randomly select a set of keys from the bowl and are obligated to leave and have sex with its owner. However, numerous researchers have tried unsuccessfully to confirm a first-hand account of such a party, suggesting that they are nothing more than an urban legend.

According to economic studies on swinging, the information and communications technology revolution, together with improvements in medicine, has been effective in reducing some of the costs of swinging and hence in increasing the number of swingers.

== Swinger party/gathering ==
A swinger party or partner-swapping party is a gathering at which individuals or couples in a committed relationship can engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity.

Swinger parties may involve various group sex activities. Partners can engage in penetrative sex, known as &quot;full swap&quot;, or choose to &quot;soft swap&quot; in which they engage only in non-penetrative sex. New swinging couples often choose a soft swap before they are comfortable with a full swap, although many couples stay soft swap for personal reasons.

=== Soft swinging ===
&quot;Soft swinging&quot; refers to couple engaging in sexual activities with only each other while other couples perform sex acts in the immediate vicinity. Technically this is a form of sexual exhibitionism rather than &quot;group sex&quot; per se.

<doc id="154825" wikidata="Q1042900" url="?curid=154825" title="Technophobia">
<text>Technophobia (from Greek τέχνη &quot;technē&quot;, &quot;art, skill, craft&quot; and φόβος &quot;phobos&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;), also known as technofear, is the fear or dislike of, or discomfort with, advanced technology or complex devices, especially personal computers, smartphones, and tablet computers. Although there are numerous interpretations of technophobia, they become more complex as technology continues to evolve. The term is generally used in the sense of an irrational fear, but others contend fears are justified. It is the opposite of technophilia.

Larry Rosen, a research psychologist, computer educator, and professor at California State University, Dominguez Hills, suggests that there are three dominant subcategories of technophobes – the &quot;uncomfortable users&quot;, the &quot;cognitive computerphobes&quot;, and &quot;anxious computerphobes&quot;. First receiving widespread notice during the Industrial Revolution, technophobia has been observed to affect various societies and communities throughout the world. This has caused some groups to take stances against some modern technological developments in order to preserve their ideologies. In some of these cases, the new technologies conflict with established beliefs, such as the personal values of simplicity and modest lifestyles.

Examples of technophobic ideas can be found in multiple forms of art, ranging from literary works such as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; to films like &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Many of these works portray a darker side to technology, as perceived by those who are technophobic. As technologies become increasingly complex and difficult to understand, people are more likely to harbor anxieties relating to their use of modern technologies.

==Prevalence==
A study published in the journal &quot;Computers in Human Behavior&quot; was conducted between 1992 and 1994 surveying first-year college students across various countries. The overall percentage of the 3,392 students who responded with high-level technophobic fears was 29%. In comparison, Japan had 58% high-level technophobes and Mexico had 53%.

A published report in 2000 stated that roughly 85–90% of new employees at an organization may be uncomfortable with new technology, and are technophobic to some degree.

==History==
Technophobia began to gain attention as a movement in England with the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. With the development of new machines able to do the work of skilled craftsmen using unskilled, low-wage labor, those who worked a trade began to fear for their livelihoods. In 1675, a group of weavers destroyed machines that replaced their jobs. By 1727, the destruction had become so prevalent that Parliament made the demolition of machines a capital offense. This action, however, did not stop the tide of violence. The Luddites, a group of anti-technology workers, united under the name &quot;Ludd&quot; in March 1811, removing key components from knitting frames, raiding houses for supplies, and petitioning for trade rights while threatening greater violence. Poor harvests and food riots lent aid to their cause by creating a restless and agitated population for them to draw supporters from.

The 19th century was also the beginning of modern science, with the work of Louis Pasteur, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Michael Faraday, Henri Becquerel, and Marie Curie, and inventors such as Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. The world was changing rapidly, too rapidly for many, who feared the changes taking place and longed for a simpler time. The Romantic movement exemplified these feelings. Romantics tended to believe in imagination over reason, the &quot;organic&quot; over the mechanical, and a longing for a simpler, more pastoral time. Poets like William Wordsworth and William Blake believed that the technological changes that were taking place as a part of the industrial revolution were polluting their cherished view of nature as being perfect and pure.

After World War II, a fear of technology continued to grow, catalyzed by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. With nuclear proliferation and the Cold War, people began to wonder what would become of the world now that humanity had the power to manipulate it to the point of destruction. Corporate production of war technologies such as napalm, explosives, and gases during the Vietnam War further undermined public confidence in technology&#x27;s worth and purpose. In the post-WWII era, environmentalism also took off as a movement. The first international air pollution conference was held in 1955, and in the 1960s, investigations into the lead content of gasoline sparked outrage among environmentalists. In the 1980s, the depletion of the ozone layer and the threat of global warming began to be taken more seriously.

===Luddites===
Several societal groups are considered technophobic, the most recognisable of which are the Luddites. Many technophobic groups revolt against modern technology because of their beliefs that these technologies are threatening their ways of life and livelihoods. The Luddites were a social movement of British artisans in the 19th century who organized in opposition to technological advances in the textile industry. These advances replaced many skilled textile artisans with comparatively unskilled machine operators. The 19th century British Luddites rejected new technologies that impacted the structure of their established trades, or the general nature of the work itself.

Resistance to new technologies did not occur when the newly adopted technology aided the work process without making significant changes to it. The British Luddites protested the application of the machines, rather than the invention of the machine itself. They argued that their labor was a crucial part of the economy, and considered the skills they possessed to complete their labor as property that needed protection from the destruction caused by the autonomy of machines.

===Use of modern technologies among Old Order Anabaptists===

Groups considered by some people to be technophobic are the Amish and other Old Order Anabaptists. The Amish follow a set of moral codes outlined in the Ordnung, which rejects the use of certain forms of technology for personal use. Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner and Steven M. Nolt state in their book &quot;The Amish&quot;: 

What the Amish do, is selective use of modern technologies in order to maintain their belief and culture.

==Technophobia in arts==

An early example of technophobia in fiction and popular culture is Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. 

A 1960 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; called &quot;A Thing About Machines&quot; deals with a man&#x27;s hatred for modern things such as electric razors, televisions, electric typewriters and clocks.

Technophobia achieved commercial success in the 1980s with the movie &quot;The Terminator&quot;, in which a computer becomes self-aware, and decides to kill all humans. 

Shows such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have tackled the issue of technophobia – most specifically in the episode &quot;The Robots of Death&quot;, with a character displaying a great fear of robots due to their lack of body language, described by the Fourth Doctor as giving them the appearance of &quot;dead men walking&quot;. Series consultant Kit Pedler also used this fear as a basis for the inspiration of classic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; monsters the Cybermen, with the creatures being inspired by his own fear of artificial limbs becoming so common that it would become impossible to know when someone had stopped being a man and become simply a machine. &quot;Virtuosity&quot; speaks of a virtual serial killer who manages to escape to the real world. He goes on a rampage before he is inevitably stopped. This is a true technophobic movie in that its main plot is about technology gone wrong. It introduces a killer who blatantly destroys people.

&quot;Avatar&quot; is exemplary of technology&#x27;s hold on humans who are empowered by it and visually demonstrates the amount of terror it instills upon those native to the concept. It enforces the notion that foreign creatures from Pandora are not only frightened by technology, but it is something they loathe; its potential to cause destruction could exceed their very existence. In contrast, the film itself used advanced technology such as the stereoscope in order to give viewers the illusion of physically taking part in an experience that would introduce them to a civilization struggling with technophobia.

<doc id="154826" wikidata="Q1115728" url="?curid=154826" title="Committee for Skeptical Inquiry">
<text>The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), formerly known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), is a program within the U.S. non-profit organization Center for Inquiry (CFI), which seeks to &quot;promote scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims.&quot; Paul Kurtz proposed the establishment of CSICOP in 1976 as an independent non-profit organization (before merging with CFI as one of its programs in 2015), to counter what he regarded as an uncritical acceptance of, and support for, paranormal claims by both the media and society in general. Its philosophical position is one of scientific skepticism. CSI&#x27;s fellows have included notable scientists, Nobel laureates, philosophers, psychologists, educators, and authors. It is headquartered in Amherst, New York.

== History ==
The committee was officially launched on April 30, 1976, and was co-chaired by Paul Kurtz and Marcello Truzzi. In the early 1970s, scientific skeptics were concerned that interest in the paranormal was on the rise in the United States, part of a growing tide of irrationalism. In 1975, Kurtz, a secular humanist, initiated a statement, &quot;Objections to Astrology&quot;, which was co-written with Bart Bok and Lawrence E. Jerome, and endorsed by 186 scientists, including 19 Nobel laureates. The statement was published in the American Humanist Association (AHA)&#x27;s newsletter &quot;The Humanist&quot;, of which Kurtz was then editor. According to Kurtz, the statement was sent to every newspaper in the United States and Canada. It received a positive reaction, which encouraged Kurtz to invite skeptical researchers to a 1976 conference with the aim of establishing a new organization to critically examine a wide range of paranormal claims. Attendees included Martin Gardner, Ray Hyman, James Randi, and Marcello Truzzi, all members of the Resources for the Scientific Evaluation of the Paranormal (RSEP), a fledgling group with objectives similar to those CSI would subsequently adopt.

RSEP disbanded and its members, along with Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, B.F. Skinner, and Philip J. Klass, then joined Kurtz, Randi, Gardner, and Hyman to formally found the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). Kurtz, Randi, Gardner, and Hyman took seats on the executive board. CSICOP was officially launched at a specially convened conference of the AHA on April 30 and May 1, 1976.

According to the published correspondence between Gardner and Truzzi, disagreements over what CSICOP should show how volatile the beginnings of the organization were. Truzzi accused CSICOP of &quot;act[ing] more like lawyers&quot; taking on a position of dismissal before evaluating the claims, saying that CSICOP took a &quot;debunking stance&quot;. Gardner, on the other hand, &quot;opposed &#x27;believers&#x27; in the paranormal becoming CSICOP members&quot;, which Truzzi supported. Gardner felt that Truzzi &quot;conferred too much respectability to nonsense&quot;.

CSICOP was funded in part with donations and sales of their magazine, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;.

==Mission statement==

The formal mission statement, approved in 2006 and still current, states:The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry promotes science and scientific inquiry, critical thinking, science education, and the use of reason in examining important issues. It encourages the critical investigation of controversial or extraordinary claims from a responsible, scientific point of view and disseminates factual information about the results of such inquiries to the scientific community, the media, and the public.A shorter version of the mission statement appears in every issue: &quot;... promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims.&quot; A previous mission statement referred to &quot;investigation of paranormal and fringe-science claims&quot;, but the 2006 change recognized and ratified a wider purview for CSI and its magazine, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, that includes &quot;new science related issues at the intersection of science and public concerns, while not ignoring [their] core topics&quot;. A history of the first two decades is available in &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal&quot; published in 1998 by S.I. editor Kendrick Frazier. In 2018, Frazier reemphasized the importance of the committee&#x27;s work by saying that &quot;[w]e need independent, evidence-based, science-based critical investigation and inquiry now more than perhaps at any other time in our history.&quot;

===Name===
Paul Kurtz was inspired by the 1949 Belgian organization Comité Para, whose full name was &quot;Comité Belge pour l&#x27;Investigation Scientifique des Phénomènes Réputés Paranormaux&quot; (&quot;Belgian Committee for Scientific Investigation of Purported Paranormal Phenomena&quot;). In 1976, the proposed name was &quot;Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and Other Phenomena&quot; which was shortened to &quot;Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal&quot;. The initial acronym, &quot;CSICP&quot; was difficult to pronounce and so was changed to &quot;CSICOP&quot;. According to James Alcock, it was never intended to be &quot;Psi Cop&quot;, a nickname that some of the group&#x27;s detractors adopted.

In November 2006, CSICOP further shortened its name to &quot;Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&quot; (CSI), pronounced C-S-I. The reasons for the change were to create a name that was shorter, more &quot;media-friendly&quot;, to remove &quot;paranormal&quot; from the name, and to reflect more accurately the actual scope of the organization with its broader focus on critical thinking, science, and rationality in general, and because &quot;it includes the root words of our magazine&#x27;s title, the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;&quot;.

== Activities ==
In order to carry out its mission, the committee &quot;maintains a network of people interested in critically examining paranormal, fringe science, and other claims, and in contributing to consumer education; prepares bibliographies of published materials that carefully examine such claims;encourages research by objective and impartial inquiry in areas where it is needed; convenes conferences and meetings; publishes articles that examine claims of the paranormal; does not reject claims on &quot;a priori&quot; grounds, antecedent to inquiry, but examines them objectively and carefully&quot;.

=== Standard ===
An axiom often repeated among CSI members is the quote &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;, which Carl Sagan made famous and adapted from an earlier quote by Marcello Truzzi: &quot;An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof&quot;. (Truzzi in turn traced the idea back through the Principle of Laplace to the philosopher David Hume.)

According to CSI member Martin Gardner, CSI regularly puts into practice H. L. Mencken&#x27;s maxim &quot;one horse-laugh is worth a thousand syllogisms.&quot;

=== Publications ===

CSI publishes the magazine &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, which was founded by Truzzi, under the name &quot;The Zetetic&quot;. The journal was under Truzzi&#x27;s editorship for the first year, until August 1977. The magazine was retitled to &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; with Kendrick Frazier, former editor of &quot;Science News&quot;, serving as its editor. In June 2023, Stephen Hupp was named as the magazine&#x27;s editor. Hupp replaced Stuart Vyse, who was the interim editor in November 2022 following the passing of Kendrick Frazier. In 1987, Cecil Adams of The Straight Dope called &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s leading antifruitcake journals&quot;. In addition, CSI publishes &quot;Skeptical Briefs&quot;, a quarterly newsletter for associate members.

CSI conducts and publishes investigations into Bigfoot and UFO sightings, psychics, astrologers, alternative medicine, religious cults, and paranormal or pseudoscientific claims.

=== Conferences ===


CSICOP has held dozens of conferences between 1983 and 2005, two of them in Europe, and all six World Skeptics Congresses so far were sponsored by it. Since 2011, the conference is known as CSICon. Two conventions have been held in conjunction with its sister and parent organizations, CSH and CFI, in 2013 and 2015. The conferences bring together some of the most prominent figures in scientific research, science communication, and skeptical activism, to exchange information on all topics of common concern and to strengthen the movement and community of skeptics.

CSI has also supported local grassroot efforts, such as SkeptiCamp community-organized conferences.

=== Response to mass media ===
Many CSI activities are oriented toward the media. As CSI&#x27;s former executive director Lee Nisbet wrote in the 25th-anniversary issue of the group&#x27;s journal, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;:

As a media watchdog, CSI has &quot;mobilized thousands of scientists, academics and responsible communicators&quot; to criticize what it regards as &quot;media&#x27;s most blatant excesses&quot;. Criticism has focused on factual TV programming or newspaper articles offering support for paranormal claims, and programs such as &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which its members believe portray skeptics and science in a bad light and help to promote belief in the paranormal. CSI&#x27;s website currently lists the email addresses of over ninety U.S. media organizations and encourages visitors to &quot;directly influence&quot; the media by contacting &quot;the networks, the TV shows, and the editors responsible for the way [they portray] the world.&quot;

=== Following pseudoscientific and paranormal belief trends ===

CSI was quoted to consider pseudoscience topics to include yogic flying, therapeutic touch, astrology, fire walking, voodoo, magical thinking, Uri Geller, alternative medicine, channeling, psychic hotlines and detectives, near-death experiences, unidentified flying objects (UFOs), the Bermuda Triangle, homeopathy, faith healing, and reincarnation.
CSI changes its focus with the changing popularity and prominence of what it considers to be pseudoscientific and paranormal beliefs. For example, as promoters of intelligent design increased their efforts to include it in school curricula in recent years, CSI stepped up its attention to the subject, creating an &quot;Intelligent Design Watch&quot; website publishing numerous articles on evolution and intelligent design in &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; and on the Internet.

===CSI Chief Investigator===

In September 2022, Kenny Biddle was announced as CSI&#x27;s Chief Investigator. Biddle is a CSI Fellow and writes a column for Skeptical Inquirer called &quot;A Closer Look&quot; (2018–present), which focuses on his use of scientific skepticism to investigate paranormal claims, including ghost photography and video, ghost hunting equipment, UFOs and psychic ability. Biddle credits his previous careers as an auto mechanic, helicopter mechanic, and X-ray technician for building his skills in attention to detail, problem-solving, testing, and critical thinking. Biddle also has co-written articles with Joe Nickell about ghost and miraculous photography. Biddle was a speaker at CSICon in 2019 and 2022.

=== Health and safety ===
CSI is concerned with paranormal or pseudoscientific claims that may endanger people&#x27;s health or safety, such as the use of alternative medicine in place of science-based healthcare. Investigations by CSI and others, including consumer watchdog groups, law enforcement, and government regulatory agencies, have shown that the sale of alternative medicines, paranormal paraphernalia, or pseudoscience-based products can be enormously profitable. CSI says this profitability has provided various pro-paranormal groups large resources for advertising, lobbying efforts, and other forms of advocacy, to the detriment of public health and safety.

==Organization==

=== Umbrella organization ===
The Center for Inquiry is the transnational non-profit umbrella organization comprising CSI, the Council for Secular Humanism, the Center for Inquiry – On Campus (national youth group) and the Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health. These organizations share headquarters and some staff, and each has their own list of fellows and their distinct mandates. CSI generally addresses questions of religion only in cases in which testable scientific assertions have been made (such as weeping statues or faith healing). 

=== Independent Investigation Group ===

The Center for Inquiry West, located in Hollywood, California Executive Director Jim Underdown founded the Independent Investigations Group (IIG), a volunteer-based organization in January 2000. The IIG investigates fringe science, paranormal, and extraordinary claims from a rational, scientific viewpoint and disseminates factual information about such inquiries to the public. IIG has offered a $50,000 prize &quot;to anyone who can show, under proper observing conditions, evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event&quot;, to which 7 people applied from 2009 to 2012.

==Awards==

===In Praise of Reason Award===

&quot;The In Praise of Reason Award is given in recognition of distinguished contributions in the use of critical inquiry, scientific evidence, and reason in evaluating claims to knowledge.&quot; This is the highest award presented by CSI and is often presented at the CSIcon conferences.

===Candle Awards===

Founded at the 1996 World Skeptics Congress in Buffalo, New York, the Council for Media Integrity gives these awards that were named in inspiration by Carl Sagan&#x27;s book, &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;. The council is made up of scientists, media and academics, all concerned with the &quot;balanced portrayal of science&quot;. The &quot;Candle in the Dark Award&quot; is presented to those who show &quot;outstanding contributions to the public&#x27;s understanding of science and scientific principles&quot; and to &quot;reward sound science television programming&quot;. The &quot;Snuffed Candle Award&quot; is awarded to those &quot;for encouraging credulity, presenting pseudoscience as genuine, and contributing to the public&#x27;s lack of understanding of the methods of scientific inquiry.&quot; The council urges TV &quot;producers to label documentary-type shows depicting the paranormal as either entertainment or fiction&quot;. The council also provides the media with contact information of experts who would be willing and able to answer questions and be interviewed for paranormal topics.

=== Robert P. Balles Prize ===

CSI awards the Robert P. Balles Annual Prize in Critical Thinking annually. The $2,500 award is given to the &quot;creator of the published work that best exemplifies healthy skepticism, logical analysis, or empirical science&quot;. Robert P. Balles, &quot;a practicing Christian&quot;, established this permanent endowment fund through a Memorial Fund. Center for Inquiry&#x27;s &quot;established criteria for the prize include use of the most parsimonious theory to fit data or to explain apparently preternatural phenomena.&quot;


===Responsibility in Journalism Award===
CSICOP seeking to acknowledge and encourage &quot;fair and balanced reporting of paranormal claims&quot; established the Responsibility in Journalism Award in 1984. Frazier stated that &quot;There are many responsible reporters who want to do a good job in covering these kinds of controversial, exotic topics.&quot; Beginning in 1991, CSI began awarding in two categories, &quot;print&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot;.

===Frontiers of Science and Technology Award===
===Public Education in Science Award===
In recognition of distinguished contributions to the testing of scientific principles and to the public understanding of science.
===Distinguished Skeptic Award===
===Founder Award===
Presented to founder and chairman of CSICOP, Paul Kurtz &quot;In recognition of your wisdom, courage, and foresight in establishing and leading the world&#x27;s first public education organization devoted to distinguishing science from pseudoscience&quot;. Award was given April 26, 1986 at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

===The Martin Gardner Lifetime Achievement Award===
Awarded to author and entertainer Steve Allen at the First World Skeptic Congress held in Buffalo, New York, in 1996. Allen was recognized for his lifetime achievement &quot;in cultivating the public appreciation of critical thinking and science&quot;.

===Lifetime Achievement Award===
Presented to Eugenie Scott by Ronald Lindsay at the CFI Summit in Tacoma, Washington, in 2013 calling her a &quot;Champion of Evolution Education&quot;.

===The Isaac Asimov Award===
Established to acknowledge the contributions to humanity and science by Isaac Asimov. This award is given to those who has &quot;shown outstanding commitment and ability in communicating the achievements, methods, and issues of science to the public&quot;.

===The Pantheon of Skeptics===
In April 2011, the executive council of CSI created The Pantheon of Skeptics, a special roster honoring deceased fellows of the Committee who have made the most outstanding contributions to the causes of science and skepticism. This roster is part of an ongoing effort to provide a sense of history about the modern skeptical movement.

=== CSI fellows ===
According to the Jan/Feb 2021 &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; the role of a CSI fellow is to &quot;promote scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims. Fellows are elected for their distinguished contributions to science and skepticsim as well as their ability to provide practical advice and expertise on various issues and projects deemed important to the work of the Committee. Election as a fellow is based upon the following criteria, approved by the CSI Executive Council: 
* 1. Outstanding contribution to a scientific discipline, preferably, thought not restricted to, a field related to the skeptical movement
* 2. Outstanding contribution to the communication of science and/or critical thinking or
* 3. Outstanding contribution to the skeptical movement.
Fellows of CSI serve as ambassadors of science and skepticism and may be consulted on issues related to their area of expertise by the media or by the Committee. They may be asked to support statements issued by CSI and contribute commentary or articles to CSI outlets. ... Election to the position of fellow is a lifetime appointment. However, if in the opinion of the CSI Executive Council an individual&#x27;s behavior or scholarship renders that person unable to continue to qualify for the position of fellow under the criteria listed or to effectively fulfill the role of ambassador or science and skepticism, CSI may choose to remove them from the list of fellows.&quot;

== Controversy and criticism ==
CSI&#x27;s activities have garnered criticism from individuals or groups which have been the focus of the organization&#x27;s attention. Television celebrity and claimed psychic Uri Geller, for example, was formerly in open dispute with the organization, filing a number of unsuccessful lawsuits against them. Some criticism has also come from within the scientific community and at times from within CSI itself. Marcello Truzzi, one of CSICOP&#x27;s co-founders, left the organization after only a short time, arguing that many of those involved &quot;tend to block honest inquiry, in my opinion. Most of them are not agnostic toward claims of the paranormal; they are out to knock them. [...] When an experiment of the paranormal meets their requirements, then they move the goal posts.&quot; Truzzi coined the term &quot;pseudoskeptic&quot; to describe critics in whom he detected such an attitude.

=== Mars effect, 1975 ===
An early controversy concerned the so-called Mars effect: French statistician Michel Gauquelin&#x27;s claim that champion athletes are more likely to be born when the planet Mars is in certain positions in the sky. In late 1975, prior to the formal launch of CSICOP, astronomer Dennis Rawlins, along with Paul Kurtz, George Abell and Marvin Zelen (all subsequent members of CSICOP) began investigating the claim. Rawlins, a founding member of CSICOP at its launch in May 1976, resigned in early 1980 claiming that other CSICOP researchers had used incorrect statistics, faulty science, and outright falsification in an attempt to debunk Gauquelin&#x27;s claims. In an article for the pro-paranormal magazine &quot;Fate&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I am still skeptical of the occult beliefs CSICOP was created to debunk. But I have changed my mind about the integrity of some of those who make a career of opposing occultism.&quot; CSICOP&#x27;s Philip J. Klass responded by circulating an article to CSICOP members critical of Rawlins&#x27; arguments and motives; Klass&#x27;s unpublished response, refused publication by &quot;Fate&quot;, itself became the target for further criticism.

=== Church of Scientology, 1977 ===

In 1977, an FBI raid on the offices of the Church of Scientology uncovered a project to discredit CSICOP so that it and its publications would cease criticism of Dianetics and Scientology. This included forging a CIA memo and sending it to media sources, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, to spread rumors that CSICOP was a front group for the CIA. A letter from CSICOP founder Paul Kurtz was forged to discredit him in the eyes of parapsychology researchers.

=== Natasha Demkina, 2004 ===

In 2004, CSICOP was accused of scientific misconduct over its involvement in the Discovery Channel&#x27;s test of the &quot;girl with X-ray eyes&quot;, Natasha Demkina. In a self-published commentary, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Brian Josephson criticized the test and evaluation methods and argued that the results should have been deemed &quot;inconclusive&quot; rather than judged in the negative. Josephson, the director of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Mind–Matter Unification Project, questioned the researchers&#x27; motives, saying: &quot;On the face of it, it looks as if there was some kind of plot to discredit the teenage claimed psychic by setting up the conditions to make it likely that they could pass her off as a failure.&quot; Ray Hyman, one of the three researchers who designed and conducted the test, published a response to this and other criticisms. CSI&#x27;s Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health also published a detailed response to these and other objections, saying that the choice of critical level was appropriate, because her claims were unlikely to be true: I decided against setting the critical level at seven because this would require Natasha to be 100% accurate in our test. We wanted to give her some leeway. More important, setting the critical value at seven would make it difficult to detect a true effect. On the other hand, I did not want to set the critical value at four because this would be treating the hypothesis that she could see into people&#x27;s bodies as if it were highly plausible. The compromise was to set the value at five.

=== General criticism and reply ===

On a more general level, proponents of parapsychology have accused CSI of pseudoskepticism, and an overly dogmatic and arrogant approach based on &quot;a priori&quot; convictions. A 1992 article in &quot;The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research&quot;, an organ for the Parapsychological Association, suggests that CSI&#x27;s aggressive style of skepticism could discourage scientific research into the paranormal. Astronomer Carl Sagan wrote on this in 1995:

Have I ever heard a skeptic wax superior and contemptuous? Certainly. I&#x27;ve even sometimes heard, to my retrospective dismay, that unpleasant tone in my own voice. There are human imperfections on both sides of this issue. Even when it&#x27;s applied sensitively, scientific skepticism may come across as arrogant, dogmatic, heartless, and dismissive of the feelings and deeply held beliefs of others ... CSICOP &quot;is&quot; imperfect. In certain cases [criticism of CSICOP] is to some degree justified. But from my point of view CSICOP serves an important social function – as a well-known organization to which media can apply when they wish to hear the other side of the story, especially when some amazing claim of pseudoscience is judged newsworthy ... CSICOP represents a counterbalance, although not yet nearly a loud enough voice, to the pseudoscience gullibility that seems second nature to so much of the media.

<text>The Podkamennaya Tunguska (, literally &quot;Tunguska under the stones&quot;; , Ket: Ӄо’ль) also known as &quot;Middle Tunguska&quot; or &quot;Stony Tunguska&quot;, is a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia.

==History==
In 1908, an asteroid impacted near the river and later became known as the Tunguska event.

== Hydrology ==
The river&#x27;s nutrition is mainly snow (60%); rain and groundwater nutrition account for 16 and 24%, respectively. The flood lasts from the beginning of May to the end of June, in the lower reaches until the beginning of July. From July to October, there is a summer low, interrupted by a rise in the level to 5.5 m during floods, which can be from one to four per year. The average annual water consumption at the mouth is 1587.18 m3/s, during summer floods it reaches 35,000 m3/s. Ice phenomena have been occurring since mid-October, the autumn ice drift of 7-16 days is accompanied by the formation of ice jams.

The ice age is from the end of October to the middle of May. The ice drift lasts 5-7 days in the upper reaches and up to 10 days in the lower reaches, passes violently, with congestion the level rises by 29.7 m. Winter nutrition is weakened due to the location of the river basin in the permafrost zone and reaches the lowest values of 3-15 m3/s, the total winter runoff is 11% of the annual.

==In popular culture==
The river was the set location in the Call of Duty: Black Ops Escalation DLC map, &quot;Call of The Dead.&quot;

<doc id="154839" wikidata="Q127537" url="?curid=154839" title="Pro bono">
<text>&#x27; (), usually shortened to &#x27;, is a Latin phrase for professional work undertaken voluntarily and without payment. The term traditionally referred to provision of legal services by legal professionals for people who are unable to afford them. More recently, the term is used to describe specialist services provided by any professional free of charge to an individual or community.

==Law==

&quot;Pro bono&quot; legal counsel may assist an individual or group on a legal case by filing government applications or petitions. A judge may occasionally determine that the loser should compensate a winning &quot;pro bono&quot; counsel.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the number of registered NPO Service Grants, which coordinates team-type &quot;pro bono&quot; programs, has increased tenfold between 2010 and 2020, and has supported more than 1,000 projects. In addition, the introduction of &quot;pro bono&quot; is gaining attention as an opportunity to promote citizen participation in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and human resource development in companies, and to solve problems in community development in local governments. The current authorized NPO, Service Grant Japan, was one of the first to take notice of the possibilities of such &quot;pro bono&quot;, bring that know-how back to Japan, and start offering a &quot;pro bono&quot; program that matches the country. Since its launch in 2005, the number of people, organizations, and companies engaged in &quot;pro bono&quot; activities in Japan has steadily increased. At the same time, many organizations coordinating &quot;pro bono&quot; activities have been established in countries other than Japan. more have joined. As a member of this &quot;Global Pro Bono Network,&quot; the certified NPO Service Grant is actively participating in networking and collaboration with various parts of the world. The NPO has a volunteer base with over 7,500 registered professionals (&quot;pro bono&quot; workers), and successfully participate in more than 180 projects annually.

As in the United States, some bar associations in Japan set mandatory working hours for public interest activities, and are sometimes regarded as &quot;pro bono&quot; activities. Certified public accountants are also gaining recognition as a result of pioneering efforts by PwC Aarata LLC. Small and medium-sized enterprise management consultants are also active in a wide range of activities, such as traveling to Tohoku with lunch boxes and supporting the reconstruction of local businesses and shopping districts, mainly for Tohoku reconstruction support activities.

=== The Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, legal services offered without payment are known as pro deo.

===Philippines===
In late 1974, former Philippine Senator Jose W. Diokno was released from prison as a political detainee. He set out as a litigation lawyer to devise a means to combat the Marcos dictatorship and introduced the term &quot;developmental legal aid&quot;, which involved lawyers providing &quot;pro bono&quot; legal services but also providing allowances to their clients, who were normally the urban poor, informal settlers, farmers, and victims of Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos. Diokno set up the Free Legal Assistance Group or FLAG, which is the oldest human rights organization in the country. During martial law FLAG has handled most of the human rights cases against the military police and the administration. Eventually the concept of developmental legal aid has grown and fresh lawyers are required to conduct part-time free legal aid for a considerable amount of time, otherwise called the Community Legal Aid Service (CLAS) Rule. Many developmental legal services are provided by most law firms and NGOs in the Philippines.

===South Korea===
South Korean lawyers are required to complete at least 30 hours of &quot;pro bono&quot; work per year; however, the local bar associations can reduce this requirement to 20 hours per year. Those who have a good reason not to fulfill the requirement may pay to a &quot;pro bono&quot; fund ₩20,000–30,000 (US$17–26) per hour instead.

===United Kingdom===
Since 2003, many UK law firms and law schools have celebrated an annual Pro Bono Week, which encourages solicitors and barristers to offer &quot;pro bono&quot; services and increases general awareness of &quot;pro bono&quot; service. LawWorks (the operating name for the Solicitors Pro Bono Group) is a national charity that works with solicitors and law students, encouraging and supporting them in carrying out legal pro bono work. It also acts as a clearing house for &quot;pro bono&quot; casework. Individuals and community groups may apply to the charity for free legal advice and mediation, where they could not otherwise afford to pay and are not entitled to legal aid. Advocates for International Development, which exclusively brokers international &quot;pro bono&quot; contributing towards the Sustainable Development Goals, operates from a London base. Many barristers offer &quot;pro bono&quot; services as a direct response the Legal Aid cuts brought by LASPO 2012, from which they make no profit. The Bar Council has revealed that just under a quarter of the bar offer pro bono; this is 3,486 barristers. Additionally, in 2018, the Bar contributed almost 11,000 hours of &quot;pro bono&quot; work. In the United Kingdom, a collaboration between local intellectual property organizations called IP Pro Bono offers intellectual property advice and legal support for claimants and defendants in intellectual property disputes.

===United States===
Lawyers in the United States are recommended under American Bar Association (ABA) ethical rules to contribute at least 50 hours of &quot;pro bono&quot; service per year. Some state bar associations, however, may recommend fewer hours. Rule 6.1 of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct strongly encourages lawyers to aspire to provide at least 50 hours of &quot;pro bono&quot; service each year and quantifies the minimal financial contributions that lawyers should aspire to make to organizations providing legal services to the poor and underserved. In contrast, other states, such as Illinois, do not have recommended hours, yet require annual disclosure of voluntary &quot;pro bono&quot; hours and contributions made to &quot;pro bono&quot; organizations. The Chief Judge of New York has also instituted a requirement that applicants who plan to be admitted in 2015 and onward must complete 50 hours of &quot;pro bono&quot; service in order to qualify. All attorneys who register must report their voluntary &quot;pro bono&quot; hours or voluntary contributions.
The ABA has conducted four national surveys of &quot;pro bono&quot; service: one released in August 2005, the second in February 2009, the third in March 2013 and the fourth in April 2018.

The ABA Standing Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service and its project, the Center for Pro Bono, are a national source of information, resources and assistance to support, facilitate, and expand the delivery of &quot;pro bono&quot; legal help. The ABA Standing Committee also sponsors Pro Bono Week during the week of 23–29 October. The ABA Standing Committee on Legal Assistance for Military Personnel and Section of Litigation jointly sponsor the ABA Military Pro Bono Project, which delivers &quot;pro bono&quot; legal assistance to enlisted, active-duty military personnel.

In an October 2007 press conference reported in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the law student group Building a Better Legal Profession released its first annual ranking of top law firms by average billable hours, &quot;pro bono&quot; participation, and demographic diversity. The report found that most large firms fall short of their &quot;pro bono&quot; targets. The group has sent the information to top law schools around the country, encouraging students to take this data into account when choosing where to work after graduation.

&quot;The American Lawyer&quot; compiles, from among its 200 top-rated law firms, those that contributed the most &quot;pro bono&quot; hours of service during the previous calendar year, publishing the list annually. In the United States, the Patent Pro Bono Program is a nationwide network of independently operated regional programs that matches volunteer patent professionals with financially under-resourced inventors and small businesses for the purpose of securing patent protection.

== Architecture ==
Traditionally architects conduct altruistic work individually or as organisations such as Architecture Sans Frontières International or its various national alternatives or partners, assisting peace-making and reconstruction efforts after conflict or disaster, when much of the housing, hospital, educational, transport, civic and other infrastructure has been destroyed or damaged. More recently, &quot;pro bono&quot; work proper, as services provided to individuals or organisations free of charge directly by architects or architectural firms, is becoming increasingly common. Services are provided either independently or through emerging organisations.

The first national organisation for promotion and provisioning of &quot;pro bono&quot; architectural services, Architects Assist, was established in Australia in 2020, on the premise that &quot;like healthcare and legal representation, sustainable and resilient architecture is not a luxury. It is a condition of our future survival and a human right.&quot;

=== Australia ===
Architects Assist is a national organisation of Australian architects and other built environment professionals providing &quot;pro bono&quot; services to individuals or organisations affected by natural disasters, such as bushfires or floods, or other adverse circumstances. The organisation operates under the Australian Institute of Architects.

=== Czechia ===
Architekti Pro Bono is an initiative of Czech architects run by the Czech Chamber of Architects.

=== United States ===
The American Institute of Architects encourages its members to provide &quot;pro bono&quot; services as part their contributions to the aspirations of the profession and service to society.

==Other uses==

=== Media ===
Pro Bono Publico in Dublin was a free DVD magazine dedicated to Irish arts.

=== Corporate ===
Corporate &quot;pro bono&quot; efforts generally focus on building the capacity of local nonprofits or mentoring local businesses. There are many models that businesses use and tailor to their specific strengths. They may loan employees, provide coaching and mentoring, complete a service marathon, create standardized team projects, engage in open-ended outsourcing, provide sector-wise solutions, perform general contracting, or work on a signature issue.

=== In intellectual property ===
To help make services related to intellectual property (IP) more accessible, a number of organizations have created &quot;pro bono&quot; initiatives. These organizations offer support from legal professionals at no cost. The services usually cover the professional fees associated with the related services, but no official fees due to a cost to intellectual property offices.

Established in 2015, the Inventor Assistance Program helps inventors navigate the patent system in their own country and a number of other jurisdictions at no cost. Individual inventors and enterprise must be from a participating country and meet certain eligibility criteria. Applicants apply via the IAP Online Platform. Current participating countries include Colombia,  Chile, Ecuador, Morocco, Peru, the Philippines, and South Africa. The program is operated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In 2020, the WIPO GREEN reinstated their &quot;pro bono&quot; legal advice program.

The Inter-American Association of Intellectual Property offers &quot;pro bono&quot; services related to intellectual property. Services include applications for copyright, patent, and trademarks, academic training, advice on IP related contracts, and IP related disputes.

The International Trademark Association matches eligible clients facing trademark issues with member attorneys who volunteer to provide services free of charge. The program initially accepted applications in the United States and Latin America and later expanded globally.

The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) offers free personalized IP support to small businesses for EU based SMEs. The work is not limited to a specific field of IP but covers virtually all IP aspects and services, including help in filing patents, trade marks, design applications, copyright, plant varieties, geographical indications, trade secrets and domain names, as well as licensing, enforcement, franchising, tech transfer of IP rights or any &quot;other IP matters and disputes&quot;.

<doc id="154847" wikidata="Q733897" url="?curid=154847" title="Old Babylonian Empire">
<text>The Old Babylonian Empire, or First Babylonian Empire, is dated to , and comes after the end of Sumerian power with the destruction of the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the subsequent Isin-Larsa period. The chronology of the first dynasty of Babylonia is debated; there is a Babylonian King List A and also a Babylonian King List B, with generally longer regnal lengths. In this chronology, the regnal years of List A are used due to their wide usage.

==Hardship of searching for origins of the First Dynasty==

The origins of the First Babylonian dynasty are hard to pinpoint because Babylon itself yields few archaeological materials intact due to a high water table. The evidence that survived throughout the years includes written records such as royal and votive inscriptions, literary texts, and lists of year-names. The minimal amount of evidence in economic and legal documents makes it difficult to illustrate the economic and social history of the First Babylonian Dynasty, but with historical events portrayed in literature and the existence of year-name lists, it is possible to establish a chronology.

==First kings of the dynasty==

With little evidence on hand, there is not much known about the reigns of the kings from Sumuabum through Sin-muballit — other than the fact they were Amorites rather than Akkadians. What is known, however, is that they did not add much to the size of the territory. When the Amorite king Hammurabi came into power, his military victories were successful in gaining more land for the Empire. However, Babylon was just one of the several important powers among Isin and Larsa.

The accomplishments of the first known king of the Dynasty, Sumuabum, include his efforts in expanding Babylonian territory by conquering Dilbat and Kish. His successor, Sumualailum, was able to complete the wall around Babylon that Sumuabum had begun constructing. Sumualailum was also able to defeat rebellions in Kish and became successful in the destruction of Kazallu, and even had brief control over Nippur (though it did not last).

There is little information available about the reigns of Sabium, Apil-Sin and Sin-muballit, other than that they continued ruling the conquered territory, as well as strengthening the walls and began building canals. However, Sin-muballit is known for his successful defeats of Rim-Sin I, which protected Babylon from further invasion. Sin-muballit would then pass on the role of king to his son, Hammurabi.

==King Hammurabi==


Hammurabi is also at times referred to as &quot;Hammurapi&quot; in ancient texts, including multiple primary-source Babylonian letters. This is a common phenomenon in Amorite names. (Another Amorite of the era, &quot;Dipilirabi&quot;, is also known as &quot;Dipilirapi&quot;.).

The Code of Hammurabi — one of the oldest written laws in history, and one of the most famous ancient texts from the Near East, and among the best known artifacts of the ancient world — is from the first Babylonian dynasty. The code is written in cuneiform on a 2.25 meter (7 foot 4½ inch) diorite stele. At the top, it portrays the Babylonian king receiving his kingship from the sun god Shamash; on the bottom is the collection of written laws. The text itself explains how Hammurabi came to power and created a set of laws to ensure justice throughout his territory — emphasizing that these are the divine roles that were given to him.

Before presenting the laws written in the Code, Hammurabi states, &quot;When the god Marduk commanded me to provide just ways for the people of the land (in order to attain) appropriate behavior, I established truth and justice as the declaration of the land, I enhanced the well-being of the people.&quot; It then goes on to detail the laws of just punishment for crimes and provide rules for his people to abide by.

King Hammurabi ruled Babylon from 1792 to 1750 BC. When he first came to power, the empire only consisted of a few towns in the area near Babylon: Dilbat, Sippar, Kish, and Borsippa. By 1762 BC, Hammurabi managed to succeed in capturing the formidable power of Eshnunna, inheriting its well-established trade routes and the economic stability that came along with them. It was not long before Hammurabi&#x27;s armies took Assyria and parts of the Zagros Mountains. Eventually in 1761 BC, Babylon gained control over Mari, making up virtually all the territory of Mesopotamia that had been under the Third Dynasty of Ur.

During Hammurabi&#x27;s thirtieth year as king, he conquered Larsa from Rim-Sin I, thus, gaining control over the lucrative urban centers of Nippur, Ur, Uruk, and Isin. Hammurabi was one of the most notable kings of the first Babylonian dynasty because of his success in gaining control over Southern Mesopotamia and establishing Babylon as the center of his Empire. Babylon would then come to dominate Mesopotamia for over a thousand years.

Zimri-Lim, king of the nearby polity of Mari, plays a significant role for modern historians. He contributed immense amounts of historical writing that describe the history and diplomacy of the first Babylonian dynasty during Hammurabi&#x27;s reign. The archives of Hammurabi at the site of Babylon cannot be recovered, since its remains are under the local water table, and have practically turned to mud. But Zimri-Lim&#x27;s palace at Mari held an archive that included letters and other texts that provide insight into the alliance between the king and Hammurabi, as well as other leaders in the Syro-Mesopotamian region. These documents survived because Hammurabi had burned the palace down — which buried the material, thus preserving it. War was a common occurrence for the kingdoms in Syria and Mesopotamia, so the majority of the documents from that era were in regard to military affairs. The documents included letters written by the messengers of the kings, discussing conflicts, divine oaths, agreements, and treaties between the powers.

==Hammurabi&#x27;s successors==

There is also little that is known about the kings who succeeded Hammurabi. The kings from Samsuiluna to Samsuditana have very few records of the occurrences during their reigns. However, we do know that Samsuiluna was successful in beating Rim-Sîn II, but nevertheless lost major parts of Babylon&#x27;s conquered land — only having real authority over the core of the Babylonian territory left from Hammurabi&#x27;s reign. The kings who succeeded Samsuiluna would face similar turmoil.

The first Babylonian dynasty eventually came to an end as the Empire lost territory and money, and faced great degradation. The attacks from Hittites who were trying to expand outside of Anatolia eventually led to the destruction of Babylon. The Kassite Period then followed the First Babylonian Dynasty, ruling from 1570 to 1154 BC. By the time of Babylon&#x27;s fall the Kassites had already been part of the region for a century and a half, acting sometimes with Babylon&#x27;s interests and sometimes against.

==The sun and astronomy in Babylonian history==

The sun played a role in the royal power of old Babylonia. Shamash was the god of the sun, of justice, and of divination, as was mentioned in the Code of Hammurabi. The text states, &quot;May the god Shamash, the great judge of heaven and Earth, who provides just ways for all living creatures, the lord, my trust, overturn his kingship.&quot; Shamash was considered to have an influence on Hammurabi, and represented the concept that he will execute the laws of justice on land just as Shamash does in his role as a god.

A recent translation of the Chogha Gavaneh tablets from modern-day Iran, which date back to 1800 BC, indicates close contacts between Babylon and the town at the site of present-day Chogha Gavaneh, which is located in the intermontane valley of modern Islamabad in Iran&#x27;s central Zagros and Dyala region.

A text about the fall of Babylon by the Hittites under Mursilis I (at the end of Samsuditana&#x27;s reign over Babylon) tells a story about a twin eclipse — which is crucial for a correct Babylonian chronology. The pair of lunar and solar eclipses occurred in the month of Shimanu (Sivan). The lunar eclipse took place on February 9, 1659 BC. It started at 4:43 a.m. and ended at 6:47 a.m. The latter was invisible, which satisfies the record, and which also tells that the moon was still in eclipse. The solar eclipse occurred on February 23, 1659 BC. It started at 10:26 a.m., has its maximum at 11:45 a.m., and ended at 1:04 p.m.

The Venus tablets of Ammisaduqa (i.e., several ancient versions on clay tablets) are also well-known, and several books had been published about them. Several dates have been offered for their events, but the dates of many older sourcebooks seem to be outdated and incorrect. There are further difficulties: the 21-year span of the detailed observations of the planet Venus may or may not coincide with the reign of this king, because his name is not mentioned, only the Year of the Golden Throne.

A few sources, some printed almost a century ago, claim that the original text mentions an occultation of Venus by the moon. However, this may be a misinterpretation. Modern calculations support the year of 1659 BC for the fall of Babylon, based on the statistical probability of the planet&#x27;s observations. The presently-accepted middle chronology is too low from the astronomical point of view.

<text>The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) were two rounds of bilateral conferences and corresponding international treaties involving the United States and the Soviet Union. The Cold War superpowers dealt with arms control in two rounds of talks and agreements: SALT I and SALT II.

Negotiations commenced in Helsinki, in November 1969. SALT I led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an interim agreement between the two countries.

Although SALT II resulted in an agreement in 1979 in Vienna, the US Senate chose not to ratify the treaty in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which took place later that year. The Supreme Soviet did not ratify it either. The agreement expired on December 31, 1985, and was not renewed, although both sides continued to respect it.

The talks led to the STARTs, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties, which consisted of START I, a 1991 completed agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, and START II, a 1993 agreement between the United States and Russia which never entered into effect, both of which proposed limits on multiple-warhead capacities and other restrictions on each side&#x27;s number of nuclear weapons. A successor to START I, New START, was proposed and was eventually ratified in February 2011.

==SALT I Treaty==
SALT I is the common name for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks Agreement signed on May 26, 1972. SALT I froze the number of strategic ballistic missile launchers at existing levels and provided for the addition of new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launchers only after the same number of older intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and SLBM launchers had been dismantled. SALT I also limited land-based ICBMs that were in range from the northeastern border of the Continental United States to the northwestern border of the continental Soviet Union. In addition, SALT I limited the number of SLBM capable submarines that NATO and the United States could operate to 50 with a maximum of 800 SLBM launchers between them. If the United States or NATO were to increase that number, the Soviets could respond with increasing their arsenal by the same amount.

The strategic nuclear forces of the Soviet Union and the United States were changing in character in 1968. The total number of missiles held by the United States had been static since 1967 at 1,054 ICBMs and 656 SLBMs but there was an increasing number of missiles with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads being deployed. MIRVs carried multiple nuclear warheads, often with dummies, to confuse ABM systems, making MIRV defense by ABM systems increasingly difficult and expensive. Both sides were also permitted to increase their number of SLBM forces but only if they disassembled an equivalent number of older ICBMs or SLBM launchers on older submarines.

One of the terms of the treaty required both countries to limit the number of deployment sites protected by an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system to one each. The idea of that system was to prevent a competition in ABM deployment between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had deployed such a system around Moscow in 1966, and the United States announced an ABM program to protect twelve ICBM sites in 1967. After 1968, the Soviets tested a system for the SS-9 missile, otherwise known as the R-36 missile. A modified two-tier Moscow ABM system is still used. The United States built only one ABM site to protect a Minuteman base in North Dakota where the &quot;Safeguard&quot; Program was deployed. That base was increasingly more vulnerable to attacks by the Soviet ICBMs because of the advancement in Soviet missile technology.

Negotiations lasted from November 17, 1969, to May 26, 1972, in a series of meetings beginning in Helsinki, with the American delegation headed by Gerard C. Smith, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Subsequent sessions alternated between Vienna and Helsinki. McNamara played a significant role with working to reduce the arms race between the U.S. and Soviet Union. There were two distinct ways in which he worked to govern the nuclear threat. First, he thought the need to avoid the deployment of an ABM system from both countries. To do this, the second thing he believed was the only way to limit the tension was to have many negotiations and discussion about deterrence, holding each other responsible for keeping peace through full communication. One problem that he ran into was that limitation strategies weren&#x27;t working and open to full of critiques, and the U.S. alongside Soviet continued to make new ballistic missiles. The US nuclear arsenals was far too large at that point in history to even pose for arms limitation at that point. After a long deadlock, the first results of SALT I came in May 1971, when an agreement was reached over ABM systems. Further discussion brought the negotiations to an end in Moscow in 1972, when U.S. President Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed both the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the &quot;Interim Agreement Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Certain Measures With Respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms&quot;. 

The two sides also agreed to a number of basic principles regarding appropriate conduct. Each recognized the sovereignty of the other; agreed to the principle of noninterference; and sought to promote economic, scientific, and cultural ties of mutual benefit and enrichment.

Nixon was proud that his diplomatic skills made him achieve an agreement that his predecessors had been unable to reach. Nixon and Kissinger planned to link arms control to détente and to the resolution of other urgent problems through what Nixon called &quot;linkage&quot;. David Tal argues:

The linkage between strategic arms limitations and outstanding issues such as the Middle East, Berlin and, foremost, Vietnam thus became central to Nixon&#x27;s and Kissinger&#x27;s policy of détente. Through employment of linkage, they hoped to change the nature and course of U.S. foreign policy, including U.S. nuclear disarmament and arms control policy, and to separate them from those practiced by Nixon’s predecessors. They also intended, through linkage, to make U.S. arms control policy part of détente. [...] His policy of linkage had in fact failed. It failed mainly because it was based on flawed assumptions and false premises, the foremost of which was that the Soviet Union wanted strategic arms limitation agreement much more than the United States did.

The agreement paved the way for further discussion regarding international cooperation and a limitation of nuclear armaments, as seen through both the SALT II Treaty and the Washington Summit of 1973.

==SALT II Treaty==

SALT II was a series of talks between American and Soviet negotiators from 1972 to 1979 that sought to curtail the manufacture of strategic nuclear weapons. It was a continuation of the SALT I talks and was led by representatives from both countries. It was the first nuclear arms treaty to assume real reductions in strategic forces to 2,250 of all categories of delivery vehicles on both sides.

The SALT II Treaty banned new missile programs, defined as those with any key parameter 5% better than in currently-employed missiles. That forced both sides to limit their new strategic missile types development and construction, such as the development of additional fixed ICBM launchers. Likewise, the agreement would limit the number of MIRVed ballistic missiles and long range missiles to 1,320. However, the United States preserved its most essential programs like the Trident missile, along with the cruise missiles President Jimmy Carter wished to use as his main defensive weapon as they were too slow to have first strike capability. In return, the Soviets could exclusively retain 308 of its so-called &quot;heavy ICBM&quot; launchers of the SS-18 type.

A major breakthrough for the agreement occurred at the Vladivostok Summit Meeting in November 1974, when President Gerald Ford and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev came to an agreement on the basic framework for the SALT II agreement. The elements of the agreement were stated to be in effect until 1985.

An agreement to limit strategic launchers was reached in Vienna on June 18, 1979, and was signed by Brezhnev and Carter at a ceremony held in the Redoutensaal of the Hofburg Palace.

Six months after the signing, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and in September, the United States discovered that a Soviet combat brigade was stationed in Cuba. Although Carter claimed that the Soviet brigade had been deployed to Cuba only recently, the unit had been stationed on the island since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. In light of those developments, Carter withdrew the treaty from consideration in January 1980, and the US Senate never consented to ratification although terms were honored by both sides until 1986.

SALT II was superseded by START I in 1991.

<text>Reentrancy is a programming concept where a function or subroutine can be interrupted and then resumed before it finishes executing. This means that the function can be called again before it completes its previous execution. Reentrant code is designed to be safe and predictable when multiple instances of the same function are called simultaneously or in quick succession. A computer program or subroutine is called reentrant if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently on multiple processors, or if on a single-processor system its execution can be interrupted and a new execution of it can be safely started (it can be &quot;re-entered&quot;). The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an interrupt or signal, unlike recursion where new invocations can only be caused by internal call. 

This definition originates from multiprogramming environments, where multiple processes may be active concurrently and where the flow of control could be interrupted by an interrupt and transferred to an interrupt service routine (ISR) or &quot;handler&quot; subroutine. Any subroutine used by the handler that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Similarly, code shared by two processors accessing shared data should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system kernel are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.

Reentrancy is neither necessary nor sufficient for thread-safety in multi-threaded environments. In other words, a reentrant subroutine can be thread-safe, but . Conversely, thread-safe code need not be reentrant (see below for examples).

Other terms used for reentrant programs include &quot;sharable code&quot;. Reentrant subroutines are sometimes marked in reference material as being &quot;signal safe&quot;. Reentrant programs are often &quot;pure procedures&quot;.

==Background==
Reentrancy is not the same thing as idempotence, in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.

Data has a characteristic called scope, which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either global (outside the scope of any function and with an indefinite extent) or local (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).

Local data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in the form of global variables (data shared between all functions), or as static variables (data shared by all invocations of the same function). In object-oriented programming, global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of instance variables, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).

Reentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, thread-safety. A function can be thread-safe and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a mutex (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only &quot;one&quot; thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.

==Rules for reentrancy==
;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data without synchronization.
:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that, except in sections of code that are synchronized, only atomic read-modify-write instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes. The C standard and SUSv3 provide codice_1 for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing. More complex atomic operations are available in C11, which provides codice_2.
;Reentrant code may not modify itself without synchronization.
:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., blitting graphics quickly) but this generally requires synchronization to avoid problems with reentrancy.It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).
;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant computer programs or routines without synchronization.
:Multiple levels of user, object, or process priority or multiprocessing usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.

Reentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the atomicity of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function in an expression like codice_3, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in C, because the expression has no sequence point.) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for signals, such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for interrupts, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.

==Examples==
To illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a C utility function, , that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.

===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===
This is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. Since the codice_4 variable is globally shared, without synchronization, among any concurrent instances of the function, one instance may interfere with the data relied upon by another. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine codice_5:
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
 tmp = *x;
 *x = *y;
 /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
 *y = tmp; 

void isr()
 int x = 1, y = 2;
 swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);


===Thread-safe but not reentrant===
The function in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making thread-local. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if is called in the same context as a thread already executing :
_Thread_local int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
 tmp = *x;
 *x = *y;
 /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
 *y = tmp; 

void isr()
 int x = 1, y = 2;
 swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);


===Reentrant and thread-safe===
An implementation of that allocates on the stack instead of globally and that is called only with unshared variables as parameters is both thread-safe and reentrant. Thread-safe because the stack is local to a thread and a function acting just on local data will always produce the expected result. There is no access to shared data therefore no data race.
void swap(int* x, int* y)
 int tmp;
 tmp = *x;
 *x = *y;
 *y = tmp; /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */

void isr()
 int x = 1, y = 2;
 swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);


==Reentrant interrupt handler==
A reentrant interrupt handler is an interrupt handler that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce interrupt latency. In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.

==Further examples==
In the following code, neither codice_6 nor codice_7 functions is reentrant.
int v = 1;

int f()
 v += 2;
 return v;

int g()
 return f() + 2;


In the above, depends on a non-constant global variable ; thus, if is interrupted during execution by an ISR which modifies , then reentry into will return the wrong value of . The value of and, therefore, the return value of , cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on whether an interrupt modified during &#x27;s execution. Hence, is not reentrant. Neither is , because it calls , which is not reentrant.

These slightly altered versions &quot;are&quot; reentrant:
int f(int i)
 return i + 2;

int g(int i)
 return f(i) + 2;


In the following, the function is thread-safe, but not (necessarily) reentrant:
int function()
 mutex_lock();
 // function body

 mutex_unlock();


In the above, can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.

<doc id="154857" wikidata="Q1338802" url="?curid=154857" title="Emmitt Smith">
<text>Emmitt James Smith III (born May 15, 1969) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons, 13 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys and 2 seasons with the Arizona Cardinals. Among other accolades, he is the league&#x27;s all-time leading rusher.

Smith grew up in Pensacola, Florida, and became the second-leading rusher in American high school football history while playing for Escambia High School. Smith played three years of college football for the Florida Gators, where he set numerous school rushing records. After being named a unanimous All-American in 1989, Smith chose to forgo his senior year of eligibility and play professionally.

The Cowboys selected Smith in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft with the 17th overall pick. During his long professional career, he rushed for 18,355 yards, breaking the record formerly held by Walter Payton. He also holds the record for career rushing touchdowns with 164. Smith is the only running back to ever win a Super Bowl championship, the NFL Most Valuable Player award, the NFL rushing crown, and the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award all in the same season (1993). He is also one of four running backs to lead the NFL in rushing three or more consecutive seasons, joining Steve Van Buren, Jim Brown, and Earl Campbell. Smith led the league in rushing and won the Super Bowl in the same year three times (1992, 1993, and 1995) when to that point it had never been done. Smith is also one of only two non-kickers in NFL history to score more than 1,000 career points (the other being Jerry Rice). Smith was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

Smith played 13 seasons with the Cowboys and two with the Arizona Cardinals. While playing for Dallas, Smith plus quarterback Troy Aikman and wide receiver Michael Irvin were known as &quot;The Triplets,&quot; and led their team to three Super Bowl wins during the 1990s.

==Early life==

Smith was born in Pensacola, Florida, the son of Mary J. Smith and Emmitt James Smith Jr. At the age of eight, he played his first organized football game on a team that was sponsored by the Salvation Army. He attended Escambia High School in Pensacola, where he played high school football and ran track for the Escambia Gators. During Smith&#x27;s high school football career, Escambia won two state football championships, and Smith rushed for 106 touchdowns and 8,804 yards, which was the second most yardage in the history of American high school football at the time. Emmitt rushed for over 100 yards in 45 of the 49 games he started for Escambia (including the last 28 in a row) and finished with a 7.8 yards per carry average. Twice, he broke the 2,000-yard rushing mark in a season. In track &amp; field, Smith competed as a sprinter and was a member of the 4 × 100 m (42.16 s) relay squad.

For his efforts, Smith was named the 1986 national high school player of the year by several publications and organizations, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Parade Magazine&quot;, and Gatorade. In 2007, twenty years after Smith graduated from high school, the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) named Smith to its All-Century Team and recognized him as the Florida high school football &quot;Player of the Century.&quot;

Despite his accomplishments and accolades, some college recruiting analysts opined that he was too small and slow to succeed in major college football when he signed to play for the University of Florida. Recruiting expert Max Emfinger didn&#x27;t list Smith among the top 50 high school running backs in his high school class and opined that, &quot;Emmitt Smith is a lugger, not a runner. He&#x27;s not fast. He can&#x27;t get around the corner. When he falls flat on his face, remember where you heard it first.&quot;

==College career==

=== 1987 season ===
Smith accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he played for coach Galen Hall&#x27;s Gators for three seasons He did not start the first two games of his college career in the fall of 1987, but made the most of his opportunities in a second-week rout of Tulsa in which he gained 109 yards on just ten carries, including a 66-yard touchdown run. That performance earned him a spot in the starting lineup the following week in the Gators&#x27; SEC opener against Alabama at Legion Field.

In his first collegiate start, Smith promptly broke Florida&#x27;s 57-year-old all-time single game rushing record held by Red Bethea, carrying 39 times for 224 yards and two touchdowns as the Gators upset the Crimson Tide. Smith went on to break the 1,000-yard barrier in the seventh game of his freshman season, the fastest any running back had ever broken that barrier to begin his college career. He finished the season with 1,341 yards, was named SEC and National Freshman of the Year, and was ninth in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy.

=== 1988 season ===
The Gators got off to a 5–0 start in 1988 with Smith averaging over 120 rushing yards per game. However, during the sixth contest against Memphis State in mid-October, he was sidelined with a sprained knee while starting quarterback Kyle Morris broke his finger, leading to an upset loss. Smith was unable to return to action for a month, during which Florida lost four games in a row and did not score a touchdown in 14 consecutive quarters of play, including a 16–0 loss to Auburn that is their most recent shutout to date.

Smith returned to the lineup in mid-November and Florida won two of its final three games, highlighted by a victory in the 1988 All-American Bowl in which he ran 55-yards for a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage and was named the game&#x27;s MVP. Smith rushed for 988 yards on the year (not including the bowl game) at 110 yards per game, the lowest totals of his college career.

=== 1989 season ===
Smith stayed healthy throughout his junior season in 1989 and found success again. He finished the campaign with Florida records for rushing yards in a season (1,599), rushing yards in a single game (316 versus New Mexico in October 1989), longest rushing play (96 yards against Mississippi State in 1988), career rushing yards (3,928), career rushing yards per game (126.7), and career rushing touchdowns (36), among many others. In all, Smith owned 58 school records at the conclusion of his Florida career despite playing on Florida teams with virtually no passing game, which made him the focal point of opposing defenses.

At the conclusion of his junior season in 1989, Smith was named a first-team SEC selection for the third year and SEC Player of the Year, was a unanimous first-team All-American, and finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy balloting. In his final game in the Freedom Bowl, he had few rushing attempts after Florida fell behind Washington early and were forced to throw.

Days later on January 1, 1990, Steve Spurrier was introduced as the Gators&#x27; new head coach. Smith, concerned about his potential role in Spurrier&#x27;s reportedly pass-first offense, decided to forgo his senior year at Florida and enter the NFL draft, which for the first time in history allowed juniors to be eligible. Smith returned to the university during the NFL off-season and completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1996.

Smith was subsequently inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 1999, the Gator Football Ring of Honor and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006. As part of a series of articles written for &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; in 2006, he was recognized as the No. 3 all-time player among the top 100 from the first 100 years of the Gators football program.

==Professional career==

===Dallas Cowboys (1990–2002)===

In the 1990 NFL draft, the Dallas Cowboys considered drafting linebacker James Francis with their first round selection, but after he was taken by the Cincinnati Bengals, the Cowboys focused on improving their running game when Smith started dropping, because despite his collegiate success, some NFL teams still felt that Smith was too small and slow for the pro game. The Cowboys traded up with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving from the 21st to the 17th pick, in exchange for a third round draft choice (#81-Craig Veasey), to select Smith in the first round. Even though he missed all of the preseason after having the longest holdout by a rookie in franchise history, he was able to start 15 games and rush for 937 yards and 11 touchdowns, while being named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and receiving Pro Bowl honors.
In 1991, he had 1,563 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. He also clinched the first of four rushing titles, after tallying 160 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the season finale.
In 1992, he set the Cowboys&#x27; single-season franchise record and won the rushing title with 1,713 yards. He also became the first player to win the league&#x27;s rushing title and the Super Bowl in the same season.

In 1993, he missed all of training camp and the first 2 regular season games. The Cowboys lost both contests with rookie Derrick Lassic running in his place. With the season in jeopardy the Cowboys relented and reached an agreement, making Smith the highest paid running back in the league. Smith had 1,486 rushing yards, 9 touchdowns, and helped the Cowboys become the first team to win a Super Bowl after starting the season 0–2. He also received the league MVP and the Super Bowl XXVIII MVP award. On October 31, his 237 rushing yards against the Philadelphia Eagles set the single-season franchise record. His career signature game came in the season finale against the New York Giants, with the Cowboys desperately trying to clinch the NFC East title and a first-round bye in the playoffs, Smith suffered a first-degree separation in his right shoulder during the first half, but still finished with 229 total yards and played a key role in a 16–13 overtime win.

The 1994 season saw Smith led the league with 21 rushing touchdowns, a new career-high despite battling a hamstring pull late in the season. However, the Cowboys lost the NFC Championship Game to the San Francisco 49ers.

In 1995, Smith became the first player in league history to rush for 1,400 rushing yards or more in five consecutive seasons and set the NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns. Smith, Adrian Peterson, and LaDainian Tomlinson are the only players with seven straight ten-touchdown seasons to start their careers. He also broke two of Tony Dorsett&#x27;s Dallas franchise rushing records, the first for most consecutive initial games of a season with 100+ rushing yards (Smith&#x27;s four to Dorsett&#x27;s three) and the second for single-season rushing yards (1,773 to Dorsett&#x27;s 1,646). Both records would hold for 19 years until 2014, when DeMarco Murray rushed for 100+ yards in each of his first eight games and accumulated 1,845 rushing yards over the course of the season.

In 1996, he scored his 100th career rushing touchdown and surpassed 10,000 career rushing yards, becoming just the twelfth player in league history and the youngest one to reach this milestone.

In 1998, he became the Cowboys&#x27; all-time leading rusher (passing Dorsett) and the NFL&#x27;s all-time rushing touchdown leader (surpassing Marcus Allen). The next year, he became the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in career postseason rushing yards (1,586) and postseason rushing touchdowns (19).

With 1,021 rushing yards in 2001, Smith became the first player in NFL history with 11 consecutive 1,000 yard seasons and the first to post eleven 1,000-yard rushing seasons in a career.

In 2002, he reached the goal he set as a rookie, finishing the season with 17,162 career yards and breaking the NFL rushing record previously held by Walter Payton against the Seattle Seahawks. In the same game against the Seahawks, Smith ran for a touchdown that gave him 150 career rushing touchdowns. He finished the 2002 season with 254 carries for 975 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns. After the season, the Cowboys hired head coach Bill Parcells who wanted to go with younger running backs and released Smith on February 26, 2003.

===Arizona Cardinals (2003–2004)===

On March 26, 2003, Smith signed a two-year contract as a free agent with the Arizona Cardinals, who were not only looking for Smith to improve their team, but also helped them promote it with their local fan base. Responding to questions about what he could do as a 34-year old running back, he said &quot;I think I&#x27;m a 1,300-yard back, and I will be out to prove that.&quot; Head Coach Dave McGinnis announced that Smith would start for the Cardinals. On October 5, in a highly anticipated game, he returned to Texas Stadium to play against the Dallas Cowboys, but suffered a broken left shoulder blade after safety Roy Williams hit him in the second quarter. The Cardinals lost 24–7, and Smith&#x27;s 6 carries for minus-1 yards marked the first time in his career he rushed for negative yardage. The injury forced him to miss six games, and he eventually finished the season with 90 carries for 256 rushing yards and averaged just 2.8 yards per carry.

In 2004, new head coach Dennis Green was hired and named Smith as the team&#x27;s starter at running back. He posted 937 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. He became the oldest player in NFL history ever to throw his first touchdown pass, throwing a 21-yard touchdown strike on a halfback option play against the New Orleans Saints in Week 4, the only passing attempt of his career.

Smith had 1,193 rushing yards, 11 rushing touchdowns, and averaged 3.2 yards per carry, and also had 212 receiving yards, no receiving touchdowns, and averaged 7.3 yards per reception during his two-year stint in Arizona.

Three days before Super Bowl XXXIX on February 3, 2005, Smith announced his retirement from the NFL. He was not re-signed by the Cardinals and signed a one-day contract for one dollar with the Dallas Cowboys, after which he immediately retired with the team he had played with for most of his career.

===NFL records===
Smith currently holds the NFL record in career rushing yards with 18,355, breaking the previous record held by Walter Payton, on October 27, 2002, against the Seattle Seahawks. He leads all running backs with 164 career rushing touchdowns, and his 175 total touchdowns ranks him second only to Jerry Rice&#x27;s 208. The total of his rushing yards, receiving yards (3,224), and fumble return yards (−15) gives him a total of 21,564 yards from the line of scrimmage, making him one of only four players in NFL history to eclipse the 21,000 combined-yards mark. (The others are Jerry Rice, Brian Mitchell, and Walter Payton).

He is the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in rushing attempts with 4,409, the only player to post three seasons with 19 or more touchdowns, and the record-holder for most games in a season with a touchdown and most games in a season with a rushing touchdown (15), set in 1995.

Smith also accumulated several NFL postseason records, including rushing touchdowns (19), consecutive games with a rushing touchdown (9), and 100-yard rushing games (7). His 1,586 yards rushing is also top on the NFL postseason chart, and he shares the total playoff touchdown mark of 21 with Thurman Thomas. With the Cowboys, Smith won three Super Bowl rings and rushed for over 100 yards in two of those games, Super Bowl XXVII (108 yards and a touchdown, and six receptions for 27 yards), and Super Bowl XXVIII (132 yards and two touchdowns, and four receptions for 26 yards). Smith received the Super Bowl MVP award for Super Bowl XXVIII, becoming the only Cowboys running back ever to win the award. He also scored two touchdowns in Super Bowl XXX.

Smith is one of only five NFL players who have amassed over 10,000 career-rushing yards and 400 career receptions. Smith and Jerry Rice are the only two non-kickers in NFL history to score 1,000 points in a career.

===Playing style===
As a runner, Smith was consistently effective, though not dazzling in style. &quot;(Smith) darted, slithered and followed his blockers, and squeezed yard after yard out of plays that didn&#x27;t have any yards in them. He didn&#x27;t look especially fast or powerful or blindingly deceptive, yet he couldn&#x27;t be stopped.&quot; Smith was noted for being a very durable back with excellent vision, tremendous leg strength, and great balance, and was known as one of the best second-effort runners ever. Smith was also a reliable receiver and an excellent blocker in pass protection.

During his career, he was often compared to Detroit Lions Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders, as both men were extremely successful for their respective teams and combined for eight rushing titles during the 1990s. Some give Smith the edge for his consistent &quot;north-south&quot; style that took full advantage of Dallas&#x27; talented offensive line, while some think Sanders&#x27; spectacular running style with sudden changes of direction made him a better back. Observers agree, though, that both Smith and Sanders were among the best running backs in league history.

Although Smith is the only player to tell John Madden that &quot;Madden NFL&quot; rated his skills too high, he was ranked No. 68 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players in 1999, three years before becoming the game&#x27;s all-time rushing yards leader.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Life after football==
In 2002, Smith and his wife founded the Pat &amp; Emmitt Smith Charities as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the mission to &quot;seek a reality where children have the resources necessary to realize their full potential.&quot;

In September 2005, Smith went on to become as a studio analyst on the NFL Network show, &quot;NFL Total Access&quot;.

On September 19, 2005, at halftime of the Cowboys-Redskins game (broadcast on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;), Smith was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor with his long-time teammates Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin.

On July 23, 2006, Smith was a judge at the Miss Universe 2006 pageant.

In the fall of 2006, Smith won the third season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional dancer Cheryl Burke. Smith was praised for &quot;making dancing look manly&quot; and for his &quot;natural charm,&quot; and Burke was given credit for coaching Smith while still allowing him to improvise some moves.

On March 12, 2007, Smith joined ESPN as a studio analyst for their NFL pre-game coverage alongside Chris Berman, Mike Ditka, Tom Jackson, and Chris Mortensen. However, he was removed from this coverage for the 2008 season. Instead, he appeared Sunday mornings during the NFL season on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. He also appeared with Steve Young and Stuart Scott at the Monday Night Football site each week on Monday Night Countdown. His contract was not renewed for the 2009 season.

Smith was criticized by some in the media and sports blogs as being inarticulate. &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; created a video called &quot;Emmitt Smith: Wordsmith&quot; mocking his numerous malapropisms. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Peter King called Smith&#x27;s comments regarding Michael Vick&#x27;s involvement in the Bad Newz Kennels &quot;idiotic and inappropriate.&quot;

Smith was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, in his first year of eligibility.

On February 7, 2010, Smith flipped the coin at the start of Super Bowl XLIV between the Indianapolis Colts and New Orleans Saints.

In June 2010, Smith returned to his high school alma mater, Escambia High School in Pensacola, Florida, for a taping of ESPN&#x27;s show Homecoming with Rick Reilly. In October 2010, he was inducted into the Escambia High School Sports Hall of Fame during halftime of an EHS football game, along with former Seattle Mariners third baseman Jim Presley and several other EHS alumni.

In 2005, Smith made his first move toward becoming a real estate developer: He teamed with another Cowboy legend, Roger Staubach, the founder and CEO of Staubach Co., to form Smith/Cypress Partners LP, a real estate development enterprise specializing in transforming underutilized parcels in densely populated areas into commercially viable properties anchored by national retail giants.

In his first deal, Smith helped the firm sign Mervyn&#x27;s, a California-based department store chain, to anchor a $45 million, project in Phoenix.

With access to $50 million in capital, Smith has several other projects in the works. He has a letter of intent to develop a site in a densely populated yet underserved area near northwest Fort Worth (it was formerly a college operated by a Masonic lodge), and he is currently negotiating for rights to another potential project in southeastern Fort Worth.

On one of the sites, Smith plans to build a complex with as much as of retail space, more than double the size of the Phoenix property. &quot;There&#x27;s a huge need for top-quality retail in these areas, and I understand how the deals are cut,&quot; Smith said before lunch. &quot;I&#x27;m not an engineer. I&#x27;m not a contractor. And I&#x27;m still learning the jargon. But I understand deals, and the only way to grow is to be in the middle of the deals.&quot;

Smith/Cypress is a joint venture (Smith owns 51 percent) with Cypress Equities, the retail development arm of Roger Staubach&#x27;s real estate services company. Early in his own playing career, Smith approached the former Cowboy quarterback with an interest in learning more about real estate. Skeptical at first, Staubach told Smith to spend some time at his company&#x27;s offices during the spring and summer if he was sincere. Smith did just that, spending the off-season at Staubach Co.&#x27;s headquarters in Dallas. Staubach founded the company in the late 1970s to locate and negotiate office and retail space for clients. In 2006, the privately held firm had transactions totaling $26 billion and of space.

In 2014, Smith&#x27;s company began a nationwide expansion, including into New York City.

Smith also co-founded ESmith Legacy, a Baltimore-based company that specializes in commercial real estate development and investment management. He serves as its Chairman of the Board and chief executive officer (CEO).

In 2007, he was a guest on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, where he joked about the Super Bowl on this question asked by Barney Stinson &quot;What is more important than the Super Bowl? – Dance, my friend, dance&quot;.

Smith participated in the 2011 National Heads-Up Poker Championship, defeating David Williams in the first round and losing in the second round to Andrew Robl.

He returned to &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in its fifteenth season as one of the &quot;All-Stars&quot; contestants. Smith once again had Cheryl Burke as his professional dance partner. They were voted off during the ninth week of the competition.

In 2016, Smith took the position of co-owner alongside founder and president Ben Davis of The Gents Place, an ultra-premium men&#x27;s grooming and lifestyle club founded in Frisco, Texas. The company has grown to include lifestyle clubs in Dallas and Southlake, as well as Leawood, Kansas.

In 2019, Smith appeared on an episode of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; to support a contestant who idolizes him.

In 2021, Smith teamed up with NASCAR driver Jesse Iwuji to form a NASCAR Xfinity Series team called Jesse Iwuji Motorsports that will compete full-time in 2022.

==Personal life==

Smith was initiated as a member of the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity at the University of Florida. He returned to the university during the NFL offseason to complete his coursework, and graduated with his bachelor&#x27;s degree in public recreation in 1996.

Smith is a devout Christian. He has a daughter, Rheagen Smith (born November 2, 1998), with ex-girlfriend Hope Wilson. He married former Miss Virginia USA Patricia Southall on April 22, 2000. They have three children together: Emmitt James Smith IV (born May 15, 2002), Skylar Smith (born October 15, 2003), and Elijah Alexander James Smith (born September 22, 2010). Smith is also the stepfather of Jasmine Page Lawrence (born January 15, 1996), who is Southall&#x27;s daughter with ex-husband, actor-comedian Martin Lawrence.

His brother, Emory, played on the practice squads of the Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers. Smith&#x27;s eldest son, E. J., committed to play college football at Stanford in 2020.

<doc id="154864" wikidata="Q1928814" url="?curid=154864" title="PeopleSoft">
<text>PeopleSoft, Inc. was a company that provided human resource management systems (HRMS), financial management solutions (FMS), supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and enterprise performance management (EPM) software, as well as software for manufacturing, and student administration to large corporations, governments, and organizations. It existed as an independent corporation until its acquisition by Oracle Corporation in 2005. The PeopleSoft name and product line are now marketed by Oracle.
== History ==
Founded in 1987 by Ken Morris and David Duffield, PeopleSoft was originally headquartered in Walnut Creek, California, before moving to Pleasanton, California. Duffield envisioned a client–server version of Integral Systems popular mainframe HRMS package. He cofounded PeopleSoft after leaving Integral Systems which was also based in Walnut Creek. It should not be confused with Integral Systems of Columbia, Maryland, a different company. The company&#x27;s sole venture backing came from IBM. George J. Still Jr. from Norwest Venture Partners joined the Board of Directors.

PeopleSoft version 1, released in late 1989, was the first fully integrated, robust client–server HRMS application suite.

PeopleSoft expanded its product range to include a financials module in 1992, distribution in 1994, and manufacturing in 1996 after the acquisition of Red Pepper.

=== JD Edwards ===
In 2003, PeopleSoft accomplished a friendly merger with smaller rival JD Edwards. The latter&#x27;s similar product line, &quot;World&quot; and &quot;OneWorld&quot;, targeted mid-sized companies too small to benefit from PeopleSoft&#x27;s applications. JD Edwards&#x27; software used the Configurable Network Computing architecture, which shielded applications from both the operating system and the database back-end. PeopleSoft branded the OneWorld product &quot;PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne&quot;.

=== Oracle Corporation acquisition ===
Beginning in 2003, Oracle began to maneuver for control of the PeopleSoft company. In June 2003, Oracle made a $13 billion bid in a hostile corporate takeover attempt. In February 2004, Oracle decreased their bid to approximately $9.4 billion; this offer was also rejected by PeopleSoft&#x27;s board of directors. Complicating Oracle&#x27;s takeover attempt was PeopleSoft&#x27;s poison pill, allowing their customers to potentially receive refunds of 2–5 times the amount they had paid in the case of a takeover.

Later that month, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block Oracle, on the grounds that the acquisition would break antitrust laws. In September 2004, the suit was rejected by a U.S. Federal judge, who found that the Justice Department had not proven its antitrust case. In October, the same decision was handed down by the European Commission. Although Oracle had reduced its offer to $7.7 billion in May, it again raised its bid in November to $9.4 billion.

In December 2004, Oracle announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire PeopleSoft for approximately $10.3 billion. A month after the acquisition of PeopleSoft, Oracle cut over half of PeopleSoft&#x27;s workforce, laying off 6,000 of PeopleSoft&#x27;s 11,000 employees.

Oracle moved to capitalize on the perceived strong brand loyalty within the JD Edwards user community by rebranding former JD Edwards products. Thus PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne became JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and PeopleSoft World became JD Edwards World.

Oracle announced in 2005 that Fusion Applications would combine the best aspects of the PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, and Oracle Applications and merge them into a new product suite.

=== Post-Oracle acquisition ===
Under Oracle, PeopleSoft offers different cloud-based software products, including Human Capital Management (HCM), Campus Solutions, Procurement and Supplier Management, Financial Management, and PeopleTools and Technology.

In 2010, PeopleSoft released its In-Memory Project Discovery. It translated unstructured data into structured data, which then allowed users to analyze keywords and data in the Services Automation suite. It ran on Oracle&#x27;s Exalytics in-memory machine and Oracle Endeca Information Discovery enterprise data platform. 

In 2015, Oracle PeopleSoft ERP (enterprise resource planning) was an on-premises system capable of running in Windows, Linux, UNIX, and IBM mainframe environments. In 2019, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) used the PeopleSoft Enterprise Human Resource platform for time and labor tracking, manager and employee self-service tools, and security.

== Product design ==

===Application architecture===
The original architecture for the PeopleSoft is a suite of products built on a client–server (two-tier) approach with a dedicated client. With the release of version 8, the entire suite was rewritten as an n-tier web-centric design called PeopleSoft Internet Architecture (PIA). The new format allowed all of a company&#x27;s business functions to be accessed and run from within a web browser.

Originally, a small number of security and system setup functions still needed to be performed on a fat-client machine; however, this is no longer the case.

The PeopleSoft application suite can function as an ERP system, similar to SAP, but can also be used for single modules; for example, Student Administration or HCM (Human Capital Management) alone.

PeopleSoft uses a functionality now known as Integration Broker to communicate with different modules (known as pillars). In addition Integration Broker can be utilized for web services calls between PeopleSoft and other applications.

===Development platform===
Implementation focuses on PeopleSoft&#x27;s proprietary PeopleTools technology. PeopleTools includes many different components used to create web-based applications: a scripting language known as PeopleCode, design tools to define various types of metadata, standard security structure, batch-processing tools, and the ability to interface with a SQL database. The metadata describes data for user interfaces, tables, messages, security, navigation, portals, etc. This set of tools can make the PeopleSoft suite platform-independent.

=== Components ===
Before PIA version 8.0, Components were called Panel Groups.

==Security==

PeopleSoft applications, which address complex business requirements, have some known issues in terms of online security. PeopleSoft was used by Fortune 500 companies and government organizations, and almost 50% of them are vulnerable and can be hacked via the internet, as researchers state.

The risk factor lies in existing vulnerabilities of Oracle PeopleSoft systems that could enable data breaches at businesses, government organizations, and universities. Because of this, companies using PeopleSoft applications are under constant threat of cyber attacks.

According to the research on public-facing Oracle PeopleSoft applications and their vulnerabilities, systems available online are susceptible to the TokenChpoken attack. A TokenChpoken attack, which affects systems that use Single Sign-On (SSO), is possible because an authentication cookie (PS_TOKEN) used by PeopleSoft applications can be forged. When the PS_TOKEN is identified by a &quot;brute force&quot; TokenChpoken attack, it is possible to log in under a system account and gain access to all data from the compromised system.

Since 2010, several cases have been reported of PeopleSoft security breaches. In March 2013, Salem State University in Massachusetts alerted 25,000 students and employees that their Social Security Numbers might have been compromised in a database breach. Similarly, in February 2016, the University of Central Florida disclosed that over 63,000 student Social Security numbers had been compromised.

All organizations that use PeopleSoft (including companies specialized in charity, food, manufacturing, retail, transport, etc.) stay vulnerable to TokenChpoken and other interventions if they do not pay due attention to security.

<doc id="154874" wikidata="Q193411" url="?curid=154874" title="Brie">
<text>Brie ( ; ) is a soft cow&#x27;s-milk cheese named after Brie (itself from Gaulish &quot;briga&quot; (&quot;hill, height&quot;)), the French region from which it originated (roughly corresponding to the modern of Seine-et-Marne). It is pale in colour with a slight greyish tinge under a rind of white mould. The rind is typically eaten, with its flavour depending largely upon the ingredients used and its manufacturing environment. It is similar to Camembert, which is native to a different region of France. Brie typically contains between 60% and 75% butterfat, slightly higher than Camembert.

&quot;Brie&quot; is a style of cheese, and is not in itself a protected name, although some regional bries are protected.

== Production ==
Brie may be produced from whole or semi-skimmed milk. The curd is obtained by adding rennet to raw milk and warming it to a maximum temperature of 37 °C (98.6 °F). The cheese is then cast into moulds, sometimes with a traditional perforated ladle called a . The mould is filled with several thin layers of cheese and drained for approximately 18 hours. The cheese is then taken out of the moulds, salted, inoculated with cheese culture (&quot;Penicillium camemberti&quot; or &quot;Brevibacterium linens&quot;), and aged in a controlled environment for at least four or five weeks.

If left to mature for longer, typically several months to a year, the cheese becomes stronger in flavour and taste, the pâte drier and darker, and the rind also darker and crumbly, and it is called (French for &#x27;black brie&#x27;).

Overripe brie contains an unpleasantly excessive amount of ammonia, produced by the same microorganisms required for ripening.

== Nutrition ==
A thirty-gram serving of brie contains about of food energy and 8.4 grams of fat, of which 5.26 grams are saturated fat. Brie is a good source of protein; a serving of brie can provide 5 to 6 grams of protein. Brie contains a good amount of both vitamin B12 and vitamin B2.

== Varieties ==
There are now many varieties of brie made all over the world, including plain brie, herbed varieties, double and triple brie and versions of brie made with other types of milk. Indeed, although brie is a French cheese, it is possible to obtain Somerset and Wisconsin brie. The French government officially certifies only two types of brie, &quot;brie de Meaux&quot; and &quot;brie de Melun&quot;. Some varieties of brie cheese are smoked.

=== Brie de Meaux ===

Brie de Meaux is an unpasteurized round cheese with a diameter of , and a weight of about . Manufactured in the town of Meaux in the Brie region of northern France since the 8th century, it was originally known as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Cheese&quot;, or, after the French Revolution, the &quot;Queen of Cheeses,&quot; and was eaten by all social classes. It was granted the protection of &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) status in 1980. It is produced primarily in the eastern part of the Parisian basin.

=== Brie de Melun ===

Brie de Melun has an average weight of and a diameter of , smaller than Brie de Meaux. It has a stronger flavour and more pungent smell. It is made with unpasteurised milk. Brie de Melun is also available in the form of &quot;Old Brie&quot; or black brie. It was granted the protection of AOC status in 1980.

=== French non-AOC bries ===
The following French bries do not have AOC certification:
brie de Montereau, Île-de-France, brie de Nangis, brie de Provins, brie noir, brie fermier, brie d&#x27;Isigny, brie de Melun bleu, brie petit moulé, brie laitier Coulommiers.

=== International bries ===
Australia:
King Island Dairy, on King Island between Victoria and Tasmania, produces a range of cheeses sold as &quot;brie&quot;, as does Jindi Cheese in Victoria and High Valley Mudgee Cheese Co in Mudgee, NSW.

UK:
Cornish Brie; Somerset Brie; Baron Bigod (made in Suffolk); Cenarth brie (made in Wales); Morangie brie (made in the Highlands, Scotland); Connage Clava brie (made in Scotland).

US:
The Marin French Cheese Company in California has made an unaged cheese since 1865 described as &quot;fresh brie&quot;.

Kolb-Lena, a Savencia Fromage &amp; Dairy plant in Illinois has made brie- and camembert-style cheese since early 1900. Today still producing brie under the brands: Alouette, Delice de France or award-winning soft cheese under Dorothy&#x27;s.

Ireland:
Ireland produces various &quot;brie&quot; cheeses such as Wicklow Bán brie, St. Killian brie, and The Little Milk Company&#x27;s Organic Irish Brie.

New Zealand has many brie-style cheeses, varying from the Mainland brand, with Creamy, Double Cream, and Blue varieties, to craft cheesemakers such as Grinning Gecko.

== Serving ==

Brie is produced as a wheel; a segment, or a whole wheel, may be bought. The white rind is edible. The cheese is ready to eat when the outside is firm, and the inside is slightly bouncy and resilient. Underripe brie is stiff to the touch; overripe brie is creamier and almost runny. The cheese is sometimes served baked.

== Storage ==
Brie is a soft cheese, which allows the rapid widespread growth of bacteria and moulds if the cheese is not stored correctly. It is recommended that soft cheeses such as brie be kept refrigerated. The optimal storage temperature for brie is or even lower. The cheese should be kept in a tightly sealed container, tightly wrapped wax paper or plastic wrap to avoid contact with moisture and food-spoilage bacteria which will reduce the shelf life and freshness of the product. Cheese producers specify a &quot;best before date&quot;, and say that the quality of the cheese will degrade beyond then. Cheese with blue or green mould may not be safe to eat; the mould may also have spread invisibly to apparently unaffected parts.

== Comparison with Camembert ==

Camembert is a similar soft cheese that is also made from cow&#x27;s milk. However, there are differences such as its origin, typical market shape, size, and flavour. Brie originates from the Île-de-France while Camembert comes from Normandy. Traditionally, brie was produced in large wheels, 23 to 37 cm (9 to 14.5 in) in diameter, and thus ripened more slowly than the smaller Camembert cheeses. When sold, brie segments typically have been cut from the larger wheels (although some brie is sold as small, flat cylinders), and therefore its sides are not covered by the rind. By contrast, Camembert is ripened as a small round cheese 10 cm (4 in) in diameter by about 3 cm (1.25 in) thick and fully covered by rind. This ratio change between rind and paste makes Camembert slightly stronger when compared to a brie ripened for the same amount of time. Once the rind is cut on Camembert, the cheese typically has a more pungent aroma than does brie. In terms of taste, Camembert has a stronger, slightly sour, and sometimes chalky taste. The texture of Camembert is softer than that of brie, and if warmed, Camembert will become creamier, whereas brie warms without losing as much structure.

<text>A weather balloon, also known as a sounding balloon, is a balloon (specifically a type of high-altitude balloon) that carries instruments to the stratosphere to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. To obtain wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System, GPS). Balloons meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time are known as &quot;transosondes&quot;. Weather balloons that do not carry an instrument pack are used to determine upper-level winds and the height of cloud layers. For such balloons, a theodolite or total station is used to track the balloon&#x27;s azimuth and elevation, which are then converted to estimated wind speed and direction and/or cloud height, as applicable.

Weather balloons are launched around the world for observations used to diagnose current conditions as well as by human forecasters and computer models for weather forecasting. Between 900 and 1,300 locations around the globe do routine releases, two or four times daily.

== History ==

One of the first people to use weather balloons was the French meteorologist Léon Teisserenc de Bort. Starting in 1896 he launched hundreds of weather balloons from his observatory in Trappes, France. These experiments led to his discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere.
Transosondes, weather balloons with instrumentation meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time to help diagnose radioactive debris from atomic fallout, were experimented with in 1958.
The drone technology boom has led to the development of weather drones since the late 1990s.
These may begin to replace balloons as a more specific means for carrying radiosondes.

== Materials and equipment ==
The balloon itself produces the lift, and is usually made of a highly flexible latex material, though chloroprene may also be used. The unit that performs the actual measurements and radio transmissions hangs at the lower end of the string, and is called a radiosonde. Specialized radiosondes are used for measuring particular parameters, such as determining the ozone concentration.

The balloon is usually filled with hydrogen, though helium – a more expensive, but viable option nonetheless – is also frequently used. The ascent rate can be controlled by the amount of gas with which the balloon is filled, usually at around . Weather balloons may reach altitudes of or more, limited by diminishing pressures causing the balloon to expand to such a degree (typically by a 100:1 factor) that it disintegrates. In this instance the instrument package is usually lost, although a parachute may be employed to help in allowing retrieval of the instrument. Above that altitude sounding rockets are used to carry instruments aloft, and for even higher altitudes satellites are used.

== Launch time, location, and uses ==
Weather balloons are launched around the world for observations used to diagnose current conditions as well as by human forecasters and computer models for weather forecasting. Between 900 and 1,300 locations around the globe do routine releases, two or four times daily, usually at 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC. Some facilities will also do occasional supplementary special releases when meteorologists determine there is a need for additional data between the 12-hour routine launches in which time much can change in the atmosphere. Military and civilian government meteorological agencies such as the National Weather Service in the US typically launch balloons, and by international agreements, almost all the data are shared with all nations.

Specialized uses also exist, such as for aviation interests, pollution monitoring, photography or videography, and research. Examples include pilot balloons (Pibal). Field research programs often use mobile launchers from land vehicles as well as ships and aircraft (usually dropsondes in this case). In recent years, weather balloons have also been used for scattering human ashes at high altitudes.
The weather balloon was also used to create the fictional entity &#x27;Rover&#x27; during the production of the 1960s TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; in Portmeirion, Gwynedd, North Wales, UK in September 1966. This was retained in further scenes shot at MGM Borehamwood UK during 1966–67.

==Environmental issues==
While weather forecasting is increasingly reliant on satellites and radar technology, it still heavily involves the use of weather balloons. These devices, launched from thousands of stations worldwide, ascend into the atmosphere to collect meteorological data. The United States, for example, releases approximately 76,600 balloons annually, while Canada launches 22,000.

Weather balloons, after reaching an altitude of approximately 35 kilometers, burst, releasing their instruments and the latex material they are made of. While the instruments are often recovered, the latex remains in the environment, posing a significant threat to marine ecosystems. Studies have shown that a substantial portion of weather balloons eventually end up in the ocean. For instance, one Australian researcher collected over 2,460 weather balloon debris from the Great Barrier Reef, estimating that up to 300 balloons per week may be released into the marine environment. This environmental impact underscores the need for sustainable alternatives in weather data collection.

Scientists and environmentalists have raised concerns about weather balloons&#x27; environmental impact. The latex material, which can persist in the ocean for extended periods, can harm marine life, including sea turtles, birds, and fish. Efforts to minimize the environmental impact of weather balloons include developing biodegradable materials and improved recovery methods. However, the continued reliance on weather balloons for meteorological data challenges balancing the need for accurate weather forecasts with environmental sustainability.

<doc id="154881" wikidata="Q2141844" url="?curid=154881" title="Heat index">
<text>The heat index (HI) is an index that combines air temperature and relative humidity, in shaded areas, to posit a human-perceived equivalent temperature, as how hot it would feel if the humidity were some other value in the shade. For example, when the temperature is with 70% relative humidity, the heat index is (see table below). The heat index is meant to describe experienced temperatures in the shade, but it does not take into account heating from direct sunlight, physical activity or cooling from wind. 

The human body normally cools itself by evaporation of sweat. High relative humidity reduces evaporation and cooling, increasing discomfort and potential heat stress. Different individuals perceive heat differently due to body shape, metabolism, level of hydration, pregnancy, or other physical conditions. Measurement of perceived temperature has been based on reports of how hot subjects feel under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. Besides the heat index, other measures of apparent temperature include the Canadian humidex, the wet-bulb globe temperature, &quot;relative outdoor temperature&quot;, and the proprietary &quot;RealFeel&quot;.

== History ==
The heat index was developed in 1979 by Robert G. Steadman. Like the wind chill index, the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height, clothing, amount of physical activity, individual heat tolerance, sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure, and the wind speed. Significant deviations from these will result in heat index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature.

In Canada, the similar humidex (a Canadian innovation introduced in 1965) is used in place of the heat index. While both the humidex and the heat index are calculated using dew point, the humidex uses a dew point of as a base, whereas the heat index uses a dew point base of . Further, the heat index uses heat balance equations which account for many variables other than vapor pressure, which is used exclusively in the humidex calculation. A joint committee formed by the United States and Canada to resolve differences has since been disbanded.

==Definition==
The heat index of a given combination of (dry-bulb) temperature and humidity is defined as the dry-bulb temperature which would feel the same if the water vapor pressure were 1.6 kPa. Quoting Steadman, &quot;Thus, for instance, an apparent temperature of refers to the same level of sultriness, and the same clothing requirements, as a dry-bulb temperature of with a vapor pressure of 1.6 kPa.&quot;

This vapor pressure corresponds for example to an air temperature of and relative humidity of 40% in the sea-level psychrometric chart, and in Steadman&#x27;s table at 40% RH the apparent temperature is equal to the true temperature between . At standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa), this baseline also corresponds to a dew point of and a mixing ratio of 0.01 (10 g of water vapor per kilogram of dry air).

A given value of relative humidity causes larger increases in the heat index at higher temperatures. For example, at approximately , the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45%, but at , any relative-humidity reading above 18% will make the heat index higher than .

It has been suggested that the equation described is valid only if the temperature is or more. The relative humidity threshold, below which a heat index calculation will return a number equal to or lower than the air temperature (a lower heat index is generally considered invalid), varies with temperature and is not linear. The threshold is commonly set at an arbitrary 40%.

The heat index and its counterpart the humidex both take into account only two variables, shade temperature and atmospheric moisture (humidity), thus providing only a limited estimate of thermal comfort. Additional factors such as wind, sunshine and individual clothing choices also affect perceived temperature; these factors are parameterized as constants in the heat index formula. Wind, for example, is assumed to be . Wind passing over wet or sweaty skin causes evaporation and a wind chill effect that the heat index does not measure. The other major factor is sunshine; standing in direct sunlight can add up to to the apparent heat compared to shade. There have been attempts to create a universal apparent temperature, such as the wet-bulb globe temperature, &quot;relative outdoor temperature&quot;, &quot;feels like&quot;, or the proprietary &quot;RealFeel&quot;.

==Meteorological considerations==
Outdoors in open conditions, as the relative humidity increases, first haze and ultimately a thicker cloud cover develops, reducing the amount of direct sunlight reaching the surface. Thus, there is an inverse relationship between maximum potential temperature and maximum potential relative humidity. Because of this factor, it was once believed that the highest heat index reading actually attainable anywhere on Earth was approximately . However, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on July 8, 2003, the dew point was while the temperature was , resulting in a heat index of . On August 28, 2024, a weather station in southern Iran recorded a heat index of , which will be a new record if confirmed.

The human body requires evaporative cooling to prevent overheating. Wet-bulb temperature and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature are used to determine the ability of a body to eliminate excess heat. A sustained wet-bulb temperature of about can be fatal to healthy people; at this temperature our bodies switch from shedding heat to the environment, to gaining heat from it. Thus a wet bulb temperature of is the threshold beyond which the body is no longer able to adequately cool itself.

== Table of values ==
The table below is from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The columns begin at , but there is also a heat index effect at and similar temperatures when there is high humidity.
For example, if the air temperature is and the relative humidity is 65%, the heat index is 

==Effects of the heat index (shade values)==

Exposure to full sunshine can increase heat index values by up to 8 °C (14 °F).

==Formula==

There are many formulas devised to approximate the original tables by Steadman. Anderson et al. (2013), NWS (2011), Jonson and Long (2004), and Schoen (2005) have lesser residuals in this order. The former two are a set of polynomials, but the third one is by a single formula with exponential functions.

The formula below approximates the heat index in degrees Fahrenheit, to within ±. It is the result of a multivariate fit (temperature equal to or greater than and relative humidity equal to or greater than 40%) to a model of the human body. This equation reproduces the above NOAA National Weather Service table (except the values at &amp; 45%/70% relative humidity vary unrounded by less than ±1, respectively).

formula_1
where
* HI = heat index (in degrees Fahrenheit)
* &quot;T&quot; = ambient dry-bulb temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)
* &quot;R&quot; = relative humidity (percentage value between 0 and 100)

formula_2

The following coefficients can be used to determine the heat index when the temperature is given in degrees Celsius, where
* HI = heat index (in degrees Celsius)
* &quot;T&quot; = ambient dry-bulb temperature (in degrees Celsius)
* &quot;R&quot; = relative humidity (percentage value between 0 and 100)

formula_3

An alternative set of constants for this equation that is within ± of the NWS master table for all humidities from 0 to 80% and all temperatures between and all heat indices below is:

formula_4

A further alternate is this:

formula_5
where
formula_6

For example, using this last formula, with temperature and relative humidity (RH) of 85%, the result would be: .

==Limitations==
The heat index does not work well with extreme conditions, like supersaturation of air, when the air is more than 100% saturated with water. David Romps, a physicist and climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley and his graduate student Yi-Chuan Lu, found that the heat index was underestimating the severity of intense heat waves, such as the 1995 Chicago heat wave. 

Other issues with the heat index include the unavailability of precise humidity data in many geographical regions, the assumption that the person is healthy, and the assumption that the person has easy access to water and shade.

<text>Aalst (; , ; Brabantian: &quot;Oilsjt&quot;) is a city and municipality in the province of East Flanders in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is located on the Dender River, about northwest of Brussels. The municipality comprises the city of Aalst itself and the villages of Baardegem, Erembodegem, Gijzegem, Herdersem, Hofstade, Meldert, Moorsel and Nieuwerkerken; it is the tenth largest city by population with 90.068 inhabitants. Aalst is crossed by the Molenbeek-Ter Erpenbeek in Aalst and Hofstade. The current mayor of Aalst is Christoph D&#x27;Haese, from the New-Flemish Alliance party. The town has a long-standing folkloric feud with Dendermonde, north along the same river, which dates from the Middle Ages.

==History==

The first historical records on Aalst date from the 9th century, when it was described as the &quot;villa Alost&quot;, a dependency of the Abbey of Lobbes. During the Middle Ages, a town and port grew at this strategic point, where the road from Bruges to Cologne crossed the Dender. While it was within the Holy Roman Empire it was considered the capital of the province of Flanders. In 1046, Aalst was transferred to the Countship of Imperial Flanders, and absorbed a portion of Brabant, and in 1173 it was united with the remainder of the Flanders province. Its frontier position on the border of the Holy Roman Empire allowed the town to keep a certain degree of independence. Its relation with Brabant has been preserved in the city&#x27;s white and red coat of arms, the colours of Lotharingia.

Construction of the town hall began in the middle of the 12th century, making it the oldest surviving town hall in Belgium. Several manuscripts from this period still survive in the town archives. During the Hundred Years War the town of Aalst allied themselves with Louis de Male against Philip van Artevelde and sent troops in the victorious Battle of Roosebeke. The town hall, and the city itself, were almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1360. The town was soon rebuilt and a new belfry in gothic style was built in the 15th century. This was a time of great prosperity for the city, dominated by the powerful weavers&#x27; guild. It is also at that time that Dirk Martens, a local citizen, became the Southern Netherlands’ first printer, founding a printing shop in 1473 that published books by various authors including Christopher Columbus; Martens would later become a professor at the Old University of Leuven, and he was laid to rest in the St Martin&#x27;s Church of Aalst.

Aalst suffered considerably under the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648). It was later taken by the French Marshal Turenne in the War of Devolution of 1667, then occupied by France until 1706, when it became independent once more following the Battle of Ramillies, along with Southern Flanders in general. The textile-based economy flourished under the French. In the 18th century, the Austrians controlled the region. 1830 saw Belgium gain independence and Aalst became part of the country, this ended a long period, starting in 1056, of foreign control, by such as the Spanish, German, French, and the Dutch. The 19th century was marked by social crises engendered by the Industrial Revolution, with Father Adolf Daens and his Christene Volkspartij emerging as the local defender of workers&#x27; rights. This was in response to &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, which established worker rights. However Daens felt this did not do enough. Eventually, he was made to pay for his &quot;splinter movement&quot;. In the Pre-World War II years, the fascist movement in the Low Countries gained momentum, with the collaborationist &quot;Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond&quot; (Flemish National Union) putting down roots in the region. Aalst, along with Brussels and Antwerp were the strongest subscribers to this line of thought. The 20th century was marked by bombardment and occupation by the Germans during both world wars.
==Economy==

The textile industry is still vibrant in Aalst, in part because of the French occupation. Aalst produces not only the textiles themselves, clothing and footwear, but manufactures many of the needed machines. The more rural regions are noted for their production of hops, which are sold to the old breweries there. They also have a large active cut flower business in the region.

==Carnival==

Aalst is known for its carnival festivities, celebrated every year before Lent. During this celebration, the former town hall belfry is the site of the traditional &quot;throwing of the onions&quot;. A &quot;Prince Carnival&quot; is elected, who is allowed to &quot;rule&quot; the city for three days. A big parade crosses the city on Sunday, with about 70 groups of costumed volunteers and parade cars. Carnival Tuesday or Shrove Tuesday (by tradition, the day before Ash Wednesday), is known as the day of the &#x27;Voil Jeannetten&#x27; (literally: &quot;the Dirty Jennies&quot;), i.e., men dressed as women. The festivities traditionally end with the &quot;Burning of the Doll&quot;, happening on Tuesday evening. In recent years the carnival has been accused of anti-Semitism due to the repeated use of derogatory imagery against Jews.

===Controversy===
In December 2019, anticipating UNESCO&#x27;s response to the decision of the carnival organizers to double down on the widely reported use of anti-Semitic stereotypes, the mayor of Aalst pre-emptively applied to have his city&#x27;s carnival removed from the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This is the only time such a request has been made.

In 2020 the Aalst parade included more anti-Semitic costumes. These included floats depicting Orthodox Jews with hooked noses standing on sacks of gold coins. Israel&#x27;s ambassador to Belgium stated “What we are asking for is the prohibition of all these antisemitic cartoons, which are beyond good taste, which have nothing to do with a sense of humor and which do not honor an exemplary democracy such as Belgium.” In response, Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, described the parade as an “internal affair.” UNIA, the Interfederal Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, stated in a report that no criminal offences were committed, for the parade had no anti-semitic motive, nor the intent to incite hatred or violence against Jews.

==In the media==
The Belgian TV police drama, &quot;13 Geboden&quot; (13 Commandments) was filmed in Aalst.

The Belgian historical drama &quot;Thieves of the Wood&quot; is set in and around Aalst.

The 1992 movie &quot;Daens&quot;, about Adolf Daens and directed by Stijn Coninx, is set in Aalst. Coninx also filmed the Aalst-set 2018 movie &quot;Niet Schieten&quot; (based on the last attributed crime of the Brabant killers, committed in Aalst in 1985) in Aalst.

==Symbols==
===Flag===

Description: &quot;A rectangle of proportions 2:3, with three vertical bands of red, white and yellow, with a red sword in the middle band pointing upwards.&quot; In Dutch: &quot;Drie even lange banen van rood, van wit en van geel, met op het wit een rood zwaard paalsgewijze geplaatst.&quot;

Heraldic blazon: &quot;Terciated by pale Gules, Argent and Or, a sword of the first pointing upwards.&quot;

===Coat of arms===
Those arms were granted in 1819 and confirmed on 6 February 1841. The oldest known seals of Aalst (13th–14th centuries) show a knight holding a sword in one hand and the Flemish banner in the other, but there is a seal dated 1237 showing the banner with the sword, and even an older seal, dated 1174, with the same features. A later version of the seal (1339–1559) shows a local banner with the sword. A seal from 1407 adds a small shield with the Flemish arms.

The arms of Aalst were first shown in the roll of arms of Gaillard (1557). The sword is probably taken from the old seal with the knight. The two shields show the Imperial eagle and the Flemish lion, recalling the odd status of the Country of Aalst.

Description: &quot;The municipal arms of Aalst show on the chief of a white shield two smaller shields separated by a red sword pointing upwards and dividing the whole shield; on dexter, the shield is yellow with a black double-headed eagle with red tongues and claws (Holy Roman Empire); on sinister, the shield is yellow with a black lion with a red tongue and claws (Flanders).&quot;

Heraldic blazon: &quot;A Modern French shield Argent ensigned by a crown Or and divided in half by a sword palewise pointing upwards Gules between two smaller shields Or; on the dexter shield, a double-headed eagle displayed; on the sinister shield a lion rampant; both Sable armed and langued Gules.&quot;

* The basketball club Okapi Aalstar 
* The football club Eendracht Aalst who play in the second division. 
* The volleyball club VK Aalst, which was founded in the 1960s, playing in the first division.

<text>The Senegal bushbaby (Galago senegalensis), also known as the Senegal galago, the lesser galago or the lesser bush baby, is a small, nocturnal primate, a member of the galago family Galagidae.

The name &quot;bush baby&quot; may come either from the animals&#x27; cries or from their appearance. They are agile leapers, and run swiftly along branches. They live in Africa south of the Sahara and nearby islands including Zanzibar. They tend to live in dry woodland regions and savannah regions. They are small primates (130 mm and 95 - 300 grams) with woolly thick fur that ranges from silvery grey to dark brown. They have large eyes, giving them good night vision; strong hind limbs; and long tails, which help them balance. Their ears are made up of four segments that can bend back individually, to aid their hearing when hunting insects at night. Their omnivorous diet is a mixture of other small animals, including birds and insects, fruit, seeds, flowers, eggs, nuts, and tree gums.
Bushbabies reproduce twice a year, at the beginning of the rains (November) and the end (February). They are polygynous, and the females raise their young in nests made from leaves. They have 1 - 2 babies per litter, with gestation period being 110 – 120 days. Bush babies are born with half-closed eyes, unable to move about independently. After a few days, the mother carries the infant in her mouth, and leaves it on convenient branches while feeding.

Adult females maintain territories, but share them with their offspring. Males leave their mothers&#x27; territories after puberty, but females remain, forming social groups consisting of closely related females and their immature young. Adult males maintain separate territories, which overlap with those of the female social groups; generally, one adult male mates with all the females in an area. Males who have not established such territories sometimes form small bachelor groups.

Bush babies communicate both by calling to each other and by marking their paths with their urine. At the end of the night, group members use a special rallying call and gather to sleep in a nest made of leaves, in a group of branches, or in a hole in a tree.

==Predation by chimpanzees==
A 2007 study of the Western chimpanzee in Täi forest, Ivory Coast, revealed that local females, young males, young females and infants chimps hunt the Senegal bushbaby using fashioned spears. When a bushbaby roost was found, the chimps broke a branch from a nearby tree and sharpened the end using their teeth. They would then rapidly and repeatedly stab into the roost. After successly killing the bushbaby they reached into or smashed the roost, retrieved the body of the bushbaby and ate it. This method was observed to be successful only once in five attempts for a young female.

==Subspecies==
There are four subspecies of the Senegal bushbaby:
* &quot;Galago senegalensis senegalensis&quot;
* &quot;Galago senegalensis braccatus&quot;
* &quot;Galago senegalensis sotikae&quot;
* &quot;Galago senegalensis dunni&quot;

<text>Erpe-Mere () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders in the Denderstreek. The municipality comprises the towns of Aaigem, Bambrugge, Burst, Erondegem, Erpe, Mere, Ottergem and Vlekkem. There is also a hamlet in Bambrugge: Egem. Erpe-Mere is crossed by 2 brooks, the Molenbeek and the Molenbeek-Ter Erpenbeek. In 2022 Erpe-Mere had a total population of 20,127. The total area is 34.03 km2. The current mayor of Erpe-Mere is Hugo De Waele, from the CD&amp;V (Christian Democratic) party.

== History ==
The municipality was formed in 1975 by the merger of the eight sub-municipalities of today, but the sub-communities Erpe and Mere initially disagreed on the new name for the merged municipality. While Erpe had the largest area, Mere was central in the entire area and had more inhabitants. As a compromise they choose the double name Erpe-Mere.

== Geography ==

The municipality is bordered to the north by Lede, in the east by Aalst and Haaltert, in the south by Herzele and in the west by Sint-Lievens-Houtem. Erpe-Mere is located north of the foothills of the Flemish Ardennes, in the region Denderstreek. The area north of the N9 (Aalst-Ghent) is between 10 and 30 meters high, the area between the N9 and E40 (Brussels-Ghent) is between 25 and 50 meters high and the area south of it has hills peaks up to 80 meters. The most famous of them is the Gotegemberg in Mere, not for his height of 68 meters, but for its slope of 18% making it a popular challenge for cyclists.

The territory is traversed by two brooks that both bear the name Molenbeek. The Molenbeek from the Upper Scheldt crosses Burst, Bambrugge, Ottergem, Vlekkem and Erondegem before it flows into the Scheldt. The Molenbeek-Ter Erpenbeek flows into the Dender.

The Romans knew early there was white natural stone called Vlaamse Arduin or Lediaanse Steen in Steenberg of Bambrugge. This white natural stone was suitable as a foundation for the masonry of Roman villas and as building material for columns and capitals of the Roman temples. From about the 11th or 12th century there was already extracted white sandstone in Bambrugge (Steenberg). The common types of white natural stone in Brabant in the 16th to 17th Century were extracted in Steenberg. Extraction continued until after World War II. Today it is the administrative center of Erpe-Mere.

There is a 205 hectare nature reserve called Den Dotter in the sub-municipalities of Aaigem (municipality Erpe-Mere) and Heldergem (municipality Haaltert).

== Transportation ==
Erpe-Mere has an exit to the A10/E40 and a regional railway station on the railway line Kortrijk–Oudenaarde–Zottegem–Erpe-Mere–Aalst–Brussels. Also the N9 (Gentsesteenweg), the N442 (Leedsesteenweg) and the N46 (Oudenaardsesteenweg) cross the municipality.

== Landmarks ==
* The water tower of the Tussengemeentelijke Maatschappij der Vlaanderen voor Watervoorziening.

=== Mills ===

Landmarks include the mills of the municipality, through which runs the Denderroute South and the Molenbeekroute. Due to the geography of the area, there are eleven water mills in Erpe-Mere, with Erpe-Mere having the most water mills in Belgium, seven of which are protected by law. One mill was largely demolished, but there are still remains of this mill and the mill house is still intact. Another mill was also converted into a house. On the Koudenberg, one of the highest hills of the community, there is a windmill that is protected by law. It was re-mounted on its base in 2006 after being restored in 2004 by a studio in Roeselare. The Kruiskoutermolen was restored in 2006 and is operational. It can be visited by appointment with the tourist service.

== Sports ==
Erpe-Mere once had seven football clubs that belonged to the Royal Belgian Football Association. There are still four left: KRC Bambrugge, KFC Olympic Burst, FC Mere and SK Aaigem. FC Edixvelde was absorbed by FC Mere. FC Oranja Erpe and KFC Olympia Erondegem merged into KVC Erperondegem that was some years later also absorbed by FC Mere.

Each year the Steenbergcross, the first international cyclo-cross race of the season, is held at Steenberg in Bambrugge. The national clubhouse of the motorcycle club Blue Angels in Belgium is located in Erpe.

==History==

Geraardsbergen is one of the oldest cities in Belgium. It came into existence close to the settlement of Hunnegem and in 1068 was one of the first communities in Western Europe to be granted city status.

The city was destroyed in 1381 by Walter IV of Enghien and his troops. According to legend, during the siege local people threw some of their left over food over the city wall to show that they had sufficient food to survive a long siege. This bravado notwithstanding, the city was still captured by Enghien&#x27;s troops. Every year the city organizes the &quot;krakelingenworp&quot; carnival on top of the hill at Oudenberg () to celebrate this historical event.

On 29May 1815, shortly before the Battle of Waterloo, Wellington and Blücher reviewed the Allied cavalry here. Some 6,000 troops were paraded in meadows on the banks of the Dender between Geraardsbergen and Jedeghem.

<doc id="154889" wikidata="Q912113" url="?curid=154889" title="Lede, Belgium">
<text>Lede () is a municipality in the Belgian province of East Flanders, in the Denderstreek near the cities of Ghent, Aalst and Dendermonde.

In 2011, Lede had a population of 17,882 and area of 29.69 km2, a population density of 575 inhabitants per km2. The current mayor of Lede is Geertrui Van de Velde (CD&amp;V).

==Name of town==
The meaning of the name &#x27;Lede&#x27; comes from the Dutch word &#x27;Ledenaars&#x27; which means &#x27;The Proud Farmers&#x27;

==Geography==
The municipality comprises the sub-municipalities of Impe, Lede proper, Oordegem, Smetlede, Wanzele, and the hamlet of Papegem. All the sub-municipalities and also the hamlet are crossed by the Molenbeek.

===Sandstone===
The Lede Formation (; abbreviation: Ld) is a geologic formation in the subsurface of Belgium. The formation is named after Lede. It consists of shallow-marine limestone and sandstone, deposited in the former sea that covered Belgium during the Eocene. The bluestone (for roads) and in particular the yellow-brown calcareous sandstone extracted from quarries in Lede and neighbouring areas, were widely used during the 15th to 18th century as construction material for religious and civil buildings.

==History==
Lede has its origins going back to the Middle Ages, controlled by various Lordships, especially the &#x27;de Bette&#x27; family, (Marquess of Lede).
The local church, &#x27;Sint-Martinuskerk&#x27;, was built in 14th Century.
A Castle was built here in the mid-1700s.

The Brussels-Ghent railway line was constructed through Lede in 1856. But industrial development remained limited: a few rural breweries, weaving mills, clothing and shoe companies were founded by local families, but all disappeared by the late 20th Century.

==Sights==
Lede is known for a statue of the Virgin Mary, inside the Martin&#x27;s Church, called &quot;Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-van-Zeven-Smarten&quot; (Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows), to which a local legend attributes miraculous powers, such as healing of diseases. The statue attracts many pilgrims. The statue is taken around in a procession during a Sunday in June, after the biannual nine-day festival. The local church, built in 1496, houses the statue.
The former Mesen Castle was situated in central Lede. It used to be the residence of the Marquess of Lede until its family line died out in the early 19th century. It was used as a private girls&#x27; school until it closed in the 1970s. It began to fall into ruins by the 1990s. The local authorities began to demolish parts of the castle in 2010, despite protests from the local population to preserve it. But most of the structure was completely torn down by 2015. The former castle gardens still exist as a park.

==Economy==
The economy of Lede consists of agriculture and small businesses, including tourism. A psychiatric clinic is also here. The community is known for its fields, woods, horses and hiking/jogging trails. One such nature area is the &#x27;Vallei van de Serskampse Beek.&#x27;

<text>Ninove () is a city and municipality in the Flemish province of East Flanders in Belgium. It is on the river Dender, and is part of the Denderstreek. The municipality comprises the city of Ninove proper and since the 1976 merger of the towns of , , , , Meerbeke, , , , , and . On 1 January 2023 Ninove had a total population of 40.090. The total area is 72.57 km2 which gives a population density of 553 inhabitants per km2.

==History==

The oldest version of the name &quot;Ninove&quot;, &quot;Neonifus&quot; dates from the 9th century. Later versions of the city name were &quot;Ninive&quot; and &quot;Nineve&quot;. The current version of the city name dates from the 14th century. The origin of the city name is not clear. There are two theories about the origin. One states that name is from Roman origin, the other states that it is of Frankish origin. The meaning of the name, however, is known. Ninove means &quot;nieuw weiland&quot; or in English, &quot;new pasture&quot;.

During Roman rule, Ninove was a small settlement located in the current &quot;Nederwijk&quot;. With the arrival of the Franks in the 4th century AD, the settlement grew to a small agricultural town. The area on which Ninove is located was from 843 on part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 11th century this area was conquered by the Count of Flanders, Boudewijn V and the whole area between the rivers Scheldt and Dender became part of Flanders.

From the 11th century on, the medieval castrum was fortified into a castle stronghold. Because it lay on the trade route between Flanders and Brabant, the town prospered and grew into a city. In 1137, Norbertine monks from Park Abbey founded the Saint Cornelius Abbey (Abbey of Our Lady and SS. Cornelius and Cyprian), adjacent to the city (&quot;see below&quot;). In 1295 the town and lands were bought by the count of Flanders Guy of Dampierre. His grandson Henry awarded the town a city charter in 1339.

The 15th–17th centuries were a bad time for the city as the region was plagued with war and religious and political strife. The abbey was plundered by the French in 1578 during the reformation. In 1658, Ninove was occupied by the French army. After the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the French returned the area back to Spain but the area was to change hands many times during the wars of Louis XIV and Louis XV of France.

During the 17th century Ninove was crippled under the indemnities laid on it by the warring parties and the town faced a big economic crisis as its cloth industry went into decline. The big abbey was closed by the French in 1796, after Flanders was annexed to France. The town served as a cavalry headquarters during the Waterloo Campaign of 1815.

During the 19th century Ninove became industrialized and by the time of the First World War, the city became the centre of the Flemish match industry. This industry however declined in importance until the last match factory closed during the late 1970s.

From 1973 to 2011 the town of Meerbeke was the finish of the cycling race Tour of Flanders.

The population of Ninove has steadily grown and the city has become an attractive centre for commercial, recreational and economical activities in the area, and plays host to a popular annual Volkswagen show every March, specifically for air-cooled vehicles, i.e. Beetles, Camper-vans, Type 3&#x27;s, 4&#x27;s etc. The opening of a shopping mall in the centre of the city, as well as new sport and cultural infrastructure, and the construction of many residential apartment buildings have made Ninove a growing competitor for nearby Aalst and an ideal living-place for many commuters who work in nearby Brussels.

===Premonstratensian abbey===

The Premonstratensian abbot of Park Abbey founded the Abbey of Saints Cornelius and Cyprian in 1137. The monks settled on uncultivated lands which had been offered to them by the lord of Ninove which were near the town, on the banks of the river Dender. The community continued to grow and its financial position soon allowed it to occupy the adjacent parishes. The lay brothers undertook the farm work. Because of its large landholdings, the abbey soon became one of the biggest grain producers in Flanders. The 16th and 17th centuries were difficult times because of the political troubles and the effects of the French wars of religion on the Southern Netherlands. The 18th century brought a period of calm and prosperity. All the abbey buildings were reconstructed to the plans of a Ghent architect advised by Laurent-Benoît Dewez. The abbey was suppressed in 1796 during the French Revolution. The abbey community was able to buy it back but this process lasted until 1822. Many of the buildings were demolished during the first half of the 19th century. The abbey church became the parish church of the Assumption of Mary in 1813.

==City politics==

Since 1 November 2015, the mayor of Ninove has been (Open VLD). 
The city council currently has 33 members, and is composed as follows:
* Open VLD – 9 seats
* Forza Ninove (Vlaams Belang) – 15 seats
* Samen (SP.a-Groen – CD&amp;V) – 7 seats
* N-VA – 2 seats

===2001–2007===
CD&amp;V and N-VA had allied themselves for the 2000 election, and formed a coalition with the VLD. Due to the increase of population, the threshold of 35,000 inhabitants had been passed and Ninove saw an increase from 31 to 33 council members for the communal elections, which were held on Sunday 8 October 2006.

The municipal elections on 8 October 2006 let the VLD retain its 12 seats, the CD&amp;V win a seat, giving them a total of 8, the Vlaams Belang double its seats, giving them a total of 8, the socialist party PRO Ninove lose a seat, making a total of 4, and the Green Party hold their single seat. The coalition between VLD and CD&amp;V was renewed, but without the N-VA.

===2007–2012===
During the 2 January 2007 elections of the OCMW council, one member of the VLD fraction voted for a candidate of Vlaams Belang, making the VLD lose 1 seat. After an investigation led by the local chapter of the VLD, it was announced that the person they suspected to be the culprit was Schepen Mariette De Smet. De Smet announced she would leave the VLD, but would remain in the council of the mayor and aldermen as an independent. Her colleagues in the council stripped her of all her duties, but after a few months she regained a few of them. On 9 January 2008 De Smet, fellow VLD schepen Corijn and another VLD member of the city council announced they were joining LDD, leaving the VLD-CD&amp;V with a brittle one seat majority on the city council. The LDD alderman however elected to stay in the majority, making for a brittle coalition. On 5 May 2009 a Vlaams Belang councilmember defected to the LDD. In 2009 mayor Luc Durant announced he would resign for health reasons. He was replaced in September by Michel Casteur. In 2010 another VB councilmember left the party to become an independent. In January 2011 Mariette De Smet announced she would join the Vlaams Belang lead chartel list &quot;Forza Ninove&quot; and left LDD. She was then again stripped of her duties by her fellow aldermen. On 27 July 2011 De Smet was murdered in a murder-suicide by a friend of her husband. She was replaced as alderman by a member of the VLD. In 2012 the local LDD disbanded with its members either joining Forza Ninove or N-VA.

===2013–2018===
The municipal elections on 14 October 2012 saw the ruling VLD-CD&amp;V-LDD coalition head for electoral defeat as the VLD (9) lost three and the CD&amp;V (4) lost four seats. Vlaams Belang, under the cartel name &quot;Forza Ninove&quot;, won a seat, giving them a total of 9. The socialist party SP.a and the Green Party formed a chartel and won six seats. N-VA won 5 seats.

After the negotiations between Open VLD, SP.a-Groen and N-VA collapsed, the coalition between Open VLD and CD&amp;V was renewed but expanded with SP.a-Groen. N-VA, claiming election irregularities by CD&amp;V and &quot;Forza Ninove&quot;, launched and won an administrative appeal. This ruling vacated the election results and ordered new elections to be held. Open VLD, CD&amp;V and SP.a-Groen appealed this ruling to the Council of State which in February 2013 subsequently overthrew the previous ruling and restored the election results. The new city council and aldermen were finally inaugurated on 25 February 2013. On 1 November 2015 mayor Casteur stood down and was replaced by Tania De Jonge.

===2019–2024===
The municipal elections on 14 October 2018 saw Forza Ninove win a landslide victory with 40% of the vote, winning 15 seats (+6). Open VLD retained its 9 seats, SAMEN (a cartel of socialists, greens and Christian-democrats) won 7 seats. N-VA won 2 seats (−3). Forza was unable to form a majority coalition, and ultimately Open VLD and SAMEN combined with one councillor from N-VA who sits as an independent to form a majority.

=== 2024-now ===
In the 2024 Belgian local elections, Forza Ninove won an absolute majority in the municipality, leading to Guy d&#x27;Haeseleer becoming the first-ever Vlaams Belang mayor.

===List of former mayors===
==Nicknames==

Throughout the ages the inhabitants of Ninove were given various nicknames as a title of honour or mockery.

===&quot;Wortelmannen or Wortels&quot;===
The inhabitants were given the title of &quot;wortelmannen&quot; or &quot;wortels&quot; (Dutch for carrot people or carrot) because of an event during the Middle Ages. During a row with the neighbouring city of Aalst, the people of Aalst decided to besiege Ninove. The inhabitants of Ninove were completely surprised by this attack and were found unprepared. In all the confusion the key to close the city gate could not be found. To bolt the gate, a carrot was used. A passing donkey saw the carrot-bolt and ate it, leaving the city gate unbolted and the militiamen from Aalst free entry of the city.

===&quot;De Oudste, de Stoutste en de Wijste der Steden&quot;===
Ninove was described by Antonius Sanderus as the Oldest, the Boldest and the Wisest of Cities. Sanderus wrote in his &quot;Flandria Illustrata&quot;:

Ninove was called the oldest because of the similarity of its name with the ancient Assyrian city Nineveh, the boldest because it waited on the enemy with open gates and the wisest because the city had no jester or town fool, if one was needed a fool from a neighbouring town was lent.

== Media ==

=== Newspapers ===
Ninove is the home of independent digital news outlet Ninofmedia. Founded in 2013, Ninofmedia primarily covers news in Ninove and other surrounding areas in the Denderstreek.

<text>Northern Kentucky is an urban area in the U.S. Commonwealth of Kentucky consisting of the southern part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The three main counties of the area are Boone, Kenton, and Campbell, all along the Ohio River across from Cincinnati, Ohio. Other counties frequently included in Northern Kentucky include Bracken, Grant, Gallatin and Pendleton. Of Greater Cincinnati&#x27;s over two million residents, over 450,000 of them live in Northern Kentucky as of 2020, primarily in the northernmost counties. The largest cities in the region are Covington, Florence, and Independence.
Historically, Trimble, Mason, and Lewis Counties have also been included in the broader definition of Northern Kentucky. On July 17, 2019, Brent Cooper, a member of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, called for the Northern Kentucky community to consider reuniting three counties (Boone, Kenton, and Campbell) into one county to better reflect the region&#x27;s common identity and strengthen its political voice and economic marketability.

==History==
The area was served by ferry service across the Ohio River until the completion of the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge (prototype of the famous Brooklyn Bridge) in 1866.

Beginning in the 1970s, many factors combined to create major growth. The proximity to Cincinnati, the completion of I-75, the nexus of rail service and river traffic, the creation of several industrial parks, and the growth of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) (located near Hebron in northeastern Boone County near the Kenton County line) drew many industries into the area. Its geographically central location (within of 80% of the US population) makes it ideal for distribution centers, and those shipping all over the country.

In addition to location, the Northern Kentucky area hosts several organizations that strive to enhance the quality of life and the local economy. The primary airport (CVG) serving Cincinnati is located in Northern Kentucky.

==Climate==
Northern Kentucky is located within a climatic transition zone and is at the extreme northern limit of the humid subtropical climate. Evidence of both humid subtropical climate and humid continental climate can be found here, particularly noticeable by the presence of plants indicative of each climatic region; for example, the southern magnolia, and crape myrtle, from the subtropics and the blue spruce, maple, and eastern hemlock from cooler regions are successful landscape plants in and around Northern Kentucky. Some significant moderating variables for the overall climate of Northern Kentucky include the Ohio River, the region&#x27;s relatively large hills and valleys, and an urban heat influence due to the proximity of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky metropolitan area. The common wall lizard, introduced from Italy in the 1950s, is an example of fauna in the area that lends a subtropical ambiance to areas near the urban core of Cincinnati. Even though Kentucky as a whole is firmly considered Southern and part of the Upper South. Northern Kentucky is considered to be within the periphery of the Upper South and Midwest.

==Attractions==
Northern Kentucky contributes many attractions to the Greater Cincinnati community. Beyond the shops, restaurants, and riverside views of Cincinnati&#x27;s skyline, some of the more well-known attractions are The Florence Speedway, MainStrasse Village, Newport on the Levee (including the Newport Aquarium), and the World Peace Bell. There are also several community playhouses and music venues, along with community parks, arboretums, and museums. Campbell County has some wineries.

Religious attractions of Northern Kentucky range from the historic churches of the older river cities, including the St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption and Mother of God Church, both in Covington, to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, south in Grant County. Florence is home to the Islamic Center of Northern Kentucky.

==Education==
Northern Kentucky has several schools of higher education, including Gateway Community and Technical College, Northern Kentucky University, and Thomas More University.

<doc id="154902" wikidata="Q2710982" url="?curid=154902" title="Totalitarian democracy">
<text>Totalitarian democracy is a dictatorship based on the mass enthusiasm generated by a perfectionist ideology. The conflict between the state and the individual should not exist in a totalitarian democracy, and in the event of such a conflict, the state has the moral duty to coerce the individual to obey. This idea that there is one true way for a society to be organized and a government should get there at all costs stands in contrast to liberal democracy, which trusts the process of democracy to, through trial and error, help a society improve without there being only one correct way to self-govern.

==Etymology==
The term was popularized by Israeli historian Jacob Leib Talmon. It had previously been used by Bertrand de Jouvenel and E. H. Carr, and subsequently by F. William Engdahl and Sheldon S. Wolin.

==Definition==

In his 1952 book &quot;The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy,&quot; Talmon argued that the totalitarian and liberal types of democracy emerged from the same premises during the eighteenth century. He regarded the conflict between these two types of democracy as of world-historical importance:

:Indeed, from the vantage point of the mid-twentieth century the history of the last hundred and fifty years looks like a systematic preparation for the headlong collision between empirical and liberal democracy on the one hand, and totalitarian Messianic democracy on the other, in which the world crisis of to-day consists.

The political neologism messianic democracy (also political messianism) also derives from Talmon&#x27;s introduction to this work.

==Differences with liberal democracy==

Talmon identified the following differences between totalitarian and liberal democracy:

* The totalitarian approach is based on the assumption of a total and exclusive truth in politics. It postulates a preordained, harmonious and perfect scheme of things, to which people are irresistibly driven and at which they are bound to arrive (see historical determinism). 

* The liberal approach assumes politics to be a matter of trial and error. It regards political systems as pragmatic contrivances of human ingenuity and spontaneity. The totalitarian approach views politics as an integral part of an all-embracing and coherent philosophy. It defines politics as the art of applying this philosophy to the organisation of society, and the final purpose of politics is only achieved when this philosophy reigns supreme over all fields of life. 

* The liberal approach recognises a variety of levels of personal and collective endeavour, which are altogether outside the sphere of politics. The totalitarian approach recognises only one plane of existence, the political. It widens the scope of politics to embrace the whole of human existence. It treats all human thought and action as having social significance, and therefore as falling within the orbit of political action. 

* The liberal approach finds the essence of freedom in spontaneity and the absence of coercion. The totalitarian approach believes freedom to be only realised in the pursuit and attainment of an absolute collective purpose.

==Historical development==

Talmon argue that totalitarian democracy arose in three stages:
# Intellectual developments in eighteenth-century France spurred by the collapse of feudal and ecclesiastical authority in the early modern era. 
# The development of single-party dictatorship during the Reign of Terror and the use of terror as a political instrument, based on a doctrine of total popular sovereignty. 
# The extension of totalitarian logic to property, leading to Communism.

== Further interpretations ==
Engdahl and Wolin have added some new dimensions to the analysis of totalitarian democracy. 

In his 2009 book &quot;Full Spectrum Dominance: Totalitarian Democracy and the New World Order,&quot; Engdahl portrays America as driving to achieve global hegemony through military and economic means. According to him, U.S. state objectives have led to internal conditions that resemble totalitarianism: &quot;[it is] a power establishment that over the course of the Cold War has spun out of control and now threatens not only the fundamental institutions of democracy, but even of life on the planet through the growing risk of nuclear war by miscalculation&quot;

Wolin, too, analyzes the symbiosis of business and public interests that emerged in the Cold War to form the &quot;tendency&quot; of what he calls &quot;inverted totalitarianism&quot;:

While exploiting the authority and resources of the state, [inverted totalitarianism] gains its dynamic by combining with other forms of power, such as evangelical religions, and most notably by encouraging a symbiotic relationship between traditional government and the system of &quot;private&quot; governance represented by the modern business corporation. The result is not a system of codetermination by equal partners who retain their respective identities but rather a system that represents the political coming-of-age of corporate power.

Elsewhere, in a 2003 article entitled &quot;Inverted Totalitarianism&quot; Wolin cites phenomena such as the lack of involvement of citizens in a narrow political framework (due to the influence of money), the privatization of social security, and massive increases in military spending and spending on surveillance as examples of the push away from public and towards private-controlled government. Corporate influence, he argues, is explicit through the media, and implicit through the privatization of the university. Furthermore, he contends that many political think-tanks have abetted this process by spreading conservative ideology. Wolin states: &quot;[With] the elements all in place...what is at stake, then, is nothing less than the attempted transformation of a tolerably free society into a variant of the extreme regimes of the past century.&quot;

Slavoj Žižek, in his 2002 book of essays &quot;Welcome to the Desert of the Real&quot;, comes to similar conclusions. He argues that the war on terror served as a justification for the suspension of civil liberties in the US, while the promise of democracy and freedom was spread abroad as the justification for invading Iraq and Afghanistan. Since Western democracies are always justifying states of exception, he argues, they are failing as sites of political agency.

<doc id="154907" wikidata="Q349868" url="?curid=154907" title="Angle modulation">
<text>Angle modulation is a class of carrier modulation that is used in telecommunications transmission systems. The class comprises frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM), and is based on altering the frequency or the phase, respectively, of a carrier signal to encode the message signal. This contrasts with varying the amplitude of the carrier, practiced in amplitude modulation (AM) transmission, the earliest of the major modulation methods used widely in early radio broadcasting.

== Foundation ==
In general form, an analog modulation process of a sinusoidal carrier wave may be described by the following equation:

:formula_1.

&quot;A(t)&quot; represents the time-varying amplitude of the sinusoidal carrier wave and the cosine-term is the carrier at its angular frequency formula_2, and the instantaneous phase deviation formula_3. This description directly provides the two major groups of modulation, amplitude modulation and angle modulation. In amplitude modulation, the angle term is held constant, while in angle modulation the term &quot;A(t)&quot; is constant and the second term of the equation has a functional relationship to the modulating message signal.

The functional form of the cosine term, which contains the expression of the instantaneous phase formula_4 as its argument, provides the distinction of the two types of angle modulation, frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM). In FM the message signal causes a functional variation of the instantaneous frequency. These variations are controlled by both the frequency and the amplitude of the modulating wave. In phase modulation, the instantaneous phase deviation formula_3 of the carrier is controlled by the modulating waveform, such that the principal frequency remains constant.

For angle modulation, the instantaneous frequency of an angle-modulated carrier wave is given by the first derivative with respect to time of the instantaneous phase:
: formula_6
in which formula_7 may be defined as the instantaneous frequency deviation, measured in rad/s.

For frequency modulation (FM), the modulating signal formula_8 is related linearly to the instantaneous frequency deviation, that is formula_9 which gives the FM modulated waveform asformula_10For phase modulation (PM), the modulating signal formula_8 is related linearly to the instantaneous phase deviation, that is formula_12 which gives the PM modulated waveform asformula_13In principle, the modulating signal in both frequency and phase modulation may either be analog in nature, or it may be digital. In general, however, when using digital signals to modify the carrier wave, the method is called &quot;keying&quot;, rather than modulation. Thus, telecommunications modems use frequency-shift keying (FSK), phase-shift keying (PSK), or amplitude-phase keying (APK), or various combinations. Furthermore, another digital modulation is line coding, which uses a baseband carrier, rather than a passband wave.

The methods of angle modulation can provide better discrimination against interference and noise than amplitude modulation. These improvements, however, are a tradeoff against increased bandwidth requirements.

==Frequency modulation==
Frequency modulation is widely used for FM broadcasting of radio programming, and largely supplanted amplitude modulation for this purpose starting in the 1930s, with its invention by American engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1933. FM also has many other applications, such as in two-way radio communications, and in FM synthesis for music synthesizers.

==Phase modulation==
Phase modulation is important in major application areas including cellular and satellite telecommunications, as well as in data networking methods, such as in some digital subscriber line systems, and WiFi.

The combination of phase modulation with amplitude modulation, practiced as early as 1874 by Thomas Edison in the quadruplex telegraph for transmitting four signals, two each in both directions of transmission, constitutes the polar modulation technique.

<text>The Regency era of British history is commonly understood as the years between and 1837, although the official regency for which it is named only spanned the years 1811 to 1820. King George III first suffered debilitating illness in the late 1780s, and relapsed into his final mental illness in 1810. By the Regency Act 1811, his eldest son George, Prince of Wales, was appointed Prince Regent to discharge royal functions. When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent succeeded him as George IV. In terms of periodisation, the longer timespan is roughly the final third of the Georgian era (1714–1837), encompassing the last 25 years or so of George III&#x27;s reign, including the official Regency, and the complete reigns of both George IV and his brother and successor William IV. It ends with the accession of Queen Victoria in June 1837 and is followed by the Victorian era (1837–1901).

Although the Regency era is remembered as a time of refinement and culture, that was the preserve of the wealthy few, especially those in the Prince Regent&#x27;s own social circle. For the masses, poverty was rampant as urban population density rose due to industrial labour migration. City dwellers lived in increasingly larger slums, a state of affairs severely aggravated by the combined impact of war, economic collapse, mass unemployment, a bad harvest in 1816 (the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;), and an ongoing population boom. Political response to the crisis included the Corn Laws, the Peterloo Massacre, and the Representation of the People Act 1832. Led by William Wilberforce, there was increasing support for the abolitionist cause during the Regency era, culminating in passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807 and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.

The longer timespan recognises the wider social and cultural aspects of the Regency era, characterised by the distinctive fashions, architecture and style of the period. The first 20 years to 1815 were overshadowed by the Napoleonic Wars. Throughout the whole period, the Industrial Revolution gathered pace and achieved significant progress by the coming of the railways and the growth of the factory system. The Regency era overlapped with Romanticism and many of the major artists, musicians, novelists and poets of the Romantic movement were prominent Regency figures, such as Jane Austen, William Blake, Lord Byron, John Constable, John Keats, John Nash, Ann Radcliffe, Walter Scott, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, J. M. W. Turner and William Wordsworth.

== Legislative background ==

George III (1738–1820) became King of Great Britain on 25 October 1760 when he was 22 years old, succeeding his grandfather George II. George III had himself been the subject of legislation to provide for a regency when Parliament passed the Minority of Successor to Crown Act 1751 following the death of his father Frederick, Prince of Wales, on 31 March 1751. George became heir apparent at the age of 12 and he would have succeeded as a minor if his grandfather had died before 4 June 1756, George&#x27;s 18th birthday. As a contingency, the Act provided for his mother, Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, to be appointed regent and discharge most but not all royal functions.

In 1761, George III married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and over the following years they had 15 children (nine sons and six daughters). The eldest was Prince George, born on 12 August 1762 as heir apparent. He was named Prince of Wales soon after his birth. By 1765, three infant children led the order of succession and Parliament again passed a Regency Act as contingency. The Minority of Heir to the Crown Act 1765 provided for either Queen Charlotte or Princess Augusta to act as regent if necessary. George III had a long episode of mental illness in the summer of 1788. Parliament proposed the Regency Bill 1789 which was passed by the House of Commons. Before the House of Lords could debate it, the King recovered and the Bill was withdrawn. Had it been passed into law, the Prince of Wales would have become the regent in 1789.

The King&#x27;s mental health continued to be a matter of concern but, whenever he was of sound mind, he opposed any further moves to implement a Regency Act. Finally, following the death on 2 November 1810 of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia, he became permanently insane. Parliament passed the Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811, commonly known as the Regency Act 1811. The King was suspended from his duties as head of state and the Prince of Wales assumed office as Prince Regent on 5 February 1811. At first, Parliament restricted some of the Regent&#x27;s powers, but the constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act. The Regency ended when George III died on 29 January 1820 and the Prince Regent succeeded him as George IV.

After George IV died in 1830, a further Regency Act was passed by Parliament. George IV was succeeded by his brother William IV. His wife, Queen Adelaide, was 37 and there were no surviving legitimate children. The heir presumptive was Princess Victoria of Kent, aged eleven. The new Act provided for her mother, Victoria, Dowager Duchess of Kent to become regent in the event of William&#x27;s death before 24 May 1837, the young Victoria&#x27;s 18th birthday. The Act made allowance for Adelaide having another child, either before or after William&#x27;s death. If the latter scenario had arisen, Victoria would have become Queen only temporarily until the new monarch was born. Adelaide had no more children and, as it happened, William died on 20 June 1837, just four weeks after Victoria was 18.

== Perceptions ==

=== Periodisation terminology ===

Officially, the Regency began on 5 February 1811 and ended on 29 January 1820 but the &quot;Regency era&quot;, as such, is generally perceived to have been much longer. The term is commonly, though loosely, applied to the period from until the accession of Queen Victoria on 20 June 1837. The Regency Era is a sub-period of the longer Georgian era (1714–1837), both of which were followed by the Victorian era (1837–1901). The latter term had contemporaneous usage although some historians give it an earlier startpoint, typically the enactment of the Great Reform Act on 7 June 1832.

=== Social, economic and political counterpoints ===

The Prince Regent himself was one of the leading patrons of the arts and architecture. He ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the exotic Brighton Pavilion, the ornate Carlton House, and many other public works and architecture. This all required considerable expense which neither the Regent himself nor HM Treasury could afford. The Regent&#x27;s extravagance was pursued at the expense of the common people.

While the Regency is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture, there was a concurrent need for social, political and economic change. The country was enveloped in the Napoleonic Wars until June 1815 and the conflict heavily impacted commerce at home and internationally. There was mass unemployment and, in 1816, an exceptionally bad harvest. In addition, the country underwent a population boom and the combination of these factors resulted in rampant poverty. Apart from the national unity government led by William Grenville from February 1806 to March 1807, all governments from December 1783 to November 1830 were formed and led by Tories. Their responses to the national crisis included the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 and the various Corn Laws. The Whig government of Earl Grey passed the Great Reform Act in 1832.

Essentially, England during the Regency era was a stratified society in which political power and influence lay in the hands of the landed class. Their fashionable locales were worlds apart from the slums in which the majority of people existed. The slum districts were known as rookeries, a notorious example being St Giles in London. These were places where alcoholism, gambling, prostitution, thievery and violence prevailed. The population boom, comprising an increase from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820, heightened the crisis. Robert Southey drew a comparison between the squalor of the slums and the glamour of the Regent&#x27;s circle:
The squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of Regency society provided sharp contrast to the Prince Regent&#x27;s social circle. Poverty was addressed only marginally. The formation of the Regency after the retirement of George III saw the end of a more pious and reserved society, and gave birth of a more frivolous, ostentatious one. This change was influenced by the Regent himself, who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits. This did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction, thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet, as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father.
== The arts ==

=== Architecture ===

==== Regent&#x27;s Park and London Zoo ====

In the 1810s, the Prince Regent proposed the conversion of Crown land in Marylebone and St Pancras into a pleasure garden. The design work was initially assigned to the architect John Nash but it was the father and son partnership of James and Decimus Burton who had the majority of input to the project. Landscaping continued through the 1820s and Regent&#x27;s Park was finally opened to the public in 1841.

The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) was founded in 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles and Sir Humphry Davy. They obtained land alongside the route of the Regent&#x27;s Canal through the northern perimeter of Regent&#x27;s Park, between the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Camden. Following the death of Raffles soon afterwards, the 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne assumed responsibility for the project and supervised construction of the first animal houses. At first, the zoo was used for scientific purposes only with admittance restricted to Fellows of the ZSL which, in 1829, was granted a Royal charter by George IV. The zoo was not opened to the public until 1847, after it became necessary to raise funds.

=== Literature ===

Jane Austen, Lord Byron, Walter Scott and others were the most prominent writers of the Regency era. However, the time period also produced some of the 19th century&#x27;s most prolific writers such as Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, and Benjamin Disraeli. Especially popular forms of literature at this time were novels and poetry, such as Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Regent&#x27;s Bomb.&quot;

=== Music ===

Wealthy households staged their own music events by relying on family members who could sing or play an instrument. For the vast majority of people, street performers provided their sole access to music of any kind. However, the upper class enjoyed music such as Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 30, Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Sonata in F major, MWV Q 7, and much more. Especially popular composers of the time included Beethoven, Rossini, Liszt, and Mendelssohn.

=== Painting ===

The most prominent landscape painters were John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. Notable portrait painters include Thomas Lawrence and Martin Archer Shee, both Presidents of the Royal Academy. The National Gallery was established in London in 1824.

=== Theatre ===
The plays of William Shakespeare were very popular throughout the period. The performers wore modern dress, however, rather than 16th-century costumes.

London had three patent theatres at Covent Garden, Drury Lane and the Haymarket. Other prominent theatres were the Theatre Royal, Bath and the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin. The playwright and politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan controlled the Drury Lane Theatre until it burned down in 1809.

== Media ==

Among the popular newspapers, pamphlets and other publications of the era were:

* &quot;Ackermann&#x27;s Repository&quot;
* &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;
* &quot;The Times&quot;
* &quot;The Observer&quot;
* &quot;Cobbett&#x27;s Weekly Political Register&quot;
* &quot;La Belle Assemblée&quot;

== Science and technology ==

In 1814, &quot;The Times&quot; adopted steam printing. Using this method, it could print 1,100 sheets every hour, five and a half times the prior rate of 200 per hour. The faster speed of printing enabled the rise of the &quot;silver fork novels&quot; which depicted the lives of the rich and aristocratic. Publishers used these as a way of spreading gossip and scandal, often clearly hinting at identities. The novels were popular during the later years of the Regency era.

== Sport and recreation ==

=== Women&#x27;s activities ===

During the Regency era and well into the succeeding Victorian era, society women were discouraged from exertion although many did take the opportunity to pursue activities such as dancing, riding and walking that were recreational rather than competitive. Depending on a lady&#x27;s rank, she may be expected to be proficient in reading and writing, mathematics, dancing, music, sewing, and embroidery. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, the Bennet sisters are frequently out walking and it is at a ball where Elizabeth meets Mr Darcy. There was a contemporary belief that people had limited energy levels with women, as the &quot;weaker sex&quot;, being most at risk of over-exertion because their menstruation cycles caused periodic energy reductions.

=== Balls ===
One of the most common activities among the upper class was attending and hosting balls, house parties, and more. These often included dancing, food, and gossip. The food generally served included items such as white soup made with veal stock, almonds and cream, cold meats, salads, etc.

=== Bare-knuckle boxing ===
Bare-knuckle boxing, also known as prizefighting, was a popular sport through the 18th and 19th centuries. The Regency era has been called &quot;the peak of British boxing&quot; because the champion fighter in Britain was also, in effect, the world champion. Britain&#x27;s only potential rival was the United States, where organised boxing began . Boxing was in fact illegal but local authorities, who were often involved on the gambling side of the sport, would turn a blind eye. In any case, the huge crowds that attended championship bouts were almost impossible to police. Like cricket and horse racing, boxing attracted gamblers. The sport needed the investment provided by gambling, but there was a seamier side in that many fights were fixed.

At one time, prizefighting was &quot;anything goes&quot; but the champion boxer Jack Broughton proposed a set of rules in 1743 that were observed throughout the Regency era until they were superseded by the London Prize Ring Rules in 1838. Broughton&#x27;s rules were a reaction to &quot;bar room brawling&quot; as they restricted fighters to use of the fists only. A round ended when a fighter was grounded and the rules prohibited the hitting of a downed opponent. He was helped to his corner and then had thirty seconds in which to &quot;step up to the mark&quot;, which was a line drawn for that purpose so that the fighters squared off less than a yard apart. The next round would then begin. A fighter who failed to step up and square off was declared the loser. Contests continued until one fighter could not step up.

There were no weight divisions and so a heavyweight always had a natural advantage over smaller fighters. Even so, the first British champion of the Regency era was Daniel Mendoza, a middleweight who had successfully claimed the vacant title in 1792. He held it until he was defeated by the heavyweight Gentleman John Jackson in April 1795. Other Regency era champions were famous fighters like Jem Belcher, Hen Pearce, John Gully, Tom Cribb, Tom Spring, Jem Ward and James Burke. Gully went on to become a successful racehorse owner and, representing the Pontefract constituency, a Member of the first post-Reform Parliament from December 1832 to July 1837. Cribb was the first fighter to be acclaimed world champion after he twice defeated the American Tom Molineaux in 1811.

=== Cricket ===

Marylebone Cricket Club, widely known as MCC, was founded in 1787 and became cricket&#x27;s governing body. In 1788, the club drafted and published a revised version of the sport&#x27;s rules. MCC had considerable influence throughout the Regency era and its ground, Lord&#x27;s, became cricket&#x27;s premier venue. There were in fact three Lord&#x27;s grounds. The first, opened in 1787 when the club was formed, was on the site of Dorset Square in Marylebone, hence the name of the club. The lease was terminated in 1811 because of a rental dispute and the club took temporary lease of a second ground in St John&#x27;s Wood. This was in use for only three seasons until the land was requisitioned because it was on the proposed route of the Regent&#x27;s Canal. MCC moved to a nearby site on which they established their present ground.

Lord Byron played for Harrow School in the first Eton v Harrow match at Lord&#x27;s in 1805. The match became an annual event in the social calendar.

Lord&#x27;s staged the first Gentlemen v Players match in 1806. This fixture provides another illustration of the class divide in Regency society as it matched a team of well-to-do amateurs (Gentlemen) against a team of working-class professionals (Players). The first match featured Billy Beldham and William Lambert, who have been recognised as the outstanding professionals of the period, and Lord Frederick Beauclerk as the outstanding amateur player. The 1821 match ended prematurely after the Gentlemen team, well behind in the contest, conceded defeat. This had been billed as the &quot;Coronation Match&quot; because it celebrated the accession of the Prince Regent as King George IV and the outcome was described by the sports historian Sir Derek Birley as &quot;a suitably murky affair&quot;.

=== Football ===
Football in Great Britain had long been a no-holds-barred pastime with an unlimited number of players on opposing teams which might comprise whole parishes or villages. The playing area was an undefined stretch of land between the two places. The ball, as such, was often a pig&#x27;s bladder that had been inflated and the object of the exercise was to move the ball by any means possible to a distant target such as a church in the opposing village. The contests were typically arranged to take place on feast days like Shrove Tuesday. By the beginning of the 19th century, efforts were being made in the English public schools to transform this mob football into an organised team sport. The earliest-known versions of football code rules were written at Eton College (1815) and Aldenham School (1825).

=== Horse racing ===

Horse racing had been very popular since the years after the Restoration when Charles II was a frequent visitor to Newmarket Racecourse. In the Regency era, the five classic races had all been inaugurated and have been run annually since 1814. These races are the St Leger Stakes (first run in 1776), The Oaks (1779), the Epsom Derby (1780), the 2,000 Guineas Stakes (1809) and the 1,000 Guineas Stakes (1814).

National Hunt racing began in 18th century Ireland and developed in England through the Regency era. There are tentative references to races held between 1792 and 1810. The first definitely recorded hurdle race took place on Durdham Down, near Bristol, in 1821. The first officially recognised steeplechase was over a cross-country route in Bedfordshire on 8 March 1830.

Aintree Racecourse held its first meeting on 7 July 1829. On 29 February 1836, a race called the Grand Liverpool Steeplechase was held. One of its organisers was Captain Martin Becher who rode The Duke to victory. The infamous sixth fence at Aintree is called Becher&#x27;s Brook. The 1836 race, which became an annual event, is recognised by some as the first Grand National, but there are historical uncertainties about the three races between 1836 and 1838 so they are officially regarded as precursors to the Grand National. Some sources insist they were held on Old Racecourse Farm in nearby Maghull but this is impossible as that course closed in 1835. The first official Grand National was the 1839 race.

=== Rowing and sailing ===

Rowing and sailing had become popular pastimes among the wealthier citizens. The Boat Race, a rowing event between the Cambridge University Boat Club and the Oxford University Boat Club, was first held in 1829 at the instigation of Charles Merivale and Charles Wordsworth, who were students at Cambridge and Oxford, respectively. Wordsworth was a nephew of William Wordsworth. The first race was at Henley-on-Thames and the contest later became an annual event on the River Thames in London. In sailing, the first Cowes Week regatta was held on the Solent in August 1826.

=== Track and field athletics ===

Track and field competitions in the modern sense were first recorded in the early 19th century. They are known to have been held by schools, colleges, army and navy bases, social clubs and the like, often as a challenge to a rival establishment. In the public schools, athletics competitions were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing or fox hunting with runners known as &quot;hounds&quot; and named as if they were racehorses. The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt, established in 1819, is the world&#x27;s oldest running club. The school organised paper chase races in which the hounds followed a trail of paper shreds left by two &quot;foxes&quot;. The oldest running race of the modern era is Shrewsbury&#x27;s Annual Steeplechase (cross-country), first definitely recorded in 1834.

<doc id="154909" wikidata="Q9246" url="?curid=154909" title="Mongolian language">
<text>Mongolian is the principal language of the Mongolic language family that originated in the Mongolian Plateau. It is spoken by ethnic Mongols and other closely related Mongolic peoples who are native to modern Mongolia and surrounding parts of East and North Asia. Mongolian is the official language of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia and a recognized language of Xinjiang and Qinghai.

The number of speakers across all its dialects may be 5–6 million, including the vast majority of the residents of Mongolia and many of the ethnic Mongol residents of the Inner Mongolia of China. In Mongolia, Khalkha Mongolian is predominant, and is currently written in both Cyrillic and the traditional Mongolian script. In Inner Mongolia, it is dialectally more diverse and written in the traditional Mongolian script. However, Mongols in both countries often use the Latin script for convenience on the Internet.

In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is the standard written Khalkha formalized in the writing conventions and in grammar as taught in schools, but much of it is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar Mongolian.

Some classify several other Mongolic languages like Buryat and Oirat as varieties of Mongolian, but this classification is not in line with the current international standard.

Mongolian is a language with vowel harmony and a complex syllabic structure compared to other Mongolic languages, allowing clusters of up to three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–verb, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, as grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.

Modern Mongolian evolved from Middle Mongol, the language spoken in the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries. In the transition, a major shift in the vowel-harmony paradigm occurred, long vowels developed, the case system changed slightly, and the verbal system was restructured. Mongolian is related to the extinct Khitan language. It was believed that Mongolian was related to Turkic, Tungusic, Korean and Japonic languages but this view is now seen as obsolete by a majority of (but not all) comparative linguists. These languages have been grouped under the Altaic language family and contrasted with the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area. However, instead of a common genetic origin, Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak proposed that Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages form a language &quot;Sprachbund&quot;, rather than common origin. Mongolian literature is well attested in written form from the 13th century but has earlier Mongolic precursors in the literature of the Khitan and other Xianbei peoples. The Bugut inscription dated to 584 CE and the Inscription of Hüis Tolgoi dated to 604–620 CE appear to be the oldest substantial Mongolic or Para-Mongolic texts discovered.

== Name ==
Writers such as Owen Lattimore referred to Mongolian as &quot;the Mongol language&quot;.

== History ==
The earliest surviving Mongolian text may be the , a report on sports composed in Mongolian script on stone, which is most often dated at 1224 or 1225. The Mongolian-Armenian wordlist of 55 words compiled by Kirakos of Gandzak (13th century) is the first written record of Mongolian words. From the 13th to the 15th centuries, Mongolian language texts were written in four scripts (not counting some vocabulary written in Western scripts): Uyghur Mongolian (UM) script (an adaptation of the Uyghur alphabet ), &#x27;Phags-pa script (Ph) (used in decrees), Chinese (SM) (&quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;), and Arabic (AM) (used in dictionaries). While they are the earliest texts available, these texts have come to be called &quot;Middle Mongol&quot; in scholarly practice. The documents in UM script show some distinct linguistic characteristics and are therefore often distinguished by terming their language &quot;Preclassical Mongolian&quot;.

The Yuan dynasty referred to the Mongolian language in Chinese as &quot;Guoyu&quot; (), which means &quot;National language&quot;, a term also used by other non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages such as the Manchu language during the Qing dynasty, the Jurchen language during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), the Khitan language during the Liao dynasty, and the Xianbei language during the Northern Wei period.

The next distinct period is Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language with a high degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.

== Geographic distribution ==

Mongolian is the official national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not always written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and the official provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country&#x27;s 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country&#x27;s citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia&#x27;s urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols so they can benefit from the preferential policies for minorities in education, healthcare, family planning, school admissions, the hiring and promotion, the financing and taxation of businesses, and regional infrastructural support given to ethnic minorities in China. In 2020, the Chinese government required three subjects—language and literature, politics, and history—to be taught in Mandarin in Mongolian-language primary and secondary schools in the Inner Mongolia since September, which caused widespread protests among ethnic Mongol communities. These protests were quickly suppressed by the Chinese government. Mandarin has been deemed the only language of instruction for all subjects as of September 2023.

== Classification and varieties ==
Mongolian belongs to the Mongolic languages. The delimitation of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded by the fact that existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.

In Juha Janhunen&#x27;s book titled &quot;Mongolian&quot;, he groups the Mongolic language family into four distinct linguistic branches:
* the Dagur branch, made up of just the Dagur language, which is spoken in the northeast area of Manchuria in China, specifically in Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner of Hulunbuir, and in Meilisi Daur District of Qiqihar, Heilongjiang;
* the Moghol branch, made up of just the Moghol language, spoken in Afghanistan, and is possibly extinct;
* the Shirongolic (or Southern Mongolic) branch, made up of roughly seven languages, which are spoken in the Amdo region of Tibet;
* the Common Mongolic (or Central Mongolic) branch, made up of roughly six language varieties, to which Mongolian proper belongs.

The Common Mongolic branch is grouped in the following way:
* Khalkha () is spoken in Mongolia, but some dialects (e.g. Cahar) are also spoken in the Inner Mongolia region of China.
* Khorchin () is spoken to the east in eastern Inner Mongolia and Manchuria.
* Ordos is spoken to the south, in Ordos City in Inner Mongolia.
* Oirat, is spoken to the west, in Dzungaria.
* Khamnigan () is spoken in northeast Mongolia and in northwest of Manchuria.
* Buryat () is spoken to the north, in the Republic of Buryatia of Russia, as well as in the Barga region of Hulun Buir League in Inner Mongolia.

There is no disagreement that the Khalkha dialect of the Mongolian state is Mongolian. However, the status of certain varieties in the Common Mongolic group—whether they are languages distinct from Mongolian or just dialects of it—is disputed. There are at least three such varieties: Oirat (including the Kalmyk variety) and Buryat, both of which are spoken in Russia, Mongolia, and China; and Ordos, spoken around Inner Mongolia&#x27;s Ordos City. The influential classification of Sanžeev (1953) proposed a &quot;Mongolian language&quot; consisting of just the three dialects Khalkha, Chakhar, and Ordos, with Buryat and Oirat judged to be independent languages. On the other hand, Luvsanvandan (1959) proposed a much broader &quot;Mongolian language&quot; consisting of a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, Kalmyk), and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties). Additionally, the &quot;Language Policy in the People&#x27;s Republic of China: Theory and Practice Since 1949&quot;, states that Mongolian can be classified into four dialects: the Khalkha dialect in the middle, the Horcin-Haracin dialect in the East, Oriat-Hilimag in the west, and Bargu–Buriyad in the north.

Some Western scholars propose that the relatively well researched Ordos variety is an independent language due to its conservative syllable structure and phoneme inventory. While the placement of a variety like Alasha, which is under the cultural influence of Inner Mongolia but historically tied to Oirat, and of other border varieties like Darkhad would very likely remain problematic in any classification, the central problem remains the question of how to classify Chakhar, Khalkha, and Khorchin in relation to each other and in relation to Buryat and Oirat. The split of into before *i and before all other reconstructed vowels, which is found in Mongolia but not in Inner Mongolia, is often cited as a fundamental distinction, for example Proto-Mongolic , Khalkha , Chakhar &#x27;year&#x27; versus Proto-Mongolic , Khalkha , Chakhar &#x27;few&#x27;. On the other hand, the split between the past tense verbal suffixes - in the Central varieties v. - in the Eastern varieties is usually seen as a merely stochastic difference.

In Inner Mongolia, official language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: Standard Mongolian of Inner Mongolia, Oirat, and Barghu-Buryat. The Standard Mongolian of Inner Mongolia is said to consist of Chakhar, Ordos, Baarin, Khorchin, Kharchin, and Alasha. The authorities have synthesized a literary standard for Mongolian in whose grammar is said to be based on the Standard Mongolian of Inner Mongolia and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner. Dialectologically, however, western Mongolian dialects in Inner Mongolia are closer to Khalkha than they are to eastern Mongolian dialects in Inner Mongolia: e.g. Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.

===Standard varieties===
There are two standard varieties of Mongolian.

==== Mongolia ====
Standard Mongolian in the state of Mongolia is based on the northern Khalkha Mongolian dialects, which include the dialect of Ulaanbaatar, and is written in the Mongolian Cyrillic script.

==== China ====
Standard Mongolian in Inner Mongolia is based on the Chakhar Mongolian of the Khalkha dialect group, spoken in the Shuluun Huh/Zhènglán Banner, and is written in the traditional Mongolian script.

The number of Mongolian speakers in China is still larger than in the state of Mongolia, where the majority of Mongolians in China speak one of the Khorchin dialects, or rather more than two million of them speak the Khorchin dialect itself as their mother tongue, so that the Khorchin dialect group has about as many speakers as the Khalkha dialect group in the State of Mongolia. Nevertheless, the Chakhar dialect, which today has only about 100,000 native speakers and belongs to the Khalkha dialect group, is the basis of standard Mongolian in China.

==== Differences ====
The characteristic differences in the pronunciation of the two standard varieties include the umlauts in Inner Mongolia and the palatalized consonants in Mongolia (see below) as well as the splitting of the Middle Mongol affricates * ( &#x27;) and * ( &#x27;) into ( ) and ( ) versus ( ) and ( ) in Mongolia:

Aside from these differences in pronunciation, there are also differences in vocabulary and language use: in the state of Mongolia more loanwords from Russian are being used, while in Inner Mongolia more loanwords from Chinese have been adopted.

== Phonology ==
The following description is based primarily on the Khalkha dialect as spoken in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia&#x27;s capital. The phonologies of other varieties such as Ordos, Khorchin, and even Chakhar, differ considerably. This section discusses the phonology of Khalkha Mongolian with subsections on Vowels, Consonants, Phonotactics and Stress.

=== Vowels ===
The standard language has seven monophthong vowel phonemes. They are aligned into three vowel harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); the groups are −ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings &#x27;ö&#x27; and &#x27;ü&#x27; are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.

Length is phonemic for vowels, and except short [e], which has merged into short [i], at least in Ulaanbaatar dialect, each of the other six phonemes occurs both short and long. Phonetically, short has become centralised to the central vowel .

In the following table, the seven vowel phonemes, with their length variants, are arranged and described phonetically. The vowels in the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet are: 
:

Khalkha also has four diphthongs: historically but are pronounced more like ; e.g. ой in () &#x27;dog&#x27;, ай in () sea&#x27;, уй in () &#x27;to cry&#x27;, үй in () &#x27;factory&#x27;, эй in () &#x27;necessary&#x27;. There are three additional rising diphthongs (иа), (уа) (эй); e.g. иа in () &#x27;individually&#x27;, уа in () &#x27;barracks&#x27;.

==== Allophones ====
This table below lists vowel allophones (short vowels allophones in non-initial positions are used interchangeably with schwa):
==== ATR harmony ====

Mongolian divides vowels into three groups in a system of vowel harmony:

For historical reasons, these have been traditionally labeled as &quot;front&quot; vowels and &quot;back&quot; vowels, as /o/ and /u/ developed from /ø/ and /y/, while /ɔ/ and /ʊ/ developed from /o/ and /u/ in Middle Mongolian. Indeed, in Mongolian romanizations, the vowels and are often conventionally rendered as and , while the vowels and are expressed as and . However, for modern Mongolian phonology, it is more appropriate to instead characterize the two vowel-harmony groups by the dimension of tongue root position. There is also one neutral vowel, , not belonging to either group.

All the vowels in a noncompound word, including all its suffixes, must belong to the same group. If the first vowel is −ATR, then every vowel of the word must be either or a −ATR vowel. Likewise, if the first vowel is a +ATR vowel, then every vowel of the word must be either or a +ATR vowel. In the case of suffixes, which must change their vowels to conform to different words, two patterns predominate. Some suffixes contain an archiphoneme that can be realized as ; e.g.
* &#x27;household&#x27; + (instrumental) → &#x27;by a household&#x27;
* &#x27;sentry&#x27; + (instrumental) → &#x27;by a sentry&#x27;

Other suffixes can occur in being realized as , in which case all −ATR vowels lead to and all +ATR vowels lead to ; e.g.
* &#x27;to take&quot;l&#x27; + (causative) → 

If the only vowel in the word stem is , the suffixes will use the +ATR suffix forms.

==== Rounding harmony ====
Mongolian also has rounding harmony, which does not apply to close vowels. If a stem contains (or ), a suffix that is specified for an open vowel will have (or , respectively) as well. However, this process is blocked by the presence of (or ) and ; e.g. &#x27;came in&#x27;, but &#x27;inserted&#x27;.

==== Vowel length ====
The pronunciation of long and short vowels depends on the syllable&#x27;s position in the word. In word-initial syllables, there is a phonemic contrast in vowel length. A long vowel has about 208% the length of a short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.

=== Consonants ===
The following table lists the consonants of Khalkha Mongolian. The consonants enclosed in parentheses occur only in loanwords. The occurrence of palatalized consonant phonemes, except , is restricted to words with [−ATR] vowels.

A rare feature among the world&#x27;s languages, Mongolian has neither a voiced lateral approximant, such as , nor the voiceless velar plosive ; instead, it has a voiced alveolar lateral fricative, , which is often realized as voiceless . In word-final position, (if not followed by a vowel in historical forms) is realized as . Aspirated consonants are preaspirated in medial and word-final contexts, devoicing preceding consonants and vowels. Devoiced short vowels are often deleted.

=== Syllable structure and phonotactics ===
The maximal syllable is CVVCCC, where the last C is a word-final suffix. A single short vowel rarely appears in syllable-final position. If a word was monosyllabic historically, *CV has become CVV. In native words, the following consonants do not occur word-initially: , , , , , , , and . is restricted to codas (else it becomes ), and and do not occur in codas for historical reasons. For two-consonant clusters, the following restrictions obtain:
* a palatalized consonant can be preceded only by another palatalized consonant or sometimes by and 
* may precede only and 
* does not seem to appear in second position
* and do not occur as first consonant and as second consonant only if preceded by or or their palatalized counterparts.

Clusters that do not conform to these restrictions will be broken up by an epenthetic nonphonemic vowel in a syllabification that takes place from right to left. For instance, &#x27;two&#x27;, &#x27;work&#x27;, and &#x27;neutral&#x27; are, phonemically, , , and respectively. In such cases, an epenthetic vowel is inserted to prevent disallowed consonant clusters. Thus, in the examples given above, the words are phonetically , , and . The phonetic form of the epenthetic vowel follows from vowel harmony triggered by the vowel in the preceding syllable. Usually it is a centralized version of the same sound, with the following exceptions: preceding produces ; will be ignored if there is a nonneutral vowel earlier in the word; and a postalveolar or palatalized consonant will be followed by an epenthetic , as in .

=== Stress ===
Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not distinguish different meanings) and thus is considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.

Walker (1997) proposes that stress falls on the rightmost heavy syllable unless this syllable is word-final:

A &quot;heavy syllable&quot; is defined as one that is at least the length of a full vowel; short word-initial syllables are thereby excluded. If a word is bisyllabic and the only heavy syllable is word-final, it gets stressed anyway. In cases where there is only one phonemic short word-initial syllable, even this syllable can get the stress:

More recently, the most extensive collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies has been applied to a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.

== Grammar ==
The grammar in this article is also based primarily on Khalkha Mongolian. Unlike the phonology, most of what is said about morphology and syntax also holds true for Chakhar, while Khorchin is somewhat more diverse.

=== Morphology ===
Modern Mongolian is an agglutinative—almost exclusively suffixing—language, with the only exception being reduplication. Mongolian also does not have gendered nouns, or definite articles like &quot;the&quot;. Most of the suffixes consist of a single morpheme. There are many derivational morphemes. For example, the word consists of the root &#x27;to be&#x27;, an epenthetic ‑‑, the causative ‑‑ (hence &#x27;to cause to be&#x27;, to found), the derivative suffix ‑ that forms nouns created by the action (like -&quot;ation&quot; in &quot;organisation&quot;) and the complex suffix ‑ denoting something that belongs to the modified word (‑ would be genitive).

Nominal compounds are quite frequent. Some derivational verbal suffixes are rather productive, e.g. &#x27;to speak&#x27;, &#x27;to speak with each other&#x27;. Formally, the independent words derived using verbal suffixes can roughly be divided into three classes: final verbs, which can only be used sentence-finally, i.e. ‑ (mainly future or generic statements) or ‑ (second person imperative); participles (often called &quot;verbal nouns&quot;), which can be used clause-finally or attributively, i.e. ‑ (perfect-past) or ‑ &#x27;want to&#x27;; and converbs, which can link clauses or function adverbially, i.e. ‑ (qualifies for any adverbial function or neutrally connects two sentences) or ‑ (the action of the main clause takes place until the action expressed by the suffixed verb begins).

=== Nouns ===
Roughly speaking, Mongolian has between seven and nine cases: nominative (unmarked), genitive, dative-locative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative, privative and directive, though the final two are not always considered part of the case paradigm. If a direct object is definite, it must take the accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is indefinite. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern the genitive, dative-locative, comitative and privative cases, including a marked form of the nominative (which can itself then take further case forms). There is also a possible attributive case (when a noun is used attributively), which is unmarked in most nouns but takes the suffix ‑ (‑) when the stem has an unstable nasal. Nouns can also take a reflexive-possessive suffix, indicating that the marked noun is possessed by the subject of the sentence: I friend- save- &quot;I saved my friend&quot;. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis.

&quot;The rules governing the morphology of Mongolian case endings are intricate, and so the rules given below are only indicative. In many situations, further (more general) rules must also be taken into account in order to produce the correct form: these include the presence of an unstable nasal or unstable velar, as well as the rules governing when a penultimate vowel should be deleted from the stem with certain case endings (e.g. &#x27; () → &#x27; ()). The additional morphological rules specific to loanwords are not covered.&quot;

==== Nominative case ====
The nominative case is used when a noun (or other part of speech acting as one) is the subject of the sentence, and the agent of whatever action (not just physically) takes place in the sentence. In Mongolian, the nominative case does not have an ending.

==== Accusative case ====
The accusative case is used when a noun acts as a direct object (or just &quot;object&quot;), and receives action from a transitive verb. It is formed by:
# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in long vowels or diphthongs, or when a stem ending in  () has an unstable velar (unstable g).
# ‑ (‑) after back vowel stems ending in unpalatalized consonants (except and ), short vowels (except ) or iotated vowels.
# ‑ (‑) after front vowel stems ending in consonants, short vowels or iotated vowels; and after all stems ending in the palatalized consonants  (),  () and  (), as well as  (),  (),  () or  ().
:&quot;Note: If the stem ends in a short vowel or &quot;&quot; (), it is replaced by the suffix.&quot;

==== Genitive case ====
The genitive case is used to show possession of something.
*For regular stems, it is formed by:
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in the diphthongs  (),  (),  (),  (),  () or  (), or the long vowel  ().
*# ‑ (‑) after back vowel stems ending in  ().
*# ‑ (‑) after front vowel stems ending in  ().
*# ‑ (‑) after back vowel stems ending in unpalatalized consonants (except , and ), short vowels (except ) or iotated vowels.
*# ‑ (‑) after front vowel stems ending in consonants (other than ), short vowels or iotated vowels; and after all stems ending in the palatalized consonants  (),  () and  (), as well as  (),  (),  () or  ().
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in a long vowel (other than ), or after the diphthongs  (),  () or  ().
*:&quot;Note: If the stem ends in a short vowel or &quot;&quot; (), it is replaced by the suffix.&quot;
*For stems with an unstable nasal (unstable n), it is formed by:
*# ‑ (‑) after back vowel stems (other than those ending in or ).
*# ‑ (‑) after front vowel stems (other than those ending in or ).
*# ‑ (‑) after back vowel stems ending in  () or  ().
*# ‑ (‑) after front vowel stems ending in  () or  ().
*:&quot;Note: If the stem ends in &#x27; () or &#x27; (), it is replaced by the suffix.&quot;
*For stems with an unstable velar (unstable g), it is formed by ‑ (‑).

==== Dative-locative case ====
The dative-locative case is used to show the location of something, or to specify that something is in something else.
*For regular stems or those with an unstable velar (unstable g), it is formed by:
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in vowels or the vocalized consonants  (),  () and  (), and a small number of stems ending in  () and  ().
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in  () and  (), most stems ending in  () and  (), and stems ending in  () when it is preceded by a vowel.
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in the palatalized consonants  (),  () and  ().
*# ‑ (‑), ‑ (‑), ‑ (‑) or ‑ (‑) after all other stems (depending on the vowel harmony of the stem).
*For stems with an unstable nasal (unstable n), it is formed by:
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in vowels.
*# ‑ (‑) after stems ending in the palatalized consonants  (),  () and  ().
*# ‑ (‑), ‑ (‑), ‑ (‑) or ‑ (‑) after all other stems (depending on the vowel harmony of the stem).

==== Plurals ====
Source:

Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix. There are four ways of forming plurals in Mongolian:

# Some plurals are formed by adding - &quot;-nuud&quot; or - &quot;-nüüd&quot;. If the last vowel of the previous word is a (a), o (y), or ɔ (o), then - is used; e.g. &quot;harh&quot; &#x27;rat&#x27; becomes &quot;harhnuud&quot; &#x27;rats&#x27;. If the last vowel of the previous word is e (э), ʊ (ө), ü (ү), or i (и) then is used; e.g. &quot;nüd&quot; &#x27;eye&#x27; becomes &quot;nüdnüüd&quot; &#x27;eyes&#x27;.
# In other plurals, just - &quot;-uud&quot; or - &quot;-üüd&quot; is added without the &quot;n&quot;; e.g. &quot;hot&quot; &#x27;city&#x27; becomes &quot;hotuud&quot; &#x27;cities&#x27;, and &quot;eezh&quot; &#x27;mother&#x27; becomes &quot;eezhüüd&quot; &#x27;mothers&#x27;.
# Another way of forming plurals is by adding - &quot;-nar&quot;; e.g. &quot;bagsh&quot; &#x27;teacher&#x27; becomes &quot;bagsh nar&quot; &#x27;teachers&#x27;. 
# The final way is an irregular form used: &quot;hün&quot; &#x27;person&#x27; becomes &quot;hümüüs&quot; &#x27;people&#x27;.

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns exist for the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include interrogative pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials, and particles, the last being rather numerous.

=== Negation ===
Negation is mostly expressed by &quot;-güi&quot; (-) after participles and by the negation particle &quot;bish&quot; () after nouns and adjectives; negation particles preceding the verb (for example in converbal constructions) exist, but tend to be replaced by analytical constructions.

=== Numbers ===
=== Forming questions ===
When asking questions in Mongolian, a question marker is used to show a question is being asked. There are different question markers for yes/no questions and for information questions. For yes/no questions, and are used when the last word ends in a short vowel or a consonant, and their use depends on the vowel harmony of the previous word. When the last word ends in a long vowel or a diphthong, then and are used (again depending on vowel harmony). For information questions (questions asking for information with an interrogative word like who, what, when, where, why, etc.), the question particles are and , depending on the last sound in the previous word.

# Yes/No Question Particles - ()
# Open Ended Question Particles - ()

Basic interrogative pronouns - ( &#x27;what&#x27;), - ( &#x27;where&#x27;), ( &#x27;who&#x27;), ( &#x27;why&#x27;), ( &#x27;how&#x27;), ( &#x27;when&#x27;), ( &#x27;what kind&#x27;)

=== Verbs ===
In Mongolian, verbs have a stem and an ending. For example, the stems , , and are suffixed with , , and respectively: , , and . These are the infinitive or dictionary forms. The present/future tense is formed by adding , , , or to the stem, for example &#x27;I/you/he/she/we/they (will) study&#x27;. is the present/future tense verb for &#x27;to be&#x27;; likewise, is &#x27;to read&#x27;, and is &#x27;to see&#x27;. The final vowel is barely pronounced and is not pronounced at all if the word after begins with a vowel, so is pronounced &#x27;hello, how are you?&#x27;.

# Past Tense ()
# Informed Past Tense (any point in past) ()
# Informed Past Tense (not long ago) ()
# Non-Informed Past Tense (generally a slightly to relatively more distant past) ()
# Present Perfect Tense ()
# Present Progressive Tense ()
# (Reflective) Present Progressive Tense ()
# Simple Present Tense ()
# Simple Future ()
# Infinitive ()

=== Negation ===
There are several ways to form negatives in Mongolian. For example:

# () – the negative form of the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; ( ) – means &#x27;is/are not&#x27;.
# - (). This suffix is added to verbs, so ( &#x27;go/will go&#x27;) becomes ( &#x27;do not go/will not go&#x27;).
# () is the word for &#x27;no&#x27;.
# () is used for negative imperatives; e.g. ( &#x27;don&#x27;t go&#x27;)
# () is the formal version of .

==Syntax==
=== Differential case marking ===
Mongolian uses differential case marking, being a regular differential object marking (DOM) language. DOM emerges from a complicated interaction of factors such as referentiality, animacy and topicality.

Mongolian also exhibits a specific type of differential subject marking (DSM), in which the subjects of embedded clauses (including adverbial clauses) occur with accusative case.

===Phrase structure===
The noun phrase has the order: demonstrative pronoun/numeral, adjective, noun. Attributive sentences precede the whole NP. Titles or occupations of people, low numerals indicating groups, and focus clitics are put behind the head noun. Possessive pronouns (in different forms) may either precede or follow the NP. Examples:

The verbal phrase consists of the predicate in the center, preceded by its complements and by the adverbials modifying it and followed (mainly if the predicate is sentence-final) by modal particles, as in the following example with predicate &quot;bichsen&quot;:

In this clause the adverbial, &quot;helehgüigeer&quot; &#x27;without saying [so]&#x27; must precede the predicate&#x27;s complement, &quot;üüniig&quot; &#x27;it-&#x27; in order to avoid syntactic ambiguity, since &quot;helehgüigeer&quot; is itself derived from a verb and hence an &quot;üüniig&quot; preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as &quot;hurdan&quot; &#x27;fast&#x27;, it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.

For Khalkha, the most complete treatment of the verbal forms is by Luvsanvandan (ed.) (1987). However, the analysis of predication presented here, while valid for Khalkha, is adapted from the description of Khorchin.

Most often, of course, the predicate consists of a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, with or without a copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position; e.g.
The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, &quot;baj-&quot; &#x27;to be&#x27;, e.g.
Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect; e.g. progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by &quot;baj-&quot; may follow, e.g.,
Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.

===Clauses===
Unmarked phrase order is subject–object–predicate. While the predicate generally has to remain in clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear. The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather at the end of the clause. Topic can be overtly marked with &quot;bol&quot;, which can also mark contrastive focus, overt additive focus (&#x27;even, also&#x27;) can be marked with the clitic &quot;ch&quot;, and overt restrictive focus with the clitic &quot;l&quot; (&#x27;only&#x27;).

The inventory of voices in Mongolian consists of passive, causative, reciprocal, plurative, and cooperative. In a passive sentence, the verb takes the suffix -&quot;gd&quot;- and the agent takes either dative or instrumental case, the first of which is more common. In the causative, the verb takes the suffix -&quot;uul&quot;-, the causee (the person caused to do something) in a transitive action (e.g. &#x27;raise&#x27;) takes dative or instrumental case, and the causee in an intransitive action (e.g. &#x27;rise&#x27;) takes accusative case. Causative morphology is also used in some passive contexts:

The semantic attribute of animacy is syntactically important: thus the sentence, &#x27;the bread was eaten by me&#x27;, which is acceptable in English, would not be acceptable in Mongolian. The reciprocal voice is marked by -&quot;ld&quot;-, the plurative by -&quot;cgaa&quot;-, and the cooperative by -&quot;lc&quot;-.

Mongolian allows for adjectival depictives that relate to either the subject or the direct object, e.g. &quot;Liena nücgen untdag&quot; &#x27;Lena sleeps naked&#x27;, while adjectival resultatives are marginal.

=== Complex sentences ===
One way to conjoin clauses is to have the first clause end in a converb, as in the following example using the converb &quot;-bol&quot;:

Some verbal nouns in the dative (or less often in the instrumental) function very similar to converbs: e.g. replacing &quot;olbol&quot; in the preceding sentence with &quot;olohod&quot; find- yields &#x27;when we find it we&#x27;ll give it to you&#x27;. Quite often, postpositions govern complete clauses. In contrast, conjunctions take verbal nouns without case:

Finally, there is a class of particles, usually clause-initial, that are distinct from conjunctions but that also relate clauses:

Mongolian has a complementizer auxiliary verb &quot;ge&quot;- very similar to Japanese &quot;to iu&quot;. &quot;ge&quot;- literally means &#x27;to say&#x27; and in converbal form &quot;gezh&quot; precedes either a psych verb or a verb of saying. As a verbal noun like &quot;gedeg&quot; (with &quot;ni&quot;) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As &quot;gene&quot; it may function as an evidentialis marker.

Mongolian clauses tend to be combined paratactically, which sometimes gives rise to sentence structures which are subordinative despite resembling coordinative structures in European languages:

In the subordinate clause the subject, if different from the subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as is the case for all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. &quot;tüünii idsen hool&quot; that.one- eat- meal &#x27;the meal that s/he had eaten&#x27;.

== Loanwords and coined words ==
Mongolian first adopted loanwords from many languages including Old Turkic, Sanskrit (these often via Uyghur), Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, Tungusic, and Chinese. However, more recent loanwords come from Russian, English, and Mandarin Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia). Language commissions of the Mongolian state continuously translate new terminology into Mongolian, so as the Mongolian vocabulary now has &#x27;president&#x27; (&#x27;generalizer&#x27;) and &#x27;beer&#x27; (&#x27;yellow kumys&#x27;). There are several loan translations, e.g. &#x27;train&#x27; (&#x27;fire cart&#x27;) from Chinese ( &#x27;fire cart&#x27;) &#x27;train&#x27;. Other loan translations include &#x27;essence&#x27; from Chinese ( &#x27;true quality&#x27;), &#x27;population&#x27; from Chinese ( &#x27;person mouth&#x27;), &#x27;corn, maize&#x27; from Chinese ( &#x27;jade rice&#x27;) and &#x27;republic&#x27; from Chinese ( &#x27;public collaboration nation&#x27;).
* Sanskrit loanwords include ( &#x27;religion&#x27;), ( &#x27;space&#x27;), ( &#x27;talent&#x27;), ( &#x27;good deeds&#x27;), ( &#x27;instant&#x27;), ( &#x27;continent&#x27;), ( &#x27;planet&#x27;), ( &#x27;tales, stories&#x27;), ( &#x27;poems, verses&#x27;), ( &#x27;strophe&#x27;), ( &#x27;mineral water, nectar&#x27;), ( &#x27;chronicle&#x27;), ( &#x27;Mercury&#x27;), ( &#x27;Venus&#x27;), ( &#x27;Jupiter&#x27;), and ( &#x27;Saturn&#x27;).

In the 20th century, many Russian loanwords entered the Mongolian language, including &#x27;doctor&#x27;, &#x27;chocolate&#x27;, &#x27;train wagon&#x27;, &#x27;calendar&#x27;, &#x27;system&#x27;, (from &#x27;T-shirt&#x27;), and &#x27;car&#x27;.

In more recent times, due to socio-political reforms, Mongolian has loaned various words from English; some of which have gradually evolved as official terms: &#x27;management&#x27;, &#x27;computer&#x27;, &#x27;file&#x27;, &#x27;marketing&#x27;, &#x27;credit&#x27;, &#x27;online&#x27;, and &#x27;message&#x27;. Most of these are confined to the Mongolian state.

Other languages have borrowed words from Mongolian. Examples (Mongolian in brackets) include Persian کشيكچى (from &#x27;royal guard&#x27;), (from &#x27;pheasant&#x27;), (from &#x27;iron armour&#x27;), (from &#x27;chief of commandant&#x27;), (from &#x27;scissors&#x27;); Uzbek (from &#x27;island&#x27;); Chinese 衚衕 &quot;hutong&quot; (from &#x27;passageway&#x27;), 站赤 &quot;zhanchi&quot; (from &#x27;courier/post station&#x27;); Middle Chinese 犢 &quot;duk&quot; (from &#x27;calf&#x27;); Korean (from &#x27;royal meal&#x27;), (from &#x27;castrated animal&#x27;), (from &#x27;chest of an animal&#x27;); Old English &quot;cocer&quot; (from &#x27;container&#x27;); Old French &quot;quivre&quot; (from &#x27;container&#x27;); Old High German &quot;Baldrian&quot; (from &#x27;valerian plant&#x27;). &quot;Köküür&quot; and &quot;balchirgan-a&quot; are thought to have been brought to Europe by the Huns or Pannonian Avars.

Despite having a diverse range of loanwords, Mongolian dialects such as Khalkha and Khorchin, within a comparative vocabulary of 452 words of Common Mongolic vocabulary, retain as many as 95% of these native words, contrasting e.g. with Southern Mongolic languages at 39–77% retentions.

== Writing systems ==


Mongolian has been written in a variety of alphabets, making it a language with one of the largest number of scripts used historically. The earliest stages of Mongolian (Xianbei, Wuhuan languages) may have used an indigenous runic script as indicated by Chinese sources. The Khitan large script adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) script.

The traditional Mongolian script was first adopted by Genghis Khan in 1204, who recognized the need to represent his own people&#x27;s language. It developed from the Uyghur script when several members of the Uyghur elite who were brought into the Mongol confederation early on shared their knowledge of their written language with the Mongol imperial clan. Among the Uyghurs sharing that knowledge were Tata-tonga (), Bilge Buqa (比俚伽普華), Kara Igach Buyruk (哈剌亦哈赤北魯), and Mengsus (孟速思). From that time, the script underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementation.

Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state. In 1941, the Latin alphabet was adopted, though it lasted only two months.

The Mongolian Cyrillic script was the result of the spreading of Russian influence following the expansion of the Russian Empire. The establishment of Soviet Union helped the influence continue, and the Cyrillic alphabet was slowly introduced with the effort by Russian/Soviet linguists in collaboration with their Mongolian counterparts. It was made mandatory by government decree in 1941. The introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Mandarin Chinese is the official language along with Mongolian in some regions, notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet has always been used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split. There are two types of written Mongolian used in China: the traditional Mongolian script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the Clear Script, used predominantly among Oirats in Xinjiang.

In March 2020, the Mongolian government announced plans to use both Cyrillic and the traditional Mongolian script in official documents by 2025.

== Example text ==
Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Mongolian, written in the Cyrillic alphabet:

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Mongolian transliteration:

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Mongolian, written in the Mongolian script:

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:
:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

&quot;For some Mongolian authors, the Mongolian version of their name is also given in square brackets, e.g., &quot;Harnud [Köke]&quot;. Köke is the author&#x27;s native name. It is a practice common among Mongolian scholars, for purposes of publishing and being cited abroad, to adopt a surname based on one&#x27;s patronymic, in this example &quot;Harnud&quot;; compare Mongolian name.&quot;
&quot;Some library catalogs write Chinese language titles with each syllable separate, even syllables belonging to a single word.&quot;

<doc id="154910" wikidata="Q1044340" url="?curid=154910" title="Wind chill">
<text>Wind chill (popularly wind chill factor) is the sensation of cold produced by the wind for a given ambient air temperature on exposed skin as the air motion accelerates the rate of heat transfer from the body to the surrounding atmosphere. Its values are always lower than the air temperature in the range where the formula is valid. When the apparent temperature is higher than the air temperature, the heat index is used instead.

== Explanation ==
A surface loses heat through conduction, evaporation, convection, and radiation. The rate of convection depends on both the difference in temperature between the surface and the fluid surrounding it and the velocity of that fluid with respect to the surface. As convection from a warm surface heats the air around it, an insulating boundary layer of warm air forms against the surface. Moving air disrupts this boundary layer, or epiclimate, carrying the warm air away, thereby allowing cooler air to replace the warm air against the surface and increasing the temperature difference in the boundary layer. The faster the wind speed, the more readily the surface cools. Contrary to popular belief, wind chill does not refer to how cold things get, and they will only get as cold as the air temperature. This means radiators and pipes cannot freeze when wind chill is below freezing and the air temperature is above freezing.

== Alternative approaches ==
Many formulas exist for wind chill because, unlike temperature, wind chill has no universally agreed-upon standard definition or measurement. All the formulas attempt to qualitatively predict the effect of wind on the temperature humans &quot;perceive&quot;. Weather services in different countries use standards unique to their country or region; for example, the U.S. and Canadian weather services use a model accepted by the National Weather Service. That model has evolved over time.

The first wind chill formulas and tables were developed by Paul Allman Siple and Charles F. Passel working in the Antarctic before the Second World War, and were made available by the National Weather Service by the 1970s. They were based on the cooling rate of a small plastic bottle as its contents turned to ice while suspended in the wind on the expedition hut roof, at the same level as the anemometer. The so-called Windchill Index provided a pretty good indication of the severity of the weather.

In the 1960s, wind chill began to be reported as a wind chill equivalent temperature (WCET), which is theoretically less useful. The author of this change is unknown, but it was not Siple or Passel as is generally believed. At first, it was defined as the temperature at which the windchill index would be the same in the complete absence of wind. This led to equivalent temperatures that exaggerated the severity of the weather. Charles Eagan realized that people are rarely still and that even when it is calm, there is some air movement. He redefined the absence of wind to be an air speed of , which was about as low a wind speed as a cup anemometer could measure. This led to more realistic (warmer-sounding) values of equivalent temperature.

=== Original model ===
Equivalent temperature was not universally used in North America until the 21st century. Until the 1970s, the coldest parts of Canada reported the original Wind Chill Index, a three- or four-digit number with units of kilocalories/hour per square metre. Each individual calibrated the scale of numbers personally, through experience. The chart also provided general guidance to comfort and hazard through threshold values of the index, such as 1400, which was the threshold for frostbite.

The original formula for the index was:

formula_1
where:
*&quot;WCI&quot; = wind chill index, kg⋅cal/m2/h
*&quot;v&quot; = wind velocity, m/s
*&quot;T&quot;a = air temperature, °C

In November 2001, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom implemented a new wind chill index developed by scientists and medical experts on the Joint Action Group for Temperature Indices (JAG/TI). It is determined by iterating a model of skin temperature under various wind speeds and temperatures using standard engineering correlations of wind speed and heat transfer rate. Heat transfer was calculated for a bare face in wind, facing the wind, while walking into it at . The model corrects the officially measured wind speed to the wind speed at face height, assuming the person is in an open field. The results of this model may be approximated, to within one degree, from the following formulas.

The standard wind chill formula for Environment Canada is:

formula_2

where &quot;T&quot;wc is the wind chill index, based on the Celsius temperature scale; &quot;T&quot;a is the air temperature in degrees Celsius; and &quot;v&quot; is the wind speed at standard anemometer height, in kilometres per hour.

When the temperature is and the wind speed is , the wind chill index is −24. If the temperature remains at −20 °C and the wind speed increases to , the wind chill index falls to −33.

The equivalent formula in US customary units is:

formula_3

where &quot;T&quot;wc is the wind chill index, based on the Fahrenheit scale; &quot;T&quot;a is the air temperature in degrees Fahrenheit; and &quot;v&quot; is the wind speed in miles per hour.

Windchill temperature is defined only for temperatures at or below and wind speeds above .

As the air temperature falls, the chilling effect of any wind that is present increases. For example, a wind will lower the apparent temperature by a wider margin at an air temperature of than a wind of the same speed would if the air temperature were .

The 2001 WCET is a steady-state calculation (except for the time-to-frostbite estimates). There are significant time-dependent aspects to wind chill because cooling is most rapid at the start of any exposure, when the skin is still warm.

<text>Buggenhout () is a municipality in the Belgian province of East Flanders in the Denderstreek. The municipality comprises the towns of Buggenhout proper, Briel, Opdorp, and . In 2021, Buggenhout had a total population of 14,689. The total area is 25.25 square kilometres.

Buggenhout is also known for its forest, the &quot;Buggenhoutbos&quot;, which is the largest forest of East Flanders.

The geographic centre of Flanders lies in Opdorp.

Buggenhout has two breweries, Bosteels Brewery (known for the &quot;Tripel Karmeliet&quot;, &quot;Deus&quot; (a champagne beer), &quot;Kwak&quot;) and De Landtsheer, now called Brouwerij Malheur (known for &quot;Malheur&quot;).

==Etymology==
The original meaning of the name is &quot;beechwood&quot; or &quot;beech forest&quot; (in modern Dutch: &quot;Beukenhout&quot;). The name is derived from the Middle Dutch &quot;Bucghenhout&quot; from Old Dutch &quot;Bukenholt&quot;. &quot;Buken&quot; comes from Proto-Germanic * (Modern Dutch: , Old English: (beeches)), holt from *hulta (Modern Dutch: , Old English: (forest)). Buggenhout still contains a forested area called &quot;Buggenhoutbos&quot;.

== History ==
The village was first mention in 1125. It used to belong to the Duchy of Brabant. Due to internal feuds, the area was confiscated. The forest was declared crown land, and the village of Buggenhout became two &quot;heerlijkheden&quot; (landed estates). After the French Revolution, Buggenhout was transferred to East Flanders.
