<text>Games Workshop Group (often abbreviated as GW) is a British manufacturer of miniature wargames, based in Nottingham, England. Its best-known products are &quot;Warhammer&quot; and &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;.

Founded in 1975 by John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson, Games Workshop was originally a manufacturer of wooden boards for games including backgammon, mancala, nine men&#x27;s morris and Go. It later became an importer of the U.S. role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and then a publisher of wargames and role-playing games in its own right, expanding from a bedroom mail-order company in the process. It expanded into Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia in the early 1990s. All UK-based operations were relocated to the current headquarters in Lenton, Nottingham in 1997.
It started promoting games associated with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy in 2001. It also owns Forge World (which makes complementary specialist resin miniatures and conversion kits). It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index since 20 December 2024.

==History==

=== Early years ===
Founded in 1975 at 15 Bolingbroke Road, London by John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson (not to be confused with U.S. game designer Steve Jackson), Games Workshop was originally a manufacturer of wooden boards for games including backgammon, mancala, nine men&#x27;s morris, and Go. It later became an importer of the U.S. role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and then a publisher of wargames and role-playing games in its own right, expanding from a bedroom mail-order company in the process.
In order to promote their business and postal games, create a games club, and provide an alternative source for games news, the newsletter &quot;Owl and Weasel&quot; was founded in February 1975. This was superseded in June 1977 by &quot;White Dwarf&quot;.

From the outset, there was a clear, stated interest in print regarding &quot;progressive games&quot;, including computer gaming, which led to the departure of John Peake in early 1976, who preferred &quot;traditional games&quot; (such as backgammon). The loss of Peake also meant the loss of the fledgling company&#x27;s main source of income. However, having successfully obtained official distribution rights to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other TSR products in the UK, and maintaining a high profile by running games conventions, the business grew rapidly. It opened its first shop in April 1978.
In late 1978 Games Workshop provided the funding to co-found Citadel Miniatures in Newark-on-Trent. Citadel would produce the metal miniatures used in its role-playing games and tabletop wargames. The &quot;Citadel&quot; name became synonymous with Games Workshop Miniatures, and continues to be a trademarked brand name used in association with them long after the Citadel company was absorbed into Games Workshop. For a time Gary Gygax promoted the idea of TSR, Inc. merging with Games Workshop, until Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone backed out.

The company&#x27;s publishing arm also released UK reprints of American RPGs such as &quot;Call of Cthulhu,&quot; &quot;Runequest,&quot; &quot;Traveller&quot; and &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot;, which were expensive to import (having previously done so for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; since 1977).

In 1984 Games Workshop ceased distributing its products in the U.S. through hobby games distributors and opened its Games Workshop (U.S.) office. Games Workshop (U.S.), and Games Workshop in general, grew significantly in the late 1980s, with over 250 employees on the payroll by 1990.

=== Refocus ===
Tom Kirby became General Manager in 1986. 
Following a management buyout by him and Bryan Ansell in December 1991, when Livingstone and Jackson sold their shares for million, Games Workshop refocused on their miniature wargames &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; (WFB) and &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; (WH40k), their most lucrative lines. The retail chain refocused on a younger, more family-oriented market. The change of direction was a great success and the company enjoyed growing profits, but the more commercial direction of the company made it lose some of its old fan base. A breakaway group of two company employees published &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; in competition with Games Workshop, but the new company met with little success and closed in 1993. Games Workshop expanded in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia, opening new branches and organising events in each new commercial territory. Having been acquired by private equity firm ECI Partners the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1994. In October 1997 all UK-based operations were relocated to the current headquarters in Lenton, Nottingham.

The company diversified by acquiring Sabretooth Games (card games), creating the Black Library (literature), and working with THQ (computer games).
In late 2009 Games Workshop issued a succession of &quot;cease and desist&quot; orders against various Internet sites it accused of violating its intellectual property generating anger and disappointment from its fan community.

On 16 May 2011, Maelstrom Games announced that Games Workshop had revised the terms and conditions of their trade agreement with independent stockists in the UK. The new terms and conditions restricted the sale of all Games Workshop products to within the European Economic Area.

On 16 June 2013, WarGameStore, a UK-based retailer of Games Workshop products since 2003, announced further changes to Games Workshop&#x27;s trade agreement with UK-based independent stockists.

Tom Kirby stepped down in 2017.

In July 2021, Games Workshop made changes to their IP guidelines, adopting a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; stance towards fan-made games, videos and animations, drawing criticism from fans.

The presence of Games Workshop in the East Midlands has led the region to become the centre of the wargames industry in the UK, known as the lead belt with numerous other 
companies founded by former employees.

==Operations==
===Licensing===
Alongside the UK publishing rights to several American role-playing games in the 1980s (including Call of Cthulhu, Runequest and Middle-earth Role Playing,) Games Workshop also secured the rights to produce miniatures or games for several classic British science fiction properties such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and several characters from 2000 AD including Rogue Trooper and Judge Dredd. Alongside the rights to reprint Iron Crown Enterprises&#x27; Middle-earth Role Playing, Citadel Miniatures acquired the rights to produce 28 mm miniatures based on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

In conjunction with the promotion of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy in 2001, Games Workshop acquired the rights to produce a skirmish wargame and miniatures, using the movies&#x27; production and publicity art, and information provided by the original novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. A 25 mm scale was used. The rights to produce a role-playing game using the films&#x27; art and both the book and the movies&#x27; plots and characters were sold to another firm, Decipher, Inc. Games Workshop also produced a &quot;Battle of Five Armies&quot; game based on a culminating episode in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, using 10Â mm scale.

On 10 February 2011 Warner Bros. Consumer Products announced that it had extended its six-year agreement with Games Workshop, continuing its exclusive, worldwide rights to produce tabletop games based on &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; Games Workshop announced plans to expand their offerings of battle-games and model soldiers, and to continue to develop and increase offerings based on J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy books.

===Group divisions===
Games Workshop has expanded into several divisions/companies producing products related to the &quot;Warhammer&quot; universe.

* Forge World makes specialist resin miniatures and conversion kits for Games Workshop&#x27;s titles as well as its Specialist Games range. Forge World was also responsible for the Warhammer Historical line of historical wargames rules, including &quot;Warhammer Ancient Battles&quot;, all of which were previously published by as a component of Black Library. In August 2018, Forge World announced substantial changes to its U.S. pricing model in exchange for faster and less costly shipping services to the United States. As of 31 November 2023, the Forge World website was made defunct as part of the company merger under the banner name &quot;Warhammer&quot; in one website, the resin kits sold were also marked as &quot;Advance model kits&quot; with an age rating attached 
* BL Publishing was the fiction, board game and roleplaying game publishing arm of Games Workshop. They comprised several separate imprints; Black Library, Black Flame, Solaris Books and Warp Artefacts.

The company has hard-to-reproduce, unique intellectual property, and a good export record. Sales slowed around 1999-2000 due to supply chain issues, but quickly rebounded a few years later.

==Miniature games==
Games Workshop previously produced miniature figures via an associated, originally independent, company called Citadel Miniatures while the main company concentrated on retail. The distinction between the two blurred after Games Workshop stores ceased to sell retail products by other manufacturers, and Citadel was effectively merged back into Games Workshop.

====Specialist Games====
These games were aimed at the &quot;veteran&quot; gamers. These are gamers who are more experienced in the core games produced by Games Workshop. This is because the rules and the complexity of tactics inherent in the systems are often more in-depth than the core games. This also includes games that aren&#x27;t necessarily more complex, but have a smaller more specialised target audience. The Specialist Games division was shut down in 2013, with all games being discontinued.

** &quot;Necromunda&quot; â a skirmish game set on a hive world which pits gangs of humans against each other, using modified 2nd edition &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; rules, which are more detailed than newer editions and more suitable for skirmish games. Originally printed in 1995, it was revived at the end of 2017.

** The Strategy Battle Game was expanded with new supplements. In 2009 an expansion for the game entitled &#x27;War of the Ring&#x27; was released, allowing players to recreate large scale battles in Middle-Earth. In December 2012 Games Workshop released the first wave of models based on the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.

== Citadel brand acrylic paints ==

Games Workshop produces a line of acrylic paints for painting miniatures, under the Citadel name. At the end of March 2012 the company announced a new range of over 145 colours made in the UK. The current Citadel paint types are:
* &quot;Base&quot;: Pigment dense for high opacity. Intended to offer good coverage over a primer layer for a strong foundation of colour.
* &quot;Layer&quot;: Thinner and less pigment dense than Base paints for slight translucency. Intended to be built up over multiple layers to create smooth transitions of colour or value.
* &quot;Shade&quot;: Acrylic ink based &quot;paints&quot; that are thin and flow easily into recessed details. Intended to be applied as a wash to add depth and shadow.
* &quot;Dry&quot;: Thick, paste-consistency paints with maximum pigment concentration. Intended to aid in dry-brushing to achieve easy highlighting of models.
* &quot;Air&quot;: A selection of colours from the Base and Layer lines that are thinned down, as well as some &quot;Clear&quot; paints. Intended to be used through an airbrush.
* &quot;Technical&quot;: A range of non-standard &quot;paints&quot; to achieve additional effects. These include gloss paints for slime or wet blood, semi-transparent glossy paints for gemstone effects, weathering effect paints, spectral effect paints, textured pastes for gaming bases, acrylic mediums, and acrylic varnishes. Intended for adding finishing details to models.
* &quot;Spray&quot;: Spray-can paints that come in black, white, and a small selection of colours from the Base line. Intended as a primer layer and to add a foundation coat of colour quickly.
* &quot;Contrast&quot;: Thinned paint and medium mixtures that flow into recesses similar to Shade paints, but also stain the raised details creating a blended fade from highlight to shadow. Intended to be applied over specialised Spray paints to give an effect similar to using a Base, then Layer, then Shade, but in one coat of paint to speed up the painting process.

Contrast paints were added to the Games Workshop paint range in 2019, promoted as speeding up the painting process for players. The existing range of paints was also expanded and reorganised when Contrast was released, and branding changed from &quot;Citadel&quot; to &quot;Citadel Colour&quot;. The previously available Glaze line of paints was discontinued, replaced with the introduction of the Air Clear paints, the previously available Edge line of paints were combined into the Layer line, with some colours also being renamed, and the previously separate Texture line of paints was combined into the Technical line.

==Role-playing games==
Several of the miniatures games (e.g. Inquisitor) involve a role-playing element; however, Games Workshop has, in the past, published role-playing games set within the Warhammer universe. &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot; was first published in 1986; a second edition appeared in 2005 published by Black Industries, part of GW&#x27;s fiction imprint BL Publishing. In 2018 a 4th edition was published by Cubicle 7.

&quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy&quot;, the first of three proposed role-playing games set in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, was released in late January 2008 and sold out almost immediately. In September 2008 production was transferred to Fantasy Flight Games.

Fantasy Flight Games subsequently published four other roleplaying games; &quot;Rogue Trader&quot;, &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, &quot;Black Crusade&quot;, and &quot;Only War&quot;, set in the same &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe and employing similar mechanics.

* &quot;Dark Heresy&quot; - an RPG based in the WH40k Universe where players control one member of an Inquisitor&#x27;s retinue.

==Board games==
Games Workshop had a strong history in boardgames development, alongside the miniatures and RPGs. Several may have had roleplaying elements, or had miniatures included or produced. &quot;Spacefarers&quot; released in 1981 was one of these board games with a set of miniature rules especially designed for use with Citadel Miniatures&#x27; figures.

Licensing for an undisclosed proportion of Games Workshop&#x27;s back catalogue of board games was transferred to Fantasy Flight Games as part of the same transaction which included Black Library&#x27;s Role Playing Games. Fantasy Flight has republished revised editions of a number of these games. At the time of the announcement, Black Library had only one boardgame in print, the 4th Edition of &quot;Talisman&quot;. Fantasy Flight subsequently released revised editions of Talisman and of other former Games Workshop boardgames. On 9 September 2016, Fantasy Flight Games announced the termination of its licensing agreement with Games Workshop.

Games Workshop currently has several standalone board games in production.

==Video games==
== Trading card games (TCGs) ==
Games Workshop released a trading card game (TCG) in 2018 based on the &quot;Age of Sigmar&quot; universe called &quot;Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Champions Trading Card Game&quot;.

==Events==
There were yearly Games Day events held by Games Workshop which was started in 1975, at Seymour Hall, London on 20 December 1975. It included the Golden Demon painting competition, news stands, sales stands, and tables to play on. In 2014 it was replaced by &#x27;Warhammer Fest&#x27;, similar but with additions such as demonstration pods and seminars.

=== Worldwide campaigns ===
Games Workshop has run numerous &quot;Worldwide Campaigns&quot; for its three core game systems. In each campaign, players are invited to submit the results of games played within a certain time period.

Each Warhammer campaign has had a new codex published with the rules for special characters or &quot;incomplete&quot; army lists. Below are listed the Games Workshop Worldwide Campaigns (with the campaign&#x27;s fictional universe setting in parentheses):

* 1997 - A Dark Conspiracy (Warhammer)
* 2000 - Third War for Armageddon (&quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;)
* 2001 - Dark Shadows (Warhammer)
* 2003 - Eye of Terror (Warhammer 40,000)
* 2004 - Storm of Chaos (Warhammer)
* 2005 - The War of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game)
* 2006 - The Fall of Medusa V (Warhammer 40,000)
* 2007 - The Nemesis Crown (Warhammer)
* 2011 - Scourge of the Storm (Warhammer)

These Campaigns were run to promote its miniature wargames, and attracted interest in the hobby, particularly at gaming clubs, Hobby Centres and independent stockists. Forums for the community were created for each campaign (in addition to those on the main site), as a place to &quot;swap tactics, plan where to post your results, or just chat about how the campaign is going.&quot; In some cases special miniatures were released to coincide with the campaigns; the promotional &quot;Gimli on Dead Uruk-hai&quot; miniature, for example, was available only through the campaign roadshows or ordering online. As a whole these events have been successful; one, for example, was deemed &quot;a fantastic rollercoaster&quot;, with thousands of registered participants.

==Magazines==
Games Workshop&#x27;s has published the White Dwarf magazine since 1977 and has over 400 issues. Games Workshop also published Fanatic Magazine in support of their Specialist Games range. After the cancellation of Fanatic Magazine, an electronic version, known as &quot;Fanatic Online&quot; was published from Games Workshop&#x27;s Specialist Games website.

For a brief period in the mid-1980s GW took over publication of the Fighting Fantasy magazine Warlock from Puffin Books who had produced the first 5 issues. The magazine turned into a general introductory gaming magazine but was discontinued after issue 13.

There was also a fortnightly series called &quot;Battle Games in Middle Earth&quot;, which came with a single or several free Lord of the Rings SBG miniatures. Though the miniatures were made by Games Workshop, the magazine itself was written by SGS (part of Games Workshop) and published by De Agostini.

==&quot;Spots the Space Marine&quot; trademark complaint==
Games Workshop issued a trademark complaint against retailer Amazon, specifically relating to the novel &quot;Spots the Space Marine&quot;, claiming it violated their European &#x27;space marine&#x27; trademark. Commentators such as Cory Doctorow and digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, questioned the right of Games Workshop to trademark the term. On 8 February 2013, Spots the Space Marine reappeared on Amazon. Games Workshop has issued no further legal action.

==Other media==
Games Workshop illustrators also published artbooks covering parts of their commissioned work for the company. These include Adrian Smith, Ian Miller and John Blanche.

===Short fiction===
From 1997 to 2005 Black Library published &quot;INFERNO!&quot;, a magazine of short stories, artwork, and other features set in the various fictional universes of Games Workshop, and regularly featuring that of Warhammer 40,000. Since 2010 Black Library has produced a monthly eBook called &quot;Hammer and Bolter&quot; with the focus on short stories set in the different Games Workshop universes.

===Novels===
===Comics and graphic novels===
===Music===

In the late 1980s the death metal band Bolt Thrower wrote lyrics dedicated to the Warhammer 40,000 universe and used 40k artwork on the cover of their second album, &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot;.

In the early 1990s Games Workshop created its own short-lived record company, Warhammer Records. The first album released by the label was &quot;Oblivion&quot; by D-Rok, in 1991. A fragment of D-Rok&#x27;s song &quot;Get Out of My Way&quot; was used in the computer game &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, published by Electronic Arts in 1992. Wraith released two albums, &quot;Danger Calling&quot; (1992) and &quot;Riot&quot; (1993) while with the label. Rich Rags album, &quot;Psycho Dead Heads from Outer Space&quot; (1993), was the final original album the label released. The label also had the UK distribution rights for Saxon&#x27;s album &quot;Forever Free. The label was folded in 1993. 

In the early 2000s the German label Art of Perception produced a 12 part soundtrack vinyl series followed by three CD compilations. The task for the artists involved in this project was to conduct a theme for a species from the Warhammer 40.000 universe.

In 2009 the Singaporean death metal band, Deus Ex Machina released I, Human, which makes numerous references to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, particularly the Adeptus Mechanicus faction.

In 2007 and 2015 the German death metal band Debauchery released several songs about the Chaos God Khorne, &quot;Praise the Blood God&quot;, &quot;True To The Skull Throne (And Bound To Kill)&quot;, and &quot;Blood For The Blood God&quot;.

===Film===
Games Workshop announced that Exile Studios would produce a CGI movie based upon the &quot;Bloodquest&quot; graphic novel; a trailer was released, but the project was discontinued and Exile Studios disbanded.

For the 25th Anniversary Games Day, Games Workshop released in 1996 (for limited sale) a short movie entitled &quot;Inquisitor&quot;, using clips and footage that was created as a pitch to G.W. for a film deal. There were also trailers for two other films, &quot;Hive Infestation&quot; and &quot;Blood for the Blood God&quot;. &quot;Hive Infestation&quot; pitted Space Wolf terminators against a genestealer cult infestation of a hive world. &quot;Blood for the Blood God&quot; was the second trailer released, and portrayed orks and Dark Angel marines fighting along with an inquisitor, much in the style of the Epic 40,000 video game cut scenes, but little information was given on this short film aside from a shot of a berserker of Khorne (available in YouTube but flagged by Games Workshop, removing the movie).

Another one was Damnatus, a German fan film developed over four years. Games Workshop announced in July 2007 that they would not give permission for the film to be released because of issues between Anglo-American copyright and Continental European Droit d&#x27;auteur.

In 2010 Games Workshop with Codex Pictures released a 70-minute downloadable film called &quot;&quot;. The screenplay was written by Black Library author Dan Abnett. Terence Stamp, Sean Pertwee and John Hurt head the cast of voice actors.

On 5 August 2021, Games Workshop launched Warhammer Plus, a subscription service that provides access to exclusive Warhammer-themed shows and animations, as well as other content such as classic issues of the &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine and exclusive miniatures.

<text>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA, ) is an independent trade association and charity that supports, develops, and promotes the arts of film, television and video games in the United Kingdom. In addition to its annual award ceremonies, BAFTA has an international programme of learning events and initiatives offering access to talent through workshops, masterclasses, scholarships, lectures, and mentoring schemes in the United Kingdom and the United States.

BAFTA&#x27;s annual film awards ceremony, the British Academy Film Awards, has been held since 1949, while its annual television awards ceremony, the British Academy Television Awards, has been held since 1955. Their third ceremony, the British Academy Games Awards, was first presented in 2004.

==Origins==
BAFTA started out as the British Film Academy, founded in 1947 by a group of directors: David Lean, Alexander Korda, Roger Manvell, Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell, Michael Balcon, Carol Reed, and other major figures of the British film industry.

David Lean was the founding chairman. The first Film Awards ceremony took place in May 1949, honouring the films &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and &quot;The World Is Rich&quot;.

The Guild of Television Producers and Directors was set up in 1953 with the first awards ceremony in October 1954, and in 1958 merged with the British Film Academy to form the Society of Film and Television Arts, whose inaugural meeting was held at Buckingham Palace and presided over by the Duke of Edinburgh.

==195 Piccadilly== 

The Society of Film and Television Arts acquired the historic Prince&#x27;s Hall facilities at 195 Piccadilly, following the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours&#x27; move to the Mall Galleries. Queen Elizabeth, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Princess Royal and The Earl Mountbatten of Burma officially opened the organisation&#x27;s headquarters in 1976, and officially became the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in March 1976.

In 2016, BAFTA embarked in an extensive renovation of the Grade II listed property. Benedetti Architects oversaw a Â£33M+ remodel, doubling its original capacity with the addition of an additional floor, raising and restoring two large Victorian rooflight structures and decorative plasterwork, creating an entire floor devoted to BAFTA&#x27;s learning and new talent programmes, and revamping the property&#x27;s food, beverage, and events operations in order to maximize revenue to sustain property maintenance and operations. The new facilities were formally reopened in 2022.

==Organisational structure==
BAFTA is a membership organisation comprising approximately 8,000 individuals worldwide who are creatives and professionals working in and making a contribution to the film, television and games industries in the UK. In 2005, it placed an overall cap on worldwide voting membership which stood at approximately 6,500 .

BAFTA does not receive any funding from the government; it relies on income from membership subscriptions, individual donations, trusts, foundations and corporate partnerships to support its ongoing outreach work.

BAFTA has offices in Scotland and Wales in the UK, in Los Angeles and New York in the United States and runs events in Hong Kong and mainland China.

Amanda Berry served as chief executive of the organisation between December 2000 and October 2022. Jane Millichip has held the position since October 2022.

==Initiatives==
In addition to its high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA manages a year-round programme of educational events and initiatives including film screenings and Q&amp;As, tribute evenings, interviews, lectures, and debates with major industry figures. With over 250 events a year, BAFTA&#x27;s stated aim is to inspire and inform the next generation of talent by providing a platform for some of the world&#x27;s most talented practitioners to pass on their knowledge and experience.

===Scholarships===
BAFTA runs a number of scholarship programmes across the UK, United States and Asia.

Launched in 2012, the UK programme enables talented British citizens who are in need of financial support to take an industry-recognised course in film, television or games in the UK. Each BAFTA Scholar receives up to Â£12,000 towards their annual course fees, and mentoring support from a BAFTA member and free access to BAFTA events around the UK. Since 2013, three students every year have received one of the Prince William Scholarships in Film, Television and Games, supported by BAFTA and Warner Bros. These scholarships are awarded in the name of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge in his role as president of BAFTA.

In the U.S., BAFTA Los Angeles offers financial support and mentorship to British graduate students studying in the US, as well as scholarships to provide financial aid to local LA students from the inner city. BAFTA New York&#x27;s Media Studies Scholarship Program, set up in 2012, supports students pursuing media studies at undergraduate and graduate level institutions within the New York City area and includes financial aid and mentoring opportunities.

Since 2015, BAFTA has been offering scholarships for British citizens to study in China, and vice versa.

===Albert===
In 2011 BAFTA founded the organisation Albert, which promotes sustainable film and television production through its carbon footprint calculator and certification. All BBC, ITV, Channel 4, UKTV, Sky and Netflix productions in the UK are required to register their carbon footprint using the Albert carbon calculator, and the BBC requires all television commissions to be Albert certified.

==Awards==
BAFTA presents awards for film, television and games, including children&#x27;s entertainment, at a number of annual ceremonies across the UK and in Los Angeles.

===BAFTA awards===

The BAFTA award trophy is a mask, designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe. When the Guild merged with the British Film Academy to become the Society of Film and Television Arts, later the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the first &quot;BAFTA award&quot; was presented to Sir Charles Chaplin on his Academy Fellowship that year.

A BAFTA award â including the bronze mask and marble base â weighs and measures high Ã wide Ã deep; the mask itself measures high Ã wide. They are made of phosphor bronze and cast in a Middlesex foundry.

In 2017, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts introduced new entry rules for British films starting from the 2018/19 season to foster diversity.

===Awards ceremonies===
====Film Awards====

BAFTA&#x27;s annual film awards ceremony is known as the British Academy Film Awards, or &quot;the BAFTAs&quot;, and reward the best work of any nationality seen on British cinema screens during the preceding year. In 1949 the British Film Academy, as it was then known, presented the first awards for films made in 1947 and 1948. Since 2008 the ceremony has been held at the Royal Opera House in London&#x27;s Covent Garden. It had been held in the Odeon cinema on Leicester Square since 2000.

Since 2017, the BAFTA ceremony has been held at the Royal Albert Hall. The ceremony had been performed during April or May of each year, but beginning 2002 it has been held in February to precede the Academy Awards (Oscars) in the United States, making the BAFTA Film Awards a major precursor of the eventual annual results of the Oscar ceremonies since.

In order for a film to be considered for a BAFTA nomination, its first public exhibition must be displayed in a cinema and it must have a UK theatrical release for no fewer than seven days of the calendar year that corresponds to the upcoming awards. A movie must be of feature-length and movies from all countries are eligible in all categories, with the exception of the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut which are for British films or individuals only.

====Television Awards and Television Craft Awards====
The British Academy Television Awards ceremony usually takes place during April or May, with its sister ceremony, the British Academy Television Craft Awards, usually occurring within a few weeks of it.

The Television Awards, celebrating the best TV programmes and performances of the past year, are also often referred to simply as &quot;the BAFTAs&quot; or, to differentiate them from the movie awards, the &quot;BAFTA Television Awards&quot;. They have been awarded annually since 1954. The first ever ceremony consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the Guild of Television Producers and Directors.

From 1968 until 1997, BAFTA&#x27;s Film and Television Awards were presented together, but from 1998 onwards they were presented at two separate ceremonies.

The Television Craft Awards celebrate the talent behind the programmes, such as individuals working in visual effects, production, and costume design.

Only British programmes are eligible â with the potential exception of the publicly voted Audience Award â but any cable, satellite, terrestrial or digital television stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between 1 January and 31 December of the year preceding the awards ceremony.

Since 2014 the &quot;BAFTA Television Awards&quot; have been open to TV programmes which are only broadcast online.

====Games Awards====

The British Academy Games Awards ceremony traditionally takes place in March, shortly after the Film Awards ceremony in February.

BAFTA first recognised video games and other interactive media at its inaugural &quot;BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards&quot; ceremony during 1998, the first major change of its rules since the admittance of television thirty years earlier. Among the first winning games were &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and interactive comedy &quot;MindGym&quot;, sharing the spotlight with the &quot;BBC News Online&quot; website which won the news category four years consecutively. These awards allowed the academy to recognise new forms of entertainment that were engaging new audiences and challenging traditional expressions of creativity.

During 2003, the sheer ubiquity of interactive forms of entertainment and the breadth of genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the &quot;BAFTA Video Games Awards&quot; and the BAFTA Interactive Awards Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA&#x27;s publicity material after only two ceremonies.

During 2006, BAFTA announced its decision &quot;to give video games equal status with film and television&quot;, and the academy now advertises video games as its third major topic in recognition of its importance as an art form of moving images. The same year the ceremony was performed at The Roundhouse by Chalk Farm Road in North London on 5 October and was televised for the first time on 17 October and was broadcast on the digital channel E4.

Between 2009 and 2019, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, and have been hosted by Dara Ã Briain and Rufus Hound. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the ceremony was changing format from a live red-carpet ceremony at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London to an online show. The online show was presented by Dara Ã Briain from his home and was watched by 720,000 globally.
In 2021 the 17th British Academy Games Awards was hosted by arts and entertainment presenter Elle Osili-Wood and was watched by a global audience of 1.5 million.

====Children&#x27;s Awards====

The British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards are presented annually during November to reward excellence in the art forms of the moving image intended for children. They have been awarded annually since 1969 except for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The academy has a history of recognising and rewarding children&#x27;s programming, presenting two awards at the 1969 ceremony â The Flame of Knowledge Award for Schools Programmes and the Harlequin Award for Children&#x27;s Programmes.

 the Awards ceremony includes 19 categories across movies, television, video games and online content.

Since 2007 the Children&#x27;s Awards have included a Kids Vote award, voted by children between seven and 14. The CBBC Me and My Movie award, a children&#x27;s filmmaking initiative to inspire and enable children to make their own movies and tell their own stories, has been discontinued.

====BAFTA Student Film Awards====
BAFTA also hosts the annual BAFTA Student Film Awards as showcase for rising industry talent. The animation award was sponsored in 2017 and 2018 by animation studio Laika.

William, Prince of Wales has been the President of the Academy since February 2010.

The Prince&#x27;s appointment follows a long tradition of royal involvement with the academy. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was the first president of the Society of Film and Television Arts (SFTA) in 1959 to 1965, followed by Earl Mountbatten of Burma and the Princess Royal, who was its president from 1972 to 2001. It was the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s generous donation of their share of profits from the film &quot;Royal Family&quot; that enabled the academy to move to its headquarters at 195 Piccadilly. The Prince of Wales succeeded the Lord Attenborough to become the fifth President in the Academy&#x27;s history.

==BAFTA Los Angeles==
BAFTA North America, founded in 1987 and currently chaired by Joyce Pierpoline, serves as the bridge between the Hollywood and British production and entertainment business communities.

BAFTA Los Angeles provides access to screenings, Q&amp;As with creative talent, produces seminars with UK film and television executives and the Heritage Archive, featuring interviews with British members of the film and television industries. The Los Angeles location also hosts the Student Film Awards and has an active Scholarship Program offering financial support and mentorship to UK students studying in the US. It created The Inner City Cinema, a screening program providing free screenings of theatrical films to inner-city areas not served by theatres. The success of Inner City Cinema has led to further free screening programs extended to multiple inner-city parks through the academy&#x27;s work with both the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks After Dark) and The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (Teen Summer Camps).

===Britannia Awards===

The Britannia Awards are BAFTA Los Angeles&#x27; highest accolade, a &quot;celebration of achievements honouring individuals and companies that have dedicated their careers to advancing the entertainment arts&quot;. The Awards began in 1989 and usually take place in October/November every year. There are no awards given to specific movies or TV programmes, only to individuals. During the first ten years, one award was given at each event, named the &#x27;Britannia Award for Excellence in Film&#x27;, but since 1999 the number of awards has increased.

Awards given include &quot;The Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film&quot; (the original award was renamed during 2000 to honour director Stanley Kubrick), presented to an individual &quot;upon whose work is stamped the indelible mark of authorship and commitment, and who has lifted the craft to new heights&quot;; &quot;The John Schlesinger Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing&quot; (added during 2003 in honour of John Schlesinger); the &quot;Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year&quot;; and the &quot;Albert R. Broccoli Britannia Award for Worldwide Contribution to Filmed Entertainment&quot;. In select years, the evening has included the &quot;BAFTA Los Angeles Humanitarian Award&quot;.

The show has been broadcast on TV around the world, including the TV Guide Network and BBC America in the United States.

==BAFTA Wales==
BAFTA Cymru is a branch of the academy formed in 1991 and extends the charity&#x27;s mission across the UK in support of Wales&#x27; creative communities.

===British Academy Cymru Awards===
For over 25 years BAFTA Cymru has celebrated Welsh talent across film and television production and craft and performance roles with the British Academy Cymru Awards, its annual awards ceremony that takes place in Cardiff. In 2016, having reviewed the eligibility criteria for last year&#x27;s awards, BAFTA Cymru now encourages Welsh individuals who have worked on Welsh or UK productions â rather than solely Welsh productions â to enter into any one of the 16 craft and performance categories, &quot;[ensuring] that BAFTA in Wales can recognise the work of talented individuals who are working on network productions in craft or performance roles across the UK.&quot;

==BAFTA New York==

==Controversy==
On 26 October 2017, Norwegian actress Natassia Malthe accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel after the 2008 BAFTA Awards. On 2 February 2018, BAFTA formally terminated Weinstein&#x27;s membership.

On 29 March 2021, Noel Clarke received the BAFTA Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award. This was suspended on 29 April 2021 following the publication of multiple and detailed accounts of sexual misconduct by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Clarke has denied all allegations, except one. Clarke said: &quot;I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.&quot; The allegations were made by twenty different women. BAFTA was informed about the existence of allegations of verbal abuse, bullying and sexual harassment against Clarke thirteen days before presenting Clarke with his award. BAFTA acknowledges it received anonymous emails and reports of allegations via intermediaries, but, as it was not given evidence that would allow it to investigate, was unable to take action. In March 2022, the Metropolitan Police stated that Clarke would not face a criminal investigation due to a lack of evidence of any crimes having been committed.

<doc id="147944" wikidata="Q313447" url="?curid=147944" title="Rodney Mullen">
<text>John Rodney Mullen (born August 17, 1966) is an American professional skateboarder who practices freestyle skateboarding and street skateboarding. He is considered one of the most influential skateboarders of all time. Mullen is credited for inventing numerous tricks, including the flatground ollie, kickflip, heelflip, impossible, and 360-kickflip. As a result, he has been called the &quot;Godfather of freestyle skating.&quot;

Rodney Mullen won his first world freestyle skateboard championship at the age of 14; over the following decade, he won 34 out of 35 freestyle contests, thus establishing the most successful competitive run in the history of the sport. Over the following years, he transitioned from freestyle to street skateboarding, adapting his accumulated freestyle skills to street and inventing or expanding upon additional tricks in the process, such as primo slides, dark slides, and Casper slides.

Mullen has appeared in over 20 skateboarding videos and has co-authored an autobiography, entitled &quot;The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself&quot;, with writer Sean Mortimer.

==Early life==
Mullen was born and raised in Gainesville, Florida. His father was a dentist and property developer while his mother was a child prodigy and accomplished pianist who graduated high school at the age of 14. He and his family lived on a farm. As a child, Mullen slept in boots designed to correct a severe pigeon-toe condition. Despite Mullen&#x27;s condition, &quot;He had an incredible dexterity with his feet,&quot; said Phil Chiocchio, former owner of the Florida skatepark, Sensation Basin.

Mullen began skateboarding at the age of ten, on New Year&#x27;s Day of 1977, after a neighborhood friend introduced him to a skateboard. He promised his strict father that he would cease skateboarding the first time he became seriously injured:
My dad wouldn&#x27;t let me have a skateboard. He thought I&#x27;d get hurt and never get good, and the culture was bums, and I&#x27;d turn into one. He was a dentist, but before that he was military, and there were times you&#x27;d call him, &#x27;Sir.&#x27; New Year&#x27;s Day he had a drink and felt better, and the skate shop was open. I learned to skate in our garage. We lived in the country in Florida, it was sort of farmish, and there was no cement anywhere else. Vert skating was the kind of skating that was done in pools, where you could get airborne and be weightless. The other style, which is what I did, was called freestyle, which was tricks you could do on flat ground.

Mullen practiced in the garage of the family home while wearing a comprehensive protective pads setup, a precaution that was part of the deal with his father. He also spent time with his sister&#x27;s surfer friends who skated on weekdays. He became obsessed with the skateboard and practiced for many hours on a daily basis.

Mullen graduated from P. K. Yonge Developmental Research School where he had a 4.0 GPA and studied biomedical engineering at the University of Florida, where he majored in mathematics, although he later dropped out due to his daily schedule. Although talented, he was pathologically shy and suffered from anxiety as well as anorexia as a teenager; while on tour, he ran away from the Bones Brigade van during a rest stop in Maryland.

==Professional skateboarding==

In 1978, even though he had only owned a skateboard for just over a year, Mullen placed fifth in the Boy&#x27;s Freestyle category at the US Open Championships at Kona Skatepark in Jacksonville, Florida. Skateboard manufacturer Bruce Walker saw his performance and sponsored Mullen through Walker Skateboards from 1978 to 1980. Mullen&#x27;s biggest influence in skateboarding at the time was a Walker professional skateboarder, Jim McCall, who was coached in his early years by Walker (Walker also coached a young Kelly Slater). Mullen was also influenced in a positive manner by professional skateboarders from Florida including Ed Womble, George McClellan, Clyde Rodgers, Tim Scroggs, and Kelly Lynn.

In later years, Mullen was coached by Barry Zaritsky (also known as &quot;SIO Barry&quot;), who owned a company called SiO Safety Shorts. When his family moved to a farm in a remote part of Florida, Mullen began perfecting his flat ground techniques in the family garage; he has said that the isolation and lack of terrain naturally guided him towards freestyle skateboarding. Mullen cites July 1979âAugust 1980 as his &quot;most creative time&quot;, a time when he was predominantly a loner who counted the cows of the family farm as his best friends. Mullen then proceeded to win thirty successive amateur competitions in the late 1970s, mostly in his home state of Florida, culminating in a win at the Oceanside Nationals in June 1979.
In 1980, the 14-year-old Mullen entered the Oasis Pro competition, defeating the world champion, Steve Rocco. At Oasis Skatepark Mullen also spotted a 12-year-old skater who &quot;introduced himself as Tony Hawk.&quot; Recalled Mullen, &quot;Before Tony was sponsored, before anybody knew anything about him, he made an impression on me,&quot; and the two would go on to become good friends.

=== Bones Brigade ===
Shortly thereafter, Mullen turned professional as a member of the renowned Bones Brigade team sponsored by Powell Peralta, based on the recommendation by Powell Peralta rider and fellow Floridian skateboarder Tim Scroggs of Mullen to company co-founder Stacy Peralta, whom Mullen highly admired. Mullen competed voraciously throughout the 1980s, often frustrating competitors and judges with his consistency and progressive ability.

Like most skaters at the time, Mullen skated a mix of styles, including some vert, before skateboarding became more clearly delineated, as skaters who were more freestyle-oriented gravitated toward street and those who had skated more transition, bowls, and pools went into vert.

Mullen enrolled in the chemical engineering program at the University of Florida, leaving during his senior year prior to completing his degree in order to take over management of World Industries with fellow Bones Brigade team member and company co-founder Steve Rocco.

===Invention of the flatground ollie===
Among his most significant contributions to the evolution of modern skateboarding, Rodney Mullen adapted the ollie, first pioneered by Alan Gelfand on vert (where Gelfand would scoop off the back trucks to obtain more air off the wall, but without popping the tail of the skateboard in the process), to flat ground. This ability to pop the board off of the ground and drag it upward into the air, gaining significant altitude and air time, allowed ollieing onto rails and obstacles and opened the door to more complex flip tricks and other flat ground tricks. The invention of this trick alone, even apart from the numerous other tricks that he has invented and his design work, has ranked Mullen as one of the most important skateboarders of all time. In response to the praise that he has received for the flat ground ollie, Mullen stated in August 2012:

The origins of olliesâa guy named Alan Gelfand did it on vert...I had for a long time done a really simple movement, which wasâit was just a transfer trick...and there are a ton of tricks where I needed to get to this side &quot;[demonstrates going from standing regular on his board to standing on the nose]&quot;. It&#x27;s a transfer trickâI&#x27;d been doing that since the late seventies, so that I could, in turn, do things like this &quot;[demonstrates going from standing on the nose to a nose-stand and then landing back on his skateboard]&quot;. When I saw him [Gelfand] do it on the wall, I immediatelyâI&#x27;m thinking, the mechanics of it: how do you get your board off the groundâhow would you get your board off the ground like he did off the wall, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m stuck on flat ground, not weightless...[T]he first ones I did took about, I don&#x27;t know, five, ten minutes...I realized, that&#x27;s just the same motion I&#x27;ve been doing for yearsâit&#x27;s a see-saw motion; that&#x27;s how ollies work...it&#x27;s just a punch and a little hop; and the real key to it was dragging your foot and leveling it out, which brings the board up...In a back-handed way, people credit me within the documentary, Stacy [Peralta]&#x27;s &quot;Bones Brigade&quot; documentary, credit me with the importance of the ollie that gave the foundation for street skating, which is just skateboarding today, all that; and to me it was like, &quot;Yeah, but, it&#x27;s not a big deal.&quot; Took me ten minutes, fifteen, half an hour, an hour; and the next thing you know, you&#x27;re getting &#x27;em this high, and that&#x27;s what laid the foundation for everything else. So, in a sense, the biggest innovation for street skating, which is what they credit me forâit&#x27;s not a big deal!

Throughout the 1980s, Mullen invented many of skating&#x27;s flip tricks, including the kickflip, the heelflip, the 360-flip, and many others. These freestyle tricks were adapted to street skating by skaters such as Mark Gonzales and Natas Kaupas. Mullen&#x27;s tricks are now considered essential building blocks of both modern street skateboarding and vert skateboarding.

===World Industries===
In early 1989, Mullen left the Bones Brigade to join World Industries as a principal investor with longtime friend and former rival, Steve Rocco, in the formation of the very first skateboarder-owned companyâprofessional skateboarder, Mike Vallely, later joined the company for a brief period of time. Mullen and Rocco had embarked on a very risky venture, as Powell Peralta was an established company and Rocco&#x27;s upstart company had been struggling at the time. World Industries would later develop into the distribution company, Dwindle Distribution, which is the world&#x27;s largest skateboard manufacturer in the 21st century.

===Transition to street and Plan B===
As the popularity of freestyle skateboarding declined, Mullen was urged to transform his style to join the street skating trend that was becoming increasingly popular at that time; however, Mullen was very reluctant due to a fear of compromising his integrity, whereby the foundation of his skateboarding would be &quot;sold out&quot;. Such pressure is alluded to in the World Industries video, &quot;Rubbish Heap&quot;, in which Mullen&#x27;s sequence ends with a team member, Jeremy Klein, deliberately breaking his freestyle skateboard (which is also the first recorded focus of a skateboard) and then handing him a note from Rocco, accompanied by a street skateboard deck, in which the end of freestyle is declared.

In 1991, Mullen joined the high-profile skateboarding team, Plan B Skateboards. Mike Ternasky, the owner of Plan B, influenced Mullen to transition from freestyle to street skating, and showcased his skills in the 1992 Plan B video, &quot;Questionable&quot;. His segment begins with traditional freestyle tricks executed on flat ground, but quickly transitions into Mullen skateboarding across public terrain to shift into street skating tricks and lines. Mullen&#x27;s video part signified a major transformation in relation to both his career and his skateboarding. Ternasky filmed Mullen as he sequenced tricks and mixed flip tricks with grinds and boardslides, while he also negotiated obstacles. Mullen also introduced two newly invented tricks in &quot;Questionable&quot;, the kickflip underflip and the Casper slide.

Mullen&#x27;s &quot;Questionable&quot; performance might have marked the beginning of a new era in street skateboarding. His reluctant transition from freestyle to street skateboarding was a symbol that legitimized the technical direction street skating had taken over the previous few years. Mullen focused on the progression of this transition in subsequent Plan B videos, including 1993&#x27;s &quot;Virtual Reality&quot;, in which Mullen showcases the newly mastered trick, the darkslide. Mullen&#x27;s participation in Plan B dissolved after Ternasky was killed in a car crash on May 17, 1994. Mullen later explained, &quot;He was such a great person. He would lift you so high and that is why Plan B was what it was. And it was clear once Mike was gone that it was never the same.&quot;

=== A-Team and Enjoi ===
In 1997, Mullen started a company, the A-Teamâalong with Marc Johnson, Gershon Mosley, Dave Mayhew, and Chet Thomasâwith the intention of forming a &quot;super team&quot;. When A-Team folded in 2000, Mullen made the transition from company founder to company rider for Enjoi Skateboards. Former Maple rider, Marc Johnson, founded Enjoi Skateboards and also recruited riders Chris Cole and Bobby Puleo, with Jerry Hsu for the team.

=== Stance erasure ===
As a result of injuries accrued over many years riding in a fixed regular stance, from 2007 onward Mullen made a conscious effort to &quot;erase&quot; his riding stance, re-learning tricks (and in many cases learning new tricks he was unable to do previously riding regular) goofy and endeavoring to re-learn riding a skateboard neutrally in the absence of any preferential &quot;natural stance&quot;. In an interview with Tony Hawk, Mullen explained that he had developed problems in his right hip joint, with scar tissue building up in his joint over years as a result of habitually hyper-extending his leg (e.g., doing the splits, a danger inherent in practicing riskier tricks such as darkslides) while skating. Mullen stated that through extensive stretching and the use of blunt objects he was able to break up the scar tissue in order to restore his range of motion.

Mullen further explained in an interview at Germany&#x27;s Bright tradeshow in 2011:
For me, it was a grinding to a halt, until I could barely walk really... I took about a couple of years, a year-and-a-half of breaking myself apart; pretty medievally. And as I did so, I realized that that was helping me unravel my stance; and so now, I&#x27;ve just been investigating, or pushing myself to try to, to, take apart my stance so that I no longer have one. And so it&#x27;s not just doing everything switch, because everybody does whatever switch. It&#x27;s to have no stance at a physical level. And so even what you did in your regular, native stance, it feels...new.
===2014âpresent===
The Almost company celebrated its 10th anniversary with an event at the Berrics indoor skate complex in early March 2014, and Mullen attended the venue for the first time. As part of the celebration, Mullen completed an interview with the Berrics that is titled &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; in which Mullen explained his current relationship with skateboarding: &quot;Because we all have that fear of judgment...yeah, that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m like thatâI&#x27;m afraid of being judged. I don&#x27;t necessarily want to be seen in public sucking, getting older; but, what I keep inside, that joy of feeling what I do, rolling around, playing aroundâthat&#x27;s something I&#x27;m going to do as long as I can. That&#x27;s who I am...who I am.&quot;

The first video footage of Mullen skateboarding in nine years was published on Tony Hawk&#x27;s RIDE &quot;YouTube&quot; channel in July 2014. Mullen appears in the video skateboarding at musician Ben Harper&#x27;s residence and Harper also performs a single trick at the video&#x27;s conclusion. The part was filmed by Ben Fordham of the Gracias L.A. brand, which released the &quot;Gracias Skateboarding Volumen Uno&quot; video in 2014 that also features Mullen.

Together with other members of the Almost team, Mullen appeared in a June 2015 photo retrospective of the Almost brand that was shot and curated by skateboard photographer Seu Trinh. Mullen was part of the Globe brand&#x27;s &quot;EUTrippin&#x27;&quot; 2015 European tour, alongside other team members including Mark Appleyard and Haslam.

== Other ventures ==

===&quot;Rodney vs. Daewon&quot;===
Around 1997, Mullen also initiated discussions with friend and fellow professional skateboarder, Daewon Song, to plan the video &quot;Rodney vs. Daewon&quot;, released in 1997, which featured the two skaters &quot;competing&quot; with their respective video parts. The concept developed into a series and, , three &quot;rounds&quot; have been produced.

===Tensor===
Around 2000, Mullen engaged in the development of his own skateboard truck design, a concept that would later become the foundation for the company Tensor. In 2000, Mullen filed for a United States Patent in support of his innovative work in the area and submitted the following abstract to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office:
A skateboard having one or more truck assemblies configured to eliminate undesired ride characteristics such as hanger-jiggle and wheel bite, without sacrificing the skateboard&#x27;s steering responsiveness. Each truck assembly includes an axle assembly with a ring-shaped hanger that is confined on a kingpin using a pair of bushings, at least one of which includes an annular flange that projects into an annular gap defined between the hanger and the kingpin. This prevents the hanger from moving laterally relative to the kingpin and thereby eliminates undesired ride characteristics such as hanger-jiggle and wheel bite. In a separate feature of the invention, the skateboard truck assembly further incorporates a low-friction slider plate that enhances the rider&#x27;s performance of certain maneuvers and at the same time protects other components of the truck assembly from undue wear.

A subsequent advertisement was released, entitled &quot;The Patented Tensor Design.&quot; Tensor recruited team riders such as Daewon Song, Chris Cole, Chris Haslam, Salman Agah, Ryan Sheckler, Kanten Russell, and Gailea Momolu. , the Tensor team consists of Mullen, along with Daewon Song, Ronnie Creager, Enrique Lorenzo, Manny Santiago, Zered Bassett, Felipe Ortiz, and Joey Brezinski.

===Almost and Dwindle Distribution===

Mullen subsequently left Enjoi to co-found Almost Skateboards with Daewon Song, who had been unable to find success with the two preceding deck companies that he had founded, Deca and Artafact. Mullen and Song proceeded to recruit Cooper Wilt (a former Artafact rider), Chris Haslam (a former Deca and Artafact rider), Greg Lutzka, and Ryan Scheckler to form the initial basis of the company.

After years of success and controversy, Steve Rocco decided to sell World Industries. In 2002, World Industries, under the holding name &quot;Kubic Marketing,&quot; was sold to Globe International for US$46 million. Its owner Rocco and Mullen, a principal investor, both became instant multimillionaires. Kubic&#x27;s management remained intact, and Mullen began working for Globe under the Dwindle Distribution brand.

, Mullen remains the co-owner and a team rider for the Almost brand; his role at Almost also includes research and development on new designs and technologies, including Impact Support, Double Impact, and Uber Light. The Uber Light design was a collaborative effort between Mullen and the CL Composites company, utilizing a design that consists of &quot;a deck inside a deck&quot;, whereby, &quot;The internal carbon fiber foam deck is ultra-light and nearly as stiff as metal. It acts like rebar, or a skeleton embodied by a standard 7-ply layup. It also vastly improved the lateral rigidity. The deck wears, slides, and looks like a normal 7-ply, but it&#x27;s lighter and has a supernatural pop that lasts far longer than any normal deck.&quot;

Mullen also contributes to the design of experimental and composite deck constructions for Dwindle&#x27;s other brands, such as Blind and Darkstar.

=== Video game appearances ===
Mullen&#x27;s popularity grew in 2000 when he made his first appearance in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; video game series. Mullen has since appeared in various titles of the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; series including:

* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk: Ride&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater HD&quot;
* &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;
In 2019, he also voiced and performed motion capture as Jace Skell in &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon Breakpoint&quot;, which marks his sole non-skating appearance in a video game to date. In 2022, he and his team released his first game called &quot;Rodney Mullen&#x27;s Skatrix&quot;, an augmented reality mobile game for iOS and Android devices.

=== Books ===
In 2015, Mullen wrote the foreword to the Dwindle and Globe history book &quot;Unemployable: 30 Years of Hardcore, Skate and Street&quot; reflecting upon his twenty-year involvement with those companies. In 2003, Mullen wrote and released his autobiography, &quot;The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself&quot;.

=== Public speaking ===
Mullen has completed numerous public speaking engagements and has been invited to present on topics such as his personal life, skateboarding, innovation, creation, and the concept of community.

The Lemelson Center at MIT invited Mullen to visit the center, a part of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History to discuss invention and innovation from within the context of American society. The Lemelson Center exchanged ideas and views with Mullen about skateboarding, in addition to the manner in which creativity and innovation can contribute to the development of an improved society.

Mullen was invited by the Sapling Foundation, as part of its TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) public speaking series, to present at the University of Southern California (USC) in June 2012. Mullen&#x27;s talk was entitled, &quot;How Context Shapes Content&quot;, and featured his perspectives on the manner in which the street-based context of skateboarding influences his practice, in addition to his view of the skateboarding community, whereby he compared the community to the open source and hacking movements. Mullen also spoke about resilience and creativity in a talk entitled &quot;Getting Back Up&quot; at the Pop!Tech &quot;Sparks of Brilliance&quot; event in October 2013.

In the first half of 2014, Mullen was invited by the O&#x27;Reilly Media technology company to present at its &quot;Strata&quot; and &quot;Velocity&quot; conferences, both of which were held in Santa Clara, California. Mullen&#x27;s Strata presentation in February 2014 was titled &quot;The Art of Good Practice&quot; and consisted of an analysis of the nuanced way in which skateboarders practice their craft. Mullen then presented the &quot;Build on a Bedrock of Failure&quot; keynote in June 2014, in which he spoke of the way that &quot;failure, pain, injury, recovery&quot; are &quot;embedded in the very notion of what it is to be a skateboarder&quot;.

=== Film ===
In December 2010, Mullen stated in an interview that he was preparing to film a part for the upcoming Almost video, although he did not appear in the 2012 video, &quot;5-Incher&quot;. In the 2011 Bright tradeshow interview, Mullen stated, &quot;At first, I just wanted to be able to be alright and walk okay and run. And then it was like, okay, skate again and now it&#x27;s like &#x27;Yeah, I can do something new!&#x27;. So, if I can do that, then I&#x27;ll film. If I can&#x27;t, then I&#x27;ll keep my skating private.&quot; Both the skateboard media and in responses from Almost indicate that a full part from Mullen is scheduled for release following &quot;5-Incher&quot;âMullen was in attendance at the premiere of &quot;5-Incher&quot;.
== Awards, accolades and influence ==
In 2002, Mullen won the &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Skater of the Year. In 2003, he was voted as the all-time greatest action sports athlete on the Extreme Sports Channel&#x27;s &quot;Legends of the Extreme&quot; countdown. &quot;Transworld&quot; also included Mullen in its &quot;30 Most Influential Skaters of All Time&quot; list, released in December 2011 and he was elected into the third position, behind Tony Hawk (second) and Mark Gonzales (first).

In May 2013, Mullen was an inductee of the Skateboarding Hall of Fame and was present at the award ceremony that was held in Anaheim, California. Fellow professional skateboarder Steve Caballero and musician Ben Harper shared their experiences of Mullen prior to the presentation of the award, and Caballero credited Mullen with changing the &quot;face&quot; of skateboarding.

Professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez identified Mullen as one of his &quot;top ten&quot; professional skateboarders in July 2013. Rodriguez explained his selection on his personal website: If you really wanna know Gonz [Mark Gonzales] and Rodney Mullen pretty much innovated damn near everything in street skateboarding. Rodney has always had the most mind-boggling most difficult tricks on top of having invented 50, 60, who knows how many tricks. Just about every modern day flat ground trick that we are doing today he invented.

&quot;Transworld&quot; has characterized him as possibly the most significant skater of all time, &quot;Rodney Mullen built the house skateboarding lives in. After inventing the flatground ollieâin itself perhaps the most influential trick everâhe went on to unveil kickflips, backside flips, heelflips, 360 flips, double flips, impossibles, darkslides, and onward. Without Rodney, skateboarding would still be in the dark ages.&quot; Anthony Pappalardo of The RIDE Channel unequivocally stated, &quot;From almost singled-handedly creating the entire vocabulary of flip-based tricks to revolutionizing the boards below our feet, Rodney Mullen is the biggest influence on modern skateboarding.&quot; In &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; &quot;Skater&#x27;s Favorite Skater&quot; video series, both Tony Hawk and Daewon Song have cited Rodney Mullen as their favorite skater.

==Reflections and perspectives==
Mullen has publicly stated that an identification of his favorite skateboarders is an &quot;endless&quot; task. However, he has provided examples such as Chris Haslam, Bryan Herman, Paul Rodriguez, Antwuan Dixon, and Eric Koston.

In 2010 Mullen stated that &quot;skating is one of the greatest blessings I could have,&quot; but also expressed concern about the popularity of skateboarding &quot;big stuff&quot; due to the physical toll that it takes on the bodies of professional skateboarders: &quot;So I think it is unhealthy and uncool... I see great skaters and their ankles and knees are ruined.&quot; Mullen expanded upon his perspective of skateboarding during his Lemelson Foundation interview:
Skateboarding is as much, or more, an art of mode of expression than it is a sport. What skateboarding has given me is precisely that: a form of expression that drew me to it, and, in so doing, I was able to express and be who I wanted to be through it, in a sense. And establish myself within a community that were all essentially outsiders like myself. And by doing that, it gave me a place, a sense of belonging and, in the end, I was able to contribute, at a foundational level, a lot of the tricks that the entire community uses to express themselves. Which, again, is one of the beauties of skateboarding, is that we all draw from the same pool, and give back; so that others can do the same and keep expounding. Very much like an open source community.

During his attendance at the Biarritz international skateboard festival, Mullen was interviewed in relation to a used Mike Carroll skateboard deck from Carroll&#x27;s time with the Plan B company. Mullen reflected on the personal influence of Plan B founder Mike Ternasky during the interview: &quot;I miss Mike. And the day Jacob called me and goes, &quot;Mike&#x27;s dead.&quot;âI replayed that so many times...and how instrumental that was in driving me forward in a way that kind of honoring what he gave me: A second chance. And how real that is. And it goes back to Stacy [Peralta]&#x27;s filmâit&#x27;s not what you do; it&#x27;s what makes you do what you do, is the thing that has to be protected and nurtured. As long as that&#x27;s there, intact...you can do anything.&quot;

In a June 2014 interview at O&#x27;Reilly Media&#x27;s Velocity conference, Mullen stated that he does not believe that skateboarding can be categorized as a &quot;sport&quot;. Mullen further explained that the self-expressive element of skateboarding shows that it is an art form, while the community element of skateboardingâwhereby sharing of ideas occursâdistinguishes it as a &quot;lifestyle&quot; or &quot;philosophy&quot;. Mullen also shared his perspective on goals and failure during the interview: &quot;You focus so much on your failures and your weaknesses, it has a...paralyzing effect, where you&#x27;re dwelling on stuff. For example, having goals: sometimes I have lofty goals, my friends doâwe all do, we all have goals. But, if you fix yourself to that goal, and you don&#x27;t see anything else on the horizonâwhich is natural, &#x27;cos that what it takes, we all have that in our personality...but, sometimes, if you attach that to a goal that is out of your reach, and you continue to fail, it will just grind you into nothing. And if you dwell on that, it can end you.&quot;

Mullen says, &quot;Just the enjoyment of doing what you want to do, all the way throughâthat&#x27;s the beauty of skateboarding, that so many people actually never find their whole lives. And that&#x27;s what skateboarding&#x27;s given me: I can&#x27;t wake upâI can&#x27;t wait to wake up in the morning to try something new; a lot of times I can&#x27;t sleep because I can&#x27;t wait to try something new... and how many people never really experience that feeling, often; and that&#x27;s why I skate.&quot;

==Personal life==
, Mullen resides in California with his girlfriend, Lori Guidroz. He describes himself as &quot;juvenile&quot; who prefers to skate during the night and on his own. He says, &quot;Any eyes on meâa late-night street sweeper, some dude texting in his parked car, the homeless guy talking to himselfâmake me feel uncomfortable when I skate. Everyone expects me to do certain things. It puts a ceiling on your progress. You&#x27;re blocked by your pride. To get good, you have to throw your board around and fall.&quot;

Aside from skateboarding, Mullen has been interested in mathematics, physics, biomedical engineering (which he majored in college), computer coding and music. He has been invited to several TEDX conferences. It has been publicly revealed that Mullen owns a pair of high-powered audio speakers, each weighing around , through which he plays a diverse range of music, including Sabaton and Beethoven: &quot;Me and my neighbors, we have an understanding...and so I sit perfect, you know, triangle at the front. You sit there with the remote and you turn it up, just when it starts to hurt, and hit one more and then go like [presses his hands to his ears] that, and then you just feel it in your whole body for a while, as long as you can take it. And then you &#x27;arrgh!&#x27;, and then you turn it off you know and [hold his hand to his heart and breathes heavily], and then I go skate [laughs]. It&#x27;s awesome, but only if I&#x27;m really usually, like, just sometimes when you really need it, you know?&quot; He has also learned Linux and has described himself as a hacker.

Mullen is a Director&#x27;s Fellow at the MIT Media Lab and a Distinguished Research Scholar with the Smithsonian Institution. He has also addressed NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Lab and the Royal Society. Mullen is also a member of the scientific advisory board of the C4 Foundation.

In 2013 musicians Ben Harper and Lee Hartney revealed a close friendship with Mullen and described the skateboarder as a &quot;brother&quot;. Mullen has also assisted Harper to learn skateboarding, as the musician has undertaken intensive practice in the fifth decade of his life.

Mullen has spoken publicly about his spiritual beliefs; while he thanked &quot;My Lord, Jesus, for all He&#x27;s done for me&quot; in his autobiography and has studied the Bible, he explained in 2010: &quot;The term religion bums me out. I can&#x27;t go to church, I&#x27;ve got issues. I&#x27;ve got issues of non-conformity built into me...It&#x27;s a personal thing and I get so scared about talking about it in public. This guy at HBO once said to me, &#x27;Your skating is like a prayer.&#x27; That was the coolest thing anyone&#x27;s ever said to me. That&#x27;s what it is for me.&quot;

<text>Awjila (, ) is an oasis town in the Al Wahat District in the Cyrenaica region of northeastern Libya. Since classical times it has been known as a place where high quality dates are farmed. Since the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam has played an important role in the community. The oasis is located on the east-west caravan route between Egypt and Tripoli, Libya, and the north-south route between Benghazi and the Sahel between Lake Chad and Darfur. In the past, it was an important trading center. The people cultivate small gardens using water from deep wells. Recently, the oil industry has become an increasingly important source of employment.

==Location==

Awjila and the adjoining oasis of Jalu are isolated, the only towns on the desert highway between Ajdabiya, to the northwest, and Kufra, to the southeast.
An 1872 account describes the cluster of three oases: the Aujilah oasis, Jalloo (Jalu) to the east and Leshkerreh (Jikharra) to the northeast. Each oasis had a small hill covered in date palm trees, surrounded by a plain of red sand impregnated with salts of soda.
Among them, the three oases had a population of 9,000 to 10,000 people.
The people of the oasis are mainly Berber, and some still speak a Berber-origin language. As of 2005, the Awjila language was highly endangered.

==History==

===Classical times===

The Awjila (Augila) oasis is mentioned by Herodotus (c. 484 â 425 BC).
He describes the nomadic Nasamones who migrated between the coasts of Syrtis Major and the Augila oasis, where they may have exacted tribute from the local people.
Herodotus says it was a journey of ten days from the oasis of Ammonium, modern Siwa, to the oasis of Augila.
This distance was confirmed by the German explorer Friedrich Hornemann (1772â1801), who covered the distance in nine days, although caravans normally take 13 days.
In the summer the Nasamones left their flocks by the coast and travelled to the oasis to gather dates.
There were other permanent inhabitants of the oasis.

Ptolemy (c. 90 â 168) implies that the Greek colonists had forced the Nasamones to leave the coast and take up residence in Augila. 
Procopius, writing around 562, says that even in his day sacrifices continued to be made to Ammon and to Alexander the Great of Macedon in two Libyan cities that were both called Augila. He was probably referring to what are now El Agheila on the Gulf of Sirte and the oasis of Awjilah.
According to Procopius the temples of the oasis were converted into Christian churches by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (c. 482 â 565).
The 6th-century geographer Stephanus of Byzantium described Augila as a city.

===Early Arab era===

The Arabs launched a campaign against the Byzantine Empire soon after Muhammad died in 632, quickly conquering Syria, Persia and Egypt. After occupying Alexandria in 643, they swept along the Mediterranean coast of Africa, taking Cyrenaica in 644, Tripolitania in 646 and Fezzan in 663.

The region around Awjila was conquered by Sidi âAbdullÄh ibn Saâad ibn AbÄ« as-Sará¸¥.
He was a companion of Muhammad and standard bearer, and an important saint. His tomb was established in Awjila around 650.
A modern structure has since replaced the original tomb.
The Sarahna family, who consider themselves the family of Sidi Abdullah, are the protectors of his tomb.
When the Senussi center was established in Awjila in 1872, the Sarahna assumed the role of Islamic teachers.

After being introduced in the 7th century, Islam has always been a major influence on the life of the oasis.
The Arab chronicler Al-Bakri says that there were already several mosques around the oasis by the 11th century.
According to oral tradition, in the 12th century a learned man from the coast of Tripolitania said that there were forty shrines in Awjila, 
and forty saints hidden among the people of the oasis. By the late 1960s only sixteen shrines remained.
Some of the saints in the surviving tombs lived during the early years of Islam, 
and the details of their life and even their family lineage have been forgotten.

===Trading centre===

In the 10th century Awjila was a stage on the trading route between the Ibadi Berber capital of Zuwayla in the Fezzan and the newly established Fatimid capital of Cairo in Egypt.
The east-west caravan route from Cairo to Tripoli, the Fezzan and Tunis went via Jaghbub, Jalu and Awjila. 
In the early Mamluk era (13th century), trade from Egypt was along a route that led via Awjila to the Fezzan, and then on to Kanem, Bornu and to cities such as Timbuktu on the Niger bend. Awjila became the main market for slaves from these regions.
Most of these slaves supplied domestic needs.
Gold was purchased from Bambouk and BourÃ© in what is now Senegal but then was part of the Mali Empire of the Mandinka people. 
In exchange, Egypt exported textiles.

During the Ottoman period in Egypt, Awjila lay on the route taken by pilgrims traveling from Timbuktu via Ghat, Ghadames and the Fezzan, 
avoiding the main Ottoman centers.
In 1639 Awjila came under the rule of the Turkish ruler of Tripolitania, who stationed a permanent garrison at Benghazi.
In the 18th century, the merchants of Awjila held a monopoly over the trade between Cairo and the Fezzan.
Describing the trade between Egypt and Hausaland, Hornemann lists:


Around 1810 a Majabra trader from Jalu named Schehaymah became lost while travelling to Wadai via Murzuk in the Fezzan.
He was found by some Bidayat, who took him via Ounianga to Wara, the old capital of Wadai.
The Sultan of Wadai, Abd al-Karim Sabun (1804â1815) agreed with Schehaymah&#x27;s proposal to open a caravan route to Benghazi along a direct route through Kufra, and Awjila / Jalu. 
This new route would bypass both Fezzan and Darfur, states that until then had controlled the eastern Saharan trade. 
The first caravans travelled the route between 1809 and 1820.

The trade was disrupted for a while in the 1820s due to political instability in Wadai, but starting in the 1830s every two or three years a caravan would travel the route.
Usually there were two or three hundred camels carrying ivory and skins, along with a batch of slaves. 
Trade increased from the 1860s. The main stations between Benghazi and the southern terminal at AbÃ©chÃ© were the assembly point at Awjila / Jalu where the caravans were made up, and the center at Kufra where food and water could be obtained.
Later the north-south route again grew in importance due to disruption of traffic on the Nile by the Mahdist revolution in the Sudan.

Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi stayed in Jalu and Awjila before opening his first lodge in al-Baida in 1843.
Over the next ten years the lodges of the Senussi became established throughout the Bedouins of Cyrenaica. 
Later they spread the Senussi influence further south, helping quell violence and resolve trade disputes.
Each post on the north-south route, including Awjila, was protected by a Senussi sheikh.
As late as 1907, a significant amount of the trade passing through Benghazi was in goods carried over this route, and goods would also have been routed from interior points such as Awjila and Jalu east to Egypt and west to Tripoli.

==Recent years==

Today the main activities of the people in Awjila are agriculture and working for the oil sector companies, as this area is the cradle of Libyan wealth.
The main crops are dates from the many varieties of palm trees, tomatoes, and cereals.
The Awjila oasis is known for the high quality of its dates.
Starting in the 1960s, the oil industry drove growth in the once-sleepy village.
In 1968 the population of the village was about 2,000 people, but by 1982 it had risen to over 4,000, supported by twelve mosques.
A 2007 travel guide gives the population as 6,790.

The Great Mosque of Atiq is the oldest &quot;masjed&quot; (mosque) in the Sahara with its unique style of architecture with rooms that are naturally air conditioned. In the scorching heat of the summer days the rooms are cool and at night they are warm.
The oasis was a destination for viewing the Solar eclipse of March 29, 2006.

<doc id="147951" wikidata="Q565638" url="?curid=147951" title="Little Dorrit">
<text>Little Dorrit is a novel by English author Charles Dickens, originally published in serial form between 1855 and 1857. The story features Amy Dorrit, youngest child of her family, born and raised in the Marshalsea prison for debtors in London. Arthur Clennam encounters her after returning home from a 20-year absence, ready to begin his life anew.

The novel satirises some shortcomings of British society and government at the time, including the institution of debtors&#x27; prisons, where debtors were imprisoned, unable to work and yet incarcerated until they had repaid their debts. The prison in this case is the Marshalsea, where Dickens&#x27;s own father had been imprisoned. Dickens is also critical of the inert bureaucracy of the British government, in this novel in the form of the fictional &quot;Circumlocution Office&quot;. In addition, Dickens satirises the stratification of society that results from the British class system.

==Plot summary==
===Poverty===
In 1826 Marseille, murderer Rigaud narrates to his prison cellmate John Baptist Cavalletto how he had killed his wife, just prior to being taken to trial. Businessman Arthur Clennam is detained with other travelers in quarantine in Marseilles and becomes friends with the merchants Mr. and Mrs. Meagles, their daughter &quot;Pet&quot;, and their maid, an orphan named Harriet Beadle whom the family has nicknamed Tattycoram. Arthur spent the last twenty years in China with his father, handling that part of the family business; his father died recently there. Arthur is now returning to London to see his mother, Mrs Clennam.
When Arthur&#x27;s father was on his deathbed, he gave Arthur a watch to give to his mother with a message inside, murmuring &quot;Your mother,&quot; which Arthur delivers to Mrs. Clennam. Inside the watch casing is an old silk paper with the initials DNF (do not forget) worked in beads. Arthur asks about the message, but Mrs. Clennam, who now uses a wheelchair, refuses to reveal what it means. Arthur says that he will not continue in the family business and will seek new opportunity on his own. Jeremiah Flintwinch then presses Mrs. Clennam on her failure to tell Arthur of the past.

In London, William Dorrit, imprisoned as a debtor, has been a resident of Marshalsea debtors&#x27; prison for over twenty years. He has three children: Edward (known as Tip), Fanny and Amy. The youngest daughter, Amy, was born in the prison and is affectionately known as Little Dorrit. Their mother died when Amy was eight years old. Tip has recently been imprisoned for his own gambling debts, and Fanny lives outside the prison with William&#x27;s older brother Frederick. She works as a dancing girl in the music hall (where Frederick plays the clarinet) and has attracted the attention of the wealthy Edmund Sparkler. Little Dorrit, devoted to her father, supports them both through her sewing and is free to pass in and out of the prison. To maintain the honour of her father, who is embarrassed to acknowledge his financial position, Little Dorrit avoids mentioning her work outside the prison or his inability to leave. Mr Dorrit assumes the role of Father of the Marshalsea and is held in respect by its inhabitants, as if he had chosen to live there.

After Arthur tells his mother that he will not continue in the family business, Mrs. Clennam chooses her clerk Jeremiah Flintwinch as her partner. When Arthur learns that Mrs. Clennam employs Little Dorrit as a seamstress and shows her unusual kindness, he wonders whether the young girl might be connected with the watch&#x27;s mystery. Arthur follows the girl to the Marshalsea. He tries in vain to enquire about William Dorrit&#x27;s debt in the Circumlocution Office â assuming the role of benefactor towards Little Dorrit, her father, and her brother. Meanwhile, Rigaud, who has been released for lack of evidence, approaches Mrs. Clennam under the name Blandois and blackmails her and Flintwinch into giving him a place in her business.

While at the Circumlocution Office, Arthur meets successful inventor Daniel Doyce. Doyce wants a partner and man of business at his factory, and Arthur agrees to fill that role. Arthur encounters Cavalletto, who is injured by a carriage in London, and aids him in getting medical care. Cavalletto lives in hopes of never again seeing Blandois. Little Dorrit falls in love with Arthur, who fails to recognise her feelings. He is infatuated with Pet Meagles but is disappointed when she marries the cruel artist Henry Gowan. After Pet&#x27;s wedding, the Meagles family suffers a blow when Tattycoram runs away to live with traveler Miss Wade.

Arthur becomes reacquainted with his former fiancÃ©e Flora Finching, the reason he was sent away to China. She is now a widow and takes care of the aunt of her late husband. Her father Mr Casby owns many rental properties, and his rent collector, Mr Pancks, takes the brunt of the dirty work of collecting Casby&#x27;s inflated rents. Pancks discovers that William Dorrit is the lost heir to a fortune, enabling him to pay his way out of prison and altering the status of the entire family. Restored to wealth, Dorrit shuns all reminders of his past and forbids a heartbroken Little Dorrit from seeing Arthur again.

===Riches===
The now wealthy Dorrits decide that they should tour Europe as a newly respectable rich family. They travel over the Alps and take up residence for a time in Venice, and finally in Rome, displaying pride over their new-found wealth and position, hiding their past from new friends. Little Dorrit finds it difficult to adjust to their wealth and new social position, but only her uncle Frederick shares her feelings. Fanny and Tip adjust rapidly to the ways of society, as does Mr. Dorrit. But he fears that someone will discover the truth of his past spent in the Marshalsea. At a party In Rome, Mr Dorrit falls ill and later dies. His distraught brother Frederick dies that same night. Little Dorrit, left alone, returns to London to stay with newly married Fanny and her husband, Edmund Sparkler. Meanwhile, Blandois disappears, and Mrs Clennam is suspected of his murder.

===The financial collapse===

The financial house of Merdle, Edmund Sparkler&#x27;s stepfather, ends with Merdle&#x27;s suicide. The collapse of his bank and investment businesses takes with it the savings of the Dorrits, the firm of Doyce and Clennam, Arthur Clennam, Pancks and thousands of others. Pancks feels guilt for persuading Clennam to invest with Merdle, who everyone considered the financial &quot;man of the hour.&quot; Ashamed and unable to pay the business debts, Clennam is imprisoned in the Marshalsea, where he becomes ill. When Little Dorrit arrives in London, she nurses him back to health.

At Arthur&#x27;s request, Cavalletto tracks down Blandois and brings him to Arthur at the Marshalsea. The truth of Mrs. Clennam&#x27;s past is revealed by Blandois and confirmed by Jeremiah at the Clennam home one week after the meeting in the Marshalsea. Her marriage was arranged by her parents and Clennam&#x27;s uncle, though uncle Gilbert knew his nephew had already married. Mrs. Clennam insisted on bringing up little Arthur and denying his biological mother, his father&#x27;s first wife, the right to see him. Mrs. Clennam feels this is her right to punish others, under the guise of her religion. She was hurt and used her power to hurt others.

Arthur&#x27;s biological mother died about the same time as Arthur went off to China. In her younger life, she joined a boarding house of artistic people in London. Later Mr. Clennam&#x27;s wealthy uncle Gilbert, stung by remorse, left a bequest to Arthur&#x27;s biological mother and to the youngest daughter of her patron. If the patron had no daughter, the youngest child of his brother would inherit. The patron was Frederick Dorrit, the musician who had taught and befriended Arthur&#x27;s biological mother, and the beneficiary is his niece, Amy Dorrit.

After prodding Mrs. Clennam to tell the truth, which she refuses to do, Jeremiah gave the papers with this codicil to the uncle&#x27;s will to his twin brother on the night that Arthur arrived home. He told Mrs. Clennam that he had burned the papers on the next day. Blandois took the papers after killing Jeremiah&#x27;s brother and left a copy at the Marshalsea for Little Dorrit.

Although Mrs Clennam failed to tell Little Dorrit of her inheritance or give it to her, she hired her for seamstress work. She failed to tell Arthur about his biological mother, although Arthur had sensed that his father had some past burden on his mind as he died. Unwilling to yield to blackmail by Blandois and with some remorse, the rigid woman rises from her chair and totters out of her house to reveal the secrets to Little Dorrit at the Marshalsea. Mrs. Clennam begs her forgiveness, which the girl grants.

Returning home, Mrs. Clennam falls in the street, never to recover the use of her speech or limbs, as the house of Clennam collapses before her eyes, killing Blandois. Affery was outdoors seeking her mistress, and Jeremiah had escaped London with as much money as he could find. Rather than hurt Arthur, Little Dorrit chooses not to reveal the will that was meant to benefit her but will tell him about his parents after his mother dies.

Mr. Meagles seeks the original papers, stopping in France to ask Miss Wade. She has them but denies it. Tattycoram, who has suffered under Miss Wade&#x27;s sadistic temperament, follows Meagles back to London and presents the papers to him. He gives them to Little Dorrit. When Arthur is well and they are about to marry, Little Dorrit asks him to burn the papers. Mr. Meagles then seeks out Arthur&#x27;s business partner Daniel Doyce from abroad. Doyce returns a wealthy and successful man, who arranges to clear all debts for Arthur&#x27;s release. Arthur is released from the prison with his fortunes revived, his position secure with Doyce, and his health restored. Arthur and Little Dorrit marry.

==Sub-plots==
&quot;Little Dorrit&quot; contains numerous sub-plots. One concerns Arthur Clennam&#x27;s friends, the kind-hearted Meagles family, who are upset when their daughter Pet marries the artist Henry Gowan, and when their servant and foster daughter Tattycoram is lured away from them by the sinister Miss Wade, an acquaintance of the criminal Rigaud. A jilted sweetheart of Gowan, Miss Wade is ruled by her anger.

Another subplot concerns the Italian man John Baptist Cavalletto, who was the cellmate of Rigaud in Marseilles when jailed for a minor crime. He makes his way to London, meets up by chance with Clennam â who stands security for him as he builds up his business in wood carving â and gains acceptance among the residents of Bleeding Heart Yard. Cavalletto repays this aid by searching for Blandois/Rigaud when Arthur wants him found. This action leads to the revelation of Mrs Clennam&#x27;s secrets.

The other major subplot is the satire of British bureaucracy, characterized by the Circumlocution Office, where the expertise is how not to do it.

==Characters==
*Rigaud: European man who is in prison in Marseilles awaiting trial for murdering his wife. He demands that others treat him as a gentleman, though he does not treat others as a gentleman would. After he persuades the jury he is not guilty, he is known as Lagnier when encountered by Cavalletto at an inn in France. In England he is known as Blandois.
*John Baptist Cavalletto: Italian man awaiting trial for minor smuggling in Marseilles and put in the same cell with Rigaud. He makes his way to England, settling in Bleeding Heart Yard, through his connection with Arthur Clennam.
*Arthur Clennam: Returning from China, he spent weeks in quarantine in Marseilles, having traveled through a place with plague. He is 40 years old single, and meets new friends in the quarantine. He is a man of honour and kindness, with skills in business.
*Mrs Clennam: Wife of Arthur Clennam&#x27;s father, who ran the family business in London. She was raised in a strict and harsh religious sect and keeps up the ways of her childhood. She kept Arthur with her in London until he was caught with a girlfriend, and both she and the girl&#x27;s parents disapproved of the connection. She sent him away to work with his father in China.
*Mr Gilbert Clennam: Uncle to the father of Arthur Clennam and founder of the family business. He forced Arthur&#x27;s father, whom he raised, to give up the marriage he made to marry a woman of the uncle&#x27;s choosing. Gilbert Clennam is not alive in the time of this story but was when Arthur was born 40 years earlier.
*The biological mother of Arthur Clennam: She is only mentioned as Arthur&#x27;s biological mother and the first wife of his father. She was pushed away by Mrs Clennam and Gilbert Clennam. 
*Affery: Later Mrs Flintwinch. She takes care of Mrs Clennam and of Arthur before he went to China. She is afraid of both her husband and her mistress. She hears the sounds of the building, all mysterious to her.
*Mr Jeremiah Flintwinch: Clerk to the Clennam business until Arthur announces that he will not work in the family business on his return to London. Mr Flintwinch is raised up to be partner with Mrs Clennam. When Mrs Clennam became an invalid needing much care, she decided that Flintwinch and Affery should marry, so they did. After the blackmail attempt, he fled London and was said to be known as Mynheer von Flyntevynge in Amsterdam and The Hague.
*Mr Meagles: A retired English banker travelling in Europe with his wife, daughter and the maid for his daughter. He and his family are held in quarantine at Marseilles, having travelled through an area with plague, though none are ill. He becomes friends with Arthur Clennam.
*Mrs Meagles: Wife of Mr Meagles and mother of their daughter.
*Minnie Meagles: Daughter of Mr and Mrs Meagles, survivor of twin girls. She is a beautiful young woman, spoiled by her parents, and known as Pet to them.
*Tattycoram: Maid to Minnie Meagles. She was an orphan taken in by the Meagles. She is younger than Minnie, with rich dark hair, and has a temperament that can run to anger. Her real name is Harriet Beadle. She lives with the family in Twickenham, then with Miss Wade in London and in Calais until she returns to the Meagles.
*Miss Wade: Another traveller held in quarantine in Marseilles. She is aloof but makes a connection with Tattycoram. She once was wooed by Henry Gowan. She is linked with Rigaud, as he left the valuable box of Clennam family papers with her.
*Mr William Dorrit: About thirty years before the story begins, he entered the Marshalsea debtors&#x27; prison with his wife and two children. Over time he becomes the &quot;Father of the Marshalsea&quot;, based on his social ways, maintaining the expectations of the class in which he was raised. He makes no efforts to resolve the situation that put him in the prison.
*Mrs Dorrit: She arrived at the prison a day after her husband, with their two children. She was pregnant, and about seven months later gave birth to their third child and second daughter. Mrs Dorrit died when the girl was about 8 years old.
*Edward Dorrit: The eldest child of the Dorrits, also called Tip, who enters the prison at about age 3. He grows up to become a gambler.
*Fanny Dorrit: The elder daughter of the Dorrits, who enters the prison at age 2. She grows to be an attractive and active young woman, who takes training in dancing for the theatre. Later she marries Edmund Sparkler.
*Amy Dorrit: She was born in the prison and is called Little Dorrit. She grows up as a girl who cares for others and is practical in getting enough money to support herself and her father in the prison. She is the emotional and practical centre of her family. She is 22 years old when the story opens.
*Frederick Dorrit: Elder brother of William, uncle to Edward, Fanny and Amy. He is artistic, and he plays a musical instrument to support himself since the family finances fell apart. He does not have the same character as his younger brother. In his younger days, he had a house for artistic people, and took in the mother of Arthur Clennam who was a singer.
*Young John Chivery: He is the son of John Chivery, who hopes to hand over his position on the lock at the Marshalsea Prison in due time. Young John is in love with Little Dorrit, but his feelings are not returned. He acts to aid her when he can, including helping Pancks in the &quot;fortune teller&quot; task of linking the Dorrits to their inheritance.
*Mrs Finching: Now a widow, in her young days Flora was in love with Arthur Clennam. When he returns to England, she maintains a hope that he will fall in love with her again, though she has changed greatly. She adds humour when she enters a scene, never able to address Arthur as Mr Clennam, as would be proper in the present. Her father is Mr Casby.
*Mr F&#x27;s aunt: When her husband dies, Mrs Finching inherits the care of his aunt, whose words are spoken with defiance, but never really make sense.
*Mr Christopher Casby: Also called The Patriarch, for his deceptively kind appearance, with long grey hair. He pushes Pancks to ruthlessly collect rents, while maintaining a benevolent image before the world. He owns the property of Bleeding Heart Yard, and Flora is his daughter.
*Mr Pancks: Rent collector for Mr Casby. He becomes friends with Arthur Clennam, and indulges his side interest of matching people with lost inheritances, in which role he calls himself the &quot;fortune teller&quot;.
*Mr Rugg: Attorney for Mr Pancks and for Doyce &amp; Clennam, also landlord to Pancks. He aided in the &quot;fortune-telling&quot; work to link Dorrits to their inheritance.
*Daniel Doyce: An inventor of mechanical devices, with a trail of successes in Paris and St Petersburg. He returns to England with vain hopes of getting a patent on a device he invented, and he has a company based in Bleeding Heart Yard. He first meets Arthur Clennam in the Circumlocution Department. He is friends with Mr Meagles, and takes on Arthur Clennam as his man of finance and business partner.
*Mr Edmund Sparkler: A dimwitted, upper class, young man who falls for Fanny Dorrit as a dancer. They meet again when the Dorrits are wealthy, and he pursues Fanny until she agrees to marry him. Before Mr Merdle (his &quot;governor&quot;) fails, he secures a position for Sparkler in the Circumlocution Office.
*Mrs Merdle: Mother of Edmund Sparkler, and remarried to Mr Merdle. She finds her social match in Fanny Dorrit. She is also referred to as &#x27;the Bosom&#x27;.
*Mr Merdle: In the period of riches for the Dorrits, he is the &quot;man of the age&quot;, a banker and financier. News of his success in investments spreads like wildfire, with everyone putting their money with him, or wishing they could. His schemes fail, which is learned after he commits suicide.
*Mr Henry Gowan: Handsome young man, related to the Barnacle family but not closely enough to have more than a small annual income from his mother. He earns money as an artist, pursues Minnie Meagles and marries her around the time that the Dorrits become rich. He is supported financially by his in-laws. The young couple meet the Dorrits while both are touring in Europe.
*Mr Tite Barnacle: On staff in the Circumlocution Department in London. He is part of the titled family, the Barnacles. Arthur encounters him in his persistence, first to learn the creditor who keeps William Dorrit in debtors&#x27; prison, then to get the patent for Doyce&#x27;s invention, two unsuccessful ventures.
*Mr Ferdinand Barnacle: Younger member of the noble family and friends with Henry Gowan. He visits Arthur Clennam at the Marshalsea prison, happy to learn the Circumlocution Office did not put him into the debtors&#x27; prison, and tries to explain to Arthur the value of their office doing nothing.
*Mr Plornish: Plasterer who lives with his family in Bleeding Heart Yard. He was briefly in the Marshalsea prison, where he met William Dorrit and Little Dorrit. He is a friend to Little Dorrit. Later he and his wife have a store, with funds supplied by William Dorrit before he left England.
*Mrs Plornish: Wife of the plasterer and a good friend to John Baptist Cavalletto when he arrives in Bleeding Heart Yard and a friend to Arthur Clennam. 
*Mr Nandy: Father of Mrs Plornish. He lives with his daughter&#x27;s family when their finances improve. Otherwise, he is forced to live in the poorhouse. He is the one pauper whom William Dorrit allows to visit him, but when Little Dorrit walks with him from the Plornish home to the prison, Dorrit is enraged that she is seen on the streets with a pauper.
*Maggy: Young woman, left underdeveloped due to disease, who is befriended by Little Dorrit. She calls Little Dorrit her little mother, as Maggy is taller and bigger than Little Dorrit.
*Mrs General: Widow hired by William Dorrit to guide his daughters in the ways of society when the family is rich. She is proud never to show any feelings, and always speak calmly. She is well &quot;varnished&quot;.
*Ephraim Flintwinch: Twin brother of Jeremiah, living in Antwerp. He took in Arthur&#x27;s birth mother after Mrs Clennam forced her away, and took care of her until her death, about the time that Arthur went off with his father. Before Arthur&#x27;s return, Jeremiah gave his twin brother the original papers regarding the uncle&#x27;s will and letters written by the mother. Rigaud murders Ephraim to obtain the box of documents.

==Development of the novel==
The character Little Dorrit (Amy) was inspired by Mary Ann Cooper (nÃ©e Mitton), whom Dickens sometimes visited along with her family, and called by that name. They lived in The Cedars, a house on Hatton Road west of London; its site is now under the east end of London Heathrow Airport. This model for Little Dorrit, and the development of the plot, is contested by others.
Dickens&#x27; working title for the novel was Nobodyâs Fault.

==Significance and reception==

Like much of Dickens&#x27;s later fiction, this novel has seen many reversals of critical fortune. It has been shown to be a critique of HM Treasury and the blunders that led to the loss of life of 360 British soldiers at the Battle of Balaclava. Imprisonment â both literal and figurative â is a major theme of the novel, with Clennam and the Meagles quarantined in Marseilles, Rigaud jailed for murder, Mrs Clennam confined to her house, the Dorrits imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and most of the characters trapped within the rigidly defined English social class structure of the time.

Tchaikovsky, a voracious reader and theatre-goer when he was not composing, was entranced by the book.

Franz Kafka, a great admirer of Dickens, sent a copy to Felice Bauer. &quot; Yesterday I sent you &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. You know it well. How could we forget Dickens. It&#x27;s probably not a good read in its entirety with the children, but parts of it will certainly give you and them great pleasure.&quot;

The American critic Anne Stevenson speaks of &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; as &quot;a wonderful read â a tragical-comical-satirical-poetical mystery story that turns out to be an allegory of love.&quot; She praises the characterization of the &quot;major characters&quot; (Arthur Clennam, Mr Dorrit, Little Dorrit), but sees others as &quot;a cast of puppets that the master showman can&#x27;t help but tag with formulaic phrasesÂ â¦ Each character&#x27;s name is a guide to the entertainment to be expected: the energetic Mr Pancks invariably rakes his hair upright and steams about like a tugboat; Mr Sparkler rants about &quot;damn fine women with no nonsense about them&quot;; Mr Flintwinch, with his wry neck and crooked necktie, perpetually screws himself into sinister corners.&quot;

==Publication history==

The novel was then issued as a book by Bradbury and Evans in 1857.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Little Dorrit&quot; has been adapted for the screen six times.

The first, a two-reel short, was released on July 29, 1913 by Thanhouser, directed by James Kirkwood.

The 1920 version was a British adaptation directed by Sidney Morgan.

A Danish version appeared in 1924, directed by A.W. Sandberg with Frederik Jensen as William Dorrit, Gunnar TolnÃ¦s as Clennam, and Karina Bell in the title role.

The 1934 German adaptation, &quot;Kleine Dorrit&quot;, starred Anny Ondra as Little Dorrit and Mathias Wieman as Arthur Clennam. It was directed by Karel LamaÄ.

The fifth adaptation, in 1987, was a UK feature film of the same title as the novel, directed by Christine Edzard and starring Alec Guinness as William Dorrit and Derek Jacobi as Arthur Clennam, supported by a cast of over 300 British actors.

The sixth adaptation was a TV series co-produced by the BBC and WGBH Boston, written by Andrew Davies and featuring Claire Foy (as Little Dorrit), Andy Serkis (as Rigaud/Blandois), Matthew Macfadyen (as Arthur Clennam), Tom Courtenay (as William Dorrit), Judy Parfitt (as Mrs Clennam), and Alun Armstrong (as Jeremiah/Ephraim Flintwinch). The series aired between October and December 2008 in the UK, in the USA on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece&quot; in April 2009, and in Australia, on ABC1 TV, in June and July 2010.

In 2001 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of five hour-long episodes, starring Sir Ian McKellen as the narrator.

&quot;Little Dorrit&quot; forms the backdrop to Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Great Fire of London&quot; (1982).

Dickens&#x27;s story provided inspiration for the web comic &quot;The Adventures of Dorrit Little&quot; by artist Monica McKelvey Johnson.

<text>Videotape is magnetic tape used for storing video and usually sound in addition. Information stored can be in the form of either an analog or digital signal. Videotape is used in both video tape recorders (VTRs) and, more commonly, videocassette recorders (VCRs) and camcorders. Videotapes have also been used for storing scientific or medical data, such as the data produced by an electrocardiogram.

Because video signals have a very high bandwidth, and stationary heads would require extremely high tape speeds, in most cases, a helical-scan video head rotates against the moving tape to record the data in two dimensions.

Tape is a linear method of storing information and thus imposes delays to access a portion of the tape that is not already against the heads. The early 2000s saw the introduction and rise to prominence of high-quality random-access video recording media such as hard disks and flash memory. Since then, videotape has been increasingly relegated to archival and similar uses.

== Early formats ==
The electronics division of entertainer Bing Crosby&#x27;s production company, Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), gave the world&#x27;s first demonstration of a videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. In development by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device gave what were described as &quot;blurred and indistinct&quot; images using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (0.635Â cm) audiotape moving at per second. A year later, an improved version using one-inch (2.54Â cm) magnetic tape was shown to the press, who reportedly expressed amazement at the quality of the images although they had a &quot;persistent grainy quality that looked like a worn motion picture.&quot; Overall the picture quality was still considered inferior to the best kinescope recordings on film. Bing Crosby Enterprises hoped to have a commercial version available in 1954 but none came forth.

The BBC experimented from 1952 to 1958 with a high-speed linear videotape system called Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus (VERA), but this was ultimately dropped in favor of quadruplex videotape. VERA used half-inch metallized (1.27Â cm) tape on 20-inch reels traveling at .

RCA demonstrated the magnetic tape recording of both black-and-white and color television programs at its Princeton laboratories on December 1, 1953. The high-speed longitudinal tape system, called Simplex, in development since 1951, could record and play back only a few minutes of a television program. The color system used half-inch (1.27Â cm) tape on 10Â½ inch reels to record five tracks, one each for red, blue, green, synchronization, and audio. The black-and-white system used quarter-inch (0.635Â cm) tape also on 10Â½ inch reels with two tracks, one for video and one for audio. Both systems ran at with per reel yielding an 83-second capacity. RCA-owned NBC first used it on &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot; on October 23, 1956, when a prerecorded song sequence by Dorothy Collins in color was included in the otherwise live television program.

In 1953, Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype helical scan video tape recorder.

BCE demonstrated a color system in February 1955 using a longitudinal recording on half-inch (1.27Â cm) tape. CBS, RCA&#x27;s competitor, was about to order BCE machines when Ampex introduced the superior Quadruplex system. BCE was acquired by 3M Company in 1956.

In 1959, Toshiba released the first commercial helical scan video tape recorder.

== Broadcast video ==

=== Quad ===
The first commercial professional broadcast quality videotape machines capable of replacing kinescopes were the two-inch quadruplex videotape (Quad) machines introduced by Ampex on April 14, 1956, at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Chicago. Quad employed a transverse (scanning the tape across its width) four-head system on a two-inch (5.08Â cm) tape and stationary heads for the soundtrack.

CBS Television first used the Ampex VRX-1000 Mark IV at its Television City studios in Hollywood on November 30, 1956, to play a delayed broadcast of &quot;Douglas Edwards and the News&quot; from New York City to the Pacific Time Zone. On January 22, 1957, the NBC Television game show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, produced in Hollywood, became the first program to be broadcast in all time zones from a prerecorded videotape. 

Ampex introduced a color videotape recorder in 1958 in a cross-licensing agreement with RCA, whose engineers had developed it from an Ampex black-and-white recorder. NBC&#x27;s special, &quot;An Evening With Fred Astaire&quot; (1958), is the oldest surviving television network color videotape, and has been restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

On December 7, 1963, instant replay, originally a videotape-based system, was used for the first time during the live transmission of the ArmyâNavy Game by its inventor, director Tony Verna.

Although Quad became the industry standard for approximately thirty years, it has drawbacks such as an inability to freeze pictures, and no picture search. Also, in early machines, a tape could reliably be played back using only the same set of hand-made tape heads, which wore out very quickly. Despite these problems, Quad is capable of producing excellent images. Subsequent videotape systems have used helical scan, where the video heads record diagonal tracks (of complete fields) onto the tape.

Many early videotape recordings were not preserved. While much less expensive (if repeatedly recycled) and more convenient than kinescope, the high cost of 3M Scotch 179 and other early videotapes ($300 per one-hour reel) meant that most broadcasters erased and reused them, and (in the United States) regarded videotape as simply a better and more cost-effective means of time-delaying broadcasts than kinescopes. It was the four time zones of the continental United States which had made the system very desirable in the first place.

Some early broadcast videotapes have survived, including &quot;The Edsel Show&quot;, broadcast live on October 13, 1957 and &quot;An Evening With Fred Astaire&quot; which aired on October 18, 1958 and was the oldest color videotape of an entertainment program known to exist until the discovery of the October 8, 1958 episode of the &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; hosted by Milton Berle. The oldest color videotape known to survive is the May 1958 dedication of the WRC-TV studios in Washington, D.C.). In 1976, NBC&#x27;s 50th-anniversary special included an excerpt from a 1957 color special starring Donald O&#x27;Connor; despite some obvious technical problems, the color tape was remarkably good. Some classic television programs recorded on studio videotape have been made available on DVD â among them NBC&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (first telecast in 1960) with Mary Martin as Peter, several episodes of The Dinah Shore Chevy Show (late 1950s/early 60s), the final Howdy Doody Show (1960), the television version of Hal Holbrook&#x27;s one-man show &quot;Mark Twain Tonight&quot; (first telecast in 1967), and Mikhail Baryshnikov&#x27;s classic production of the ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (first telecast in 1977).

=== Types C and B ===
The next format to gain widespread usage was 1 inch (2.54 cm) Type C videotape introduced in 1976. This format introduced features such as shuttling, various-speed playback (including slow-motion), and still framing. Although 1&quot; Type C&#x27;s quality was still quite high, the sound and picture reproduction attainable on the format were of slightly lower quality than Quad. However, compared to Quad, 1&quot; Type C machines required much less maintenance, took up less space, and consumed much less electrical power.

In Europe, a similar tape format was developed, called 1 inch Type B videotape. Type B machines use the same 1&quot; tape as Type C but they lacked C&#x27;s shuttle and slow-motion options. The picture quality is slightly better, though. Type B was the broadcast norm in continental Europe for most of the 1980s.

=== Professional cassette formats ===

A videocassette is a case containing videotape. In 1969, Sony introduced a prototype for the first widespread video cassette, the Â¾Êº (1.905Â cm) composite U-matic system, which Sony introduced commercially in September 1971 after working out industry standards with other manufacturers. Sony later refined it to &quot;Broadcast Video U-matic&quot; (BVU). Sony continued its hold on the professional market with its ever-expanding Â½Êº (1.27Â cm) component video Betacam family introduced in 1982. This tape form factor would go on to be used for leading professional digital video formats. Panasonic had some limited success with its MII system, but never could compare to Betacam in terms of market share.

The next step was the digital revolution. Sony&#x27;s D-1 was introduced in 1986 and featured uncompressed digital component recording. Because D-1 was extremely expensive, the composite D-2 (Sony, 1988) and D-3 (Panasonic, 1991) were introduced soon after. Ampex introduced the first compressed component recording with its DCT series in 1992. Panasonic&#x27;s D-5 format was introduced in 1994. Like D-1, it is uncompressed, but much more affordable.

The DV standard, which debuted in 1995, and was widely used both in its native form as MiniDV and in more robust professional variants.

In digital camcorders, Sony adapted the Betacam system with its Digital Betacam format in 1993, and in 1996 following it up with the cheaper Betacam SX and the 2000 MPEG IMX format, The semiprofessional DV-based DVCAM system was introduced in 1996. Panasonic used its DV variant DVCPRO for all professional cameras, with the higher-end format DVCPRO50 being a direct descendant. JVC developed the competing D9/Digital-S format, which compresses video data in a way similar to DVCPRO but uses a cassette similar to S-VHS media. Many helical scan cassette formats such as VHS and Betacam use a head drum with heads that use azimuth recording, in which the heads in the head drum have a gap that is tilted at an angle, and opposing heads have their gaps tilted so as to oppose each other.

=== High definition ===
The introduction of HDTV video production necessitated a medium for storing high-definition video. In 1997, Sony supplemented its Betacam family with the HD-capable HDCAM standard and its higher-end cousin HDCAM SR in 2003. Panasonic&#x27;s competing HD format for its camcorders was based on DVCPRO and called DVCPRO HD. For VTR and archive use, Panasonic expanded the D-5 specification to store compressed HD streams and called it D-5 HD.

== Home video ==
=== Videocassette recorders ===
The first consumer videocassette recorders (VCRs) used Sony U-matic technology and were launched in 1971. Philips entered the domestic market the following year with the N1500. Sony&#x27;s Betamax (1975) and JVC&#x27;s VHS (1976) created a mass-market for VCRs and the two competing systems battled the videotape format war, which VHS ultimately won. In Europe, Philips had developed the Video 2000 format, which did not find favor with the TV rental companies in the UK and lost out to VHS.

At first VCRs and videocassettes were very expensive, but by the late 1980s the price had come down enough to make them affordable to a mainstream audience. Videocassettes finally made it possible for consumers to buy or rent a complete film and watch it at home whenever they wished, rather than going to a movie theater or having to wait until it was telecast. It gave birth to video rental stores, Blockbuster the largest chain, which lasted from 1985 to 2005. It also made it possible for a VCR owner to begin time shifting their viewing of films and other television programs. This caused an enormous change in viewing practices, as one no longer had to wait for a repeat of a program that had been missed. The shift to home viewing also changed the movie industry&#x27;s revenue streams, because home renting created an additional window of time in which a film could make money. In some cases, films that did only modestly in their theater releases went on to have strong performances in the rental market (e.g., cult films).

VHS became the leading consumer tape format for home movies after the videotape format war, though its follow-ups S-VHS, W-VHS and D-VHS never caught up in popularity. In the early 2000s in the prerecorded video market, VHS began to be displaced by DVD. The DVD format has several advantages over VHS tape. A DVD is much better able to take repeated viewings than VHS tape. Whereas a VHS tape can be erased though degaussing, DVDs and other optical discs are not affected by magnetic fields. DVDs can still be damaged by scratches. DVDs are smaller and take less space to store. DVDs can support both standard 4x3 and widescreen 16x9 screen aspect ratios and DVDs can provide twice the video resolution of VHS. DVD supports random access while a VHS tape is restricted to sequential access and must be rewound. DVDs can have interactive menus, multiple language tracks, audio commentaries, closed captioning and subtitling (with the option of turning the subtitles on or off, or selecting subtitles in several languages). Moreover, a DVD can be played on a computer.

Due to these advantages, by the mid-2000s, DVDs were the dominant form of prerecorded video movies. Through the late 1990s and early 2000s consumers continued to use VCRs to record over-the-air TV shows, because consumers could not make home recordings onto DVDs. This last barrier to DVD domination was broken in the late 2000s with the advent of inexpensive DVD recorders and digital video recorders (DVRs). In July 2016, the last known manufacturer of VCRs, Funai, announced that it was ceasing VCR production.

=== Consumer and prosumer camcorders ===

Early consumer camcorders used full-size VHS or Betamax cassettes. Later models switched to more compact formats, designed explicitly for smaller camcorder use, like VHS-C and Video8. VHS-C is a downsized version of VHS, using the same recording method and the same tape, but in a smaller cassette. It is possible to play VHS-C tapes in a regular VHS tape recorder by using an adapter. After the introduction of S-VHS, a corresponding compact version, S-VHS-C, was released as well. Video8 is an indirect descendant of Betamax, using narrower tape and a smaller cassette. Because of its narrower tape and other technical differences, it is not possible to develop an adapter from Video8 to Betamax. Video8 was later developed into Hi8, which provides better resolution similar to S-VHS.

The first consumer-level and lower-end professional () digital video recording format, introduced in 1995, used a smaller Digital Video Cassette (DVC). The format was later renamed MiniDV to reflect the DV encoding scheme, but the tapes are still marked &quot;DVC&quot;. Some later formats like DVCÂ Pro from Panasonic reflect the original name. The DVC or MiniDV format provides broadcast-quality video and sophisticated nonlinear editing capability on consumer and some professional equipment and has been used on feature films, including Danny Boyle&#x27;s 28 Days Later (2002, shot on a Canon XL1) and David Lynch&#x27;s Inland Empire (2006, shot on a Sony DSR-PD150).

In 1999 Sony backported the DV recording scheme to 8-mm systems, creating Digital8. By using the same cassettes as Hi8, many Digital8 camcorders were able to play analog Video8 or Hi8 recordings, preserving compatibility with already recorded analog video tapes.

Sony introduced another camcorder cassette format called MicroMV in 2001. Sony was the only electronics manufacturer to sell MicroMV cameras. In 2006, Sony stopped offering new MicroMV camcorder models. In November 2015, Sony announced that shipment of MicroMV cassettes would be discontinued in March 2016.

In the late 2000s, MiniDV and its high-definition cousin, HDV, were the two most popular consumer or prosumer tape-based formats. The formats use different encoding methods, but the same cassette type.

== Future of tape ==
With advances in technology, videotape has moved past its original uses (original recording, editing, and broadcast playback) and is now primarily an archival medium. The death of tape for video recording was predicted as early as 1995 when the Avid nonlinear editing system was demonstrated storing video clips on hard disks. Yet videotape was still used extensively, especially by consumers, up until about 2004, when DVD-based camcorders became affordable and domestic computers had large enough hard drives to store an acceptable amount of video.

Consumer camcorders have switched from being tape-based to tapeless machines that record video as computer files. Small hard disks and writable optical discs have been used, with solid-state memory such as SD cards being the current market leader. There are two primary advantages: First, copying a tape recording onto a computer or other video machine occurs in real time (e.g. a ten-minute video would take ten minutes to copy); since tapeless camcorders record video as computer-ready data files, the files can copied onto a computer significantly faster than real time. Second, tapeless camcorders, and those using solid-state memory in particular, are far simpler mechanically and so are more reliable.

Despite these conveniences, tape is still used extensively with filmmakers and television networks because of its longevity, low cost, and reliability. Master copies of visual content are often stored on tape for these reasons, particularly by users who cannot afford to move to tapeless machines. During the mid- to late 2000s, professional users such as broadcast television were still using tape heavily but tapeless formats like P2, XDCAM and AVCHD were gaining broader acceptance.

While live recording has migrated to solid state, optical disc (Sony&#x27;s XDCAM) and hard disks, the high cost of solid state and the limited shelf life of hard-disk drives make them less desirable for archival use, for which tape is still used.

<text>Bright Eyes is an American indie rock band founded by singer-songwriter and guitarist Conor Oberst. It consists of Oberst, multi-instrumentalist and producer Mike Mogis, arranger, composer and trumpet and piano player Nate Walcott, and a rotating line-up of collaborators drawn primarily from Omaha&#x27;s indie music scene. 

Between 1998 and 2011, the band&#x27;s albums were released through Saddle Creek Records, a Nebraska-based label founded by Justin Oberst (Conor&#x27;s brother) and Mogis. In January 2020, the band announced their return, having signed with Dead Oceans. Their most recent album, &quot;Five Dice, All Threes&quot;, was released in September 2024. 

==History==
===1995â1998: &quot;A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995â1997&quot;===
After being a founding member of Commander Venus â which disbanded in 1997 â guitarist/vocalist Conor Oberst turned to focus on his new project, Bright Eyes. In 1998, he released 20 of the songs he had been stockpiling as the first official Bright Eyes album, &quot;A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995â1997.&quot; The album saw Conor Oberst beginning to experiment with drum machines, keyboards and other instruments. The sound of the album ranges from bleating vocals to acoustic guitar songs and techno-style synthesizer instrumentals. Critical reaction was negative, with AllMusic saying that many of &quot;the songs disintegrate as his vocals are reduced to the unintelligible babbling of a child. Any balance the music maintained up to that point, however fragile, is lost and so, more than likely, is the listener.&quot;

===1998â1999: &quot;Letting Off the Happiness&quot;===
On November 2, 1998, Saddle Creek released &quot;Letting Off the Happiness&quot;, a ten-track album that displayed a more focused and clearer sound than the previous album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of Lullaby for the Working Class, Neutral Milk Hotel, and of Montreal. Park Ave. bandmate Neely Jenkins also contributed vocals. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track reel to reel; with some work also done at keyboardist Andy Lemaster&#x27;s Athens, Georgia studio. Although almost all of the tracks feature a full band, &quot;June on the West Coast&quot; is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. &quot;Padraic My Prince&quot; gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of his baby brother, a story with a multitude of symbolic meanings. Oberst has referenced the song &quot;Padraic My Prince&quot; more than once in his music. &lt;br&gt;The song &quot;An Attempt To Tip the Scales&quot; on the album &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot; has a faux-interview near the end of the track. (Oberst is voiced by Todd Fink, who was a label-mate and had played in other bands with Oberst.) The interviewer is Matt Silcock, another labelmate on Saddle Creek Records. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true. At one point the interviewer asks the question: &quot;So some of these references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?&quot; The Oberst impersonator replies: &quot;Well I did have a brother who died in a bathtub... he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned.&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that&#x27;s why they only got one song. It&#x27;s kind of like walking out a door and discovering that it&#x27;s a window.&quot; Oberst also references the song in &quot;Cartoon Blues&quot; on the &quot;Four Winds&quot; EP.

In November 1999, Bright Eyes released the five-song &quot;Every Day and Every Night&quot; EP, which included &quot;Neely O&#x27;Hara&quot; and &quot;A Perfect Sonnet.&quot;

===2000â2003: &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Lifted&quot;, and &quot;A Christmas Album&quot;===
In 2000, Bright Eyes released &quot;Fevers and Mirrors,&quot; with new instruments such as the flute, piano, and accordion introduced into the song arrangements. After &quot;An Attempt to Tip the Scales&quot;, there is a mock radio interview that features Todd Fink of The Faint doing an impression of Oberst while reading a script that Oberst wrote. In this interview, the fake Oberst presents a strange, contradictory explanation of his attitude towards his music. It acknowledges criticisms of his lyrics as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation. Oberst later commented that &quot;It was a way to make fun of ourselves because the record is such a downer. I mean, that&#x27;s one part of who I am but I also like laughing.&quot;
The album placed 170 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s best 200 albums of the decade.

With &quot;Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground&quot; in 2002, Bright Eyes became one of the year&#x27;s most celebrated &quot;new&quot; artists, despite having been recording under that moniker for a few years. They received national attention, including in several notable pieces in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Blender&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot;, many of which proclaimed Conor Oberst to be a significant new artist. The album was a commercial success and has sold over 250,000 copies, a breakthrough for the label and for all of the band&#x27;s peers at that time. Oberst stated that, before making this record, both he and Mike Mogis had an idea for a &quot;sort of grandiose sound&quot; that neither could really put into words. This was also the first album made after Oberst&#x27;s break to play with Desaparecidos. On December 1, 2002, Bright Eyes released their fifth studio album, &quot;A Christmas Album&quot;.

===2004â2006: &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot;; &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot;; and &quot;Noise Floor&quot;===

During the 2004 election season, Bright Eyes toured with Bruce Springsteen and R.E.M. on the Vote for Change tour, further pushing Bright Eyes into the public eye. Oberst sang numerous duets with the likes of Springsteen and Neil Young.

January 25, 2005 saw the release of two distinctly different Bright Eyes albums: the folk-influenced &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; and the electronic-pop inflected &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot;. An extensive world tour followed the release of those albums. Part one of the tour was in support of &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake&quot; and the second part was in support of &quot;Digital Ash&quot;. The first part was more similar to past tours with an intimate band setting. The decision to split the tour this way was practical as it would have been a &quot;logistical nightmare&quot; in terms of equipment and staff to perform songs from both albums simultaneously. By the end of January 2005, &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake&quot; was No.Â 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts while &quot;Digital Ash&quot; was No.Â 15.

In early 2005, Bright Eyes supported R.E.M. in their tour of Australia and New Zealand, as well as headlined shows themselves. On May 2, 2005 Bright Eyes appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and performed the protest song &quot;When the President Talks to God&quot; directed at President George W. Bush. A 7&quot; vinyl single of the song was sold at concerts soon after and was also released as a free track on iTunes. In November 2005, Bright Eyes performed &quot;True Blue&quot; on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Pancake Mountain.&quot;

Bright Eyes has actively protested against the Clear Channel media company. Oberst has vocally advocated the boycotting of all Clear Channel events, venues, and radio stations, perhaps most publicly at the Shortlist Awards show at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles on October 5, 2003. On November 9, 2005, Bright Eyes canceled their November 12 show in St. Louis, Missouri upon discovering that the venue was associated with Clear Channel.

Bright Eyes won Artist of the Year and Song of the Year for &quot;When the President Talks to God&quot; at the 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards and a special recognition award for the video for &quot;First Day of My Life&quot;
at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards. Additionally, &quot;Time&quot; listed &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; as one of the top ten albums of 2005. Later in the year, the live album &quot;Motion Sickness&quot; was released, documenting the &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; tour.

In a skit on the May 20, 2006 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Neil Young (played by Kevin Spacey) was joined by Dixie Chicks and &quot;indie sensation Bright Eyes&quot; (played by Andy Samberg), all of whom have been public in their criticism of George W. Bush.

After releasing three albums in 2005, Oberst stated that he did not plan to release an album in 2006.

On October 24, 2006, a compilation of rare tracks entitled &quot;Noise Floor (Rarities: 1998â2005)&quot; was released.

===2007â2008: &quot;Cassadaga&quot;===
On March 8, 2007, Oberst appeared on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Songs Considered&quot;, playing a selection of tracks in his collection, as well as several from &quot;Four Winds&quot;.

Bright Eyes released the &quot;Four Winds&quot; EP in March 2007, featuring the first single from their seventh studio album &quot;Cassadaga&quot;, released in April 2007. The track &quot;Endless Entertainment&quot; circulated over the internet from the new official site, ThisIsBrightEyes.com. In a 2007 issue, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labeled &quot;Four Winds&quot; as a top 100 song of the year.

&quot;Cassadaga&quot; reached number four in the United States, making it the band&#x27;s biggest commercial success. In support of this album, Bright Eyes toured North America from February to May, and Europe and Japan from June to July. The twelve musicians included two drummers, and they donned white uniforms in front of a video backdrop.

During an encore on May 19, 2007 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, Oberst performed a new song with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings entitled &quot;Man Named Truth&quot;. The song was officially released on Monsters of Folk&#x27;s 2009 self-titled album, on which Oberst teams up with Jim James (of My Morning Jacket), M. Ward (of She &amp; Him), and Mike Mogis (of Bright Eyes).

During a 7-night stint at The Town Hall in New York City, Bright Eyes welcomed the following guests on stage for special performances: Lou Reed on May 25; Ben Kweller on May 26; Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice on May 28; Norah Jones, Little Willie and Derrick E on May 29; Nick Zinner, Maria Taylor and Ben Gibbard on May 30, Steve Earle on May 31, and finally Ron Sexsmith and Britt Daniel on June 1.

On June 4, 2007, they performed &quot;Hot Knives&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

A double-single for &quot;Hot Knives&quot; and &quot;If the Brakeman Turns My Way&quot; was released on July 9, 2007.

In August 2007, Bright Eyes postponed 3 UK shows due to illness. A U.S. tour was announced, and in September, the UK dates were canceled and not rescheduled.

On September 29, 2007, they performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the historic Hollywood Bowl.

Bright Eyes performed at a Barack Obama rally in Omaha, Nebraska on February 7, 2008.

Zachary Nipper, the album&#x27;s art director, was awarded the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

===2008â2011: &quot;The People&#x27;s Key&quot;===
Bright Eyes went on an unofficial hiatus after the release of &quot;Cassadaga&quot; in 2007. During 2008 and 2009, Oberst recorded music and toured in support of his other music projects, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band and supergroup Monsters of Folk. In a June 2009 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Oberst announced that he wanted to &quot;retire&quot; the Bright Eyes moniker, and would be making one final album with the band: &quot;It does feel like it needs to stop at some point. I&#x27;d like to clean it up, lock the door, say goodbye.&quot; Saddle Creek Records reissued their Neva Dinova split &quot;One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels&quot; on March 23, 2010 with four brand-new songs recorded in late 2009.

On July 31, 2010, Bright Eyes teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nebraska to put on a concert for equality in Omaha, Nebraska. The concert raised money for a federal lawsuit the ACLU filed against the city of Fremont, Nebraska for an ordinance the city passed on June 21, 2010 banning the hiring of or the rental of properties to illegal immigrants. At this show, Bright Eyes debuted a new song entitled &quot;Coyote Song&quot; about two lovers separated by the MexicoâUnited States border.

&quot;The People&#x27;s Key&quot; was released on February 15, 2011, Conor Oberst&#x27;s birthday. Conor Oberst has stated that the sound of &quot;The People&#x27;s Key&quot; moves away from the folk sound that the band had accomplished on previous records. &quot;We&#x27;re over the Americana, rootsy, whatever that sound is. People say country but I never thought we were very country at all. But whatever that element is or that aesthetic is, I guess it&#x27;s worn a little thin for me these days. So we very much wanted it to be rocking and, for lack of a better term, contemporary, or modern.&quot;

The video for the song &quot;Shell Games&quot; was released via Saddle Creek Records on both the band&#x27;s YouTube channel and that of Saddle Creek, and features the band playing against various projections. On February 24, the band performed &quot;Jejune Stars&quot; on the Late Show with David Letterman. They performed &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; on The Tonight Show on April 14, 2011. On June 10, Bright Eyes released the music video for &quot;Jejune Stars&quot;. The video features the band playing in a desert with a firework rig behind them, spelling out selected lyrics as Oberst sings them. In June, July, and August 2011, the band performed shows on tour with The Mountain Goats. The band finished the year with a tour of Australia, performing at Harvest Festival as well as select headlining shows.

Bright Eyes performed a final show in Honolulu, Hawaii on November 21, 2011. Bright Eyes went on an unofficial hiatus as members Oberst, Mogis, and Walcott each pursued different projects.

===2012â2019: Hiatus and reissues===
In July 2016, it was announced that the band&#x27;s six last studio albums (excluding the Christmas release) were to be reissued in a box set titled &quot;The Studio Albums 2000â2011&quot;. &quot;Fevers and Mirrors, Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning, Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, and Cassadaga&quot; were remastered by Bob Ludwig. The box set was released on September 16, 2016. Individual releases were also issued later in the year.

===2020â2023: &quot;Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was&quot; and &quot;Companion&quot; series===
In January 2020, Bright Eyes launched an Instagram page and teased a 2020 return. On March 24 they released &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot;, their first new song in 9 years. &quot;NME&quot;â³s Luke Morgan Britton wrote of the track: &quot;[A] dual sense of societal dystopia and inner turmoil collide and intertwine on the quietly poignant &#x27;Persona Non Grata&#x27;... [It] sees the band maintain the sage-like, cryptic feel of their latter-day records. Yet it also returns to the intimacy and immediacy of their early material.&quot;

Bright Eyes released the single &quot;Forced Convalescence&quot; on April 21, 2020. The song features Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass along with a gospel choir. On May 27, 2020, the single &quot;One &amp; Done&quot; was released along with a lyric video.

The band announced their tenth album, &quot;Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was&quot;, on June 22, 2020. On the same day, they released a new single, &quot;Mariana Trench&quot;. The album was released on August 21, 2020.

Bright Eyes released the song &quot;Miracle of Life&quot; featuring Phoebe Bridgers on October 28, 2020. The song was made to benefit Planned Parenthood.

On February 1, 2022 the band announced plans to reissue their first nine studio albums under Dead Oceans. Each reissue will be accompanied by a six-track companion EP featuring re-recorded songs from the album and covers. The first three companion EPs will release on May 27, 2022. The same day &quot;Falling Out of Love at This Volume&quot;, &quot;Contrast and Compare&quot; (featuring Waxahatchee), and &quot;Haligh, Haligh, A Lie, Haligh (featuring Phoebe Bridgers)&quot; were released as singles from the &quot;A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995â1997&quot;, &quot;Letting Off the Happiness&quot;, and &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot; companion EPs, respectively. A cover of Elliott Smith&#x27;s &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot; with vocals from Bridgers was released as the second single from &quot;Letting Off the Happiness: A Companion&quot; on March 22, 2022.

===2024âpresent: &quot;Five Dice, All Threes&quot;===
On September 20, 2024, the band released its eleventh studio album, &quot;Five Dice, All Threes&quot;. The album is the second of a two-album deal that the band signed with Dead Oceans back in 2018. Regarding the album&#x27;s dice-themed framing device, Oberst stated: &quot;Life is a game of chance and a metaphorical street brawl, so that is what we are putting out there.&quot; The day before the album&#x27;s release, the band cancelled its supporting tour dates stating: &quot;Weâre heartbroken to announce that our upcoming record release shows have been cancelled. The warm-up shows we played earlier this week resulted in Conor losing his voice and, on the advice of doctors, weâve made the difficult but sensible decision to prioritise rest and recuperation for the remainder of the month.&quot;

<doc id="147954" wikidata="Q41587" url="?curid=147954" title="GoiÃ¡s">
<text>GoiÃ¡s () is a Brazilian state located in the Midwest region. GoiÃ¡s borders the Federal District and the states of (from north clockwise) Tocantins, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso. The state capital is GoiÃ¢nia. With 7.2 million inhabitants, GoiÃ¡s is the most populous state in the Midwest and the 11th most populous in the country. It has the ninth largest economy among Brazilian federative units. In Brazil&#x27;s geoeconomic division, GoiÃ¡s belongs to the Centro-Sul (Center-South), being the northernmost state of the southern portion of Brazil. The state has 3.3% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 2.7% of the Brazilian GDP.

The history of GoiÃ¡s dates back to the beginning of the 18th century, with the arrival of pioneers from SÃ£o Paulo. The Rio Vermelho region was the first to be occupied, where Vila Boa (later renamed GoiÃ¡s) was founded. The development and settlement of the state took place, in a more intensified way, starting in the 1930s with the founding of the new capital, GoiÃ¢nia, and especially with the construction of BrasÃ­lia in the 1950s.

GoiÃ¡s is characterized by a landscape of &quot;chapadÃµes&quot; (plateaus). In the height of the drought season, from June to September, the lack of rain makes the level of the Araguaia River go down and exposes almost of beaches. At the Emas National Park in the municipality of Mineiros, it is possible to observe the typical fauna and flora from the region. At the Chapada dos Veadeiros the main attractions are the canyons, valleys, rapids and waterfalls. Other attractions include the historical city of GoiÃ¡s and the hot springs of Caldas Novas.

==Geography==

GoiÃ¡s occupies a large plateau, the vast almost level surface of which stands between 750 and 900 m above sea level and forms the divide between three of Brazil&#x27;s largest river systems: to the south, GoiÃ¡s is drained by the ParanaÃ­ba river, a tributary of the ParanÃ¡ River; to the east it is drained by tributaries of the SÃ£o Francisco River; and northward the state is drained by the Araguaia River and the Tocantins River and their tributaries. Other major rivers in the state are the Meia Ponte, AporÃ©, SÃ£o Marcos, CorumbÃ¡ River, Claro, MaranhÃ£o, ParanÃ£ and Preto. None of these rivers is navigable except for short distances by small craft.

The state&#x27;s highest point is Pouso Alto, at above sea level, in the Chapada dos Veadeiros.

GoiÃ¡s is covered with a woodland savanna known in Brazil as campo cerrado, although there are still tropical forests along the rivers. The climate of the plateau is tropical. Average monthly temperatures vary from in the warmest month to in the coldest. The year is divided into a rainy season (OctoberâMarch) and a dry season (AprilâSeptember). Average annual rainfall is about , but this varies due to elevation and microclimate.
Some parts of the state, however, have small remnants of tropical Atlantic forest, that mostly appears around rivers and valleys.

The Great Midwest Region, consisting of the states of GoiÃ¡s, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and the Federal District, is among the fastest-growing regions of Brazil. The population of GoiÃ¡s state tripled in size in the period from 1950 to 1980 and is still growing very quickly. However, outside the Federal District and the GoiÃ¢nia metropolitan region (with a population of over a million) most of GoiÃ¡s is very thinly populated. The chief concentration of settlement is in the southeast, in the area of GoiÃ¢nia (GoiÃ¢nia and Aparecida de GoiÃ¢nia), across the border from Minas Gerais (CatalÃ£o, Rio Verde, JataÃ­, and Caldas Novas), and around the Federal District (Formosa, Planaltina de GoiÃ¡s, and LuziÃ¢nia).

==History==
The first European exploration of this interior part of Brazil was carried out by expeditions from SÃ£o Paulo in the 17th century. Gold was discovered in the gravel of a tributary of the Araguaia River by the bandeirante Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva (the Anhanguera) in 1682. The settlement he founded there, called Santa Anna, became the colonial town of GoiÃ¡s Velho, the former state capital. In 1744 the large inland area, much of it still unexplored by Europeans, was made a Captaincy General, and in 1822 it became a province of the empire of Brazil. It became a state in 1889. The Brazilian constitution of 1891 specified that the nation&#x27;s capital should be moved to the Brazilian Highlands (Planalto Central), and in 1956 GoiÃ¡s was selected as the site for the federal district and capital national, BrasÃ­lia. The seat of the federal government was officially moved to BrasÃ­lia in 1960.

GoiÃ¢nia, the largest city and capital was planned in 1933 to replace the old, inaccessible former state capital of GoiÃ¡s, northwest. In 1937 the state government moved there, and in 1942 the official inauguration was held. GoiÃ¢nia is now one of the fastest-growing cities in Brazil and one of the most livable cities in the country. It stands out as both an industrial center (along with the neighboring towns of AnÃ¡polis and Aparecida de GoiÃ¢nia) and as a cultural center for country culture and music, known as Sertanejo.

Due to the relatively large territory of the state, which was over , communications were obviously very difficult. The northern part of the state began to feel abandoned by the southern government and began a movement for separation. Local political leaders also encouraged the movement. In 1988 the northern half of GoiÃ¡s became a separate state called Tocantins.

It is a toned down version of the original Republican flag of Brazil, in itself not original.

<text>A filename extension, file name extension or file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file (for example, codice_1, codice_2, codice_3). The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period), but in some systems it is separated with spaces.

Some file systems implement filename extensions as a feature of the file system itself and may limit the length and format of the extension, while others treat filename extensions as part of the filename without special distinction.

== Operating system and file system support ==
The Multics file system stores the file name as a single string, not split into base name and extension components, allowing the &quot;.&quot; to be just another character allowed in file names. It allows for variable-length filenames, permitting more than one dot, and hence multiple suffixes, as well as no dot, and hence no suffix. Some components of Multics, and applications running on it, use suffixes to indicate file types, but not all files are required to have a suffix â for example, executables and ordinary text files usually have no suffixes in their names.

File systems for UNIX-like operating systems also store the file name as a single string, with &quot;.&quot; as just another character in the file name. A file with more than one suffix is sometimes said to have more than one extension, although terminology varies in this regard, and most authors define &quot;extension&quot; in a way that does not allow more than one in the same file name. More than one extension usually represents nested transformations, such as codice_4 (the codice_5 indicates that the file is a tar archive of one or more files, and the codice_6 indicates that the tar archive file is compressed with gzip). Programs transforming or creating files may add the appropriate extension to names inferred from input file names (unless explicitly given an output file name), but programs reading files usually ignore the information; it is mostly intended for the human user. 
It is more common, especially in binary files, for the file to contain internal or external metadata describing its contents.
This model generally requires the full filename to be provided in commands, whereas the metadata approach often allows the extension to be omitted.

In DOS and 16-bit Windows, file names have a maximum of 8 characters, a period, and an extension of up to three letters. The FAT file system for DOS and Windows stores file names as an 8-character name and a three-character extension. The period character is not stored.

The High Performance File System (HPFS), used in Microsoft and IBM&#x27;s OS/2 stores the file name as a single string, with the &quot;.&quot; character as just another character in the file name. The convention of using suffixes continued, even though HPFS supports extended attributes for files, allowing a file&#x27;s type to be stored in the file as an extended attribute.

Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT&#x27;s native file system, NTFS, and the later ReFS, also store the file name as a single string; again, the convention of using suffixes to simulate extensions continued, for compatibility with existing versions of Windows. In Windows NT 3.5, a variant of the FAT file system, called VFAT appeared; it supports longer file names, with the file name being treated as a single string.

Windows 95, with VFAT, introduced support for long file names, and removed the 8.3 name/extension split in file names from non-NT Windows.

The classic Mac OS disposed of filename-based extension metadata entirely; it used, instead, a distinct file type code to identify the file format. Additionally, a creator code was specified to determine which application would be launched when the file&#x27;s icon was double-clicked. macOS, however, uses filename suffixes as a consequence of being derived from the UNIX-like NeXTSTEP operating system, in addition to using type and creator codes.

In Commodore systems, files can only have four extensions: PRG, SEQ, USR, REL. However, these are used to separate data types used by a program and are irrelevant for identifying their contents.

With the advent of graphical user interfaces, the issue of file management and interface behavior arose. Microsoft Windows allowed multiple applications to be associated with a given extension, and different actions were available for selecting the required application, such as a context menu offering a choice between viewing, editing or printing the file. The assumption was still that any extension represented a single file type; there was an unambiguous mapping between extension and icon.

When the Internet age first arrived, those using Windows systems that were still restricted to 8.3 filename formats had to create web pages with names ending in codice_7, while those using Macintosh or UNIX computers could use the recommended codice_8 filename extension. This also became a problem for programmers experimenting with the Java programming language, since it &quot;requires&quot; the four-letter suffix codice_9 for source code files and the five-letter suffix codice_10 for Java compiler object code output files.

== Content type ==
Filename extensions may be considered a type of metadata. They are commonly used to imply information about the way data might be stored in the file. The exact definition, giving the criteria for deciding what part of the file name is its extension, belongs to the rules of the specific file system used; usually the extension is the substring which follows the last occurrence, if any, of the dot character (&quot;example:&quot; codice_11 is the extension of the filename codice_12, and codice_13 the extension of codice_14).
On file systems of some mainframe systems such as CMS in VM, VMS, and of PC systems such as CP/M and derivative systems such as MS-DOS, the extension is a separate namespace from the filename. Under Microsoft&#x27;s DOS and Windows, extensions such as codice_15, codice_16 or codice_17 indicate that a file is a program executable. In OS/360 and successors, the part of the dataset name following the last period, called the low level qualifier, is treated as an extension by some software, e.g., TSO EDIT, but it has no special significance to the operating system itself; the same applies to Unix files in MVS.

The filename extension was originally used to determine the file&#x27;s generic type. The need to condense a file&#x27;s type into three characters frequently led to abbreviated extensions. Examples include using codice_18 for graphics files, codice_19 for plain text, and codice_20 for music. However, because many different software programs have been made that all handle these data types (and others) in a variety of ways, filename extensions started to become closely associated with certain productsâeven specific product versions. For example, early WordStar files used codice_21 or codice_22, where &quot;n&quot; was the program&#x27;s version number. Also, conflicting uses of some filename extensions developed. One example is codice_23, used for both RPM Package Manager packages and RealPlayer Media files;. Others are codice_24, shared by DESQview fonts, Quicken financial ledgers, and QuickTime pictures; codice_25, shared by GrabIt scripts and Game Boy Advance ROM images; codice_26, used for SmallBasic and Scratch; and codice_27, being used for Dynamix Three Space and DTS.

=== Compared to MIME type ===
In many Internet protocols, such as HTTP and MIME email, the type of a bitstream is stated as the media type, or MIME type, of the stream, rather than a filename extension. This is given in a line of text preceding the stream, such as &quot;Content-type: text/plain&quot;.

There is no standard mapping between filename extensions and media types, resulting in possible mismatches in interpretation between authors, web servers, and client software when transferring files over the Internet. For instance, a content author may specify the extension &quot;svgz&quot; for a compressed Scalable Vector Graphics file, but a web server that does not recognize this extension may not send the proper content type &quot;application/svg+xml&quot; and its required compression header, leaving web browsers unable to correctly interpret and display the image.

BeOS, whose BFS file system supports extended attributes, would tag a file with its media type as an extended attribute. Some desktop environments, such as KDE Plasma and GNOME, associate a media type with a file by examining both the filename suffix and the contents of the file, in the fashion of the file command, as a heuristic. They choose the application to launch when a file is opened based on that media type, reducing the dependency on filename extensions. macOS uses both filename extensions and media types, as well as file type codes, to select a Uniform Type Identifier by which to identify the file type internally.

== Executable programs ==
The use of a filename extension in a command name appears occasionally, usually as a side effect of the command having been implemented as a script, e.g., for the Bourne shell or for Python, and the interpreter name being suffixed to the command name, a practice common on systems that rely on associations between filename extension and interpreter, but sharply deprecated in Unix-like systems, such as Linux, Oracle Solaris, BSD-based systems, and Apple&#x27;s macOS, where the interpreter is normally specified as a header in the script (&quot;shebang&quot;).

On association-based systems, the filename extension is generally mapped to a single, system-wide selection of interpreter for that extension (such as &quot;.py&quot; meaning to use Python), and the command itself is runnable from the command line even if the extension is omitted (assuming appropriate setup is done). If the implementation language is changed, the command name extension is changed as well, and the OS provides a consistent API by allowing the same extensionless version of the command to be used in both cases. This method suffers somewhat from the essentially global nature of the association mapping, as well as from developers&#x27; incomplete avoidance of extensions when calling programs, and that developers can not force that avoidance. Windows is the only remaining widespread employer of this mechanism.

On systems with interpreter directives, including virtually all versions of Unix, command name extensions have no special significance, and are by standard practice not used, since the primary method to set interpreters for scripts is to start them with a single line specifying the interpreter to use. In these environments, including the extension in a command name unnecessarily exposes an implementation detail which puts all references to the commands from other programs at future risk if the implementation changes. For example, it would be perfectly normal for a shell script to be reimplemented in Python or Ruby, and later in C or C++, all of which would change the name of the command were extensions used. Without extensions, a program always has the same extension-less name, with only the interpreter directive or magic number changing, and references to the program from other programs remain valid.

== Security issues ==
File extensions alone are not a reliable indicator of a file&#x27;s type, as the extension can be modified without changing the file&#x27;s contents, such as to disguise malicious content. Therefore, especially in the context of cybersecurity, a file&#x27;s true nature should be examined for its signature, which is a distinctive sequence of bytes affixed to a file&#x27;s header. This is accomplished using file identification software or a hex editor, which provides a hex dump of a file&#x27;s contents. For example, on UNIX-like systems, it is not uncommon to find files with no extensions at all, as commands such as codice_28 are meant to be used instead, and will read the file&#x27;s header to determine its content.

Malware such as Trojan horses typically takes the form of an executable, but any file type that performs input/output operations may contain malicious code. A few data file types such as PDFs have been found to be vulnerable to exploits that cause buffer overflows. There have been instances of malware crafted to exploit such vulnerabilities in some Windows applications when opening a file with an overly long, unhandled filename extension.

File managers may have an option to hide filenames extensions. This is the case for File Explorer, the file browser provided with Microsoft Windows, which by default does not display extensions. Malicious users have tried to spread computer viruses and computer worms by using file names formed like codice_29. The idea is that this will appear as codice_30, a harmless text file, without alerting the user to the fact that it is a harmful computer program, in this case, written in VBScript. The default behavior for ReactOS is to display filename extensions in ReactOS Explorer. Later Windows versions (starting with Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003) included customizable lists of filename extensions that should be considered &quot;dangerous&quot; in certain &quot;zones&quot; of operation, such as when downloaded from the web or received as an e-mail attachment. Modern antivirus software systems also help to defend users against such attempted attacks where possible.

A virus may couple itself with an executable without actually modifying the executable. These viruses, known as &quot;companion viruses&quot;, attach themselves in such a way that they are executed when the original file is requested. One way such a virus does this involves giving the virus the same name as the target file, but with a different extension to which the operating system gives priority, and often assigning the former a &quot;hidden&quot; attribute to conceal the malware&#x27;s existence. The efficacy of this approach depends on whether the user attempts to open the intended file by entering a command and whether the user includes the extension. Later versions of DOS and Windows check for and attempt to run codice_31 files first by default, followed by codice_32 and finally codice_33 files. In this case, the infected file is the one with the codice_31 extension, which the user unwittingly executes.

Some viruses take advantage of the similarity between the &quot;.com&quot; top-level domain and the codice_35 filename extension by emailing malicious, executable command-file attachments under names superficially similar to URLs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;myparty.yahoo.com&quot;), with the effect that unaware users click on email-embedded links that they think lead to websites but actually download and execute the malicious attachments.

<text>Robert II (2 March 1316 â 19 April 1390) was King of Scots from 1371 to his death in 1390. The son of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and Marjorie, daughter of King Robert the Bruce, he was named Robert Stewart. Upon the death of his uncle David II, Robert succeeded to the throne as the first monarch of the House of Stewart.

Edward Bruce had been the heir presumptive for his older brother Robert the Bruce, but Edward had no children when he was killed in the Battle of Faughart on 14 October 1318. Marjorie Bruce had died probably in 1317 in a riding accident and Parliament decreed her infant son, Robert Stewart, as heir presumptive, but this lapsed on 5 March 1324 on the birth of a son, David, to King Robert and his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh. Robert Stewart became High Steward of Scotland on his father&#x27;s death on 9 April 1327, and in the same year Parliament confirmed the young Steward as heir should David die childless. In 1329 King Robert I died and his five-year-old son succeeded to the throne as David II under the guardianship of Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray.

Edward Balliol, son of King John Balliol â assisted by the English and those Scottish nobles who Robert I had disinherited â invaded Scotland inflicting heavy defeats on the Bruce party on 11 August 1332 at Dupplin Moor. In the early morning hours of 16 December 1332, then sixteen-year-old Robert fought with Sir Archibald Douglas at the Battle of Annan driving Edward Balliol out of Scotland. Balliol returned to Scotland with Edward and an English army the following year defeating Archibald Douglas at the Battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. Robert, who had fought at Halidon, joined his uncle David in refuge in Dumbarton Castle. David escaped to France in 1334 and Parliament, still functioning, appointed Robert and John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray, as joint guardians of the kingdom. The English captured Randolph in July 1335 and in the same year, Robert submitted to Balliol bringing about the removal of his guardianship. His former position was reinstated in 1338 until David returned from France in June 1341. Hostilities continued and Robert was with David at the Neville&#x27;s Cross on 17 October 1346 and either escaped or fled the field. David, however, was captured and remained a prisoner until he was ransomed in October 1357.

Robert married Elizabeth Mure around 1348, legitimising their four sons and five daughters. His subsequent marriage to Euphemia de Ross in 1355 produced two sons and two surviving daughters. Robert rebelled against King David in 1363 but submitted to him following a threat to his right of succession. David died in 1371 and Robert succeeded him at the age of fifty-five. The border magnates continued to attack English-held zones in southern Scotland and by 1384, the Scots had re-taken most of the occupied lands. Robert ensured that Scotland was included in the Anglo-French truce of 1384 and that was a factor in the coup in November when he lost control of the country first to his eldest son, John, and then from 1388 to John&#x27;s younger brother, Robert. Robert II died in Dundonald Castle in 1390 and was buried at Scone Abbey.

== Heir presumptive ==
Robert Stewart, born in 1316, was the only child of King Robert I&#x27;s daughter Marjorie Bruce, who died either in childbirth or shortly afterwards, and Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland. Robert had the upbringing of a Gaelic noble on the Stewart lands in Bute, Clydeside, and in Renfrew. In 1315, parliament revoked Marjorie Bruce&#x27;s right as heir to her father in favour of her uncle, Edward Bruce. Edward was killed at the Battle of Faughart, near Dundalk on 14 October 1318, resulting in a hastily arranged Parliament in December to enact a new tailzie naming Marjorie&#x27;s son, Robert, as heir should the king die without a successor. The birth of a son, afterwards David II, to King Robert on 5 March 1324 cancelled Robert Stewart&#x27;s position as heir presumptive, but a Parliament at Cambuskenneth in July 1326 restored him in the line of succession should David die without an heir. This reinstatement of his status was accompanied by the gift of lands in Argyll, Roxburghshire, and the Lothians.

== High Steward of Scotland ==
=== Renewed war for independence ===

The first war of independence began in the reign of King John Balliol. His short reign was bedevilled by Edward I&#x27;s insistence on his overlordship of Scotland. The Scottish leadership concluded that only war could release the country from the English king&#x27;s continued weakening of Balliol&#x27;s sovereignty and so finalised a treaty of reciprocal assistance with France in October 1295. The Scots forayed into England in March 1296 â this incursion together with the French treaty angered the English king and provoked an invasion of Scotland taking Berwick on 30 March before defeating the Scots army at Dunbar on 27 April. John Balliol submitted to Edward and resigned the throne to him before being sent to London as a prisoner. Despite this, resistance to the English led by William Wallace and Andrew Moray had emerged in the name of King John Balliol. On their deaths, Robert the Bruce continued to resist the English and eventually succeeded in defeating the forces of Edward II of England and gained the Scottish throne for himself.

David Bruce, aged five, became king on 7 June 1329 after the death of his father Robert. Walter the Steward had died earlier on 9 April 1327, and the orphaned eleven-year-old Robert was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Sir James Stewart of Durrisdeer, who along with Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, and William Lindsey, Archdeacon of St Andrews were appointed as joint guardians of the kingdom. David&#x27;s accession kindled the second independence war which threatened Robert&#x27;s position as heir. In 1332 Edward Balliol, son of the deposed John Balliol, spearheaded an attack on the Bruce sovereignty with the tacit support of King Edward III of England and the explicit endorsement of &quot;the disinherited&quot;. Edward Balliol&#x27;s forces delivered heavy defeats on the Bruce supporters at Dupplin Moor on 11 August 1332 and again at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333, at which the 17-year-old Robert participated. Robert&#x27;s estates were overrun by Balliol, who granted them to David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl, but Robert evaded capture and gained protection at Dumbarton Castle where King David was also taking refuge. Very few other strongholds remained in Scottish hands in the winter of 1333 â only the castles of Kildrummy (held by Christina Bruce, elder sister of Robert I and wife of Andrew Murray of Bothwell), Loch Leven, Loch Doon, and Urquhart held out against Balliol forces.

In May 1334, the situation looked dire for the house of Bruce and David II gained safety in France. Robert set about winning back his lands in the west of Scotland. Strathbogie came over to the Bruce interest after disagreements with his fellow &quot;disinherited&quot; but his fierce opposition to Randolph came to a head at a Parliament held at Dairsie Castle in early 1335 when Strathbogie received the support of Robert. Strathbogie once again changed sides submitting to the English king in August and was made Warden of Scotland. Robert likely submitted to Edward in September 1335 relinquishing the guardianship by early December.

The Bruce resistance to Balliol may have been verging on collapse in 1335 but a turn-round in its fortunes began with the appearance of Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell as a potent war leader at the Battle of Culblean. Moray had been captured in 1332, ransomed himself in 1334, and immediately sped north to lay siege to Dundarg Castle in Buchan held by Sir Henry de Beaumont, with the castle falling on 23 December 1334. Moray was appointed guardian at Dunfermline during the winter of 1335â1336 while besieging Cupar Castle in Fife. He died at his castle in Avoch in 1338 and Robert resumed the guardianship. Murray&#x27;s campaign put an end to any chance of Edward III having full lasting control over the south of Scotland and Edward&#x27;s failure in the six-month siege of Dunbar Castle confirmed this. Balliol lost many of his major supporters to the Bruce side and the main English garrisons began to fall to the Scots â Cupar in the spring or summer of 1339, Perth taken by the combined armies of Sir William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale, Robert Stewart and Maurice Murray of Drumsargard in June 1339. Edinburgh was taken by stratagem by William Douglas of Liddesdale in April 1341.

John Randolph was released from English custody in a prisoner exchange in 1341 and visited David II in Normandy before returning to Scotland. Just as Randolph was a favourite of the king, David II mistrusted Robert Stewart with his powerful positions of heir presumptive and guardian of Scotland. At the beginning of June 1341, the kingdom appeared sufficiently stable to allow the king to return to a land where his nobles while fighting for the Bruce cause, had considerably increased their own power bases. On 17 October 1346, Robert accompanied David into battle at Neville&#x27;s Cross, where many Scottish nobles including Randolph, died â David II was wounded and captured while Robert and Patrick, earl of March had apparently fled the field.

=== King David&#x27;s captivity ===
With the king now imprisoned in England and Randolph dead, the guardianship once again fell to Robert. In 1347 he took the important step of ensuring the legitimation of his four sons, John, Earl of Carrick (the future King Robert III), Walter, Lord of Fife (d. 1362), Robert (the future Duke of Albany) and Alexander, Lord of Badenoch (and future Earl of Buchan), and six daughters by petitioning Pope Clement VI to allow a canon law marriage to Elizabeth Mure.

Even though an English prisoner, David retained influence in Scotland and Robert had his guardianship removed by parliament and given jointly to the earls of Mar and Ross and the lord of Douglas â this did not last and Robert was once again appointed guardian by the Parliament of February 1352. The paroled David attended this Parliament to present to Robert and the members of the Three Estates the conditions for his release. These contained no ransom demand but required the Scots to name the English prince John of Gaunt as heir presumptive. The Council rejected these terms, with Robert opposing a proposal that threatened his right of succession. The king had no option but to return to captivity â the English chronicler Henry Knighton wrote of the event:

... the Scots refused to have their King unless he entirely renounced the influence of the English, and similarly refused to submit themselves to them. And they warned him that they would neither ransom him nor allow him to be ransomed unless he pardoned them for all their acts and injuries that they had done, and all the offences that they had committed during the time of captivity, and he should give them security for that, or otherwise, they threatened to choose another king to rule them.

By 1354 ongoing negotiations for the king&#x27;s release reached the stage where a proposal of a straight ransom payment of 90,000 marks to be repaid over nine years, guaranteed by the provision of 20 high-ranking hostages, was agreed upon â this understanding was destroyed by Robert when he bound the Scots to a French action against the English in 1355. The capture of Berwick together with the presence of the French on English soil jolted Edward III into moving against the Scots â in January 1356 Edward led his forces into the south-east of Scotland and burned Edinburgh and Haddington and much of the Lothians in a campaign that became known as the &quot;Burnt Candlemas&quot;. After Edward&#x27;s victory over France in September, the Scots resumed negotiations for David&#x27;s release ending in October 1357 with the Treaty of Berwick. Its terms were that in turn for David&#x27;s freedom, a ransom of 100,000 marks would be paid in annual instalments over ten years â only the first two payments were completed initially and nothing further until 1366. This failure to honour the conditions of the Berwick treaty allowed Edward to continue to press for a Plantagenet successor to David â terms that were rejected by the Scottish Council and probably by Robert himself. This may have been the cause of a brief rebellion in 1363 by Robert and the earls of Douglas and March. Later French inducements could not bring David to their aid and the country remained at peace with England during his reign.

=== Consolidation of Stewart power and personal rule ===
David died childless on 22 February 1371 and was succeeded by Robert II. David was buried at Holyrood Abbey almost immediately but an armed protest by William, Earl of Douglas delayed Robert II&#x27;s coronation until 26 March 1371. The reasons for the incident remain unclear but may have involved a dispute regarding Robert&#x27;s right of succession, or may have been directed against George Dunbar, Earl of March (also known as Earl of Dunbar) and the southern justiciar, Robert Erskine. It was resolved by Robert giving his daughter Isabella in marriage to Douglas&#x27;s son, James and with Douglas replacing Erskine as justiciar south of the Forth. Robert&#x27;s accession did affect some others who held offices from David II. In particular, George Dunbar&#x27;s brother John Dunbar, the Lord of Fife who lost his claim on Fife and Sir Robert Erskine&#x27;s son, Sir Thomas Erskine who lost control of Edinburgh Castle.

The Stewarts greatly increased their holdings in the west, in Atholl, and in the far north: the earldoms of Fife and Menteith went to Robert&#x27;s second surviving son, Robert; the earldoms of Buchan and Ross (along with the lordship of Badenoch) to his fourth son, Alexander; and the earldoms of Strathearn and Caithness to the eldest son of his second marriage, David. King Robert&#x27;s sons-in-law were John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and James who would become the 2nd Earl of Douglas. Robert&#x27;s sons John, Earl of Carrick, the king&#x27;s heir, and Robert, Earl of Fife, were made keepers of the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling respectively, while Alexander, Lord of Badenoch and Ross, and afterwards Earl of Buchan, became the king&#x27;s justiciar and lieutenant in the north of the kingdom. This build-up of the Stewart family power did not appear to cause resentment among the senior magnates â the king generally did not threaten their territories or local rule and where titles were transferred to his sons the individuals affected were usually very well rewarded. This style of kingship was very different from his predecessor&#x27;s â David tried to dominate his nobles whereas Robert&#x27;s strategy was to delegate authority to his powerful sons and earls and this generally worked for the first decade of his reign. Robert was to have influence over eight of the fifteen earldoms either through his sons directly or by strategic marriages of his daughters to powerful lords.

In 1373, Robert ensured the future security of the Stewart dynasty by having Parliament pass entailments regarding the succession. At this time, none of his sons had heirs so it became necessary for a system to be devised to define precisely the circumstances in which each of his sons could inherit the crownânone of this would take precedence over normal succession by primogeniture. By 1375, the king had commissioned John Barbour to write the poem, &quot;The Brus&quot;, a history intended to bolster the public image of the Stewarts as the genuine heirs of Robert I. It described the patriotic acts of both Sir James, the Black Douglas and Walter the Steward, the king&#x27;s father, in their support of Bruce. Robert&#x27;s rule during the 1370s saw the country&#x27;s finances stabilised and greatly improved due in part to the flourishing wool trade, reduced calls on the public purse and the halting of his predecessor&#x27;s ransom money on the death of Edward III of England. Robert â unlike David II whose kingship was predominantly Lothian and therefore lowland based â did not restrict his attention to one sector of his kingdom but frequently visited the more remote areas of the north and west among his Gaelic lords.

Robert ruled over a country that continued to have English enclaves within its borders and Scots who gave their allegiance to the king of England â the important castles of Berwick, Jedburgh, Lochmaben and Roxburgh had English garrisons and controlled southern Berwickshire, Teviotdale and large areas in Annandale and Tweeddale. In June 1371, Robert agreed to a defensive treaty with the French, and although there were no outright hostilities during 1372, the English garrisons were reinforced and placed under an increased state of vigilance. Attacks on the English-held zones, with the near-certain backing of Robert, began in 1373 and accelerated in the years 1375â77. This indicated that a central decision had probably been taken for the escalation of conflict rather than the previous small-scale marauding attacks by the border barons. In 1376, the Earl of March successfully recovered Annandale, but then found himself constrained by the Bruges Anglo-French truce.

In his dealings with Edward III, Robert blamed his border magnates for the escalating attacks on the English zones; regardless, the Scots retained the recaptured lands, often portioned out among minor lords, to secure their interest in preventing English re-possession. Despite Robert&#x27;s further condemnations of his border lords, all the signs were that Robert backed the growing successful Scottish militancy following Edward III&#x27;s death in 1377. In a charter dated 25 July 1378 the king decreed that Coldingham Priory would no longer be a daughter house of the English Durham Priory but was to be attached to Dunfermline Abbey. In early February the Scots â apparently unaware of the conclusion of an Anglo-French truce on 26 January 1384 that included the Scots in the cease-fire â conducted an all-out attack on the English zones winning back Lochmaben Castle and Teviotdale. John of Gaunt led a reciprocal English attack that took him as far as Edinburgh, where the burgesses bribed him to leave the town unharmed. Haddington, however, was destroyed. Carrick and James, Earl of Douglas (his father William had died in April), wanted a retaliatory strike for the Gaunt raid. Robert may have concluded that as the French had reneged on a previous agreement to send assistance in 1383 and then entered into a truce with England, any military action would have been met with retaliation and exclusion from the forthcoming Boulogne peace talks. On 2 June 1384, Robert resolved to send Walter Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow to the Anglo-French peace talks, yet Carrick ignored this and allowed raids into the north of England to take place. Despite this, by 26 July, the Scots were part of the truce that would expire in October. Robert called a Council in September probably to decide how to proceed when the truce concluded.

=== Loss of authority and death ===
Robert&#x27;s son, John, Earl of Carrick, had become the foremost Stewart magnate south of the Forth just as Alexander, Earl of Buchan was in the north. Alexander&#x27;s activities and methods of royal administration, enforced by Gaelic mercenaries, drew criticism from northern earls and bishops and his younger half-brother David, Earl of Strathearn. These complaints damaged the king&#x27;s standing within the Council leading to criticism of his ability to curb Buchan&#x27;s activities. Robert&#x27;s differences with the Carrick affinity regarding the conduct of the war and his continued failure or unwillingness to deal with Buchan in the north led to the political convulsion of November 1384 when the Council removed the king&#x27;s authority to govern and appointed Carrick as lieutenant of the kingdom â a &quot;coup d&#x27;Ã©tat&quot; had taken place. With Robert sidelined, there was now no impediment in the way of war. In June 1385, a force of 1200 French soldiers joined the Scots in a campaign that involved the Earl of Douglas and two of Robert&#x27;s sons, John, Earl of Carrick and Robert, Earl of Fife. The skirmishes saw small gains but a quarrel between the French and Scottish commanders saw the abandonment of an attack on the important castle of Roxburgh.

The victory of the Scots over the English at the Battle of Otterburn in Northumberland in August 1388 set in motion Carrick&#x27;s fall from power. One of the Scottish casualties was Carrick&#x27;s close ally James, Earl of Douglas. Douglas died without an heir, which led to various claims upon the title and estate â Carrick backed Malcolm Drummond, the husband of Douglas&#x27;s sister, while Fife sided with the successful appellant, Sir Archibald Douglas, Earl of Wigtown and Lord of Galloway who possessed an entail on the Douglas estates. Fife, now with his powerful Douglas ally, and those who supported the king ensured a countercoup at the December Council meeting when the guardianship of Scotland passed from Carrick (who had recently been badly injured from a horse-kick) to Fife. Many had also approved of Fife&#x27;s intention to properly resolve the situation of lawlessness in the north and in particular the activities of his younger brother, Buchan. Fife relieved Buchan of his offices of lieutenant of the north and justiciar north of the Forth. The latter role was given to Fife&#x27;s son, Murdoch Stewart. Robert II toured the northeast in late January 1390, perhaps to reinforce the changing political scene in the north following Buchan&#x27;s removal from authority. In March, Robert returned to Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire where he died on 19 April and was buried at Scone on 25 April.

== Historiography ==
The reign of Robert II has undergone a re-appraisal since the works of historians Gordon Donaldson (1967) and Ranald Nicholson (1974). Donaldson admitted to a lack of knowledge (at the time he was writing) regarding Robert&#x27;s reign and accepts that the early chroniclers writing near his reign found little to criticise. Robert&#x27;s career before and after he succeeded to the throne is described by Donaldson as &quot;to say the least, undistinguished, and his reign did nothing to add lustre to it.&quot; Donaldson goes further and debates the legality of the canon law marriage of Robert and Elizabeth Mure following the papal dispensation, but acknowledges that the Acts of Succession in 1371 and 1372, although sealing the matter in the eyes of Parliament, did not end the generational feud of the descendants of Elizabeth Mure and Euphemia Ross. Robert&#x27;s earlier participation in combat at the battles of Halidon and Neville&#x27;s Cross, according to Donaldson, had made him wary of sanctioning military expeditions against the English and that any such actions by his barons were concealed from him. Similarly, Nicholson described Robert&#x27;s reign as deficient and that his lack of the skills of governance led to internal strife. Nicholson asserts that the Earl of Douglas was bought off following his armed demonstration just before Robert&#x27;s coronation, and associates this with the doubt surrounding the legitimacy of Robert&#x27;s sons with Elizabeth Mure.

In contrast, the historians Stephen Boardman (2007), Alexander Grant (1984 and 1992) and Michael Lynch (1992) give a more even-handed appraisal of Robert II&#x27;s life. Modern historians show a kingdom that had become wealthier and more stable, particularly during the first decade of his rule. Boardman explains that Robert II was subjected to negative propaganda while he was High Steward â David II&#x27;s followers denigrated his conduct during his lieutenancies and described them as &quot;tyranny&quot; â and again later as King when the supporters of his son John, Earl of Carrick said that Robert was a king lacking drive and accomplishments, weighed down by age and unfit to govern. Robert II&#x27;s association with Gaelic Scotland also drew criticism. He grew up in his ancestral lands in the west and was completely at ease with the Gaelic language and culture and possessed a potent relationship with the Gaelic lords in the Hebrides, upper Perthshire and Argyll. Throughout his reign, Robert spent long periods in his Gaelic heartlands and complaints at the time in Lowland Scotland seem to have been influenced by the view that the king was too much involved in Gaelic concerns. Boardman also asserts that much of the negative views held of Robert II find their origins in the writings of the French chronicler Jean Froissart who recorded that &#x27;[the king] had red bleared eyes, of the colour of sandalwood, which clearly showed that he was no valiant man, but one who would remain at home than march to the field&#x27;. Contrary to Froissart&#x27;s view, the early Scottish chroniclers â Andrew of Wyntoun and Walter Bower (who both utilised a source that was nearly contemporary with Robert II) â and later 15th and 16th century Scottish chroniclers and poets showed &quot;Robert II as a Scottish patriotic hero, a defender of the integrity of the Scottish kingdom, and as the direct heir to Robert I&quot;.

Grant (1992) acknowledges that Robert II&#x27;s reign in terms of foreign and domestic policy was &quot;not so unsuccessful&quot;. As far as William, Earl of Douglas&#x27;s reaction was concerned when he staged an armed demonstration before Robert&#x27;s coronation, Grant does not hold to the view that Douglas was in some way demonstrating against Robert&#x27;s legitimate right to the throne, but more an assertion that royal patronage should not continue as in the time of David II. Grant also advocates that the demonstration was aimed at father and son Robert and Thomas Erskine, who held the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling and Dumbarton from Robert&#x27;s predecessor. Grant seriously called into question the dependability of Froissart&#x27;s writings as an effective source for Robert II&#x27;s reign. Influential magnate coalitions headed by Carrick, having undermined the king&#x27;s position, manipulated the Council of November 1384 to remove Robert II from any real power. Grant gives little weight to the asserted senility of Robert and suggests that the deposition of Carrick in 1388, and then the resolution to join the Anglo-French truce of 1389, were both at the instigation of Robert II. Yet authority was not handed back to Robert II but to Carrick&#x27;s younger brother, Robert, earl of Fife; this once again saw the king at the disposition of one of his sons. Despite this, the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on made the point that Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the guardianships of his two sons.

Michael Lynch points out that Robert II&#x27;s reign from 1371 until the lieutenancy of Carrick in 1384 had been one exemplified by continued prosperity and stability â a time which Abbot Bower described as a period of &quot;tranquillity, prosperity and peace&quot;. Lynch suggests that the troubles of the 1450s between James II and the Douglases (which some historians have interpreted as the legacy of Robert II&#x27;s policy of encouraging powerful lordships), was a continuation of David II&#x27;s build-up of local lords in the Marches and Galloway â Robert was satisfied with government to leave alone the Douglas and the Stewart earls in their fiefdoms. The weakening of government if anything, Lynch suggests, came not before the 1384 coup but after it, even though the coup had at its root Robert II&#x27;s favouring of his third son, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan (known as &quot;the Wolf of Badenoch&quot;).

== Marriages and issue ==
In 1336, he first married Elizabeth Mure (died 1355), daughter of Sir Adam Mure of Rowallan. The marriage was criticised for being uncanonical, so he remarried her in 1349 after receiving a papal dispensation in 1347.

From this union, ten children reached adulthood:
* John (died 1406), who became King of Scotland as Robert III, married Anabella Drummond;
* Walter (died in 1362), husband of Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Fife;
* Robert, Earl of Fife and from 1398 Duke of Albany (died 1420), married in 1361 Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith, and his second wife in 1381 Muriella Keith (died in 1449);
* Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan (died 1405), nicknamed &quot;the Wolf of Badenoch&quot;, married in 1382 to Euphemia of Ross;
* Margaret, married John of Islay, Lord of the Isles;
* Marjorie, married John Dunbar, Earl of Moray, then Sir Alexander Keith;
* Elizabeth, married Thomas de la Hay, Lord High Constable of Scotland;
* Isabel (died 1410), married James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas (died in 1388), followed in 1389 by John Edmonstone of that Ilk;
* Johanna (Jean), married Sir John Keith (died 1375), then John Lyon, Lord of Glamis (died 1383) and finally, Sir James Sandilands;
* Katherine, married Sir Robert Logan of Grugar and Restalrig, Lord High Admiral of Scotland.

In 1355, Robert married his second wife Euphemia de Ross (died 1387), daughter of Hugh, Earl of Ross. They had four children:
* David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn, born about 1356 and died in 1389;
* Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, born about 1360, was beheaded at Edinburgh in 1437 for being involved in the assassination of King James I;
* Elizabeth, who married in 1380 David Lindsay, 1st Earl of Crawford;
* Egidia, who married in 1387 William Douglas of Nithsdale.

King Robert II also had many illegitimate children: 

By Mariota de Cardeny, daughter of Sir John Cardeny, and widow of Alexander Mac Naugthon:
* Alexander Stewart, of Inverlunan;
* Sir John Stewart, of Cardeny;
* James Stewart, of Abernethy and Kinfauna;
* Walter Stewart.

By Moira Leitch (according to tradition):
* Sir John Stewart, Sheriff of Bute (1360 â 1445/9), ancestor of the Marquesses of Bute

Other issue born by unknown women:
* John Stewart, Lord of Burley (killed 1425);
* Alexander Stewart, canon of Glasgow;
* Sir Alexander Stewart of Inverlunan;
* Thomas Stewart, Archdeacon of St Andrews, Dean of Dunkeld;
* James Stewart of Kinfauns;
* Walter Stewart;
* Maria or Mary Stewart, wife of Sir John de Danielstoun and mother of Sir Robert de Danielstoun of that Ilk (ancestor of Cunningham of Kilmaurs, and Maxwell of Calderwood).

== Ancestry ==
== Fictional portrayals ==
Robert II has been depicted in historical novels. They include:
* &quot;The Three Perils of Man; or, War, women, and witchcraft&quot; (1822) by James Hogg. The tale takes place in the reign of Robert II whose &quot;country enjoyed happiness and peace, all save a part adjoining to the borders of England.&quot; Part of the action takes place at Linlithgow Palace, where Robert promises to marry his daughter Margaret Stewart &quot;to the knight who shall take that castle of Roxburgh out of the hands of the English&quot;. With Margaret adding her own terms, that &quot;in case of his attempting and failing in the undertaking, he shall forfeit all his lands, castles, towns, and towers to me.&quot; In the absence of volunteers, Margaret vows to take the Castle herself, defeating Lord Musgrave and his mistress Jane Howard;

* &quot;The Lords of Misrule&quot; (1976) by Nigel Tranter. It covers events from c. 1388 to 1390 and depicts the last years of Robert II and the rise of Robert III of Scotland to the throne. As the elderly king has grown &quot;feeble, weary and half-blind&quot;, his sons, daughters and other nobles campaign for power. An ungoverned Scotland is ravaged by their conflicts. Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, and Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, are prominently featured;

* &quot;Courting Favour&quot; (2000) by Nigel Tranter. Follows the career of John Dunbar, Earl of Moray in the courts of David II of Scotland and Robert II. John is a son-in-law to the latter and serves him as a diplomat.

<text>Robert III ( â 4 April 1406), born John Stewart, was King of Scots from 1390 to his death in 1406. He was also High Steward of Scotland from 1371 to 1390 and held the titles of Earl of Atholl (1367â1390) and Earl of Carrick (1368â1390) before ascending the throne at about the age of 53 years. He was the eldest son of King Robert II and Elizabeth Mure and was legitimized by the second marriage of his parents and by papal dispensation in 1349.

John joined his father and other magnates in a rebellion against his great-uncle David II early in 1363 but submitted to him soon afterwards. He was married to Anabella Drummond by 1367. In 1368 David created him Earl of Carrick. His father became king in 1371 after the unexpected death of the childless King David II. In the succeeding years, Carrick was influential in the governance of the kingdom but became progressively more impatient at his father&#x27;s longevity. In 1384 Carrick was appointed the king&#x27;s lieutenant after swaying the general council to remove Robert II from direct rule. Carrick&#x27;s administration saw a renewal of the conflict with England. In 1388 the Scots defeated the English at the Battle of Otterburn where the Scots&#x27; commander, James, Earl of Douglas, was killed. By this time Carrick had been badly injured from a horse kick, however, it was the loss of his powerful ally, Douglas, that saw a turnaround in magnate support in favour of his younger brother Robert, Earl of Fife, to whom the council transferred the lieutenancy in December 1388.

In 1390, Robert II died and Carrick ascended the throne as Robert III but without authority to rule directly. Fife continued as Lieutenant until February 1393 when power was returned to the king jointly with his son David. At a council in 1399 owing to the king&#x27;s &quot;sickness of his person&quot;, David, now Duke of Rothesay, became Lieutenant under the supervision of a special parliamentary group dominated by Fife, now styled Duke of Albany. After this, Robert III withdrew to his lands in the west and for a time played little or no part in affairs of state. He was powerless to interfere when a dispute between Albany and Rothesay arose in 1401, leading to Rothesay&#x27;s imprisonment and death in March 1402. The general council absolved Albany from blame and reappointed him as Lieutenant. The only impediment now remaining to an Albany Stewart monarchy was the king&#x27;s only surviving son, James, Earl of Carrick. After a clash with Albany&#x27;s Douglas allies in 1406, the 11-year-old James tried to escape to France. The vessel was intercepted and James became the prisoner of Henry IV of England. Robert III died shortly after learning of his heir&#x27;s imprisonment.

== Early life ==
John Stewart was born around the year 1337 to Robert, Steward of Scotland and heir presumptive to the throne, and his wife Elizabeth Mure. Robert&#x27;s mother Marjorie and her half-brother, David II, were the children of the first Bruce king, Robert I. 
Robert Stewart and Elizabeth Mure were married in 1336 by traditional marriage, recognized as legally binding but not recognized by the Church. The marriage was criticized for being uncanonical, so they married a second time in 1349, after receiving a papal dispensation from Pope Clement VI dated 22 November 1347. Therefore, although their children were legitimate, having been born after the first marriage of their parents, John, his three brothers and six sisters were legitimised by their parents&#x27; second Church-sanctioned marriage. Styled Lord of Kyle, John is first recorded in the 1350s as the commander of a campaign in the Lordship of Annandale to re-establish Scottish control over English occupied territory. In 1363, he joined his father along with the earls of Douglas and March in a failed insurrection against Robert&#x27;s uncle, David II. The reasons for the rebellion were varied. In 1362, David II supported several of his royal favourites in their titles to lands in the Stewart earldom of Monteith and thwarted Stewart claims to the earldom of Fife. The King&#x27;s involvement and eventual marriage with Margaret Drummond may also have represented a threat in the Steward&#x27;s own earldom of Strathearn where the Drummonds also had interests, while Douglas and March mistrusted David&#x27;s intentions towards them. These nobles were also unhappy at the king&#x27;s squandering of funds provided to him for his ransom, and with the prospect that they could be sent to England as guarantors for the ransom payments. The friction between the King and the Stewarts looked to have been settled before the end of spring 1367.

On 31 May 1367, the Steward resigned the earldom of Atholl to John, who by this time was already married to Annabella Drummond, the daughter of the queen&#x27;s deceased brother, Sir John Drummond. David II reinforced the position of John and Annabella by providing them with the Earldom of Carrick on 22 June 1368 and the tacit approval of John as the king&#x27;s probable heir. A Stewart succession was suddenly endangered when David II had his marriage to Margaret annulled in March 1369 leaving the king free to remarry and with the prospect of a Bruce heir.

On 22 February 1371, David II (who was preparing to marry the Earl of March&#x27;s sister, Agnes Dunbar) unexpectedly died, presumably to the relief of both John and his father. Robert was crowned at Scone Abbey on 27 March 1371 and before this date had given John â now styled Steward of Scotland â the ancestral lands surrounding the Firth of Clyde. How the succession was to take place was first entailed by Robert I when female heirs were excluded; David II attempted unsuccessfully on several occasions to have the council change the succession procedure. Robert II quickly moved to ensure the succession of John when the general council attending his coronation officially named Carrick as heir â in 1373 the Stewart succession was further strengthened when parliament passed entails defining how each of the king&#x27;s sons could inherit the crown. After the coronation John Dunbar who had received the Lordship of Fife from David II now resigned the title so that the king&#x27;s second son, Robert, Earl of Monteith could receive the Earldom of Fife â Dunbar was compensated with the provision of the earldom of Moray.

A son, David, the future Duke of Rothesay, was born to Carrick and Annabella on 24 October 1378. In 1381, Carrick was calling himself &quot;lieutenant for the marches&quot; sustained by his connections to border magnates such as his brother-in-law, James Douglas, son of William, Earl of Douglas, whom he succeeded in 1384.

== Guardianship â and its collapse ==
Robert II&#x27;s policy of building up Stewart domination in Scotland through the advancement of his sons saw the emergence of Carrick as the pre-eminent Stewart magnate south of the Forth-Clyde line, just as his younger brother Alexander, Earl of Buchan, Lord of Badenoch and Ross had become in the north. 
Before 1384 persistent objections regarding Robert II&#x27;s application of the law were brought to the council&#x27;s attention. Some of these grievances maintained that the King had acted unlawfully by deliberately disregarding charges regarding his personal conduct. Buchan&#x27;s use of cateran supporters drew criticism from Northern nobles and prelates and demonstrated Robert II&#x27;s inability or reluctance to control his son. The king&#x27;s failure to take a leading role in prosecuting the war with England and Buchan&#x27;s abuse of royal power in the north was the backdrop to the general council meeting at Holyrood Abbey in November 1384, where the decision was taken to sideline the king and provide the ruling powers to Carrick as Guardian of Scotland.

Within weeks Carrick&#x27;s actions signalled changes in the direction of crown strategy where the CarrickâDouglas affinity was, by far, the largest group to benefit from crown patronage. On 13 March 1385 it emerged that an unauthorised payment of Â£700 in bullion, a huge amount, had been taken by the guardian from the customs of Edinburgh. It transpired that Fife, also Chamberlain of Scotland, had been struggling to check Carrick&#x27;s misuse of the Crown finances during 1384â1385.

In April 1385, the general council sharply condemned Buchan&#x27;s behaviour and sat intending to manoeuvre Carrick into firmly intervening in the north. In July, under Carrick&#x27;s guardianship, a Scottish army that included a French force commanded by Admiral Jean de Vienne penetrated the north of England without any serious gains but provoked a damaging retaliatory attack by Richard II. Yet in the north, Carrick did not bring Buchan under control and many of the Guardian&#x27;s supporters although pleased at the resumption of hostilities with England were unhappy at the continued northern lawlessness. Carrick had been made Guardian partly on the need to curb Buchan&#x27;s excesses yet despite this by February 1387 Buchan had become even more powerful and influential when he was appointed Justiciar north of the Forth.

The war with England was halted by a series of truces however, on 19 April 1388, English envoys sent to Scotland to again extend the ceasefire returned to Richard&#x27;s court empty-handed â by 29 April Robert II was conducting a council in Edinburgh to authorise renewed conflict with England. Although the Scots army defeated the English at the Battle of Otterburn in Northumberland in August 1388, its leader, the Earl of Douglas, was killed. Douglas died childless, triggering a series of claims on his estate â Carrick backed his brother-in-law Malcolm Drummond, the husband of Douglas&#x27;s sister, while Carrick&#x27;s brother, Robert Earl of Fife, took the side of Sir Archibald Douglas, Lord of Galloway, who held an entail on his kinsman&#x27;s estates, and who ultimately succeeded to the earldom. Fife, with his new powerful Douglas ally, together with those loyal to the king, ensured at the December 1388 council meeting that the guardianship of Scotland would pass from Carrick (who had recently been badly injured from a horse-kick) to Fife.

There was general approval of Fife&#x27;s intention to properly resolve the situation of lawlessness in the north and in particular the activities of Buchan his younger brother. Buchan was stripped of his position of justiciar, which would soon be given to Fife&#x27;s son, Murdoch Stewart. In January 1390 Robert II was in the north-east perhaps to strengthen the now changed political outlook in that region. He returned to Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire in March where he died on 19 April and was buried at Scone on 25 April.

== Reign ==
In May 1390 parliament granted John permission to change his regnal name to Robert, probably in part to maintain the link back to Robert I but also to disassociate himself from King John Balliol. The four-month delay in the crowning of Robert III can be seen as a period when Fife and his affinity sought to ensure their future positions, and which also saw Buchan&#x27;s opportunistic attack on Elgin Cathedral, settling an old score with the Bishop of Moray, and possibly also a protest at Fife&#x27;s reappointment as the king&#x27;s lieutenant.

=== Rothesay&#x27;s lieutenancy ===
In 1392, Robert III strengthened the position of his son David, now Earl of Carrick, when he endowed him with a large annuity that allowed the young prince to build up his household and affinity, and then in 1393 regained his right to direct rule when the general council decided that Fife&#x27;s lieutenancy should end and that Carrick, now of age, should assist his father. This independence of action was demonstrated in 1395â1396, when he responded to Carrick&#x27;s unauthorised marriage to Elizabeth Dunbar, daughter of George, Earl of March, by ensuring its annulment. The king appears to have also taken over the conduct of foreign affairs, preserving the peace with Richard II and managing to increase the power of the Red Douglas Earl of Angus in the southeast of the country as a counterbalance to Fife&#x27;s Black Douglas ally. He further showed his authority when in an attempt to reduce inter-clan feuding and lawlessness, he arranged and oversaw a gladiatorial limited combat between the clans of Kay and Quhele (Clan Chattan) in Perth on 28 April 1396. Carrick progressively acted independently of his father taking control of the Stewart lands in the south-west, while maintaining his links with the Drummonds of his mother, and all at a time when Fife&#x27;s influence in central Scotland remained strong.

The king was increasingly blamed for his failure to pacify the Gaelic areas in the west and north. The general council held in Perth in April 1398 criticised the king&#x27;s governance, and empowered his brother Robert and his son David â now respectively the Dukes of Albany and Rothesay â to lead an army against Donald, Lord of the Isles, and his brothers. In November 1398, an influential group of magnates and prelates met at Falkland Castle that included Albany, Rothesay, Archibald, Earl of Douglas, Albany&#x27;s son Murdoch, justiciar North of the Forth along with the bishops Walter of St Andrews and Gilbert of Aberdeen â the outcome of this meeting manifested itself at the council meeting held in January 1399 when the king was forced to surrender power to Rothesay for three years.

The kin of the border earls took advantage of the confusion in England after the deposition of Richard II by Henry IV and harried and forayed into England causing much damage, and taking Wark Castle around 13 October 1399. A far-reaching dispute between Rothesay and George Dunbar, Earl of March, occurred when Rothesay, rather than remarrying Elizabeth Dunbar as previously agreed, decided to marry Mary Douglas, daughter of the Earl of Douglas. Enraged, March wrote to Henry IV on 18 February 1400, and by July had entered Henry&#x27;s service. In 1401, Rothesay took on a more assertive and autonomous attitude, circumventing proper procedures, unjustifiably appropriating sums from the customs of the burghs on the east coast, before provoking further animosity when he confiscated the revenues of the temporalities of the vacant bishopric of St Andrews. Rothesay also confronted Albany&#x27;s influence in central Scotland in conjunction with his uncle, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan. As soon his lieutenancy expired in 1402, Rothesay was arrested and imprisoned in Albany&#x27;s Falkland Castle where he died in March 1402. Rothesay&#x27;s death probably lay with Albany and Douglas, who would have looked upon the possibility of the young prince acceding to the throne with great apprehension. They certainly fell under suspicion, but were cleared of all blame by a general council, &quot;&quot;where, by divine providence and not otherwise, it is discerned that he departed from this life&quot;.&quot;

=== Albany&#x27;s lieutenancy ===
Following Rothesay&#x27;s death, and with the restoration of the lieutenancy to Albany and the Scottish defeat at the battle of Humbleton, Robert III experienced almost total exclusion from political authority and was limited to his lands in the west. By late 1404 Robert, with the aid of his close councilors Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, Sir David Fleming and Henry Wardlaw, had succeeded in re-establishing himself and intervened in favour of Alexander Stewart, the Earl of Buchan&#x27;s illegitimate son, who was in dispute with Albany over the earldom of Mar. Robert III again exhibited his new resolve when in December 1404 he created a new regality in the Stewartry for his sole remaining son and heir, James, now Earl of Carrick â an act designed to prevent these lands falling into Albany&#x27;s hands.

By 28 October 1405, Robert III had returned to Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire. With the king&#x27;s health failing, it was decided in the winter of 1405â1406 to send the young prince to France out of the reach of Albany. Despite this, the manner of James&#x27;s flight from Scotland was unplanned. In February 1406, James together with Orkney and Fleming, at the head of a large group of followers left the safety of Bishop Wardlaw&#x27;s protection in St Andrews and journeyed through the hostile Douglas territories of east Lothian â an act probably designed to demonstrate James&#x27;s royal endorsement of his custodians, but also a move by his custodians to further their own interests in the traditional Douglas heartlands. Events went seriously wrong for James and he had to escape to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth along with the Earl of Orkney after his escorts were attacked by James Douglas of Balvenie, and which resulted in Sir David Fleming&#x27;s death. Their confinement on the rock was to last for over a month before a ship from Danzig, en route for France, picked them up. On 22 March 1406, the ship was taken by English pirates off Flamborough Head, who delivered James to King Henry IV of England. Robert III had moved to Rothesay Castle where, after hearing of his son&#x27;s captivity, he died on 4 April 1406, and was buried in Paisley Abbey, which had been founded by the Stewarts.

== Family and issue ==
King Robert III married Anabella Drummond, the daughter of Sir John Drummond of Stobhall and Mary Montifex, daughter of Sir William Montifex, in c. 1366/1367. They had seven children:
* David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay (24 October 1378 â 26 March 1402), who was betrothed to Elizabeth Dunbar but later married Lady Marjory Douglas, the daughter of Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas and Joanna de Moravia of Strathearn;

== Historiography ==
Abbot Walter Bower reported that Robert III described himself as &quot;the worst of kings and the most miserable of men&quot;. Gordon Donaldson in his general history &quot;Scottish Kings&quot; (1967) agrees and writes of the first two Stewart kings &quot;that a famous dynasty, which was to produce so many men of remarkable ability ... made a somewhat pedestrian beginning&quot;. He immediately qualifies this statement with &quot;it is true that the sources, both record and narrative, are scanty&quot;. He goes further and explains &quot;admittedly, no attempt has yet been made to bring the resources of modern historical research to bear on Robert II and Robert III ... but it is beyond the bounds of probability that even if this is done either of them will emerge as a man who did much positively to shape Scottish history.&quot; When Robert III re-established his personal rule in 1393, Donaldson characterises it as a period of anarchy, and of a king who couldn&#x27;t control his brothers Albany and Buchan, nor his son Rothesay.

Ranald Nicholson agrees with Donaldson in his &quot;Scotland: The Later Middle Ages&quot; (1974), and describes Robert III as a failure, like his father, because he wasn&#x27;t dominant. Nicholson&#x27;s opinion was that in his period as Lieutenant in the 1380s, Robert (John, Earl of Carrick) was incapable of dealing with the breakdown of law and order, citing the number of legal cases. The lameness of Carrick after being kicked by a horse was explained by Nicholson as the excuse needed to have him replaced by his brother Robert, Earl of Fife as the king&#x27;s lieutenant. Nicholson writes, &quot;nothing much was to be hoped for in the heir apparent&quot;, and goes on to blame Robert III for the destruction of Forres and Elgin, despite the lieutenancy of Fife at the time.

Andrew Barrell in his book &quot;Medieval Scotland&quot; (2000) puts forward that the first two Stewart kings, &quot;had difficulty in asserting themselves, partly because their dynasty was new to kingship and needed to establish itself&quot;. Robert III&#x27;s period of personal rule from 1393 was &quot;disastrous&quot; according to Barrell, and was exemplified by the king&#x27;s failure to re-take the royal fortress of Dumbarton. Barrell&#x27;s final assessment of Robert III was of a man crippled in body and incapable or averse to personally confronting Albany but sought to do so through promoting the status of his sons, and even then he failed.

Alexander Grant in &quot;Independence and Nationhood&quot; (1984) found Robert III to be &quot;probably Scotland&#x27;s least impressive king&quot;. Grant puts this into perspective and writes that it is notable that Robert III&#x27;s reign could have been worse compared to the turmoil and violence experienced in England and France when ruled by weak kings. Even on Robert&#x27;s death, Scotland didn&#x27;t descend into open civil war but was restricted to positioning among the royal family and its magnate groupings. Grant, in &quot;The New Cambridge Medieval History&quot;, explains that the 13th century Scottish kings ruled with the endorsement of practically all the political classes but that none of the 14th century kings, from Robert I to Robert III, did so and retained loyalty by the use of patronage. The benefits of this were outweighed by the disadvantages â alienated lands reduced crown income, endowments had the same effect, the estates granted to nobles and church often in regality led to a loss of royal attendance within these territories and contributed to a diminishment of authority.

Michael Lynch suggests that the earlier 20th century historians made hasty evaluations of both Robert II and Robert III when they characterised them as &quot;pathetically weak personalities&quot; and their reigns as &quot;nineteen years of senility and sixteen of infirmity&quot;. Lynch also makes the point that the complaints made in the later chronicles of lawlessness and disturbance in the country were mainly confined to the north with the king&#x27;s brother Alexander, Lord of Badenoch and Earl of Buchan at its root. The death of John, Lord of the Isles heralded a state of dissension between the lordship and the crown that was to last for two generations and which even Robert III&#x27;s successor James I was unable to deal with properly. Lynch states that much of the troubles during Robert III&#x27;s reign derived from the sharp deterioration of the royal revenues. The unruliness of northern Scotland was the result of competing factions within the royal family â Lynch suggests that the weakness in kingship before 1406 &quot;can be exaggerated&quot;, citing Buchan&#x27;s enforced appearance at Robert III&#x27;s council to answer for his incendiary attack on Elgin and its cathedral, and Albany&#x27;s obtainment of a submission from the lord of the Isles.

In Stephen Boardman&#x27;s &quot;The Early Stewart Kings&quot;, the younger Robert, then John, Earl of Carrick, is shown to be an energetic ambitious man and fully engaged in the running of the country, at the centre of Anglo-Scottish diplomacy, and who became the pre-eminent magnate in Scotland and whose political importance south of the Forth would eclipse that of his father&#x27;s. Boardman describes how in 1384 he callously engineered the council to remove his father from power and to place it in his hands. Many of the problems of Robert III&#x27;s rule, Boardman argues, stemmed from the death of his brother-in-law and close ally James, Earl of Douglas at Otterburn in 1388, when his deliberately constructed and powerful affinity south of the Forth crumbled. That same year Carrick lost the lieutenancy to his brother Robert Earl of Fife, that was, Boardman suggests, a blow to the future king&#x27;s standing and one from which he would not fully recover. According to Boardman, when Robert became king in 1390 he was the victim of his father&#x27;s style of government characterised by Robert II&#x27;s creation of his sons, sons-in-law, and other major territorial nobles as powerful magnates to whom he delegated extensive authority. As a result, Robert III&#x27;s brothers refused to act simply as liegemen to the king. Robert III, already weakened by the council when he ascended the throne, was in the end completely subordinated to the magnate power of Albany and Douglas.

== Fictional portrayals ==
Robert III has been depicted in historical novels. They include:
* &quot;The Fair Maid of Perth&quot; (1828) by Walter Scott. The novel covers events from 1396 to 1402, depicting &quot;Scottish Clan feuds&quot; and other disturbances in Robert III&#x27;s reign. Robert III himself, David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, and Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany are prominently depicted. Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas stands out among the secondary characters;

* &quot;The Lords of Misrule&quot; (1976) by Nigel Tranter. Covers events from c. 1388 to 1390. Depicting the last years of Robert II of Scotland and the rise of Robert III to the throne. As the elderly king has grown &quot;feeble, weary and half-blind&quot;, his sons, daughters and other nobles campaign for power. An ungoverned Scotland is ravaged by their conflicts. Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany and Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan are prominently featured;

* &quot;A Folly of Princes&quot; (1977) by Nigel Tranter. Covers events from c. 1390 to 1402. Robert III turns out to be a weak king. His son David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, and brother Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany rival each other for political power in his court. But the struggle attracts the attention of Richard II and Henry IV, leading to English involvement;

* &quot;The Captive Crown&quot; (1977) by Nigel Tranter. Covers events from 1402 to 1411. It depicts the last few years in the reign of Robert III, the captivity of James I of Scotland at the hands of Henry IV and the events back in Scotland. Concluding with the Battle of Harlaw.

<doc id="147962" wikidata="Q465110" url="?curid=147962" title="Stylobate">
<text>In classical Greek architecture, a stylobate () is the top step of the crepidoma, the stepped platform upon which colonnades of temple columns are placed (it is the floor of the temple). The platform was built on a leveling course that flattened out the ground immediately beneath the temple.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;stylobate&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek , consisting of (stylos), &quot;column&quot;, and (bainein), &quot;to stride, walk&quot;.

==Terminology==
Some methodologies use the word &quot;stylobate&quot; to describe only the topmost step of the temple&#x27;s base, while stereobate is used to describe the remaining steps of the platform beneath the stylobate and just above the leveling course. Others, like John Lord, use the term to refer to the entire platform.

==Architectural use==
The stylobate was often designed to relate closely to the dimensions of other elements of the temple. In Greek Doric temples, the length and width of the stylobate were related, and in some early Doric temples the column height was one third the width of the stylobate. The Romans, following Etruscan architectural tradition, took a different approach in using a much higher stylobate that typically had steps only in the front, leading to the portico.

In modern architecture the stylobate is the upper part of the stepped basement of the building, or the common basement floor, combining several buildings. Today, stylobates are popular in use in the construction of high-rise buildings.

<text>In classical architecture, the frieze is the wide central section of an entablature and may be plain in the Ionic or Doric order, or decorated with bas-reliefs. Paterae are also usually used to decorate friezes. Even when neither columns nor pilasters are expressed, on an astylar wall it lies upon the architrave (&quot;main beam&quot;) and is capped by the moldings of the cornice. A frieze can be found on many Greek and Roman buildings, the Parthenon Frieze being the most famous, and perhaps the most elaborate. 

In interiors, the frieze of a room is the section of wall above the picture rail and under the crown moldings or cornice. By extension, a frieze is a long stretch of painted, sculpted or even calligraphic decoration in such a position, normally above eye-level. Frieze decorations may depict scenes in a sequence of discrete panels. The material of which the frieze is made may be plasterwork, carved wood or other decorative medium.

More loosely, &quot;frieze&quot; is sometimes used for any continuous horizontal strip of decoration on a wall, containing figurative or ornamental motifs. In an example of an architectural frieze on the faÃ§ade of a building, the octagonal Tower of the Winds in the Roman agora at Athens bears relief sculptures of the eight winds on its frieze.

A pulvinated frieze (or pulvino) is in section. Such friezes were features of 17th-century Northern Mannerism, especially in subsidiary friezes, and much employed in interior architecture and in furniture.

The concept of a &quot;frieze&quot; has been generalized in the mathematical construction of frieze patterns.

<text>Hamilton Howard &quot;Albert&quot; Fish (May 19, 1870Â â January 16, 1936) was an American serial killer, rapist, child molester and cannibal who committed at least three child murders between July 1924 and June 1928. He was also known as the Gray Man, the Werewolf of Wysteria, the Brooklyn Vampire, the Moon Maniac, and the Boogey Man. Fish was a suspect in at least ten murders during his lifetime, although he only confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide. He also confessed to stabbing at least two other people.

Fish once boasted that he &quot;had children in every state&quot;, and at one time stated his number of victims was about 100. However, it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or cannibalization, nor is it known if the statement was truthful. Fish was apprehended on December 13, 1934, and put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd. He was convicted and executed by electric chair on January 16, 1936, at the age of 65.

==Early life==
Albert Fish was born Hamilton Howard Fish in Washington, D.C., on May 19, 1870, to Randall Fish (1795â1875) and Ellen Francis Howell (1838â1903). Fish&#x27;s father was American, of English ancestry, and his mother was a Scots-Irish American. His father was forty-three years older than his mother and aged 75 at the time of his birth. Fish was his family&#x27;s youngest child and had three living siblings: Walter, Annie, and Edwin. He wished to be known as &quot;Albert&quot; after a dead sibling and to escape the nickname &quot;Ham and Eggs&quot; that he was given at an orphanage in which he spent much of his childhood. 

Fish&#x27;s family had a history of mental illness. His uncle had mania, one of his brothers was confined in a state mental hospital, a paternal half-brother suffered from schizophrenia and his sister Annie was diagnosed with a &quot;mental affliction&quot;. Three other relatives were diagnosed with mental illnesses, and his mother had &quot;aural and/or visual hallucinations&quot;.

On October 16, 1875, Fish&#x27;s father, a fertilizer manufacturer and former riverboat captain, suffered a fatal heart attack at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station. His mother then put him into Saint John&#x27;s Orphanage in Washington, D.C., where he was frequently physically abused. However, Fish began to enjoy the physical pain brought by the beatings. By 1880, Fish&#x27;s mother secured a government job and was able to remove him from the orphanage. 

In 1882, at age 12, Fish began a relationship with a telegraph boy. The youth introduced Fish to such practices as drinking urine and eating feces. Fish began visiting public baths where he could watch other boys undress, spending a great portion of his weekends on these visits. Throughout his life, he would write obscene letters to women whose names he acquired from classified advertising and matrimonial agencies.

==1890â1918: Early adulthood and criminal history==
By 1890, at age 20, Fish moved to New York City. There he engaged in male prostitution and began molesting and raping boys, mostly less than six years old. In 1898, Fish&#x27;s mother arranged a marriage for him with Anna Mary Hoffman, who was nine years his junior. They had six children: Albert, Anna, Gertrude, Eugene, John and Henry Fish. In 1903, Fish was arrested for grand larceny, convicted and incarcerated in Sing Sing Prison. 
Fish later recounted an incident in which a male lover took him to a wax museum, where he was fascinated by a bisection of a human penis and subsequently became obsessed with sexual mutilation. Several years later, around 1910, Fish was working in Wilmington, Delaware, when he met a 19-year-old man named Thomas Bedden. He took Bedden to where he was staying and the two began a sadomasochistic relationship; it is unclear whether or not the sadomasochism was consensual on Bedden&#x27;s part, but Fish&#x27;s later confession implied that Bedden was intellectually disabled. After ten days, Fish took Bedden to &quot;an old farm house&quot;, where he tortured him over two weeks. Fish eventually tied Bedden up and cut off half of his penis. &quot;I shall never forget his scream or the look he gave me&quot;, Fish later recalled. He originally intended to kill Bedden, cut up his body, and take it home, but he feared the hot weather would draw attention; instead, Fish poured peroxide over the wound, wrapped it in a Vaseline-covered handkerchief, left a $10 bill, kissed Bedden goodbye and left. &quot;Took first train I could get back home. Never heard what become of him, or tried to find out,&quot; Fish recalled.

In January 1917, Fish&#x27;s wife left him for John Straube, a handyman who boarded with the Fish family. Fish was subsequently forced to raise his children as a single parent. After his arrest, Fish told a newspaper that when his wife left him, she took nearly every possession the family owned. Fish began to have auditory hallucinations; he once wrapped himself in a carpet, saying that he was following the instructions of John the Apostle. It was about this time that Fish began to indulge in self-harm by embedding needles into his groin and abdomen. After his arrest, X-rays revealed that Fish had at least twenty-nine needles lodged in his pelvic region. He also hit himself repeatedly with a nail-studded paddle, and inserted wool doused with lighter fluid into his anus and set it alight. While Fish was never thought to have physically attacked or abused his children, he did encourage them and their friends to paddle his buttocks with the same nail-studded paddle he used to abuse himself.

===1919â1930: Escalation===
Around 1919, Fish stabbed an intellectually disabled boy in Georgetown. He often chose people who were either mentally disabled or African-American as his victims, later explaining that he assumed these people would not be missed when killed. Fish would later claim to have occasionally paid boys to procure other children for him. Fish tortured, mutilated, and murdered young children with his &quot;implements of Hell&quot;: a meat cleaver, a butcher knife, and a small handsaw. On July 11, 1924, Fish found 8-year-old Beatrice Kiel playing alone on her parents&#x27; farm on Staten Island, New York. He offered her money to come and help him look for rhubarb. She was about to leave the farm when her mother chased Fish away. Fish left but returned later to the Kiels&#x27; barn, where he tried to sleep but was discovered by Beatrice&#x27;s father and forced to leave. In 1924, the 54-year-old Fish, suffering from psychosis, felt that God was commanding him to torture and sexually mutilate children.

Shortly before he abducted Grace Budd, Fish attempted to test his &quot;implements of Hell&quot; on a 10-year-old child he had been molesting named Cyril Quinn. Quinn and his friend were playing box ball on a sidewalk when Fish asked them if they had eaten lunch. When they said that they had not, he invited them into his apartment for sandwiches. While the two boys were wrestling on Fish&#x27;s bed, they dislodged his mattress; underneath was a knife, a small handsaw, and a meat cleaver. They became frightened and ran out of the apartment. Despite already being married, Fish married Estella Wilcox on February 6, 1930, in Waterloo, New York; they divorced after only one week. Fish was arrested in May 1930 for &quot;sending an obscene letter to a woman who answered an advertisement for a maid.&quot; Following that arrest and another in 1931, he was sent to the Bellevue Hospital for observation.

==Murder of Grace Budd==

On May 25, 1928, Fish saw a classified advertisement in the Sunday edition of the &quot;New York World&quot; that read, &quot;Young man, 18, wishes position in country. Edward Budd, 406 West 15th Street.&quot; On May 28, Fish, then 58 years old, visited the Budd family in Manhattan under the pretence of hiring Edward; he later confessed that he planned to tie Edward up, mutilate him, and leave him to bleed to death. Fish introduced himself as &quot;Frank Howard&quot;, a farmer from Farmingdale, New York. He promised to hire Budd and his friend and said he would send for them in a few days. Fish failed to show up, but he sent a telegram to the Budd family apologizing and set a later date. When Fish returned, he met Edward&#x27;s younger sister, 10-year-old Grace &quot;Gracie&quot; Budd. He apparently shifted his intentions toward Grace and quickly made up a story about having to attend his niece&#x27;s birthday party.

He persuaded the parents, Delia Bridget Flanagan and Albert Francis Budd Sr., to let Grace accompany him to the party that evening. Fish subsequently took Grace to an abandoned house he had previously picked out to use for the murder of his next victim, Wisteria Cottage at 359 Mountain Road, located in the East Irvington neighborhood of Irvington, New York. There, Fish manually strangled her to death, then decapitated and dismembered her body, and ate most of the remains over the next several days. The police arrested 66-year-old superintendent Charles Edward Pope on September 5, 1930, as a suspect in Grace&#x27;s disappearance, accused by Pope&#x27;s estranged wife. Pope spent 108Â days in jail between his arrest and trial on December 22, 1930. He was found not guilty.

===Letter to the mother of Grace Budd===
In November 1934, an anonymous letter sent to Grace&#x27;s parents ultimately led the police to Fish. Budd&#x27;s mother was illiterate and could not read the letter herself, so she had her son read it to her. The unaltered letter reads:

Police investigated the letter and although the story concerning &quot;Capt. Davis&quot; and the famine in Hong Kong could not be verified, the part of the letter concerning the murder of Grace was found to be accurate in its description of the kidnapping and subsequent events, though it was impossible to confirm whether or not Fish had actually eaten parts of Grace&#x27;s body.

==Capture==
The letter was delivered in an envelope that had a small hexagonal emblem with the letters &quot;N.Y.P.C.B.A.&quot; representing &quot;New York Private Chauffeur&#x27;s Benevolent Association&quot;. A janitor at the company told the police he had taken some of the stationery home but left it at his rooming house at 200 East 52nd Street when he moved out. The landlady of the rooming house said that Fish checked out of that room a few days earlier. She said that Fish&#x27;s son sent him money and he asked her to hold his next check for him. Detective William King, the chief investigator for the case, waited outside the room until Fish returned. He agreed to go to headquarters for questioning, then brandished a razor blade. King disarmed Fish and took him to police headquarters. Fish made no attempt to deny the murder of Grace Budd, saying that he meant to go to the house to kill her brother Edward. Fish said it &quot;never even entered [his] head&quot; to rape the girl, but he later claimed to his attorney that, while kneeling on Grace&#x27;s chest and strangling her, he did have two involuntary ejaculations. This information was used at trial to make the claim the kidnapping was sexually motivated, thus avoiding any mention of cannibalism.

==Additional crimes discovered after Fish&#x27;s arrest==
===Francis McDonnell===
During the night of July 14, 1924, 9-year-old Francis McDonnell was reported missing after he failed to return home after playing catch with friends in Port Richmond, Staten Island. A search was organized and his body was foundâhanging by a treeâin a wooded area near his home. He had been sexually assaulted, and then strangled with his suspenders. According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left hamstring had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated that he intended to castrate the boy but fled when he heard someone approaching the area. McDonnell&#x27;s friends told the police that he was taken by an elderly man with a grey moustache. A neighbour also told the police he observed the boy with a similar-looking man walking along a grassy path into the nearby woods.

Francis&#x27; mother, Anna McDonnell, said she saw the same man earlier that day, telling reporters, &quot;He came shuffling down the street mumbling to himself and making queer motions with his hands ... I saw his thick grey hair and his drooping grey moustache. Everything about him seemed faded and grey.&quot; This description resulted in the mysterious stranger becoming known as &quot;The Grey Man&quot;. The McDonnell murder remained unsolved until the murder of Budd. When several eyewitnesses, among them the Staten Island farmer Hans Kiel, positively identified Fish as the odd stranger seen around Port Richmond on the day of McDonnell&#x27;s disappearance, Richmond County District Attorney Thomas Walsh announced his intention to seek an indictment against Fish for the boy&#x27;s murder. At first, Fish denied the charges. It was only in March 1935, after the conclusion of his trial for the Budd murder and his confession to the killing of Billy Gaffney, that he confirmed to investigators that he had also raped and murdered McDonnell. When the McDonnell confession was made public, the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; wrote that the disclosure solidified Fish&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the most vicious child-slayer in criminal history&quot;.

===Billy Gaffney===
On February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in Brooklyn with 4-year-old William &quot;Billy&quot; Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said &quot;the bogeyman took him.&quot; Gaffney&#x27;s body was never recovered. Initially, serial killer Peter Kudzinowski was a suspect in Gaffney&#x27;s murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a Brooklyn trolley, saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton&#x27;s description of the &quot;bogeyman&quot; matched Fish. Police matched the description of the child to Gaffney.

Detectives of the Manhattan Missing Persons Bureau were able to establish that Fish was employed as a house painter by a Brooklyn real estate company during February 1927, and that on the day of Gaffney&#x27;s disappearance he was working at a location a few miles from where the boy was abducted. Gaffney&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Gaffney, visited Fish in Sing Sing, accompanied by Detective King. She wanted to ask him about her son&#x27;s death, but Fish refused to speak to her. However, Fish claimed the following in a letter to his attorney:

==Trial and execution==
Fish&#x27;s trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in White Plains, New York. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and Westchester County Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish&#x27;s defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of Peekskill, New York. The trial lasted for ten days. Fish pleaded insanity, and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several psychiatrists testified about Fish&#x27;s sexual fetishes, which included sadism and masochism, flagellation, exhibitionism, voyeurism, piquerism, cannibalism, coprophagia, urophilia, hematolagnia, pedophilia, necrophilia, and infibulation. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a &quot;psychiatric phenomenon&quot; and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities. 

The defense&#x27;s chief expert witness was Fredric Wertham, a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish&#x27;s obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1â24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly &quot;sacrificing&quot; a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish&#x27;s cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish&#x27;s life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered &quot;He is insane.&quot;

Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement, and religion and thus was an &quot;insane knowledge&quot;. The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham&#x27;s findings. The first of four rebuttal witnesses was Menas Gregory, the former manager of the Bellevue Hospital, where Fish was treated during 1930. He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross-examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia, and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not &quot;mentally sick&quot; and that these were common perversions that were &quot;socially perfectly alright&quot; and that Fish was &quot;no different from millions of other people&quot;, some very prominent and successful, who had the &quot;very same&quot; perversions.

The next witness was the resident physician at The Tombs, Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish&#x27;s causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, &quot;That is not masochism&quot;, as he was only &quot;punishing himself to get sexual gratification&quot;. The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but &quot;was a matter of taste&quot; and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert&#x27;s opinion. Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish&#x27;s 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.

None of the jurors doubted that Fish was insane, but ultimately, as one later explained, they felt he should be executed anyway. They found him to be sane and guilty, and the judge sentenced the defendant to death by electrocution. Fish arrived at prison in March 1935, and was executed on January 16, 1936, in the electric chair at Sing Sing. He entered the chamber at 11:06Â p.m. and was pronounced dead three minutes later. He was buried in the Sing Sing Prison Cemetery. Fish is said to have helped the executioner position the electrodes on his body. His last words were reportedly, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know why I&#x27;m here.&quot; According to one witness present, it took two jolts before Fish died, creating the rumor that the apparatus was short-circuited by the needles that Fish had inserted into his body. These rumors were later regarded as untrue, as Fish reportedly died in the same fashion and time frame as others in the electric chair.

At a meeting with reporters after the execution, Fish&#x27;s lawyer James Dempsey revealed that he was in possession of his client&#x27;s &quot;final statement&quot;. This amounted to several pages of hand-written notes that Fish apparently penned in the hours just prior to his death. When pressed by the assembled journalists to reveal the document&#x27;s contents, Dempsey refused, stating, &quot;I will never show it to anyone. It was the most filthy string of obscenities that I have ever read.&quot;

==Victims==

===Known===
Between 1924 and 1928, Fish is believed to have killed at least three children:
* Francis McDonnell, 8, July 15, 1924, Long Island, New York.
* Billy Gaffney, 4, February 11, 1927, New York City.
* Grace Budd, age 10, June 3, 1928, New York City.

===Suspected===
Though Fish denied involvement with any other murders, he was a suspect in several other ones.

* Yetta Abramowitz, 12, was strangled and beaten on the roof of a five-story apartment house at 1013 Simpson Street in the Bronx on May 14, 1927. She died in a hospital shortly after she was found. An unidentified man matching Fish&#x27;s physical description was sighted trying to lure several local young girls into dark hallways and alleys on the date of Abramowitz&#x27;s death.
* The mutilated body of 16-year-old Mary Ellen O&#x27;Connor was found in the woods close to a house that Fish had been painting in Far Rockaway, Queens on February 15, 1932.

===Possible===
Fish claimed to have sexually assaulted at least 100 boys, most of whom were African-American or had developmental disabilities. He claimed he picked them because he believed the police would not fully investigate attacks against them.

* Emma Richardson, 5, October 3, 1926.
* Benjamin Collings, 17, December 15, 1932.

==In popular culture==

*A documentary film about Fish was released in 2007, directed by John Borowski. Also in 2007, the biographical film &quot;The Gray Man&quot; was released, starring Patrick Bauchau as Fish.
*Comedian Norm Macdonald used information from Fish&#x27;s crimes to set up a recurring joke on his podcast, &quot;Norm Macdonald Live&quot;. The joke included describing horrific elements of the crimes prior to setting up the intentionally anticlimactic punchline, &quot;This guy was a real jerk!&quot;
*Several songs about Fish were recorded by American extreme metal band Macabre, featured on their &quot;Grim Reality&quot;, &quot;Gloom&quot;, &quot;Sinister Slaughter&quot;, &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; and &quot;Carnival of Killers&quot; albums and EPs.
*Kenneth Robert Wilson, founding drummer for Marilyn Manson, created his stage name Ginger Fish by combining the names of Ginger Rogers and Albert Fish.

<text>A volute is a spiral, scroll-like ornament that forms the basis of the Ionic order, found in the capital of the Ionic column. It was later incorporated into Corinthian order and Composite column capitals. Four are normally to be found on an Ionic capital, eight on Composite capitals and smaller versions (sometimes called &quot;helix&quot;) on the Corinthian capital.

The word derives from the Latin &quot;voluta&quot; (&quot;scroll&quot;). It has been suggested that the ornament was inspired by the curve of a ram&#x27;s horns, or perhaps was derived from the natural spiral found in the ovule of a common species of clover native to Greece. Alternatively, it may simply be of geometrical origin.

The ornament can be seen in Renaissance and Baroque architecture and is a common decoration in furniture design, silverware and ceramics. A method of drawing the complex geometry was devised by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius through the study of classical buildings and structures.

<text>Respironics is an American medical supply company owned by Philips that specializes in products that improve respiratory functions. It is based in the Pittsburgh suburb of Murrysville in Pennsylvania, United States.

Some of its products had hazardous foam that disintegrated and entered patients&#x27; bodies. Company officials were aware of the defect, but continued to market them while the company withheld the vast majority of reports.

==History==
In 1976, company founder Gerald E. McGinnis opened the company&#x27;s first manufacturing facility for anesthesia masks near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Previous product research and manufacturing had occurred in the founder&#x27;s kitchen. Other early products included endotracheal and tracheostomy products.

McGinnis developed the &quot;Nasal CPAP Mask System,&quot; a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine for the treatment of sleep apnea, based on the original 1981 design by Dr. Colin Sullivan. After receiving FDA approval in 1984, Respironics began selling the first commercially available CPAP machine a year later.

In 1988, the company went public under the stock ticker symbol RESP. In 1992, Respironics received a patent for bi-level technology. This technology was originally intended as an improvement on CPAP, however, its use has expanded into the treatment of other breathing disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Other significant milestones were the acquisition of the ventilator company LIFECARE International in 1996, sleep apnea competitor Healthdyne Technologies in 1998, and medical monitor and sensor leader Novametrix in 2002.

On December 21, 2007, Respironics announced it entered into a merger agreement with Philips, with Philips acquiring all shares of Respironics for $66 per share, for a total of approx $5.1 billion. On March 14, 2008, Philips announced completion of tender offer to acquire Respironics.

== Hazardous foam and product recall==
A redesign of the CPAP devices from Respironics led to over a decade of complaints to Philips, which withheld the vast majority of them from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Around 2010, the company added industrial foam made of polyester-based polyurethane to silence rattling in the machine. But the foam could fall apart in heat and humidity, sending it into patients&#x27; noses, mouths, throats, and lungs. Among the chemicals released was formaldehyde, a potential carcinogen.

Only in 2021 did Philips recall the machines, which had been delivered across the United States and many other countries. Over 3,700 complaints across more than 11 years were held back from the FDA, which device makers are required to do so within 30 days of reports of patient injuries in addition to investigating them. The company did not begin an internal investigation until 2019. The devices were used by children, the elderly, and over 700,000 U.S. veterans. As many as 15 million devices were affected. People experienced vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and cancers in the lungs, throat, sinuses, and esophagus. Company officials knew about the dangers of the device, but continued to market and sell them.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company ramped up production of another ventilator that also included the foam. Operating profits from the ventilators, including the CPAP devices, soared to around US$800 million. During the pandemic, Philips conducted a series of studies on the foam, showing the deteriorating foam and chemicals released by it, which could cause &quot;serious injury, life-threatening or permanent impairment&quot;.

The company said patients&#x27; health is its top priority, and regretted the &quot;distress and concern&quot; that the recall caused. It said complaints about the foam were limited and were evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and it was made aware of the significance in early 2021, launching the recall soon after. Months after the recall, Philips said that tests showed the chemicals released by the foam were within safe levels.

The company announced a new CPAP machine in April 2021, and soon after admitted that the foam it had used previously had been breaking down in an earnings call. Then-CEO Frans van Houten, in the earnings call, pledged 250 million euros to the problem, and reassured investors that the &quot;device is safe to be continued to use to the best of our knowledge at this time&quot;. The company alerted the FDA but not customers. Following the recall, van Houten said he regretted the impact of it on &quot;patients, care providers, and shareholders.&quot;

Multiple federal lawsuits have been levied against the company. One settled with the company for US$479 million to reimburse customers.

==Today==
Philips Respironics&#x27;s products include devices for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea including CPAP and bi-level (BiPAP) non-invasive ventilation machines, oxygen concentrators for patients requiring supplemental oxygen, infant apnea monitors for infants at risk of SIDS, asthma treatment solutions and hospital ventilators.

<text>David II (5 March 1324 â 22 February 1371) was King of Scotland from 1329 until his death in 1371. Upon the death of his father, Robert the Bruce, David succeeded to the throne at the age of five and was crowned at Scone in November 1331, becoming the first Scottish monarch to be anointed at his coronation. During his childhood, David was governed by a series of guardians, and Edward III of England sought to take advantage of David&#x27;s minority by supporting an invasion of Scotland by Edward Balliol, beginning the Second War of Scottish Independence. Following the English victory at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, King David, Queen Joan and the rump of his government were evacuated to France, where he remained in exile until it was safe for him to return to Scotland in 1341.

In 1346, David invaded England in support of France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. His army was defeated at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross and he was captured and held as a prisoner in England for eleven years, while his nephew Robert Stewart governed Scotland. In 1357 the Treaty of Berwick brought the Second War of Independence to an end, the Scots agreed to pay a ransom of 100,000 merks, and David was allowed to return home. Heavy taxation was needed to pay for the ransom, which was to be paid in instalments, and David alienated his subjects by using the money for his own purposes. By 1363 it was found impossible to raise the remaining ransom, and David sought its cancellation by offering to bequeath the succession to the Scottish throne to Edward III or one of his sons. In 1364, the parliament of Scotland rejected David&#x27;s proposal to make Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, the next king. Despising his nephew, David sought to prevent him from succeeding to his throne by marrying his mistress Margaret Drummond and producing an alternative heir. When his second wife failed to do so, David unsuccessfully attempted to divorce her.

Although David spent long periods in exile or captivity, he managed to ensure the survival of his kingdom, reformed the machinery of government, and left the Scottish monarchy in a strong position. The last male of the House of Bruce, he died childless in 1371 after a reign of 41 years and was succeeded by his nephew Robert II.

== Early life ==
David II was born on 5 March 1324 at Dunfermline Abbey in Fife, one of twin sons born to King Robert the Bruce, and Elizabeth de Burgh. Soon after his birth he was wet nursed at the Bishop of St Andrews&#x27; manor at Inchmurdoch in Fife. David was created Earl of Carrick by his father in 1326, and an official household was established for the prince at Turnberry Castle. Very little is known of his youth, though it is recorded that King Robert paid for Dominican friars to educate David, and also purchased books for him. David&#x27;s mother died in 1327, when he was three years old. In accordance with the Treaty of EdinburghâNorthampton&#x27;s terms, on 17 July 1328, when he was four years old, David was married to seven-year-old Joan, the daughter of Edward II of England and Isabella of France, at Berwick Castle. The young earl of Carrick received a visit from his ailing father at Turnberry in February 1329.

== Reign ==
David became king upon the death of his father on 7 June 1329. David II&#x27;s youth and the uncertainty of the Anglo-Scottish peace meant he was not moved from Turnberry to Scone for his coronation for two-and-a-half years. The seven-year-old king and his wife were crowned at Scone Abbey on 24 November 1331, with David becoming the first Scottish monarch to be anointed at their coronation. Upon David&#x27;s accession, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was appointed as Guardian under Robert I&#x27;s orders, to govern Scotland until David reached adulthood, and the royal government of King Robert remained largely in place from 1329 to 1332. After Moray&#x27;s death, on 20 July 1332, he was replaced by Donald, Earl of Mar, elected by an assembly of the magnates of Scotland at Perth, 2 August 1332. Ten days later, Mar fell at the Battle of Dupplin Moor. Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell, who was married to Christian (or Christina), the sister of King Robert I, was chosen as the new Guardian. The English took him prisoner at Roxburgh in April 1333 and was accordingly replaced as Guardian by Archibald Douglas (the Tyneman), who fell at the Battle of Halidon Hill that July.

Meanwhile, on 24 September 1332, following the Scots&#x27; defeat at Dupplin, Edward Balliol, a protÃ©gÃ© of Edward III of England, and a pretender to the throne of Scotland, was crowned by the English and his Scots adherents. By December, however, Balliol was forced to flee to England after the Battle of Annan, although he returned the following year as part of an invasion force led by the English king.

=== Exile in France ===
Following the English victory at the Battle of Halidon Hill in July 1333, David and his wife were sent for safety into France, reaching Boulogne on 14 May 1334. They were received very graciously by King Philip VI. Little is known about the life of the Scottish king in France, except that ChÃ¢teau Gaillard was given to him for a residence, and that he was present at the bloodless meeting of the English and French armies in October 1339 at Vironfosse, now known as Buironfosse, in the Arrondissement of Vervins.

By 1341, David&#x27;s representatives had again obtained the upper hand in Scotland. David was able to return to his kingdom, landing at Inverbervie in Kincardineshire on 2 June 1341. He took the reins of government into his own hands, at the age of 17.

=== Captivity in England ===
In 1346, under the terms of the Auld Alliance, David invaded England to try to draw King Edward away from the French, who had been invaded by the English and badly defeated at the battle of CrÃ©cy. After initial success at Hexham, David&#x27;s army was soundly defeated at the battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross on 17 October 1346. David suffered two arrow wounds to the face and was captured and taken prisoner by Sir John de Coupland. The king was taken to Wark on Tweed, and then to Bamburgh Castle, where barber-surgeons from York were brought to treat his serious injuries. David II was transferred to London, where he was imprisoned in the Tower of London in January 1347. David was transferred to Windsor Castle in Berkshire upon the return of Edward III from France. The depiction of David being presented to King Edward III in the play &quot;The Raigne of King Edward the Third&quot; is fictitious. David and his household were later moved to Odiham Castle in Hampshire. His imprisonment was not reputed to be a rigorous one as was typical of most royal prisoners. However, the fact that from 1355 he was denied contact with any of his subjects may indicate otherwise. He remained captive in England for eleven years.

On 3 October 1357, after several protracted negotiations with the Scots&#x27; regency council, a treaty was signed at Berwick-upon-Tweed under which Scotland&#x27;s nobility agreed to pay 100,000 marks, at the rate of 10,000 marks per year, as a ransom for their king. This was ratified by the Scottish Parliament at Scone on 6 November 1357.

=== Return to Scotland ===
David returned to Scotland accompanied by a large contingent of Scottish nobles and clergy. He also brought his mistress, Katherine (or Catherine) Mortimer, of whom little is known. Katherine was murdered in 1360 by men hired by the Earl of Angus and other nobles, according to some sources; some accounts say the earl was starved to death, however since his death was not until 1362, two years after the murder, death from the plague or other causes is more likely. She was replaced as mistress by Margaret Drummond.

After six years, owing to the poverty of the kingdom, it was found impossible to raise the ransom instalment of 1363. David then made for London and sought to get rid of the liability by offering to bequeath Scotland to Edward III, or one of his sons, in return for a cancellation of the ransom. David did this with the full awareness that the Scots would never accept such an arrangement. In 1364, the Scottish parliament indignantly rejected a proposal to make Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, the next king. Over the next few years, David strung out secret negotiations with Edward III, which apparently appeased the matter.

His wife, Queen Joan, died on 7 September 1362 (aged 41) at Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire, possibly a victim of the Black Death. He remarried, on about 20 February 1364, to Margaret Drummond, widow of Sir John Logie, and daughter of Sir Malcolm Drummond. He divorced her on about 20 March 1370. They had no children. Margaret, however, travelled to Avignon, and made a successful appeal to the Pope Urban V to reverse the sentence of divorce which had been pronounced against her in Scotland. She was still alive in January 1375, four years after David died.

From 1364, David governed actively, dealing firmly with recalcitrant nobles, and a wider baronial revolt, led by his prospective successor, the future Robert II. David continued to pursue the goal of a final peace with England. At the time of his death, the Scottish monarchy was stronger and the country was &quot;a free and independent kingdom&quot; according to a reliable source. The royal finances were more prosperous than might have seemed possible.

== Relationships ==

King David II of Scotland married twice and had several mistresses, but none of his relationships produced children:

# Joan of the Tower, the daughter of King Edward II of England and Isabella of France, was David&#x27;s first wife. David and Joan were married on 17 July 1328, when he was four years old and she was seven. The marriage was in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Northampton. They were married for 34 years but produced no children. Queen Joan died on 7 September 1362 (aged 41) at Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire;
# Margaret Drummond was the widow of Sir John Logie, and daughter of Sir Malcolm Drummond. Margaret was David&#x27;s mistress before the death of Queen Joan, from about 1361. David and Margaret married on 20 February 1364. Still producing no heirs, David attempted to divorce Margaret on 20 March 1370, on the grounds that she was infertile. Pope Urban V, however, reversed the divorce. When David died on 22 February 1371, Margaret and David were still actually married, according to Rome. Margaret died sometime after 31 January 1375, and her funeral was paid for by Pope Gregory XI;
# Agnes Dunbar was David&#x27;s mistress at the time of his death. He was planning to marry her; however, the marriage was delayed by the reversal of his divorce to Margaret.

== Death ==
David II died unexpectedly of natural causes at Edinburgh Castle on 22 February 1371, aged forty-six. David was not buried â as he had previously planned â beside his parents at Dunfermline Abbey, but before the high altar of Holyrood Abbey. This choice may have been made because Holyrood was the closest church at hand, only a mile away from Edinburgh Castle, and because David&#x27;s successor wished to quickly draw a line under the previous reign. The funeral was overseen by Abbot Thomas. As David II left no children, he was the last male of the House of Bruce and was succeeded by his nephew, Robert II, the son of David&#x27;s half-sister Marjorie.

== Fictional portrayals ==
David II has been depicted in historical novels. They include:
* &quot;Cressy and Poictiers; or, the Story of the Black Prince&#x27;s Page&quot; (1865) by John George Edgar (1834â1864). The novel depicts events of the years 1344 to 1370, with an epilogue in 1376. The events depicted cover part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the &quot;Scotch Border Wars&quot; (Second War of Scottish Independence), with the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross (1346) being a key part of the plot. David II is one of the &quot;principal characters&quot;, alongside Edward III of England, Philippa of Hainault, and Edward the Black Prince;

* &quot;Flowers of Chivalry&quot; (1988), by Nigel Tranter, covers events of the Second War of Scottish Independence from 1332 to 1339. David II is a secondary character, the protagonists being Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie and William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale;

* &quot;Vagabond&quot; (2002) by Bernard Cornwell.

David II also appears as a character in the Elizabethan play &quot;Edward III&quot; and also in the 2012 grand strategy game Crusader Kings II as the monarch of Scotland in 1336.

<text>Carlo Gambino (; August 24, 1902Â â October 15, 1976) was a Sicilian crime boss who was the leader and namesake of the Gambino crime family of New York City. Following the Apalachin Meeting in 1957, and the imprisonment of Vito Genovese in 1959, Gambino took over the Commission of the American Mafia and played a powerful role in organized crime until his death from a heart attack in 1976. During a criminal career that spanned over fifty years, Gambino served only twenty-two months in prison for a tax evasion charge in 1937.

==Early life and family==
Carlo Gambino was born in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, on August 24, 1902, to a family that belonged to a Sicilian Mafia gang from Passo di Rigano. He had two brothers: Gaspare, who was not involved with the Mafia, and Paolo, who was a part of what would become the Gambino crime family. His parents were Italian immigrants Tommaso Gambino and Felice Castellano.

Gambino entered the United States on December 23, 1921, at Norfolk, Virginia, as a stowaway on the SS &quot;Vincenzo Florio&quot;. He made his way to New York City to join his cousins, the Castellanos, and worked for a small trucking firm owned by their family. Gambino later moved to a modest house located at 2230 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn; his Long Island residence, located at 34 Club Drive in Massapequa, New York, served as his summer home. The two-story brick house, surrounded by a low fence with marble statues on the front lawn, was at the end of a cul-de-sac in Harbor Green Estates, overlooking the South Oyster Bay. 

In 1932, Gambino married one of his cousins, Catherine Castellano, sister of future Gambino family boss Paul Castellano. They raised four childrenÂ â sons Thomas, Joseph (March 28, 1936 â February 20, 2020) and Carlo Jr. (1934â2019) and a daughter, Phyllis Gambino Sinatra (September 22, 1927 â February 19, 2007).

== Criminal career ==
=== Castellammarese War and The Commission ===
In New York, Gambino joined a criminal organization headed by Joe Masseria, another Sicilian-born gangster. In 1930 Gambino was arrested in Lawrence, Massachusetts, as a suspicious person. That charge was dismissed, but he was seized a month later in Brockton, Massachusetts, on a larceny charge. A warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to show up in court. Four years later, he was arrested in Manhattan as a fugitive and was returned to Brockton, where the larceny charge was dropped when he made restitution of $1,000.

By the early 1930s, Masseria found himself in a fierce rivalry with Salvatore Maranzano, the head of the Castellammarese clan, which eventually escalated into the bloody Castellammarese War. Masseria and Maranzano were so-called &quot;Mustache Petes&quot;: older, traditional Mafia bosses who had started their criminal careers in their home country and believed in upholding the supposed &quot;Old World Mafia&quot; principles of &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;dignity&quot;. The Mustache Petes refused to work with non-Italians and were skeptical of working with non-Sicilians. Some of the most conservative bosses worked only with men having roots in their own Sicilian village.

When the war began turning poorly for Masseria, his second-in-command, Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, saw an opportunity to switch allegiances. In a secret deal with Maranzano, he agreed to engineer Masseria&#x27;s death in return for taking over Masseria&#x27;s rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s lieutenant. On April 15, 1931, Masseria was killed at Nuova Villa Tammaro, a restaurant on Coney Island, ending the Castellammarese War.

With Masseria gone, Maranzano reorganized the Italian gangs of New York into Five Families headed by Luciano, Joe Profaci, Tommy Gagliano, Vincent Mangano and himself. He called a meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, where he declared himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). Maranzano also whittled down the rival families&#x27; rackets in favor of his own. Luciano appeared to accept these changes but was merely biding his time before removing Maranzano. Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that he was even more greedy and power-hungry than Masseria had been.

By September 1931, Maranzano, realizing the threat Luciano posed, hired Irish hitman Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll to eliminate him. However, Tommy Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. On September 10, Maranzano summoned Luciano, Vito Genovese and Frank Costello to his office at 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan, where Maranzano was killed.

Later in 1931, Luciano called a meeting in Chicago with various bosses, where he proposed the creation of a governing body for organized crime that would later evolve into The Commission. Designed to settle all disputes and decide which families controlled which territories, the Commission has been called Luciano&#x27;s greatest innovation. His goals with the Commission were to quietly maintain his own power over all the families, and to prevent future gang wars; the bosses approved the idea of the Commission.

=== Mangano family ===
After Masseria&#x27;s death, Gambino and his cousins became soldiers in the family headed by Mangano. Despite being a mob power in his own right, Albert Anastasia was nominally the underboss of the Mangano family. During his twenty-year rule, Mangano had resented Anastasia&#x27;s close ties to Luciano and Costello, particularly the fact that they had obtained Anastasia&#x27;s services without first seeking Mangano&#x27;s permission. This and other business disputes led to heated, almost physical fights between the two mobsters.

Gambino was arrested in 1937 for tax evasion related to operating a million-gallon distillery in Philadelphia. He served twenty-two months in prison at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, the only period in his long criminal career during which he was incarcerated.

In 1951, Mangano and his brother Philip were murdered, reportedly on the orders of Anastasia. Philip&#x27;s body was found near Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, on April 19, 1951. Vincent&#x27;s body was never found and he was declared dead by the Surrogate&#x27;s Court in Brooklyn on October 30, 1961, ten years after he had disappeared.

=== Anastasia murder ===
In 1957, Genovese decided to move against Costello and Anastasia, enlisting GambinoAnastasia&#x27;s underboss in the murder conspiracy. Genovese ordered Vincent Gigante to carry out the hit on Costello, which was attempted outside Costello&#x27;s apartment building on May 2, 1957. Although the wound was superficial, the brush with death persuaded Costello to relinquish power to Genovese and retire. Although a doorman identified Gigante as the gunman, Costello claimed to not recognize him at Gigante&#x27;s 1958 trial; Gigante was acquitted on charges of attempted murder.

With Costello gone, Genovese and Gambino allegedly ordered Anastasia&#x27;s murder. Gambino gave the contract to Profaci, who then allegedly assigned the hit to Joseph &quot;Crazy Joe&quot; Gallo. Anastasia was murdered on October 25, 1957, in the barbershop of the Park Sheraton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. 

Gambino subsequently took over the Mangano crime family, which took his name going forward. He appointed Joseph Biondo as underboss, though Biondo was replaced by Aniello Dellacroce in 1965.

=== Apalachin and Genovese&#x27;s fall ===
Shortly after Anastasia&#x27;s murder, Genovese took control of Luciano&#x27;s crime family from Costello. Seeking to legitimize his new power, he called a meeting in which leaders of both the American and Sicilian crime syndicates would be in attendance. Among the items on the meeting&#x27;s agenda were the Mafia&#x27;s interests in gambling and narcotics smuggling in pre-revolutionary Cuba, as well as their interests in New York City&#x27;s garment industry. The meeting took place on November 14 at the home of mobster Joseph Barbara in Apalachin, New York. 

Edgar D. Croswell, a trooper with the New York State Police, had become aware that Barbara&#x27;s son was reserving rooms in local hotels and that a large quantity of meat from the local butcher was being delivered to the Barbara home. Suspicious, Croswell decided to monitor Barbara&#x27;s house. When the State Police found numerous luxury cars parked at the estate, they took down the license plate numbers and discovered the vehicles were registered to known criminals. Police reinforcements came to the scene and a roadblock was set up. 

When the mobsters discovered the police presence, they started fleeing the gathering by car or by foot. Many &quot;mafiosi&quot; escaped through the woods surrounding the Barbara estate; Gambino is thought to have attended the meeting, but was not one of the mobsters apprehended. The police stopped a car driven by Pennsylvania boss Russell Bufalino, whose passengers included Genovese and three other men. Bufalino said that Genovese had come to visit a sick Barbara, while Genovese himself said he had come to attend a barbecue. The police let him go.

Gambino and Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On April 17, 1959, Genovese was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for drug offenses; he died in custody on February 14, 1969.

On January 26, 1962, Luciano died of a heart attack at Naples International Airport. Three days later, 300 people attended a funeral service for Luciano in Naples, during which his body was conveyed along the streets in a horse-drawn black hearse. With the permission of the U.S. government, Luciano&#x27;s relatives took his body back to New York for burial at St. John&#x27;s Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens. More than 2,000 mourners attended his funeral. Gambino, Luciano&#x27;s longtime friend, gave his eulogy.

=== Boss ===
After Genovese&#x27;s imprisonment, Gambino took control of The Commission. Under his leadership, the Gambino crime family had 500 soldiers and over 1,000 associates.

In 1962, Gambino&#x27;s oldest son, Thomas, married Lucchese&#x27;s daughter Frances. Over 1,000 guests attended the wedding, at which Gambino presented Lucchese with a $30,000 gift. In return, Lucchese gave Gambino a part of his rackets at Idlewild Airport (now called John F. Kennedy Airport). Lucchese exercised control over airport security and airport unions. As a team, Lucchese and Gambino now controlled the airport, the Commission, and most organized crime in New York.

=== Conspiracy against the Commission ===
In 1963, Joseph Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family, made plans to assassinate several rivals on The Commissionâbosses Gambino, Lucchese, and Stefano Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone. Bonanno sought Joseph Magliocco&#x27;s support, and Magliocco, bitter over being previously denied a seat on The Commission, readily agreed. Bonanno promised to make Magliocco his right-hand man in exchange for his assistance. 

Magliocco was assigned with killing Lucchese and Gambino, and he gave the contract to Joseph Colombo, one of his top hit men. However, the opportunistic Colombo revealed the plot to his intended targets. The other bosses quickly surmised that Magliocco and Bonnano were colluding, and summoned both men to explain themselves. Fearing for his life, Bonanno went into hiding in Montreal, leaving Magliocco to deal with the Commission. Badly shaken and in failing health, Magliocco confessed his role in the plot. The Commission spared his life but forced him to retire as boss of the Profaci family and pay a $50,000 fine. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo took over Magliocco&#x27;s family, which was subsequently renamed the Colombo family.

=== Health and deportation order ===
Deportation proceedings against Gambino were started by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as early as 1953, but made no headway for several years because of his heart condition and constant hospitalizations. In 1970 he was indicted on charges of conspiring to hijack an armored car carrying $3 million, and was arrested on March 23, 1970. He was released on $75,000 bail, and was never brought to trial because of his health. The same year, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a 1967 order, that he previously appealed, that he be deported because he had entered the country illegally. When the government tried to carry out the order, Gambino was rushed to a hospital after he had suffered a massive heart attack.

=== Colombo assassination ===
On June 28, 1971, Colombo was shot three times by Jerome A. Johnson, one being in the head, at the second Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle sponsored by the Italian-American Civil Rights League; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards. Colombo was permanently paralyzed from the shooting, and later died in 1978.

Although many in the Colombo family blamed Gallo for the shooting, the police eventually concluded that Johnson was a lone gunman after they had questioned Gallo. Since Johnson had spent time a few days earlier at a club run by the Gambino family, one theory was that Gambino organized the shooting. Colombo had refused to listen to Gambino&#x27;s complaints about the League, and allegedly spat in Gambino&#x27;s face during one argument. However, the Colombo family leadership was convinced that Gallo ordered the murder after his falling out with the family. Gallo was murdered on April 7, 1972.

=== Tommy Eboli murder ===
After Genovese&#x27;s death, Gerardo Catena became the new boss of the Genovese family. However, he was indicted and jailed in 1970. Thomas Eboli then became the &quot;front boss&quot; of the family for the next two years. However, Eboli wanted to run the family for real and borrowed $4 million from Gambino to finance a new drug trafficking operation. However, law enforcement soon shut down Eboli&#x27;s drug racket and arrested most of his crew. Gambino allegedly ordered Eboli&#x27;s murder. While it was initially thought that this was due to Eboli&#x27;s failure to pay back the loan, it is now believed that Gambino actually wanted to replace Eboli with Frank &quot;Funzi&quot; Tieri, and that Gambino used the loan as a pretext. On July 16, 1972, Eboli left his girlfriend&#x27;s apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and walked to his chauffeured Cadillac. As he sat in the parked car, a gunman in a passing truck shot him five times. Hit in the head and neck, Eboli died instantly. No one was ever charged in this murder.

== Death ==
Gambino died at his Massapequa home in the early morning hours of Friday having watched the television broadcast of the winning the American League pennant the previous evening. The official cause was natural causes, and his death was not unexpected, given a history of heart disease. Cusimano &amp; Russo Funeral Home hosted his wake over the weekend of October 16 and 17. His funeral mass was held on Monday, October 18, at the Church of Our Lady of Grace Gambino was then entombed within his family&#x27;s private room in the Cloister building of St. John Cemetery in Queens. His funeral and wake were attended by several hundred people, with plainclothes police and FBI agents mingling outside. His funeral procession consisted of thirteen limousines, around a dozen private cars and one flower car.

=== Aftermath ===
Against expectations, Gambino had previously appointed Castellano to succeed him over his underboss Dellacroce. Gambino appeared to believe that the family would benefit from Castellano&#x27;s focus on white-collar crime. Dellacroce, at the time, was imprisoned for tax evasion and was unable to contest Castellano&#x27;s succession.

Castellano&#x27;s succession was confirmed at a meeting on November 24, with Dellacroce present. Castellano arranged for Dellacroce to remain as underboss while directly running traditional Mafia activities such as extortion, robbery and loansharking. While Dellacroce accepted Castellano&#x27;s succession, the deal effectively split the Gambino family into two rival factions.

<doc id="147973" wikidata="Q5183612" url="?curid=147973" title="Creator code">
<text>A creator code is a mechanism introduced in the classic Mac OS to link a data file to the application program which created it. The similar type code held the file type, like &quot;TEXT&quot;. Together, the type and creator indicated what application should be used to open a file, similar to (but richer than) the file extensions in other operating systems.

Creator codes are four-byte OSTypes. They allow applications to launch and open a file whenever any of their associated files is double-clicked. Creator codes could be any four-byte value, but were usually chosen so that their ASCII representation formed a word or acronym. For example, the creator code of the HyperCard application and its associated &quot;stacks&quot; is represented in ASCII as , from the application&#x27;s original name of WildCard. Occasionally they represented inside jokes. For instance, the &quot;Marathon&quot; computer game had a creator code of (the approximate length, in miles, of a marathon) and &quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot; had a creator code of .

The binding are stored inside the resource fork of the application as BNDL and fref resources. These resources maintained the creator code as well as the association with each type code and icon. The OS collected this data from the files when they were copied between mediums, thereby building up the list of associations and icons as software was installed onto the machine. Periodically this &quot;desktop database&quot; would become corrupted, and had to be fixed by &quot;rebuilding the desktop database.&quot;

The key difference between extensions and Apple&#x27;s system is that file type and file ownership bindings are kept distinct. This allows files to be written of the same type - TEXT say - by different applications. Although any application can open anyone else&#x27;s TEXT file, by default, opening the file will open the original application that created it. With the extensions approach, this distinction is lost - all files with a .txt extension will be mapped to a single text editing application of the user&#x27;s choosing. A more obvious advantage of this approach is allowing for double click launching of specialized editors for more complex but common file types, like .csv or .html. This can also represent a disadvantage as in the illustration above, where double clicking the four mp3 files would launch and play the files in four different music applications instead of queuing them in the user&#x27;s preferred player application.

macOS retains creator codes, but supports extensions as well. However, beginning with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, creator codes are ignored by the operating system. Creator codes have been internally superseded by Apple&#x27;s Uniform Type Identifier scheme, which manages application and file type identification as well as type codes, creator codes and file extensions.

To avoid conflicts, Apple maintained a database of creator codes in use. Developers could fill out an online form to register their codes. Apple reserves codes containing all lower-case ASCII characters for its own use.

Creator codes are not readily accessible for users to manipulate, although they can be viewed and changed with certain software, most notably the macOS command line tools &quot;GetFileInfo&quot; and &quot;SetFile&quot; which are installed as part of the developer tools into &quot;/Developer/Tools&quot;.

<doc id="147976" wikidata="Q216787" url="?curid=147976" title="David I of Scotland">
<text>David I or DauÃ­d mac MaÃ­l Choluim (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Daibhidh I mac [Mhaoil] Chaluim&quot;; â 24 May 1153) was a 12th century ruler and saint who was Prince of the Cumbrians from 1113 to 1124 and King of Scotland from 1124 to 1153. The youngest son of King Malcolm III and Queen Margaret, David spent most of his childhood in Scotland but was exiled to England temporarily in 1093. Perhaps after 1100, he became a dependent at the court of King Henry I of England, by whom he was influenced.

When David&#x27;s brother Alexander I died in 1124, David chose, with the backing of Henry I, to take the Kingdom of Alba (Scotland) for himself. He was forced to engage in warfare against his rival and nephew, MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair. Subduing the latter seems to have taken David ten years, a struggle that involved the destruction of Ãengus, Mormaer of Moray. David&#x27;s victory allowed expansion of control over more distant regions theoretically part of his Kingdom. After the death of his former patron Henry I, David supported the claims of Henry&#x27;s daughter and his own niece, Empress Matilda, to the throne of England. In the process, he came into conflict with King Stephen and was able to expand his power in northern England, despite his defeat at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. David I is a saint of the Catholic Church, with his feast day celebrated on 24 May.

The term &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot; is used by many scholars to summarise the changes that took place in Scotland during his reign. These included his foundation of burghs and regional markets, implementation of the ideals of Gregorian Reform, foundation of monasteries, Normanisation of the Scottish government, and the introduction of feudalism through immigrant Anglo-Norman and Norman knights, as well as Flemish settlers.

== Early years ==
David was born on a date unknown in 1084 in Scotland. He was probably the eighth son of King Malcolm III, and certainly the sixth and youngest borne by Malcolm&#x27;s second wife, Margaret of Wessex. He was the grandson of King Duncan I.

In 1093, King Malcolm and David&#x27;s brother Edward were killed at the River Aln during an invasion of Northumberland. David and his two brothers Alexander and Edgar were probably present when their mother died shortly afterwards. According to later medieval tradition, the three brothers were in Edinburgh when they were besieged by their paternal uncle Donald III, who made himself king. It is not certain what happened next, but an insertion in the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; states that Donald forced his three nephews into exile, although he was allied with another of his nephews, Edmund. John of Fordun wrote, centuries later, that an escort into England was arranged for them by their maternal uncle Edgar Ãtheling.

King William Rufus of England opposed Donald&#x27;s accession to the northerly kingdom. He sent the eldest son of Malcolm, David&#x27;s half-brother Duncan, into Scotland with an army. Duncan was killed within the year, and so in 1097 William sent Duncan&#x27;s half-brother Edgar into Scotland. The latter was more successful and was crowned by the end of 1097.

During the power struggle of 1093â1097, David was in England. In 1093, he may have been about nine years old. From 1093 until 1103, David&#x27;s presence cannot be accounted for in detail, but he appears to have been in Scotland for the remainder of the 1090s. When William Rufus was killed, his brother Henry Beauclerc seized power and married David&#x27;s sister, Matilda. The marriage made David the brother-in-law of the ruler of England. From that point onwards, David was probably an important figure at the English court. Despite his Gaelic background, by the end of his stay in England, David had become a fully Normanised prince. William of Malmesbury wrote that it was in this period that David &quot;rubbed off all tarnish of Scottish barbarity through being polished by intercourse and friendship with us&quot;.

== Early rule 1113â1124 ==
=== Prince of the Cumbrians ===
David&#x27;s brother King Edgar had visited William Rufus in May 1099 and bequeathed to David extensive territory to the south of the river Forth. On 8 January 1107, Edgar died. His younger brother Alexander took the throne. It has been assumed that David took control of his inheritance â the southern lands bequeathed by Edgar â soon after the latter&#x27;s death. However, it cannot be shown that he possessed his inheritance until his foundation of Selkirk Abbey late in 1113. According to Richard Oram, it was only in 1113, when Henry returned to England from Normandy, that David was at last in a position to claim his inheritance in southern Scotland.

King Henry&#x27;s backing seems to have been enough to force King Alexander to recognise his younger brother&#x27;s claims. This probably occurred without bloodshed but through the threat of force nonetheless. David&#x27;s aggression seems to have inspired resentment amongst some native Scots. A Middle Gaelic quatrain from this period complains that:
If &quot;divided from&quot; is anything to go by, this quatrain may have been written in David&#x27;s new territories in southern Scotland. The lands in question consisted of the Shires of Scotland of Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, Berwickshire, Peeblesshire and Lanarkshire. David, moreover, gained the title , &quot;Prince of the Cumbrians&quot;, as attested in David&#x27;s charters from this era. Although this was a large slice of Scotland south of the river Forth, the region of Galloway-proper was entirely outside David&#x27;s control. David may perhaps have had varying degrees of overlordship in parts of Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire. In the lands between Galloway and the Principality of Cumbria, David eventually set up large-scale marcher lordships, such as Annandale for Robert de Brus, Cunningham for Hugh de Morville, and possibly Strathgryfe for Walter Fitzalan.

=== Earl of Huntingdon ===
In the later part of 1113, King Henry gave David the hand of Matilda of Huntingdon, daughter and heiress of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria. The marriage brought with it the &quot;Honour of Huntingdon&quot;, a lordship scattered through the shires of Northampton, Huntingdon, and Bedford. Within a few years, Matilda bore him two sons: Malcolm, who died young, and Henry, whom David named after his patron.

The new territories which David controlled were a valuable supplement to his income and manpower, increasing his status as one of the most powerful magnates in the Kingdom of the English. Moreover, Matilda&#x27;s father Waltheof had been Earl of Northumberland, a defunct lordship which had covered the far north of England and included Cumberland and Westmorland, Northumberland-proper, as well as overlordship of the bishopric of Durham. After King Henry&#x27;s death, David revived the claim to this earldom for his son, Henry.

David&#x27;s activities and whereabouts after 1114 are not always easy to trace. He spent much of his time outside his principality, in England and Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.

== Political and military events in Scotland during David&#x27;s kingship ==
In spite of the fact that David spent his childhood in Scotland, Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray him as having little initial connection with the culture and society of the Scots; but both likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David&#x27;s claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. He was the youngest of eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons, William fitz Duncan, son of King Duncan II, and MÃ¡el Coluim, son of the last King Alexander, but since Scots had never adopted the rules of primogeniture that was not a barrier to his kingship, and unlike David, neither William nor MÃ¡el Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as king or face war with both David and Henry.

=== Coronation and struggle for the kingdom ===
Alexander&#x27;s son, MÃ¡el Coluim, chose war. Orderic Vitalis reported that MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair &quot;affected to snatch the kingdom from [David], and fought against him two sufficiently fierce battles; but David, who was loftier in understanding and in power and wealth, conquered him and his followers&quot;. MÃ¡el Coluim escaped unharmed into areas of Scotland not yet under David&#x27;s control, and in those areas gained shelter and aid.

In either April or May of the same year, David was crowned King of Scotland (; Medieval Latin: ) at Scone. If later Scottish and Irish evidence can be taken as evidence, the ceremony of coronation was a series of elaborate traditional rituals, of the kind infamous in the Anglo-French world of the 12th century for their &quot;unchristian&quot; elements.

Aelred of Rievaulx, friend and one-time member of David&#x27;s court, reported that David &quot;so abhorred those acts of homage which are offered by the Scottish nation in the manner of their fathers upon the recent promotion of their kings, that he was with difficulty compelled by the bishops to receive them&quot;.

Outside his Cumbrian principality and the southern fringe of Scotland-proper, David exercised little power in the 1120s, and in the words of Richard Oram, was &quot;king of Scots in little more than name&quot;. He was probably in that part of Scotland he did rule for most of the time between late 1127 and 1130. However, he was at the court of Henry in 1126 and in early 1127, and returned to Henry&#x27;s court in 1130, serving as a judge at Woodstock for the treason trial of Geoffrey de Clinton. It was in this year that David&#x27;s wife, Matilda of Huntingdon, died. Possibly as a result of this, and while David was still in southern England,

Scotland-proper rose up in arms against him. The instigator was, again, his nephew MÃ¡el Coluim, who now had the support of Ãengus of Moray. King Ãengus was David&#x27;s most powerful vassal, a man who, as grandson of King Lulach of Scotland, even had his own claim to the kingdom. The rebel Scots had advanced into Angus, where they were met by David&#x27;s Mercian constable, Edward; a battle took place at Stracathro near Brechin. According to the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, 1000 of Edward&#x27;s army, and 4000 of Ãengus&#x27; army â including Ãengus himself â died.

According to Orderic Vitalis, Edward followed up the killing of Ãengus by marching north into Moray itself, which, in Orderic&#x27;s words, &quot;lacked a defender and lord&quot;; and so Edward, &quot;with God&#x27;s help obtained the entire duchy of that extensive district&quot;. However, this was far from the end of it. MÃ¡el Coluim escaped, and four years of continuing civil war followed; for David, this period was quite simply a &quot;struggle for survival&quot;.

It appears that David asked for and obtained extensive military aid from King Henry. Aelred of Rievaulx related that at this point a large fleet and a large army of Norman knights, including Walter Espec, were sent by Henry to Carlisle in order to assist David&#x27;s attempt to root out his Scottish enemies. The fleet seems to have been used in the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde and the entire Argyll coast, where MÃ¡el Coluim was probably at large among supporters. In 1134, MÃ¡el Coluim was captured and imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle. Since modern historians no longer confuse him with &quot;Malcolm MacHeth&quot;, it is clear that nothing more is ever heard of MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair, except perhaps that his sons were later allied with Somerled.

=== Pacification of the west and north ===
Richard Oram puts forward the suggestion that it was during this period that David granted Walter fitz Alan Strathgryfe, with northern Kyle and the area around Renfrew, forming what would become the &quot;Stewart&quot; lordship of Strathgryfe; he also suggests that Hugh de Morville may have gained Cunningham and the settlement of &quot;Strathyrewen&quot; (i.e. Irvine). This would indicate that the 1130â1134 campaign had resulted in the acquisition of these territories.

How long it took to pacify Moray is not known, but in this period David appointed his nephew William fitz Duncan to succeed Ãengus, perhaps in compensation for the exclusion from the succession to the Scottish throne caused by the coming of age of David&#x27;s son Henry. William may have been given the daughter of Ãengus in marriage, cementing his authority in the region. The burghs of Elgin and Forres may have been founded at this point, consolidating royal authority in Moray. David also founded Urquhart Priory, possibly as a &quot;victory monastery&quot;, and assigned to it a percentage of his &quot;cain&quot; (tribute) from Argyll.

During this period too, a marriage was arranged between the son of Matad, Mormaer of Atholl, and the daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the kingdom and held out the prospect that a son of one of David&#x27;s mormaers could gain Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry I died on 1 December 1135, David had more of Scotland under his control than ever before.

=== Dominating the north ===
While fighting King Stephen and attempting to dominate northern England in the years following 1136, David was continuing his drive for control of the far north of Scotland. In 1139, his cousin, the five-year-old Harald Maddadsson, was given the title of &quot;Earl&quot; and half the lands of the earldom of Orkney, in addition to Scottish Caithness. Throughout the 1140s, Caithness and Sutherland were brought back under the Scottish zone of control. Sometime before 1146, David appointed a native Scot called AindrÃ©as to be the first Bishop of Caithness, a bishopric which was based at Halkirk, near Thurso, in an area which was ethnically Scandinavian.

In 1150, it looked like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney were going to come under permanent Scottish control. However, David&#x27;s plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald&#x27;s rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David&#x27;s grant. David&#x27;s weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.

== England ==

David&#x27;s relationship with England and the English crown in these years is usually interpreted in two ways. Firstly, his actions are understood in relation to his connections with the King of England. No historian is likely to deny that David&#x27;s early career was largely manufactured by King Henry I of England. David was the latter&#x27;s brother-in-law and &quot;greatest protÃ©gÃ©&quot;, one of Henry&#x27;s &quot;new men&quot;. His hostility to Stephen can be interpreted as an effort to uphold the intended inheritance of Henry I, the succession of his daughter and David&#x27;s niece Empress Matilda. David carried out his wars in her name, joined her when she arrived in England, and later knighted her son Henry.

However, David&#x27;s policy towards England can be interpreted in an additional way. David was the independence-loving king trying to build a &quot;Scoto-Northumbrian&quot; realm by seizing the most northerly parts of the English kingdom. In this perspective, David&#x27;s support for Matilda is used as a pretext for land-grabbing. David&#x27;s maternal descent from the House of Wessex and his son Henry&#x27;s maternal descent from the English earls of Northumberland is thought to have further encouraged such a project, a project which came to an end only after Henry II ordered David&#x27;s child successor MÃ¡el Coluim IV to hand over the most important of David&#x27;s gains. It is clear that neither one of these interpretations can be taken without some weight being given to the other.

=== Usurpation of Stephen and First Treaty of Durham ===
Henry I had arranged his inheritance to pass to his daughter Empress Matilda. Instead, Stephen, younger brother of Theobald II, Count of Blois, seized the throne. David had been the first layperson to take the oath to uphold the succession of Matilda in 1127, and when Stephen was crowned on 22 December 1135, David decided to make war.

Before December was over, David marched into northern England, and by the end of January, he had occupied the castles of Carlisle, Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle. By February David was at Durham, but an army led by King Stephen met him there. Rather than fight a pitched battle, a treaty was agreed whereby David would retain Carlisle, while David&#x27;s son Henry was re-granted the title and half the lands of the earldom of Huntingdon, territory which had been confiscated during David&#x27;s revolt. On Stephen&#x27;s side, he received back the other castles; and while David would do no homage, Stephen was to receive the homage of Henry for both Carlisle and the other English territories. Stephen also gave the rather worthless but for David face-saving promise that if he ever chose to resurrect the defunct earldom of Northumberland, Henry would be given first consideration. Importantly, the issue of Matilda was not mentioned. However, the first Durham treaty quickly broke down after David took insult at the treatment of his son Henry at Stephen&#x27;s court.

=== Renewal of war and Clitheroe ===
When the winter of 1136â1137 was over, David prepared again to invade England. The king of the Scots massed an army on Northumberland&#x27;s border, to which the English responded by gathering an army at Newcastle. Once more pitched battle was avoided, and instead, a truce was agreed until December. When December fell, David demanded that Stephen hand over the whole of the old earldom of Northumberland. Stephen&#x27;s refusal led to David&#x27;s third invasion, this time in January 1138.

The army which invaded England in January and February 1138 shocked the English chroniclers. Richard of Hexham called it &quot;an execrable army, savager than any race of heathen yielding honour to neither God nor man&quot; and that it &quot;harried the whole province and slaughtered everywhere folk of either sex, of every age and condition, destroying, pillaging and burning the vills, churches and houses&quot;. Several doubtful stories of cannibalism were recorded by chroniclers, and these same chroniclers paint a picture of routine enslavings, as well as killings of churchmen, women and infants.

By February King Stephen marched north to deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road south. In the summer David split his army into two forces, sending William fitz Duncan to march into Lancashire, where he harried Furness and Craven. On 10 June, William fitz Duncan met a force of knights and men-at-arms. A pitched battle took place, the battle of Clitheroe, and the English army was routed.

=== Battle of the Standard and Second Treaty of Durham ===
By later July 1138, the two Scottish armies had reunited in &quot;St Cuthbert&#x27;s land&quot;, that is, in the lands controlled by the Bishop of Durham, on the far side of the river Tyne. Another English army had mustered to meet the Scots, this time led by William, Earl of Aumale. The victory at Clitheroe was probably what inspired David to risk battle. David&#x27;s force, apparently 26,000 strong and several times larger than the English army, met the English on 22 August at Cowdon Moor near Northallerton, North Yorkshire.

The Battle of the Standard, as the encounter came to be called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although the result was a defeat, it was not by any means decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.

On 26 September Cardinal Alberic, Bishop of Ostia, arrived at Carlisle where David had called together his kingdom&#x27;s nobles, abbots and bishops. Alberic was there to investigate the controversy over the issue of the Bishop of Glasgow&#x27;s allegiance or non-allegiance to the Archbishop of York. Alberic played the role of peace broker, and David agreed to a six-week truce which excluded the siege of Wark. On 9 April, David and Stephen&#x27;s wife Matilda of Boulogne (daughter of Mary of Scotland, and so another niece of David) met each other at Durham and agreed a settlement. David&#x27;s son Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland and was restored to the earldom of Huntingdon and lordship of Doncaster; David himself was allowed to keep Carlisle and Cumberland. King Stephen was to retain possession of the strategically vital castles of Bamburgh and Newcastle. This effectively fulfilled all of David&#x27;s war aims.

=== Arrival of Matilda and the renewal of conflict ===
The settlement with Stephen was not set to last long. The arrival in England of Empress Matilda gave David an opportunity to renew the conflict with Stephen. In either May or June, David travelled to the south of England and entered Matilda&#x27;s company; he was present for her expected coronation at Westminster Abbey, though this never took place. David was there until September when the Empress found herself surrounded at Winchester.

This civil war, or &quot;the Anarchy&quot; as it was later called, enabled David to strengthen his own position in northern England. While David consolidated his hold on his own and his son&#x27;s newly acquired lands, he also sought to expand his influence. The castles at Newcastle and Bamburgh were again brought under his control, and he attained dominion over all of England north-west of the river Ribble and Pennines while holding the north-east as far south as the river Tyne, on the borders of the core territory of the bishopric of Durham. While his son brought all the senior barons of Northumberland into his entourage, David rebuilt the fortress of Carlisle. Carlisle quickly replaced Roxburgh as his favoured residence. David&#x27;s acquisition of the mines at Alston on the South Tyne enabled him to begin minting the Kingdom of Scotland&#x27;s first silver coinage. David, meanwhile, issued charters to Shrewsbury Abbey in respect to their lands in Lancashire.

=== Bishopric of Durham and the Archbishopric of York ===
However, David&#x27;s successes were in many ways balanced by his failures. David&#x27;s greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the Bishopric of Durham and the Archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant since the death of Bishop Geoffrey Rufus in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the &quot;de facto&quot; bishop, and had control of the bishop&#x27;s castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David&#x27;s only hope of ensuring his election and consecration was gaining the support of the papal legate, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and had given up by the time William of St. Barbara was elected to the see in 1143.

David also attempted to interfere in the succession to the archbishopric of York. William FitzHerbert, nephew of King Stephen, found his position undermined by the collapsing political fortune of Stephen in the north of England and was deposed by the Pope. David used his Cistercian connections to build a bond with Henry Murdac, the new archbishop. Despite the support of Pope Eugene III, supporters of King Stephen and William FitzHerbert managed to prevent Henry taking up his post at York. In 1149, Henry sought the support of David. David seized on the opportunity to bring the archdiocese under his control and marched on the city. However, Stephen&#x27;s supporters became aware of David&#x27;s intentions and informed King Stephen. Stephen therefore marched to the city and installed a new garrison. David decided not to risk such an engagement and withdrew. Richard Oram has conjectured that David&#x27;s ultimate aim was to bring the whole of the ancient Kingdom of Northumbria into his dominion. For Oram, this event was the turning point, &quot;the chance to radically redraw the political map of the British Isles [had been] lost forever&quot;.

== Scottish Church ==

Historical treatment of David I and the Scottish church usually acknowledges David&#x27;s role as the defender of the Scottish church&#x27;s independence from claims of overlordship by the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

=== Innovations in the church system ===
It was once held that Scotland&#x27;s episcopal sees and entire parochial system owed its origins to the innovations of David I. Today, scholars have moderated this view. Aelred of Rievaulx wrote in David&#x27;s eulogy that when David came to power, &quot;he found three or four bishops in the whole Scottish kingdom [north of the Forth], and the others wavering without a pastor to the loss of both morals and property; when he died, he left nine, both of ancient bishoprics which he himself restored and new ones which he erected&quot;. Although David moved the bishopric of Mortlach east to Old Aberdeen, and arranged the creation of the diocese of Caithness, no other bishoprics can be safely called David&#x27;s creation.

The bishopric of Glasgow was restored rather than resurrected. David appointed his reform-minded French chaplain John Capellanus to the bishopric and carried out an inquest, afterwards assigning to the bishopric all the lands of his principality, except those in the east which were already governed by the Bishop of St Andrews. David was at least partly responsible for forcing semi-monastic &quot;bishoprics&quot; like Brechin, Dunkeld, Mortlach (Aberdeen) and Dunblane to become fully episcopal and firmly integrated into a national diocesan system.

As for the development of the parochial system, David&#x27;s traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David&#x27;s Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.

=== Ecclesiastical disputes ===
One of the first problems David had to deal with as king was an ecclesiastical dispute with the English Church. The problem with the English Church concerned the subordination of Scottish sees to the archbishops of York and/or Canterbury, an issue which since his election in 1124 had prevented Robert of Scone from being consecrated to the see of St Andrews (Cenn RÃ­ghmonaidh). Since the 11th century, the bishopric of St Andrews likely functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; archbishopric. The title of &quot;Archbishop&quot; is accorded in Scottish and Irish sources to Bishop Giric and Bishop Fothad II.

The problem was that this archepiscopal status had not been cleared with the papacy, opening the way for English archbishops to claim the overlordship of the whole Scottish church. The man responsible was the new aggressively assertive Archbishop of York, Thurstan. His easiest target was the bishopric of Glasgow, which being south of the river Forth was not regarded as part of Scotland nor the jurisdiction of St Andrews. In 1125, Pope Honorius II wrote to John, Bishop of Glasgow ordering him to submit to the archbishopric of York. David ordered Bishop John of Glasgow to travel to the Apostolic See in order to secure a pallium which would elevate the bishopric of St Andrews to an archbishopric with jurisdiction over Glasgow.

Thurstan travelled to Rome, as did the Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, and both presumably opposed David&#x27;s request. David however gained the support of King Henry, and the Archbishop of York agreed to a year&#x27;s postponement of the issue and to consecrate Robert of Scone without making an issue of subordination. York&#x27;s claim over bishops north of the Forth was in practice abandoned for the rest of David&#x27;s reign, although York maintained her more credible claims over Glasgow.

In 1151, David again requested a pallium for the Archbishop of St Andrews. Cardinal John Paparo met David at his residence in Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, the Cardinal was on his way to Ireland with four &quot;pallia&quot; to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When the Cardinal returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David&#x27;s plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David&#x27;s Scottish territory, as well as bishopric of Orkney and the bishopric of the Isles. Unfortunately for David, the Cardinal does not appear to have brought the issue up with the papacy. In the following year, the papacy dealt David another blow by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.

== Succession and death ==
Perhaps the greatest blow to David&#x27;s plans came on 12 July 1152 when Henry, Earl of Northumberland, David&#x27;s heir, died. He had probably been suffering from some kind of illness for a long time. David had under a year to live, and he may have known that he was not going to be alive much longer. David quickly arranged for his grandson Malcolm IV to be made his successor, and for his younger grandson William to be made Earl of Northumberland. Donnchad I, Mormaer of Fife, the senior magnate in Scotland-proper, was appointed as &quot;rector&quot;, or regent, and took the 11-year-old Malcolm around Scotland-proper on a tour to meet and gain the homage of his future Gaelic subjects. David&#x27;s health began to fail seriously in the spring of 1153, and on 24 May 1153, David died in Carlisle Castle. In his obituary in the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;, he is called &quot;DabÃ­d mac Mail Colaim, rÃ­ Alban &amp; Saxan&quot;, &quot;David, son of Malcolm, King of Scotland and England&quot;, a title which acknowledged the importance of the new English part of David&#x27;s realm. He was buried before the high altar Dunfermline Abbey in early June.

== Veneration ==
David I is recognised as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 24 May, though it appears that he was never formally canonised. There are churches in Scotland which have him as their patron. His mother Saint Margaret of Scotland was canonised in 1249.

== Historiography ==
=== Medieval reputation ===
The earliest English assessments of David portray him as a pious king, a reformer and a civilising agent in a barbarian nation. For William of Newburgh, David was a &quot;King not barbarous of a barbarous nation&quot;, who &quot;wisely tempered the fierceness of his barbarous nation&quot;. William praises David for his piety, noting that, among other saintly activities, &quot;he was frequent in washing the feet of the poor&quot; (this can be read literally: his mother, who is now patron saint of Scotland, was widely known and lauded for the same practice). Another of David&#x27;s eulogists, his former courtier Aelred of Rievaulx, echoes Newburgh&#x27;s assertions and praises David for his justice as well as his piety, commenting that David&#x27;s rule of the Scots meant that &quot;the whole barbarity of that nation was softened ... as if forgetting their natural fierceness they submitted their necks to the laws which the royal gentleness dictated&quot;.

Although avoiding stress on 12th-century Scottish &quot;barbarity&quot;, the Lowland Scottish historians of the Late Middle Ages tend to repeat the accounts of earlier chronicle tradition. Much that was written was either directly transcribed from the earlier medieval chronicles themselves or was modelled closely upon them, even in the significant works of John of Fordun, Andrew Wyntoun and Walter Bower. For example, Bower includes in his text the eulogy written for David by Aelred of Rievaulx. This quotation extends to over twenty pages in the modern edition and exerted a great deal of influence over what became the traditional view of David in later works about Scottish history. Historical treatment of David developed in the writings of later Scottish historians, and the writings of men like John Mair, George Buchanan, Hector Boece, and Bishop John Leslie ensured that by the 18th century, a picture of David as a pious, justice-loving state-builder and vigorous maintainer of Scottish independence had emerged.

Moreover, Bower stated in his eulogy that David always had the ambition to join a crusade, which was prevented eventually by his death. In addition, Aelred of Rievaulx hinted that David expressed his desire to be part of the Second Crusade himself, but he was dissuaded by his subjects. However, David had already met Hugues de Payens, the first Grand Master of the Knights Templar, in 1128 in Scotland. In the meantime, the Order established a seat at Balantrodoch, now Temple, Midlothian on the South Esk (River Esk, Lothian).

=== Modern treatment ===
In the modern period, there has been more of an emphasis on David&#x27;s state-building and the effects of his changes on Scottish cultural development. Lowland Scots tended to trace the origins of their culture to the marriage of David&#x27;s father MÃ¡el Coluim III to Saint Margaret of Scotland, a myth which had its origins in the medieval period. With the development of modern historical techniques in the mid-19th century, responsibility for these developments appeared to lie more with David than his father. David assumed a principal place in the alleged destruction of the Celtic Kingdom of Scotland, Andrew Lang, in 1900, wrote that &quot;with Alexander [I], Celtic domination ends; with David, Norman and English dominance is established&quot;.

The ages of Enlightenment and Romanticism had elevated the role of races and &quot;ethnic packages&quot; into mainstream history, and in this context David was portrayed as hostile to the native Scots, and his reforms were seen in the light of natural, perhaps even justified, civilised Teutonic aggression towards the backward Celts.

In the 20th century, several studies were devoted to Normanisation in 12th century Scotland, focusing upon and thereby emphasising the changes brought about by the reign of David I. GrÃ¦me Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;The Normans in Scotland&quot; (1954), Archie Duncan&#x27;s &quot;Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom&quot; (1974) and the many articles of G. W. S. Barrow all formed part of this historiographical trend.

In the 1980s, Barrow sought a compromise between change and continuity, and argued that the reign of King David was, in fact, a &quot;Balance of New and Old&quot;. Such a conclusion was a natural incorporation of an underlying current in Scottish historiography which, since William F. Skene&#x27;s monumental and revolutionary three-volume &quot;Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban&quot; (1876â1880), had been forced to acknowledge that &quot;Celtic Scotland&quot; was alive and healthy for a long time after the reign of David I. Michael Lynch followed and built upon Barrow&#x27;s compromise solution, arguing that as David&#x27;s reign progressed, his kingship became more Celtic. Despite its subtitle, in 2004 in the only full-volume study of David I&#x27;s reign yet produced, &quot;David I: The King Who Made Scotland&quot;, its author Richard Oram further builds upon Lynch&#x27;s picture, stressing continuity while placing the changes of David&#x27;s reign in their context.

== Davidian Revolution ==

However, while there may be debate about the importance or extent of the historical change in David I&#x27;s era, no historian doubts that it was taking place. The reason is what Barrow and Lynch both call the &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot;. David&#x27;s &quot;revolution&quot; is held to underpin the development of later medieval Scotland, whereby the changes he inaugurated grew into most of the central institutions of the later medieval kingdom.

Since Robert Bartlett&#x27;s pioneering work, &quot;The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change, 950â1350&quot; (1993), reinforced by Moore&#x27;s &quot;The First European Revolution, c. 970â1215&quot; (2000), it has become increasingly apparent that better understanding of David&#x27;s &quot;revolution&quot; can be achieved by recognising the wider &quot;European revolution&quot; taking place during this period. The central idea is that from the late 10th century onwards the culture and institutions of the old Carolingian heartlands in northern France and western Germany were spreading to outlying areas, creating a more recognisable &quot;Europe&quot;. Scotland was just one of many &quot;outlying&quot; areas.

=== Government and feudalism ===
The widespread enfeoffment of foreign knights and the processes by which land ownership was converted from customary tenures into feudal, or otherwise legally-defined relationships, would revolutionise the way the Kingdom of Scotland was governed, as did the dispersal and installation of royal agents in the new mottes that were proliferating throughout the realm to staff newly created sheriffdoms and judiciaries for the twin purposes of law enforcement and taxation, bringing Scotland further into the &quot;continental&quot; model.

Scotland in this period experienced innovations in governmental practices and the importation of foreign, mostly French, knights. It is to David&#x27;s reign that the beginnings of feudalism are generally assigned. This is defined as &quot;castle-building, the regular use of professional cavalry, the knight&#x27;s fee&quot; as well as &quot;homage and fealty&quot;. David established large-scale feudal lordships in the west of his Cumbrian principality for the leading members of the French military entourage who kept him in power. Additionally, many smaller-scale feudal lordships were created.

Steps were taken during David&#x27;s reign to make the government of that part of Scotland he administered more like the government of Anglo-Norman England. New sheriffdoms enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During his reign, royal sheriffs were established in the king&#x27;s core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at Roxburgh, Scone, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Stirling and Perth. The Justiciarship too was created in David&#x27;s reign. Although this institution had Anglo-Norman origins, in Scotland north of the Forth at least, it represented some form of continuity with an older office.

=== Economy ===
The revenue of his English earldom and the proceeds of the silver mines at Alston allowed David to produce Scotland&#x27;s first coinage. These altered the nature of trade and transformed his political image.

David was a great town builder. As Prince of the Cumbrians, David founded the first two burghs of &quot;Scotland&quot;, at Roxburgh and Berwick. Burghs were settlements with defined boundaries and guaranteed trading rights, locations where the king could collect and sell the products of his &quot;cain&quot; and &quot;conveth&quot; (a payment made &quot;in lieu&quot; of providing the king hospitality). David founded around 15 burghs.

Perhaps nothing in David&#x27;s reign compares in importance to burghs. While they could not, at first, have amounted to much more than the nucleus of an immigrant merchant class, nothing would do more to reshape the long-term economic and ethnic shape of Scotland than the burgh. These planned towns were or dominated by English in culture and language; William of Newburgh wrote in the reign of William the Lion, that &quot;the towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English&quot;; as well as transforming the economy, the dominance of an English influence would in the long term undermine the position of the Middle Irish language, giving birth to the idea of the Scottish Lowlands.

=== Monastic patronage ===
David was one of medieval Scotland&#x27;s greatest monastic patrons. In 1113, in perhaps David&#x27;s first act as Prince of the Cumbrians, he founded Selkirk Abbey for the Tironensians. David founded more than a dozen new monasteries in his reign, patronising various new monastic orders.

Not only were such monasteries an expression of David&#x27;s undoubted piety, they also functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence and provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown&#x27;s growing administrative needs. These new monasteries, the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. Cistercian labour, for instance, transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe&#x27;s most important sources of sheep wool.

<doc id="147980" wikidata="Q366745" url="?curid=147980" title="Duncan II of Scotland">
<text>Donnchad mac MÃ¡el Coluim (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Donnchadh mac Mhaoil Chaluim&quot;; anglicised as Duncan II; c. 1060 â 12 November 1094) was King of Alba. He was son of Malcolm III (MÃ¡el Coluim mac Donnchada) and his first wife Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, earl of Orkney.

== Early life ==
The identity of Duncan&#x27;s mother is given by the Orkneyinga saga, which records the marriage of Malcolm and Ingibiorg, and then mentions &quot;their son was Duncan, King of Scots, father of William&quot;. Duncan II got his name from that of his grandfather, Duncan I of Scotland. However, Ingibiorg is never mentioned by primary sources written by Scottish and English chroniclers. She might have been a concubine or have a marriage not recognized by the Church. William of Malmesbury calls Duncan an illegitimate son of Malcolm III. This account influenced a number of Medieval commentators, who also dismissed Duncan as an illegitimate son. However, this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm&#x27;s descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan&#x27;s descendants, the Meic Uilleim.

Duncan was given into the keeping of William the Conqueror in 1072 as a hostage. The Annals of Ulster note that the &quot;French went into Scotland and brought away the son of the king of Scotland as hostage&quot; (by French, the text is referring to the Normans). The context of this event was the initial conflict between Malcolm III and William. Edgar Ãtheling, the last remaining male member of the English royal family, had fled to Scotland in 1068, seeking protection from the invading Normans. Edgar sought Malcolm&#x27;s assistance in his struggle against William. The relationship was reinforced when Malcolm married Ãtheling&#x27;s sister, Margaret, in 1071. The Norman conquest of England also involved William securing control over the areas of Northumbria. Malcolm probably perceived this move as a threat to his own areas of Cumbria and Lothian. In 1070, possibly claiming he was redressing the wrongs against his brother-in-law, Malcolm responded with a &quot;savage raid&quot; of Northern England.

The formal link between the royal house of Scotland and Wessex and Malcolm&#x27;s forays in northern England were an obvious threat to William who counter-attacked with a full-scale invasion of southern Scotland in 1072. Malcolm met William in Abernethy. In the resulting Treaty of Abernethy, Malcolm submitted to William for Malcolm&#x27;s lands in England (Cambria and Northumbria) but not for Scotland. Though the facts are not clear, one of the conditions of the agreement may have been that Edgar Ãtheling leave the Scottish court. The offering of Duncan, Malcolm&#x27;s eldest son, as hostage was probably another term of the treaty.

Duncan was raised in the Anglo-Norman court of William I, becoming familiar with the culture, education, and institutions of his hosts. He was trained as a Norman knight and participated in William&#x27;s campaigns. In 1087, William died, and his eldest surviving son Robert Curthose succeeded him as Duke of Normandy. According to Florence of Worcester, Robert released Duncan from custody and had him officially knighted. Duncan was allowed to leave the Duchy of Normandy. He chose to join the court of William II of England, younger brother to Robert. His father, who by then had many sons, appears to have made no effort to obtain Duncan&#x27;s return. Edward, the eldest paternal half-brother of Duncan, had been designated as heir in his absence. Duncan notably chose to stay with his adoptive culture, partly due to the influence of 15 years of Norman life and partly in pursuit of personal wealth and glory, though he may always have had in mind that one day he would become Scotland&#x27;s king, like his father and grandfather.

In 1092, hostilities between Malcolm III and William II were ongoing. William managed to capture Carlisle, a major settlement of Cumbria. In 1093, William started the construction of Carlisle Castle. Malcolm reacted by leading his last raid into Northumberland. While marching north again, Malcolm was ambushed by Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, whose lands he had devastated, near Alnwick on 13 November 1093. There he was killed by Arkil Morel, steward of Bamburgh Castle, at the Battle of Alnwick. Edward was mortally wounded in the same fight. Malcolm&#x27;s queen Margaret died days after receiving the news of their deaths from her son Edgar. The resulting power vacuum allowed Donald III of Scotland (Domnall BÃ¡n mac Donnchada), younger brother of Malcolm, to seize the throne. The new monarch represented the interests of &quot;a resentful native aristocracy&quot;, driving out the Anglo-Saxons and Normans who had come to the court of Malcolm and Margaret. The event allowed Duncan to lay claim to the throne, attempting to depose his uncle. He had the support of William II, in exchange for an oath of fealty to his patron.

== Marriage ==
Duncan married Ethelreda of Northumbria, daughter of Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The marriage is recorded in the &quot;Cronicon CumbriÃ¦&quot;. They had a single known son, William fitz Duncan.

== Reign and death ==
Donald III had been unable to gain the support of certain landowners and church officials of the Scottish Lowlands, who had ties to the regime of his predecessor. Duncan took advantage, negotiating alliances with these disgruntled supporters of his father&#x27;s and gaining essential military and financial support for his cause. While William II himself had no intention to join in the campaign, he lent part of the Norman army to the new &quot;warrior-prince&quot;. Duncan was able to recruit further levies from local barons and towns of England. He bought support with promises of land and privilege, estates and titles.

By 1094, Duncan was leading a sizeable army, consisting of mercenary knights and infantry. Many of these soldiers probably came from Northumbria, reflecting the familial association of Duncan to Gospatrick. In the early summer, Duncan led his army in an invasion of Scotland. Donald mobilized his own supporters and troops in response. The early phase of the war took place in June, resulting in victory for Duncan. Donald was forced to retreat towards the Scottish Highlands. Duncan was crowned king at Scone, but his support and authority probably did not extend north of the River Forth. His continued power was reliant on the presence of his Anglo-Norman allies.

The continued presence of a foreign occupation army was naturally resented by much of the local population. Duncan himself had spent most of his life abroad, making him an outsider. Months into his reign, landowners and prelates rose against the Normans. The occupation army fared poorly against a series of ongoing raids. Duncan was only able to maintain the throne by negotiating with the rebels. He agreed to their terms, sending most of his foreign supporters back to William.

Sending away his support troops soon backfired. The Lowlands rebels seem to have ceased their activities, but Donald had spent the intervening months rebuilding his army and political support. In November 1094, Donald led his army to the Lowlands and confronted his nephew. On 12 November, Duncan was ambushed and killed in battle, having reigned for less than seven months. Primary sources are unclear about the exact manner of his death. The Annals of Inisfallen report that &quot;Donnchadh [Duncan] son of Mael Coluim [Malcolm], king of Alba, was slain by Domnall [Donald], son of Donnchadh [Duncan]. That same Domnall, moreover, afterwards took the kingship of Alba.&quot; The Annals of Ulster report that &quot;Donnchad son of Mael Coluim, king of Scotland, was treacherously killed by his own brothers Domnall and Edmond&quot;. As Duncan had no brothers by those names, the text probably points to his uncle Donald and half-brother Edmund, though later texts identify a noble by the name of MÃ¡el Petair of Mearns (Malpeder) as the actual murderer.

William of Malmesbury later reported that Duncan was &quot;murdered by the wickedness of his uncle Donald&quot;. Florence of Worcester reported that Duncan was killed, but never states who killed him. In &quot;Chronicle of the Picts and Scots&quot; (1867), there is a 13th century entry recording that Duncan was killed by MÃ¡el Petair (Malpeder), through the treachery of Donald. John of Fordun (14th century) finally recorded the better known account of the event, that Duncan was &quot;slain at Monthechin by the Earl of Mernys ... through the wiles of his uncle Donald&quot;.

There are two contradictory accounts about the burial place of Duncan II. One reports him buried at Dunfermline Abbey, the other at the isle of Iona.

== Interpretation ==
William Forbes Skene viewed the conflict between Donald III and Duncan II as being essentially a conflict between &quot;the Celtic and the Saxon laws of succession&quot;. In other words, it was a conflict between tanistry and hereditary monarchy, Donald being the legitimate heir under the former, Duncan and his brothers under the latter. Donald probably derived his support from the Gaels of Scotland, who formed the majority of the population. His supporters would have had reason to feel threatened by the large number of Anglo-Saxons who had arrived in Scotland under the reign of Malcolm III. The descendants of Malcolm were Anglo-Saxons &quot;in all respects, except that of birth&quot;. Their claim to power would be alarming at best to the Gaels.

Skene considered that two foreign rulers played their own part in the conflict. Magnus III of Norway and his fleet were campaigning at the Irish Sea, attempting to establish his authority over the Kingdom of the Isles. The lack of conflict between Donald III and Magnus III might point to an alliance between them â Magnus offering recognition of Donald&#x27;s rights to the throne, while Donald would withdraw all Scottish claims to the area. Duncan himself was obviously supported by William II of England, who lent him &quot;a numerous army of English and Normans&quot;.

The brief reign of Duncan II, culminating with his death at the hands of his own subjects, attests to his unpopularity. He was a usurper in the eyes of the Gaels. His half-brother Edgar, King of Scotland, only managed to gain the throne due to the intervention of William II, his claims again opposed by most of the Gaels. The effects of Edgar&#x27;s victory were significant, as Anglo-Saxon laws, institutions, and forms of government were adopted in the Kingdom of Scotland. All were &quot;in imitation of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms&quot;, before David I (reigned 1124â1153) introduced Anglo-Norman institutions to the country.

&quot;The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707&quot; includes a history of the Kingship by Benjamin Hudson. Hudson feels that Duncan II doomed his own reign by the &quot;fatal move&quot; of sending away his foreign troops, thus divesting himself of his own supporters. He feels that the male-line descendants of Malcolm III and Saint Margaret managed to hold onto the throne until the 13th century precisely because none of them made the same mistake. He points out that Edgar succeeded in holding the throne for a decade because he continued to depend on aid from his political patrons, William II and Henry I of England, who had resources far surpassing those of Donald III and his supporters.

== Legacy ==

Duncan&#x27;s son by Ethelreda, William fitz Duncan, was a prominent figure during the reigns of Duncan&#x27;s half-brothers Alexander and David. William seems to have served as an acknowledged heir to them for part of their reigns. His descendants the Meic Uilleim led various revolts against later Scottish kings. The last remaining Meic Uilleim, an infant daughter of Gille Escoib or one of his sons, was put to death in 1229 or 1230: &quot;[T]he same Mac-William&#x27;s daughter, who had not long left her mother&#x27;s womb, innocent as she was, was put to death, in the burgh of Forfar, in view of the market place, after a proclamation by the public crier. Her head was struck against the column of the market cross, and her brains dashed out&quot;.

The sole surviving charter of Duncan II granted Tynninghame and its surrounding area to the monks of Durham. Among the witnesses of the charter was someone called &quot;Uuiget&quot;. The name is probably a rendering of the Old English &quot;Wulfgeat&quot;, which was also rendered as &quot;Uviet&quot; in the Domesday Book. The name seems to have been popular in the Midlands and Southern England. There was at least one notable landowner of that name in the 11th century Yorkshire.

G. W. S. Barrow argues that this &quot;Uuiget&quot; is actually Uviet the White, lord of Treverlen (modern Duddingston). Uviet is known for also signing charters of Kings Edgar (reigned 1097â1107), Alexander I (reigned 1107â1124), and David I (reigned 1124â1153). He was closely associated with the royal household for decades, his own descendants forming the landowning dynasties variously known as Uviet(h)s, Eviot(h)s, and Ovioths, with certain lines enduring to the 17th century. Barrows theorises that Uviet the White originally entered Scotland as a companion of Duncan II and that the two shared a similar background, as ambitious knights in the court of William II. His continued support for Duncan&#x27;s half-brothers points to them inheriting whatever circle of supporters Duncan had formed.

== Reputation ==
The history of George Buchanan considers Duncan to have been summoned to Scotland by its people, as Donald had alienated &quot;&quot;all good men who had a veneration for the memory of Malcolm and Margaret&quot; and those nobles refusing to swear allegiance to him. Buchanan assesses Duncan as a distinguished and experienced military man, but &quot;being a military man and not so skilful in the arts of peace&quot;&quot;, he angered his people with his arrogant and imperious manner.

<text>Donnchad mac Crinain (; anglicised as Duncan I, and nicknamed An t-Ilgarach, &quot;the Diseased&quot; or &quot;the Sick&quot;; â 14 August 1040) was king of Scotland (&quot;Alba&quot;) from 1034 to 1040. He is the historical basis of the &quot;King Duncan&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

== Life ==
The ancestry of King Duncan is not certain. In modern texts, he is the son of CrÃ­nÃ¡n, hereditary lay abbot of Dunkeld, and BethÃ³c, daughter of King Malcolm II. However, in the late 17th century the historian Frederic Van Bossen, after collecting historical accounts throughout Europe, identified King Duncan as the first son of Abonarhl ap crinan (the grandson of Crinan) and princess Beatrice, the eldest daughter to King Malcom II, and Gunnor who was the daughter of the &quot;2nd Duke of Normandy&quot;.

Unlike the &quot;King Duncan&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the historical Duncan appears to have been a young man. He followed his grandfather Malcolm as king after the latter&#x27;s death on 25 November 1034, without apparent opposition. He may have been Malcolm&#x27;s acknowledged successor or &quot;TÃ¡naiste&quot; as the succession appears to have been uneventful. Earlier histories, following John of Fordun, supposed that Duncan had been king of Strathclyde in his grandfather&#x27;s lifetime, between 1018 and 1034, ruling the former Kingdom of Strathclyde as an appanage. Modern historians discount this idea, although it is supported by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

An earlier source, a variant of the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; (CK-I), gives Duncan&#x27;s wife the Gaelic name &quot;Suthen&quot;, and John of Fordun suggests that she may have been a relative of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. This differs from the review by Frederic van Bossen who wrote in 1688 that King Duncan was twice married, his first wife being Wonfrida (Unfrida) the daughter of Gigurt (Earl Siward?) the Earl of Northumberland and Huntingtoun and &quot;By them was espoused two sons Malcome and Donald&quot;. Then, after her decease, he married Astrida the daughter of &quot;Sigfrid, the &quot;King of Dublin&quot;.

Whatever his wife&#x27;s name and family connections may have been, Duncan had at least two sons. The eldest, Malcolm III (MÃ¡el Coluim mac Donnchada) was king from 1058 to 1093 after assassinating and usurping Lulach, Macbeth&#x27;s stepson. The second son Donald III (Domnall BÃ¡n, or &quot;Donalbane&quot;) was king afterwards. MÃ¡el Muire, Earl of Atholl is a possible third son of Duncan, although this is uncertain.

The early period of Duncan&#x27;s reign was apparently uneventful, perhaps a consequence of his youth. Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac FindlÃ¡ich) is recorded as having been his &quot;dux&quot;, today rendered as &quot;duke&quot; and meaning nothing more than the rank between prince and marquess, but then still having the Roman meaning of &quot;war leader&quot;. In context â &quot;dukes of Francia&quot; had half a century before replaced the Carolingian kings of the Franks and in England the over-mighty Godwin of Wessex was called a &quot;dux&quot; â this suggests that Macbeth may have been the power behind the throne.

In 1039, Duncan led a large Scots army south to besiege Durham, but the expedition ended in disaster. Duncan survived, but the following year he led an army north into Moray, Macbeth&#x27;s domain, apparently on a punitive expedition against Moray. There he was killed in action, at the battle of Bothnagowan, now Pitgaveny, near Elgin, by the men of Moray led by Macbeth, probably on 14 August 1040. He is thought to have been buried at Elgin before later relocation to the island of Iona.

== Family ==
The 14th century chronicler John of Fordun would write that Duncan&#x27;s wife was a kinswoman of the Anglo-Danish Siward, Earl of Northumbria, who would help restore her son Malcolm to the throne. However, this is seemingly belied by a kings list that gives Malcolm&#x27;s mother the Gaelic name Suthen. Duncan had three sons:
* Malcolm III of Scotland, also known as MÃ¡el Coluim mac Donnchada and Malcolm Canmore, died 1093;
* Donald III of Scotland, also known as Domnall mac Donnchada and Donalbain, died 1099;
* MÃ¡el Muire, Earl of Atholl, also known as Melmare.

== Depictions in fiction ==
Duncan is depicted as an elderly king in the play &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1606) by William Shakespeare. He is killed in his sleep by the protagonist, Macbeth.

In the historical novel &quot;Macbeth the King&quot; (1978) by Nigel Tranter, Duncan is portrayed as a schemer who is fearful of Macbeth as a possible rival for the throne. He tries to assassinate Macbeth by poisoning and then when this fails, attacks his home with an army. In self-defence Macbeth meets him in battle and wounds him, and he dies of bleeding, for he is bad-blooded, or Haemophilia C.

In the animated television series &quot;Gargoyles&quot; he is depicted as a weak and conniving king who assassinates those who he believes threaten his rule. He even tries to assassinate Macbeth, forcing Demona to ally with the Moray nobleman, with Duncan&#x27;s resulting death coming from attempting to strike an enchanted orb of energy that one of the Weird Sisters gave to Macbeth to take Duncan down.

<text>The Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) was formed to develop the U.S. Army&#x27;s first large ballistic missile. The agency was established at Redstone Arsenal on 1 February 1956, and commanded by Major General John B. Medaris with Wernher von Braun as technical director.

== History ==
The Redstone missile was the first major project assigned to ABMA. The Redstone was a direct descendant of the V-2 missile developed by the von Braun team in Germany during World War II. After the Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s Project Vanguard was chosen by the DoD Committee on Special Capabilities, over the ABMA&#x27;s proposal to use a modified Redstone ballistic missile as a satellite launch vehicle, ABMA was ordered to stop work on launchers for satellites and focus, instead, on military missiles.

Von Braun continued work on the design for what became the Jupiter-C rocket. This was a three-stage rocket, designed to test Jupiter missile components which, by &quot;coincidence&quot;, could be used to launch a satellite in the Juno I configuration (that is, with an added fourth stage). In September 1956, a Jupiter-C was launched with a dummy satellite on a suborbital flight. It was generally believed that the ABMA could have put a satellite into orbit at that time, had the U.S. government allowed ABMA to do so. A year later, the Soviets launched Sputnik 1. When the Vanguard rocket failed, a Redstone-based Jupiter-C with an added fourth stage and thus designated as Juno I rocket, launched America&#x27;s first satellite, Explorer 1, on 1 February 1958 (GMT). Redstone was later used as a launch vehicle in Project Mercury. Redstone was also deployed by the U.S. Army as the PGM-11, the first missile to carry a nuclear warhead.

Studies began in 1956 for a replacement for the Redstone missile. Initially called the Redstone-S (S for solid), the name was changed to MGM-31 Pershing and a contract was awarded to The Martin Company, beginning a program that lasted 34 years.

In early 1958, NACA&#x27;s &quot;Stever Committee&quot; included consultation from the ABMA&#x27;s large booster program, headed by Wernher von Braun. Von Braun&#x27;s Group was referred to as the &quot;Working Group on Vehicular Program&quot;.

In March 1958, ABMA was placed under the new U.S. Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) along with Redstone Arsenal, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, White Sands Proving Ground, and the Army Rocket and Guided Missile Agency (ARGMA). General Medaris was placed in command of AOMC and BG John A. Barclay took command of ABMA.

On 1 July 1960, the AOMC space-related missions and most of its employees, facilities, and equipment were transferred to NASA, forming the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Wernher von Braun was named MSFC director.

BG Richard M. Hurst took command of ABMA from May 1960 until December 1961 when both ABMA and ARGMA were abolished and the remnants were folded directly into AOMC. In 1962, AOMC (the part that hadn&#x27;t been transferred to NASA) was restructured into the new U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM).

=== Redstone ===
In the aftermath of World War II, a number of German rocket scientists and engineers were moved to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. Rocketry was at that time considered to be a sort of long-range artillery, and naturally fell to the Army to explore. The group was settled at Fort Bliss, Texas â where they aided General Electric&#x27;s Project Hermes efforts to build and test a variety of V-2-derived designs at the nearby White Sands Proving Ground.

Around the same time, North American Aviation (NAA) won the contract to build a long-range cruise missile that became the SM-64 Navaho. This used ramjet power and needed to be boosted up to operational speed by a rocket. Their Propulsion Division was given two V-2 engines to work with to meet this requirement, along with a wealth of research papers from the original V-2 engine team. The NAA team discovered that a major upgrade to the V-2&#x27;s original Model 39 engine was planned through the use of a new fuel injector design, but the Germans were not able to cure lingering combustion problems. Attacking this task, NAA successfully solved the problems and began using this new injector. This became the XLR-41 Phase III engine, which provided of thrust, one third greater than the Model 39, and was lighter and smaller than the German design.

The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 led to calls for the rapid deployment of new missiles, and the U.S. Army responded by developing a requirement for a ballistic missile with range while carrying a warhead that could be operational as rapidly as possible. The fastest solution was to provide the German team with anything they needed to achieve this goal by adapting the V-2 design. The team, under the leadership of Wernher von Braun, began work on the problem at Fort Bliss. In 1951, they moved to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, home to the Army&#x27;s Ordnance commands. Initially known as the Ordnance Guided Missile Center, then the Guided Missile Development Division (GMDD), in 1956 they finally became the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, or ABMA.

Taking the XLR-41, renamed as the NA-75-110 in U.S. Army use, they wrapped it in the largest airframe it could lift, increasing fuel load and extending the range. The result was essentially a larger version of the V-2. As tensions of the Cold War mounted, the Army changed the requirement to be able to carry smallest nuclear warheads in the inventory â with a warhead weight of , range was reduced to only . Design work was complete in 1952 and on 8 April 1952 it became known as the SSM-G-14 Redstone (Surface-to-Surface Missile, G for ground). The first ABMA-built prototype flew in August 1953, the first production-line model from Chrysler in July 1956, and the Redstone entered service in 1958.

=== Navaho to Jupiter ===
While the PGM-11 Redstone program continued, NAA was receiving a continual stream of orders from the U.S. Air Force to extend the range and payload of their Navaho design. This required a much larger missile, and a much larger booster to launch it. As a result, NAA was continually introducing new versions of their engines. By the mid-1950s, NAA had a version known as the XLR-43 running at thrust, while further reducing weight at the same time. Much of this was due to the introduction of the tubular wall combustion chamber, which was much lighter than the cast-steel designs of the V-2, while also offering much better cooling which allowed the combustion rate, and thus thrust, to be increased.

While the Navajo program dragged on, NAA split the team into three groups, Rocketdyne handled engines, Autonetics developed inertial navigation systems (INS) and the Missile Division retained the Navaho itself. With this breakup of duties, both Rocketdyne and Autonetics were soon asked to provide solutions for other projects. In particular, the Air Force asked Rocketdyne to provide an engine for their SM-65 Atlas which they did by adapting the XLR-43 to run on JP-4 instead of alcohol, becoming the LR89. In addition to the switch to JP-4, the engine did away with the hydrogen peroxide system of the XLR-41 that powered the turbopumps and replaced it with a turbine that ran on the rocket fuel itself, simplifying the overall design.

Von Braun&#x27;s team initially considered making a version of the Redstone using the LR89 and adding a second stage, stretching the range to . But ongoing work on the LR89 suggested that the engine could be further improved, and in 1954, the Army approached Rocketdyne to provide a similar design with a thrust of . Over this period the weight of nuclear warheads was rapidly falling, and by combining this engine with a warhead of they could build a single-stage missile able to reach while being significantly less complicated and easier to handle in the field than a two-stage model. This engine was continually upgraded, ultimately reaching . This last model, known to the Army as the NAA-150-200, became much better known by its Rocketdyne model number, S-3.

=== Initial IRBM battles ===
In January 1955, the Air Force&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) urged the Air Force to develop a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). They felt that it was far less technically risky than the SM-65 Atlas ICBM the Air Force was developing, and would enter service earlier. General Bernard Schriever, leader of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Western Development Division in charge of Atlas development, was opposed to the concept, feeling that it would divert resources from the Atlas efforts.

In February 1955, the United Kingdom expressed an interest in obtaining an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that could strike the Soviet Union from bases within the United Kingdom. This added impetus to desires for a MRBM, but this ran afoul of ongoing concerns about the sharing of nuclear information. Later that same month, the initial report of the Killian Committee was published. Among its many recommendations was the statement that the U.S. should build an IRBM as soon as possible. They based their argument on the fact that an IRBM could strike any point in Europe from any point in Europe. It was believed that this type of weapon would be highly desirable to the Soviets and thus since they were very likely to develop such a system, the U.S. should build one first.

In March 1955, the Army approached the Air Force about their MRBM design. When the Air Force had split from the Army in 1947, the two forces had a tacit agreement that the Army would be responsible for designs flying less than , while the Air Force took over those with greater range. The new design&#x27;s range placed it within the umbrella of the Air Force, so the Army offered to design and build the missile for operation by the Air Force. In spite of addressing the calls for an Air Force M/IRBM, and that taking it over would keep the Army out of the long-range missile game, General Schriever dismissed the idea outright:

As the calls for an IRBM continued, Schriever finally acquiesced and suggested that an IRBM could be created out of a down-scaled Atlas, thereby avoiding any duplication of effort. Contract tenders for such designs were sent out in May 1955. However, by July 1955, the Joint Coordinating Committee on Ballistic Missiles concluded that there were enough differences between the two concepts that an entirely new design should be built for the role.

The Army, meanwhile, did not give up on their design. In September 1955, von Braun briefed the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the Armed Services Policy Council on long range missiles, pointing out that a missile was a logical extension of the Redstone. He proposed a six-year development program costing US$240 million (equivalent to $ in ) with a total production of 50 prototype missiles.

=== Jupiter-A ===
To test various parts of the Jupiter equipment, ABMA began launching Jupiter hardware on previously planned Redstone development missions. These were known under the name Jupiter-A. Among the systems tested by Jupiter-A were the ST-80 INS, angle-of-attack sensors, fusing systems and the explosive bolts that separated the booster from the upper stage.

ABMA and the Air Force disagree on how many flights were part of the Jupiter-A series. ABMA lists Redstone RS-11 as the first Jupiter-A launch on 22 September 1955, with RS-12 following on 5 December 1955. This means these flights took place before the Jupiter program was even official. The Air Force states the first was on 14 March 1956. Likewise the Air Force does not claim the last three Redstone flights, RS-46, CC-43 and CC-48, to be part of the Jupiter-A program, while ABMA lists them.

In total, ABMA lists 25 launches as part of the Jupiter-A series, every Redstone launched between September 1955 and 11 June 1958. The Air Force lists only the 20 in the middle of this period.

=== Jupiter-C ===
While development of the Jupiter missile was underway, design of the reentry vehicle was progressing rapidly. In order to gain test data on the design before the missile would be ready to launch it, ABMA designed the Jupiter-C, short for &quot;Jupiter Composite Test Vehicle&quot;. This was not really a Jupiter at all, but a Redstone with an stretch to hold more fuel, topped with two upper stages consisting of clusters of small solid fuel rockets, topped by a subscale version of the Jupiter reentry vehicle.

The bare Jupiter-C flew for the first time on 20 September 1956, flying further and faster than any previous rocket. The complete system with a dummy reentry vehicle flew twice in 1957, the first on 15 May and the second on 8 August 1957. The second of these tests also used a new three-stage upper that had been designed for the Juno I rocket, a further expansion of the Jupiter-C intended for future space launches. It was a Juno I that launched the U.S.&#x27;s first satellite, Explorer 1, on 1 February 1958 (GMT).

=== Jupiter versus Thor ===
ABMA&#x27;s work on the Jupiter progressed throughout the U.S. Navy&#x27;s brief involvement, especially work on the INS. The goal had originally been to match Redstone&#x27;s accuracy at the Jupiter&#x27;s much extended range, but as development continued it became clear the ABMA team could improve on that considerably. This led to a period in which &quot;The Army would lay down a particular accuracy, and wait for our arguments whether it was possible. We had to promise a lot, but were fortunate&quot;.

This process ultimately delivered a design intended to provide accuracy at the full range, a radius one fourth that of the best INS designs being used by the Air Force. The system was so accurate that a number of observers expressed their skepticism about the Army&#x27;s goals, with the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) suggesting they were hopelessly optimistic.

The Army&#x27;s desire for accuracy was a side-effect of their mission concept for nuclear weapons. They saw the weapons as part of a large-scale battle in Europe, in which both sides would use nuclear weapons during a limited war that did not include the use of strategic weapons on each other&#x27;s cities. In that case, &quot;if wars were to be kept limited, such weapons would have to be capable of hitting only tactical targets&quot;. This approach saw support of a number of influential theorists, notably Henry Kissinger, and was seized on as a uniquely Army mission.

Although the Air Force had started their own IRBM to compete with Jupiter, development was lackadaisical. They had the much more impressive Atlas to worry about, and even that saw relatively little interest in a force dominated by Strategic Air Command&#x27;s bomber-centric strategic vision. Curtis LeMay, leader of SAC, was generally uninterested in Atlas, considering it useful only as a way to blast holes in the Soviet defensive systems to let his bombers through. But as the Jupiter program began to progress they became increasingly concerned that it would enter service before Atlas, potentially handing the Army some sort of strategic role in the short term.

The Air Force vision of war was significantly different from the Army&#x27;s, consisting of a massive attack on the Soviet Union in the event of any sort of major military action, the so-called &quot;Sunday punch&quot;. The possibility of a major war that did not escalate to the point where strategic weapons were used was a serious concern to Air Force planners. If the Soviets became convinced the U.S. would respond to tactical nuclear use in kind, and that such use would not automatically unleash SAC, they might be more willing to chance a war in Europe where they might maintain superiority.

The Air Force began to agitate against Jupiter, saying that the Army&#x27;s vision of a low-scale nuclear war was destabilizing, while claiming that their own Thor missile did not represent this sort of destabilizing force as it was purely strategic. They may also have been motivated by the WSEG&#x27;s comments that if the Jupiter team&#x27;s accuracy claims were true, &quot;they would indicate that Jupiter is the most promising weapon for development&quot;.

=== Army to Air Force ===
As the Air Force&#x27;s arguments against Jupiter grew more vocal, the argument came to encompass several other ongoing projects that the two forces had in common, including surface-to-air missiles and anti-ballistic missiles. By the middle of 1956, both forces were engaged in tit-for-tat attacks in the press, with the Air Force calling the Army &quot;unfit to guard the nation&quot; on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and sending out press releases about how bad their SAM-A-25 Nike Hercules missile was compared to the Air Force&#x27;s IM-99 Bomarc.

Tired of the internecine fighting, Secretary of Defense Wilson decided to end it once and for all. Examining a wide variety of complaints between the two forces, on 18 November 1956, he published a memo that limited the Army to weapons with a range of or less, and those dedicated to air defense to half that. Jupiter&#x27;s range was well over this limit, but instead of forcing them to cancel the project, Wilson had the ABMA team continue development and the Air Force to ultimately deploy it. This was precisely the plan that Schriever had rejected the year before.

The Army were apoplectic, and let the press know it. This ultimately led to the court-martial of Colonel John C. Nickerson Jr., after he leaked information about various Army projects, including the then-secret Pershing missile.

The Air Force were no happier, as they had little real interest in anything other than Atlas, and didn&#x27;t see a strong need for one IRBM, let alone two. Through 1957 the situation between the Air Force and ABMA was almost nonfunctional, with ABMA requests for updates on the project going unanswered for months. The Air Force did, however, reduce the production rate from two missiles per month to one. They then began a review process with the thinly disguised goal of canceling Jupiter.

=== Army to NASA ===
When the Army was stripped of their long-range surface-to-surface role, the question arose as to what to do with the ABMA team. The large team built up for the Redstone and Jupiter efforts would not be needed for the short range missiles fitting the Wilson range limits, but breaking up the team was something no one wanted.

The team soon began working on non-military rockets, which did not fall under the Wilson range requirements. This led to a series of designs extending the existing Juno series, using various combinations of parts from Army and Air Force missiles to meet a wide variety of performance goals. During a visit by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the various plans were presented, notably the Juno V concept which ABMA saw as a solution for launching the spy satellites the Air Force was designing. The Air Force was, unsurprisingly, planning to use its own launcher for this, an expanded version of the upcoming Titan II. ARPA then provided ABMA with initial funding to keep the Juno V project moving, and assigned it von Braun&#x27;s preferred name of &quot;Saturn&quot;, meaning &quot;the one after Jupiter&quot;.

Meanwhile, President Eisenhower was interested in handing the job of space exploration to a civilian body, which would avoid any potential issues over the militarization of space. This was formed as NASA in late 1958. Some months later ABMA was handed over to NASA to become the Marshall Space Flight Center.

When the next president, John F. Kennedy, announced the goal of landing on the Moon on 25 May 1961, two competing designs were considered for the booster, Marshall&#x27;s Saturn V and the NASA Nova. The subsequent selection of the smaller Saturn was a factor in the success of the Apollo project.

He helped shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of successes, which earned him the nicknames &quot;Prince of Motown&quot; and &quot;Prince of Soul&quot;.

Gaye&#x27;s Motown hits include &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)&quot; (1964), &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot; (1965), and &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (1968). He also recorded duets with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross. During the 1970s, Gaye became one of the first Motown artists to break away from the reins of a production company and recorded the landmark albums &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; (1973).

His later recordings influenced several R&amp;B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, released in 1982 on the album &quot;Midnight Love&quot;, won him his first two Grammy Awards. Gaye&#x27;s last televised appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; in 1983, and on &quot;Soul Train&quot;.

On April 1, 1984, Gaye intervened during a fight between his parents at their home in Western Heights, Los Angeles. Gaye&#x27;s father, Marvin GayÂ Sr., subsequently shot and killed him; it was the day before Gaye&#x27;s 45th birthday. GayÂ Sr. later pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, receiving a six-year suspended sentence and five years of probation. Institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with such awards and honors as the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. was born on April 2, 1939, at Freedman&#x27;s Hospital in Washington, D.C., to church minister Marvin Gay Sr. and domestic worker Alberta Gay (nÃ©e Cooper). His first home was in a public housing project, the Fairfax Apartments (now demolished) at 1617 1st Street SW in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood. Although one of the city&#x27;s oldest neighborhoods, with many elegant Federal-style homes, most buildings were small, in extensive disrepair, and lacked both electricity and running water. The alleys were full of one- and two-story shacks, and nearly every dwelling was overcrowded. Gaye and his friends nicknamed the area &quot;Simple City&quot;, owing to it being &quot;half-city, half country&quot;.

Gaye was the second oldest of the couple&#x27;s four children. He had two sisters, Jeanne and Zeola, and one brother, Frankie Gaye. He also had two half-brothers: Michael Cooper, his mother&#x27;s son from a previous relationship, and Antwaun Carey Gay, born as a result of one of his father&#x27;s extramarital affairs.Gaye started singing in church when he was four years old; his father often accompanied him on piano. Gaye and his family were part of a conservative church known as the House of God that took its teachings from Pentecostalism, with a strict code of conduct. Gaye developed a love of singing at an early age and was encouraged to pursue a professional music career after a performance at a school play at 11 singing Mario Lanza&#x27;s &quot;Be My Love&quot;. His home life consisted of &quot;brutal whippings&quot; by his father, who struck him for any shortcoming. The young Gaye described living in his father&#x27;s house as similar to &quot;living with a king, a very peculiar, changeable, cruel, and all powerful king&quot;. He felt that had his mother not consoled him and encouraged his singing, he would have committed suicide. His sister later explained that Gaye was beaten often, from age seven well into his teenage years.

Gaye attended Syphax Elementary School and then Randall Junior High School. Gaye began to take singing much more seriously in junior high, and he joined and became a singing star with the Randall Junior High Glee Club.

In 1953 or 1954, the Gays moved into the East Capitol Dwellings public housing project in D.C.&#x27;s Capitol View neighborhood. Their townhouse apartment (Unit 12, 60th Street NE; now demolished) was Marvin&#x27;s home until 1962.

Gaye briefly attended Spingarn High School before transferring to Cardozo High School. At Cardozo, Gaye joined several doo-wop vocal groups, including the Dippers and the D.C. Tones. During his teenage years, his father would kick him out of the house often. In 1956, 17-year-old Gaye dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Air Force as an airman basic. His early disenchantment with the service was similar to most of his peers who were made to perform menial labor, not working on jet airplanes as hoped. Gaye later said he lost his virginity to a local prostitute while in the Air Force. He feigned mental illness and was given a &quot;General Discharge&quot;, with an outgoing performance review from his sergeant remarking &quot;Airman Gay cannot adjust to regimentation nor authority&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===

After Gaye left the Air Force, he formed a vocal quartet, The Marquees, with his good friend Reese Palmer. The group performed in the D.C. area and soon began working with Bo Diddley, who tried to persuade his own label, Chess, to sign them to a record deal. Failing that, he sent them to Columbia subsidiary OKeh Records. Diddley co-wrote the group&#x27;s sole single, &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;; it failed to chart and the group was soon dropped from the label. Gaye began composing music.

Moonglows co-founder Harvey Fuqua later hired The Marquees as employees. Under Fuqua&#x27;s direction, the group changed its name to Harvey and the New Moonglows, and moved to Chicago. The group recorded several sides for Chess in 1959, including the song &quot;Mama Loocie&quot;, which was Gaye&#x27;s first lead vocal recording. The group found work as session singers for established acts such as Chuck Berry, singing on the songs &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Almost Grown&quot;.

In 1960, the group disbanded. Gaye moved to Detroit with Fuqua, where he signed with Tri-Phi Records as a session musician, playing drums on several Tri-Phi releases. Gaye performed at Motown president Berry Gordy&#x27;s house during the holiday season in December 1960. Impressed, Gordy sought Fuqua on his contract with Gaye. Fuqua agreed to sell part of his interest in his contract with Gaye. Shortly afterwards, Gaye signed with Motown subsidiary Tamla.

When Gaye signed with Tamla, he pursued a career as a performer of jazz music and standards, having no desire to become an R&amp;B performer. Before the release of his first single, Gaye started spelling his surname with added &quot;e&quot;, in the same way as did Sam Cooke. Author David Ritz wrote that Gaye did this to silence rumors of his sexuality, and to put more distance between himself and his father.

Gaye released his first single, &quot;Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide&quot;, in May 1961, with the album &quot;The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye&quot;, following a month later. Gaye&#x27;s initial recordings failed commercially and he spent most of 1961 performing session work as a drummer for artists such as The Miracles, The Marvelettes and blues artist Jimmy Reed for $5 (US$ in dollars) a week. While Gaye took some advice on performing with his eyes open (having been accused of appearing as though he were sleeping) and also got pointers on how to move more gracefully onstage, he refused to attend grooming school courses at the John Robert Powers School for Social Grace in Detroit because of his unwillingness to comply with its orders, something he later regretted.

===Initial success===
In 1962, Gaye found success as co-writer of the Marvelettes track &quot;Beechwood 4-5789&quot;, on which he also played drums. His first solo success, &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot;, was later released that September, reaching No. 8 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 46 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gaye first reached the pop top 40 with the dance song, &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;, peaking at No. 30 on the Hot 100. &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; became Gaye&#x27;s first top ten single after its release in 1963.

The three singles and songs from the 1962 sessions were included on Gaye&#x27;s second album, &quot;That Stubborn Kinda Fellow&quot;, released on Tamla in January 1963. Starting in October 1962, Gaye performed as part of the Motortown Revue, a series of concert tours headlined at the north and southeastern coasts of the United States as part of the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, a series of rock shows performed at venues that welcomed predominantly black musicians. A filmed performance of Gaye at the Apollo Theater took place in June 1963. Later that October, Tamla issued the live album, &quot;Marvin Gaye Recorded Live on Stage&quot;. &quot;Can I Get a Witness&quot; became one of Gaye&#x27;s early international successes.
In 1964, Gaye recorded a successful duet album with singer Mary Wells titled &quot;Together&quot;, which reached No. 42 on the pop album chart. The album&#x27;s two-sided single, including &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &#x27;What&#x27;s the Matter With You Baby&quot;, each reached the top 20. Gaye&#x27;s next solo success, &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, which Holland-Dozier-Holland wrote for him, reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and reached the top 50 in the UK. Gaye started getting television exposure around this time, on shows such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Also in 1964, he appeared in the concert film &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot;. Gaye had two number-one R&amp;B singles in 1965 with the Miraclesâcomposed &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Doggone&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot;. Both songs became million-sellers. After this, Gaye returned to jazz-derived ballads for &quot;A Tribute to the Great Nat King Cole&quot;, a tribute album to the recently-deceased Nat King Cole.

After recording &quot;It Takes Two&quot; with Kim Weston, Gaye began working with Tammi Terrell on a series of duets, mostly composed by Ashford &amp; Simpson, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;.

In October 1967, Terrell collapsed in Gaye&#x27;s arms during a performance in Farmville, Virginia. Terrell was subsequently rushed to Farmville&#x27;s Southside Community Hospital, where doctors discovered she had a malignant tumor in her brain. The diagnosis ended Terrell&#x27;s career as a live performer, though she continued to record music under careful supervision. Despite the presence of successful singles such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;, Terrell&#x27;s illness caused problems with recording, and led to multiple operations to remove the tumor. Gaye was reportedly devastated by Terrell&#x27;s sickness and became disillusioned with the record business.

On October 6, 1968, Gaye sang the national anthem during Game 4 of the 1968 World Series, held at Tiger Stadium, in Detroit, Michigan, between the Detroit Tigers and the St. Louis Cardinals.

In late 1968, Gaye&#x27;s recording of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; became his first to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the top of the charts in other countries, selling over four million copies. However, Gaye felt the success was something he &quot;didn&#x27;t deserve&quot; and that he &quot;felt like a puppet â Berry&#x27;s puppet, Anna&#x27;s puppet&quot;. Gaye followed it up with &quot;Too Busy Thinking About My Baby&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Is&quot;, which reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969. That year, his album &quot;M.P.G.&quot; became his first No. 1 album on the R&amp;B album charts. During this period, Gaye produced and co-wrote &quot;Baby I&#x27;m For Real&quot; and &quot;The Bells&quot; for The Originals.

Tammi Terrell died from brain cancer on March 16, 1970; Gaye attended her funeral and after a period of depression, Gaye sought out a position on a professional football team, the Detroit Lions, where he later befriended Mel Farr and Lem Barney. Barney and Farr had gotten gold records for providing backup vocals for the title track of Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; album. The Lions played along for the publicity, but ultimately declined an invitation for Gaye to try out, owing to legal liabilities and fears of possible injuries that could have affected his music career.

===&quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and subsequent success===

On June 1, 1970, Gaye returned to Hitsville U.S.A., where he recorded his new composition &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, inspired by an idea from Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson of the Four Tops after he witnessed an act of police brutality at an anti-war rally in Berkeley. Upon hearing the song, Berry Gordy refused its release due to his feelings of the song being &quot;too political&quot; for radio and feared Gaye would lose his crossover audience. Gaye responded by deciding against releasing any other new material before the label released it. Released in 1971, it reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts within a month, staying there for five weeks. It also reached the top spot on Cashbox&#x27;s pop chart for a week and reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 and the Record World chart, selling over two million copies.

After giving an ultimatum to record a full album to win creative control from Motown, Gaye spent ten days recording the &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; album that March. Motown issued the album that May after Gaye remixed the album in Hollywood. The album became Gaye&#x27;s first million-selling album launching two more top ten singles, &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; and &quot;Inner City Blues&quot;. One of Motown&#x27;s first autonomous works, its theme and segue flow brought the concept album format to rhythm and blues and soul music. An AllMusic writer later cited it as &quot;the most important and passionate record to come out of soul music, delivered by one of its finest voices&quot;. For the album, Gaye received two Grammy Award nominations at the 1972 ceremony and several NAACP Image Awards. The album also topped &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;â³s year-end list as its album of the year. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named Gaye &quot;Trendsetter of the Year&quot; following the album&#x27;s success.

In 1971, Gaye signed a new deal with Motown worth $1Â million (US$ in dollars), making it the most lucrative deal by a black recording artist at the time. Gaye first responded to the new contract with the soundtrack and subsequent score, &quot;Trouble Man&quot;, released in late 1972. Before the release of &quot;Trouble Man,&quot; Marvin released a single called &quot;You&#x27;re the Man&quot;. The album of the same name was a follow-up to &quot;What&#x27;s Going On,&quot; but Motown refused to promote the single, according to Gaye. According to some biographies, Gordy, who was considered a moderate, feared Gaye&#x27;s left-leaning political views would alienate Motown&#x27;s moderately liberal audiences. As a result, Gaye shelved the project and substituted it for &quot;Trouble Man&quot;. In 2019, Universal Music Group released the album on what would&#x27;ve been Gaye&#x27;s 80th birthday. In between the releases of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and &quot;Trouble Man&quot;, Gaye and his family relocated to Los Angeles, making Marvin one of the final Motown artists to move there despite early protests urging him to stay in Detroit.

In August 1973, Gaye released the &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; album. Its title track became Gaye&#x27;s second No. 1 single on the Hot 100. The album was later hailed as &quot;a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy&quot;. Other singles from the album included &quot;Come Get to This&quot;, which recalled Gaye&#x27;s early Motown soul sound of the previous decade, while the suggestive &quot;You Sure Love to Ball&quot; reached modest success on the R&amp;B charts, while also managing to make the pop top 50, its success halted by radio refusing to play the sexually explicit song.

In the 1970s, Gaye&#x27;s sister-in-law turned her attention to Frankie Beverly, the founder of Maze. Marvin took them on his tours, featured them as the opening acts of his concerts, and persuaded Beverly to change the band&#x27;s name from Raw Soul to Maze.

Marvin&#x27;s final duet project, &quot;Diana &amp; Marvin&quot;, with Diana Ross, garnered international success despite contrasting artistic styles. Much of the material was crafted especially for the duo by Ashford and Simpson. Responding to demand from fans and Motown, Gaye started his first concert tour in four years at the OaklandâAlameda County Coliseum on January 4, 1974. The performance received critical acclaim and resulted in the release of the live album, &quot;Marvin Gaye Live!&quot; and its single, a live version of &quot;Distant Lover&quot;, an album track from &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;.

The tour helped to enhance Gaye&#x27;s reputation as a live performer. For a time, he was earning $100,000 a night (US$ in dollars) for performances. Gaye toured throughout 1974 and 1975. A renewed contract with Motown allowed Gaye to build his own custom-made recording studio.

In October 1975, Gaye gave a performance at a UNESCO benefit concert at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall to support UNESCO&#x27;s African literacy drive, resulting in him being commended at the United Nations by then-Ambassador to Ghana Shirley Temple Black and Kurt Waldheim. Gaye&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;I Want You&quot;, followed in March 1976 with the title track &quot;I Want You&quot; reaching No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts. The album would go on to sell over one million copies. That spring, Gaye embarked on his first European tour in a decade, starting off in Belgium. In early 1977, Gaye released the live album, &quot;Live at the London Palladium&quot;, which sold over two million copies thanks to the success of its studio song, &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;, which charted at No. 1. In September 1977, Gaye opened Radio City Music Hall&#x27;s New York Pop Arts Festival.

===Last Motown recordings and European exile===

In December 1978, Gaye released &quot;Here, My Dear&quot;, inspired by the fallout from his first marriage to Anna Gordy. Recorded with the intention of remitting a portion of its royalties to her as alimony payments, it performed poorly on the charts. During that period, Gaye&#x27;s cocaine addiction intensified while he was dealing with several financial issues with the IRS. These issues led him to move to Maui, where he struggled to record a disco-influenced album titled &quot;Love Man&quot;, with a probable release date for February 1980, though he would later shelve the project. That year, Gaye went on a European tour, his first in four years. By the time the tour stopped, he had relocated to London when he feared imprisonment for failure to pay back taxes, which had now reached upwards of $4.5Â million (US$ in dollars).

Gaye then reworked &quot;Love Man&quot; from its original disco concept to another socially-conscious album invoking religion and the possible end time from a chapter in the Book of Revelation. Titling the album &quot;In Our Lifetime?&quot;, Gaye worked on the album for much of 1980 in London studios such as AIR and Odyssey Studios.

In the fall of that year, a master tape of a rough draft of the album was stolen from one of Gaye&#x27;s traveling musicians, Frank Blair, and taken to Motown&#x27;s Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (&quot;Far Cry&quot;), altering the cover art and removing the album title&#x27;s question mark, muting its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Pablo Picasso painting. Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.

On February 14, 1981, under the advice of music promoter Freddy Cousaert, Gaye relocated to Cousaert&#x27;s apartment in Ostend, Belgium. While there, Gaye shied away from heavy drug use and began exercising and attending a local Ostend church, regaining personal confidence. In this period, Gaye lived in the home of Belgian musician . In March 2024, it was revealed that when he moved on, Gaye had given the family a large collection of unreleased recordings made during his stay in the country.

Following several months of recovery, Gaye sought a comeback onstage, starting the short-lived &quot;Heavy Love Affair&quot; tour in England and Ostend in JuneâJuly 1981. Gaye&#x27;s personal attorney Curtis Shaw would later describe Gaye&#x27;s Ostend period as &quot;the best thing that ever happened to Marvin&quot;. When word got around that Gaye was planning a musical comeback and an exit from Motown, CBS Urban president Larkin Arnold eventually was able to convince Gaye to sign with CBS Records. On MarchÂ 23, 1982, Motown and CBS negotiated Gaye&#x27;s release from Motown. The details of the contract were not revealed due to a possible negative effect on Gaye&#x27;s settlement to creditors from the IRS and to stop a possible bidding war by competing labels.

===&quot;Midnight Love&quot;===
Assigned to CBS&#x27;s Columbia subsidiary, Gaye worked on his first post-Motown album titled &quot;Midnight Love&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, which was written and recorded in Ostend in Freddy Cousaert&#x27;s apartment, was released in October 1982, and became Gaye&#x27;s biggest career success, spending a record 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Black Singles chart, becoming the biggest R&amp;B hit of the 1980s according to &quot;Billboard&quot; stats. In January 1983, it successfully crossed over to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 3, while the record reached international success, reaching the top spot in New Zealand and Canada and reaching the top 10 on the United Kingdom&#x27;s OCC singles chart, Australia and Belgium, later selling more than two million copies in the U.S. alone, becoming Gaye&#x27;s most successful single to date. The video for the song was shot at Ostend&#x27;s Casino-Kursaal.

&quot;Sexual Healing&quot; won Gaye his first two Grammy Awards including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance, in February 1983, and also won Gaye an American Music Award in the R&amp;B-soul category. &quot;People&quot; magazine called it &quot;America&#x27;s hottest musical turn-on since Olivia Newton-John demanded we get &#x27;Physical. &quot;Midnight Love&quot; was released to stores less than a month after the single&#x27;s release, and was equally successful, peaking at the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and becoming Gaye&#x27;s eighth No. 1 album on the Top Black Albums chart, eventually selling three million alone in the U.S.

On February 13, 1983, Gaye sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the NBA All-Star Game at The Forum in Inglewood, Californiaâaccompanied by Gordon Banks, who played the studio tape from the stands. The following month, Gaye performed at the &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; special. This and a May appearance on &quot;Soul Train&quot; (his third appearance on the show) became Gaye&#x27;s final television performances. Gaye embarked on his final concert tour, titled the &quot;Sexual Healing Tour&quot;, on April 18, 1983, at The El Cortez Hotel Concerts by the Bay in San Diego. The tour, which had 51 dates in total and included a then-record six sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, ended on August 14, 1983, at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, California, but was plagued by cocaine-triggered paranoia and illness. Following the concert&#x27;s end, he moved into his parents&#x27; house in Los Angeles. In early 1984, &quot;Midnight Love&quot; was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance category, his 12th and final nomination.

==Personal life==
In June 1963, Gaye married Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy. The couple separated in 1973, and Gordy filed for divorce in November 1975. The couple officially divorced in 1977. Gaye later married Janis Hunter in October 1977. The couple separated in 1979 and officially divorced in November 1982.

Gaye was the father of three children: Marvin III, by adoption; Nona; and Frankie. Marvin III was the biological son of Anna&#x27;s niece, Denise Gordy, who was 16 at the time of the birth. Nona and Frankie were born to Gaye&#x27;s second wife, Janis. At the time of his death, Gaye was survived by his three children, mother, father, and five siblings.

Gaye was a cousin of Wu-Tang Clan member Masta Killa.

==Death==
In the early afternoon of April 1, 1984, Gaye intervened in a fight between his parents in the family house in the West Adams neighborhood of Western Heights in Los Angeles. He became involved in a physical altercation with his father, Marvin Gay Sr., who shot Gaye twice, once in the chest, piercing his heart, and then into his shoulder. The shooting took place in Gaye&#x27;s bedroom at 12:38Â p.m. Gaye was pronounced dead at 1:01Â p.m. after his body arrived at California Hospital Medical Center, the day before his 45th birthday.

After Gaye&#x27;s funeral, his body was cremated at Forest Lawn Memorial ParkâHollywood Hills, and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. Gay Sr. was initially charged with first-degree murder, but the charges were reduced to voluntary manslaughter following a diagnosis of a brain tumor. He was given a suspended six-year sentence and probation. He died at a nursing home in 1998.

==Musicianship==
===Equipment===
Starting off his musicianship as a drummer doing session work during his tenure with Harvey Fuqua, and his early Motown years, Gaye&#x27;s musicianship evolved to include piano, keyboards, synthesizers, and organ. Gaye also used percussion instruments, such as bells, finger cymbals, box drums, glockenspiels, vibraphones, bongos, congas, and cabasas. This became evident when he was given creative control in his later years with Motown, to produce his own albums. In addition to his talent as a drummer, Gaye also embraced the TR-808, a drum machine that became prominent in the early &#x27;80s, making use of its sounds for production of his &quot;Midnight Love&quot; album. The piano was his primary instrument when performing on stage, with occasional drumming.

===Influences===
As a child, Gaye&#x27;s main influence was his minister father, something he later acknowledged to biographer David Ritz, and also in interviews, often mentioning that his father&#x27;s sermons greatly impressed him. His first major musical influences were doo-wop groups such as The Moonglows and The Capris. Gaye&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame page lists the Capris&#x27; song, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as &quot;critical to his musical awakening&quot;. Of the Capris&#x27; song, Gaye said, &quot;It fell from the heavens and hit me between the eyes. So much soul, so much hurt. I related to the story, to the way that no one except the Lord really can read the heart of lonely kids in love.&quot; Gaye&#x27;s main musical influences were Rudy West of The Five Keys, Clyde McPhatter, Ray Charles and Little Willie John. Gaye considered Frank Sinatra a major influence in what he wanted to be. He also was influenced by the vocal styles of Billy Eckstine and Nat King Cole.

As his Motown career developed, Gaye took inspiration from fellow label mates such as David Ruffin of The Temptations and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops, whose grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Is&quot;. Later in his life, Gaye reflected on the influence of Ruffin and Stubbs, stating: &quot;I had heard something in their voices something my own voice lacked.&quot; He further explained, &quot;the Tempts and Tops&#x27; music made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man.&quot;

===Vocal style===
Gaye had a four-octave vocal range. From his earlier recordings as member of the Marquees and Harvey and the New Moonglows, and in his first several recordings with Motown, Gaye recorded mainly in the baritone and tenor ranges. He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot; and &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;. As writer Eddie Holland explained, &quot;He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song.&quot;

In songs such as &quot;Pride and Joy&quot;, Gaye used three different vocal rangesâsinging in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye&#x27;s voice that it was &quot;one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear&quot;. And while he noted that ballads and jazz was &quot;his basic soul&quot;, he stated Gaye &quot;had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&amp;B, any kind of song and make it his own&quot;, later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.

Gaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voiceâespecially in Norman Whitfield&#x27;s recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was &quot;into being produce-able&quot;. After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his &quot;tough man voice&quot;âsaying, &quot;I developed a growl.&quot; In the liner notes of his DVD set, &quot;Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964â1981&quot;, Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed &quot;three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal falsetto.&quot; Bowman further wrote that the recording of the &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; single was &quot;...the first single to use all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself.&quot; Bowman found that Gaye&#x27;s multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles &quot;summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving&quot;.

===Social commentary and concept albums===
Prior to recording the &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, &quot;Abraham, Martin &amp; John&quot;, which became a UK hit in 1970. Despite some political music and socially conscious material recorded by The Temptations, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, for fear of alienating pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself: &quot;with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?&quot; When Gaye called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do protest music, Gordy told him: &quot;Marvin, don&#x27;t be ridiculous. That&#x27;s taking things too far.&quot;

Gaye was inspired by the Black Panther Party and supported the efforts they put forth such as giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye&#x27;s messages in many of his political songs were nonviolent. The lyrics and music of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as racism, police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues. Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the Vietnam War, the 1967 race riots in Detroit, and the Kent State shootings, as well as the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.

Once Gaye presented Gordy with the &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol. Following the album&#x27;s success, Gaye tried a follow-up album, &quot;You&#x27;re the Man&quot;. The title track only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Several of Gaye&#x27;s unreleased songs of social commentary, including &quot;The World Is Rated X&quot;, would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; would later be described by an AllMusic writer as an album that &quot;not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re the Man&quot; was finally released on March 29, 2019, through Motown, Universal Music Enterprises, and Universal Music Group.

The &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; album also provided another first in both Motown and R&amp;B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a song cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&amp;B albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&amp;B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album&#x27;s concept. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; repeated the suite-form arrangement of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, as would Gaye&#x27;s later albums such as &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; and &quot;In Our Lifetime&quot;. Although Gaye was not politically active outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.

==Legacy==
Gaye has been called &quot;the number-one purveyor of soul music&quot;. In his book &quot;Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye&quot;, Michael Eric Dyson described Gaye as someone &quot;who transcended the boundaries of rhythm and blues as no other performer had done before&quot;. Following his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Gaye as someone who &quot;blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music&quot;. Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining &quot;the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer&quot;. His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label&#x27;s signature sound. His work with Motown gave him the titles &quot;Prince of Soul&quot; and &quot;Prince of Motown.&quot; Critics stated that Gaye&#x27;s music &quot;signified the development of black music from raw rhythm and blues, through sophisticated soul to the political awareness of the 1970s and increased concentration on personal and sexual politics thereafter&quot;. As a Motown artist, Gaye was among the first to break from the reins of its production system, paving the way for Stevie Wonder. Gaye&#x27;s late 1970s and early 1980s recordings influenced forms of R&amp;B predating the subgenres quiet storm and neo-soul.

Barry White, Stevie Wonder, Frankie Beverly and many others have said they were influenced by Gaye&#x27;s music. For his Oscar-nominated role as James &quot;Thunder&quot; Ealy in the film &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, Eddie Murphy replicated Gaye&#x27;s 1970s clothing style.

David Ritz wrote in a 1991 revision of his biography of Gaye, &quot;since 1983, Marvin&#x27;s name has been mentionedâin reverential tonesâon no less than seven top-ten hit records.&quot; Gaye&#x27;s name has been used in the title of several hits, including Big Sean&#x27;s &quot;Marvin Gaye &amp; Chardonnay&quot; and Charlie Puth&#x27;s debut hit, &quot;Marvin Gaye&quot;, a duet with Meghan Trainor. The 1983 Spandau Ballet hit &quot;True&quot; mentions &quot;Listening to Marvin all night long...&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him in 1987, declaring that Gaye &quot;made a huge contribution to soul music in general and the Motown Sound in particular&quot;. The page stated that Gaye &quot;possessed a classic R&amp;B voice that was edged with grit yet tempered with sweetness&quot;. The page further states that Gaye &quot;projected an air of soulful authority driven by fervid conviction and heartbroken vulnerability&quot;. A year after his death, then-mayor of D.C., Marion Barry declared April 2 as &quot;Marvin Gaye Jr. Memorial Scholarship Fund Day&quot; in the city. Since then, a non-profit organization has helped to organize annual Marvin Gaye Day Celebrations in the city of Washington.

A year later, Gaye&#x27;s mother founded the Marvin P. Gaye Jr. Memorial Foundation in dedication to her son to help those suffering from drug abuse and alcoholism; however she died a day before the memorial was set to open in 1987. Gaye&#x27;s sister Jeanne once served as the foundation&#x27;s chairperson. In 1988, a year after his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Gaye was inducted posthumously to the NAACP Hall of Fame. In 1990, Gaye received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1996, Gaye posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed three Gaye recordings, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, among its list of the &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. American music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Gaye No. 18 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, sixth on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; and number 82 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked Gaye sixth on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot;.

Three of Gaye&#x27;s albums â &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971), &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; (1973), and &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; (1978) â were ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; remains his largest-ranked album, reaching No. 6 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list and topped the &quot;NME&quot; list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of All Time&quot; in 1985 and was later chosen in 2003 for inclusion by the Library of Congress to its National Recording Registry. In a revised 2020 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; was listed as the greatest album of all time. In addition, four of his songs â &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; and &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; â made it on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2005, Gaye was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In 2006, Watts Branch Park, a park in Washington that Gaye frequented as a teenager, was renamed Marvin Gaye Park. Three years later, the 5200 block of Foote Street NE in Deanwood, Washington, D.C., was renamed Marvin Gaye Way. In August 2014, Gaye was inducted to the official Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in its second class. In October 2015, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced Gaye as a nominee for induction to the Hall&#x27;s 2016 class after posthumous nominations were included. Gaye was named as a posthumous inductee to that hall on March 2, 2016. Gaye was subsequently inducted to the Songwriters Hall on June 9, 2016. In July 2018, a bill by California politician Karen Bass to rename a post office in South Los Angeles after Gaye was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Gaye was ranked number 20 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;â³s &quot;The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; published in January 2023.

==In popular culture==
His 1983 NBA All-Star performance of the national anthem was used in a Nike commercial featuring the 2008 U.S. Olympic basketball team. Also, on CBS Sports&#x27; final NBA telecast to date (before the contract moved to NBC) at the conclusion of Game 5 of the 1990 Finals, they used Gaye&#x27;s 1983 All-Star Game performance over the closing credits. When VH1 launched on January 1, 1985, Gaye&#x27;s 1983 rendition of the national anthem was the first video they aired. In 2010, it was used in the intro to Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;Tenth Inning&quot; documentary on the game of baseball. The 1985 Commodores song &quot;Nightshift&quot; was a tribute to Gaye and Jackie Wilson, who both died in 1984. One verse mentions Gaye&#x27;s song &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;.

&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; was played in a Levi&#x27;s television advertisement in 1985. The result of the commercial&#x27;s success led to the original song finding renewed success in Europe after Tamla-Motown re-released it in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. In 1986, the song was covered by Buddy Miles as part of a California Raisins ad campaign. The song was later used for chewing gum commercials in Finland and to promote a brand of Lucky Strike cigarettes in Germany.

Gaye&#x27;s music has also been used in numerous film soundtracks including &quot;Four Brothers&quot; and &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, both of which featured Gaye&#x27;s music from his &quot;Trouble Man&quot; soundtrack. &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; was used in the opening credits of the film, &quot;The Big Chill&quot;.

In 2007, his song &quot;A Funky Space Reincarnation&quot; was used in the Charlize Theronâstarred ad for Dior J&#x27;Adore perfume. A documentary about Gayeâ&quot;What&#x27;s Going On: The Marvin Gaye Story&quot;âwas a UK/PBS co-production, directed by Jeremy Marre and was first broadcast in 2006. Two years later, the special re-aired with a different production and newer interviews after it was re-broadcast as an &quot;American Masters&quot; special. Another documentary, focusing on his 1981 documentary, &quot;Transit Ostend&quot;, titled &quot;Remember Marvin&quot;, aired in 2006.

==Earnings==
In 2008, Gaye&#x27;s estate earned $3.5Â million (US$ in dollars). As a result, Gaye took 13th place in &quot;Top-Earning Dead Celebrities&quot; in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

On March 11, 2015, Gaye&#x27;s family was awarded $7.4Â million in damages following a decision by an eight-member jury in Los Angeles that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams had breached copyright by incorporating part of Gaye&#x27;s song &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; into their hit &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;; U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt reduced the sum to $5.3Â million, while adding royalties. In January 2016, the Gaye family requested that a California judge give $2.66Â million in attorneys&#x27; fees and $777,000 in legal expenses.

As of 2018, Gaye&#x27;s estate was managed by Geffen Management Group and his legacy is protected through Creative Rights Group. Both are founded by talent manager Jeremy Geffen.

==Attempted biopics==
There have been several attempts to adapt Gaye&#x27;s life story into a feature film. In February 2006, it was reported that Jesse L. Martin was to portray Gaye in a biopic titled &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, named after Gaye&#x27;s 1982 song of the same name. The film was to have been directed by Lauren Goodman and produced by James Gandolfini and Alexandra Ryan. The film was to depict the final three years of Gaye&#x27;s life. Years later, other producers such as Jean-Luc Van Damme, Frederick Bestall and Jimmy De Brabant, came aboard and Goodman was replaced by Julien Temple. Lenny Kravitz was almost slated to play Gaye. The script was to be written by Matthew Broughton. The film was to have been distributed by Focus Features and released on April 1, 2014, the thirtieth anniversary of Gaye&#x27;s death. This never came to fruition and it was announced that Focus Features no longer has involvement with the Gaye biopic as of June 2013.

In June 2008, it was announced that F. Gary Gray was going to direct a biopic titled &quot;Marvin&quot;. The script was to be written by C. Gaby Mitchell and the film was to be produced by David Foster and Duncan McGillivray and co-produced by Ryan Heppe. According to Gray, the film would cover Gaye&#x27;s entire life, from his emergence at Motown through his defiance of Berry Gordy to record &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and on up to his death.

Cameron Crowe had also been working on a biopic titled &quot;My Name Is Marvin&quot;. The film was to have been a Sony presentation with Scott Rudin as producer. Both Will Smith and Terrence Howard were considered for the role of Gaye. Crowe later confirmed in August 2011 that he abandoned the project: &quot;We were working on the Marvin Gaye movie which is called &quot;My Name is Marvin&quot;, but the time just wasn&#x27;t right for that movie.&quot; Members of Gaye&#x27;s family, such as his ex-wife Janis and his son Marvin III, have expressed opposition to a biopic.

In July 2016, it was announced that a feature film documentary on Gaye would be released the following year delving into his life and the making of his 1971 album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. The film would be developed by Noah Media Group and Greenlight and is quoted to be &quot;the defining portrait of this visionary artist and his impeccable album&quot; by the film&#x27;s producers Gabriel Clarke and Torquil Jones. The film will include &quot;unseen footage&quot; of Gaye. Gaye&#x27;s family approved of the documentary. In November 2016, it was announced that the actor Jamie Foxx was billed to produce a limited biopic series on Gaye&#x27;s life. The series was approved by Gaye&#x27;s family, including son Marvin III, who was to serve as executive producer, and Berry Gordy, Jr.

On June 18, 2018, it was reported that American rapper Dr. Dre was in talks to produce a biopic about Gaye. In June 2021, it was announced that the film Dre would be producing was greenlighted by Warner Bros. Pictures and would be directed by Allen Hughes for a projected 2023 release.

==Acting==
Gaye acted in two movies, featuring as a Vietnam veteran in both roles. His first performance was in the 1969 George McCowan film &quot;The Ballad of Andy Crocker&quot;, which starred Lee Majors. The film was about a war veteran returning to find that his expectations have not been met and he feels betrayed. Gaye had a prominent role in the film as David Owens. His other performance was in 1971. He had a role in the Lee Frost-directed biker-exploitation film &quot;Chrome and Hot Leather&quot;, about a group of Vietnam veterans taking on a bike gang. The film starred William Smith; Gaye played the part of Jim, one of the veterans.

Gaye did have acting aspirations and had signed with the William Morris Agency but that only lasted a year as Gaye was not satisfied with the support he was getting from the agency. In his interview with David Ritz, Gaye admitted being interested in show business particularly when he was hired to compose the soundtrack for &quot;Trouble Man&quot;. &quot;No doubt I could have been a movie star, but it was something my subconscious rejected. Not that I didn&#x27;t want it, I most certainly did. I just didn&#x27;t have the fortitude to play the Hollywood game: to put myself out there, knowing they would eat my rear end like a piece of meat.&quot;

<text>The Poqet PC is a line of palmtop PCs introduced in 1989 by Poqet Computer Corporation. The eponymous first model was the first IBM PCâcompatible palmtop computer capable of running MS-DOS at CGA resolutions. The Poqet PC is powered by two AA batteries. Through the use of aggressive power management, which includes stopping the CPU between keystrokes, the batteries are able to power the computer for anywhere between a couple of weeks and a couple of months, depending on usage. The computer also uses an &quot;instant on&quot; feature, such that after powering it down, it can be used again immediately without having to go through a full booting sequence. The Poqet PC is comparable to the HP 95LX/HP 100LX/HP 200LX and the Atari Portfolio handheld computers. The computer originally sold for US$2,000; it was discontinued after Fujitsu Ltd. bought Poqet Computer Corp.

==Poqet PC, &quot;Classic&quot; and Prime==
Three variants were produced. The Poqet PC was the first to be introduced and the Poqet PC Prime followed shortly after. (The original version was subsequently renamed the Poqet PC &quot;Classic&quot;). Several years later, the Poqet PC Plus was introduced. The main difference between the Poqet PC Classic and the Prime was the expansion of RAM from 512 to 640Â KB and enhancement of the power management features.

===Specifications===
* Size: x x 
* Weight: with batteries
* Battery life: 50â100 hours (expect a lot less if running long, CPU-intensive programs (10-20 h approx.))
* Microprocessor: Intel 80C88 / 7Â MHz
* Memory: 640Â KB SRAM
* Display: Reflective DSTN (no backlight)
* Display compatibility: MDA: 80 Ã 25 characters CGA: 640 Ã 200 pixels
* PCMCIA: 2 Ã Type I, Revision 1.0 memory card slots
* Secondary storage: Drive A: 512 KB-2Â MB PCMCIA (not included) Drive B: 512-2Â MB PCMCIA (not included) Drive C: 768Â KB ROM drive with MS-DOS 3.3 and PoqetTools Drive D: 22Â KB volatile RAM drive
* Built-in software: MS-DOS 3.3, PoqetLink, and PoqetTools

==Poqet PC Plus==
Several years after the Poqet Prime and Classic, and some time after Fujitsu purchased Poqet Computer Corp., the new and improved Poqet PC Plus was introduced. The Poqet PC Plus had significant differences from the Classic and Prime models, some better than others. It features a rechargeable battery pack that holds a smaller charge than the &quot;Classic&quot;, enhanced PC Card slots that now support more PC Cards, a transflective backlit LCD and 2Â MB of RAM (640Â KB to DOS, 64Â KB shadow, and 1-1344Â KB for a RAM disk). The Poqet &quot;Classic&quot;&#x27;s LCD didn&#x27;t have a backlight and was more prone to breaking than the Poqet PC Plus. It also only took Type I, Release 1.0 SRAM cards, as opposed to Type II cards and Release 2.0 cards, including flash, SRAM, and a few modem cards. The Plus also had more memory. Despite many improvements, the Plus also had its drawbacks. The Poqet PC Plus was considerably larger and heavier than its predecessors. It weighed approximately as opposed to the Classic&#x27;s . It also has a very odd miniature 26-pin serial connector for which there is no currently available adapter. However, many Toshiba external floppy drives and dongles used this same JAE connector. An amateur radio hobbyist who uses a Poqet has found a way to make a suitable adapter. It also is not totally PCMCIA Release 2.0 compatible, so not all memory cards will work, and, as Bryan Mason says on his Poqet site, only the &quot;PNB Samantha modem, Megahertz 14.4Â kbit/s modem with XJACK, and the AT&amp;T Paradyne KeepInTouch 14.4Â kbit/s modems&quot; will work in it. In addition, not all CompactFlash cards work in the Poqet. Users have found that many machines do not work with newer CF cards.

==Reception==

The Poqet PC was one of the first subnotebooks to exist in the marketplace, and still today is one of the smallest, although it is beaten by the HP 200LX. It was immediately recognized as a milestone in portable computing when PC Magazine awarded the Poqet PC development team (Ian H. S. Cullimore, John P. Fairbanks, Leroy D. Harper, Shinpei Ichikawa, Stavro Evangelo Prodromou) its coveted Technical Excellence Award for 1989. The same device that PC World called &quot;one of the 50 greatest gadgets of the last 50 years&quot; had a very short lifespan, from only about 1989-1994. After Poqet was bought by Fujitsu, the Poqet was soon axed. For a short time Poqet value declined, with the onset of Windows CE. A similar decline in HP 200LX demand also occurred after the introduction of HP Windows CE machines. However, despite the new machines&#x27; power, their operating system soon proved to be inefficient. The Poqets and HP &#x27;LX&#x27; DOS machines became very high in demand. Poqets also are in fairly high demand, but fetch somewhat lower prices. A Cherry Hill, NJ business, Disks &#x27;n&#x27; Data, once had a stock of Classics and Pluses. As the owner of the store, Jerry Tessler, put it: &quot;I sold them all in twenty minutes.&quot; Unlike running Windows CE, running DOS in near-standard specifications meant that everything from Lotus 1-2-3 to Zork worked as expected.

<doc id="147997" wikidata="Q122479" url="?curid=147997" title="Malcolm IV of Scotland">
<text>Malcolm IV (; ), nicknamed Virgo, &quot;the Maiden&quot; (between 23 April and 24 May 1141 â 9 December 1165) was King of Scotland from 1153 until his death. He was the eldest son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon and Northumbria (died 1152) and Ada de Warenne. The original Malcolm Canmore, a name now associated with his great-grandfather Malcolm III (MÃ¡el Coluim mac Donnchada), he succeeded his grandfather David I, and shared David&#x27;s Anglo-Norman tastes.

Called Malcolm the Maiden by later chroniclers, a name which may incorrectly suggest weakness or effeminacy to modern readers, he was noted for his religious zeal and interest in knighthood and warfare. For much of his reign, he was in poor health and died unmarried at the age of twenty-four.

== Accession ==
Earl Henry, son and heir of King David I of Scotland, had been in poor health throughout the 1140s. He died suddenly on 12 June 1152. His death occurred in either Newcastle or Roxburgh, both located in those areas of Northumbria which he and his father had attached to the Scots crown in the period of English weakness after the death of Henry I of England. Unlike in the case of the English king, who had been left without male heirs after the death of his only legitimate son in the shipwreck of the &quot;White Ship&quot;, the King of Scots, David I, did not lack for immediate heirs upon the death of Earl Henry. This was because Earl Henry had left behind three sons to carry forward the lineage of his father.

Malcolm, the eldest of Earl Henry&#x27;s sons, was only eleven years old when he became heir apparent. Nonetheless, he was sent by his grandfather on a circuit of the kingdom, accompanied by Donnchad, Mormaer of Fife, and a large army. Donnchad had been styled &quot;rector&quot;, perhaps indicating that he was to hold the regency for Malcolm on David&#x27;s death. These preparations were timely, because King David survived his son by less than a year, dying on 24 May 1153 at Carlisle. Malcolm was inaugurated as king on 27 May 1153 at Scone at age twelve. Donnchad, who duly became regent for the young Malcolm, ensured that the inauguration took place before the old king was even buried. This might appear unseemly, but there was good reason for the haste. Malcolm was not without rivals for the kingship. Donnchad himself died a year later, in 1154.

== Rivals and neighbours ==
The &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; claims &quot;William the Noble&quot;, son of William fitz Duncan, was the man whom &quot;every Scotsman wanted for his king&quot;. As William fitz Duncan married Alice de Rumilly c.1137, young William could only have been a youth, perhaps a child, by 1153. There is no evidence to suggest that William ever made any claims to the throne, and he died young, in the early 1160s, leaving his sizable estates to his three sisters. Of William Fitz Duncan&#x27;s other sons, Bishop Wimund had already been blinded, emasculated and imprisoned at Byland Abbey before King David&#x27;s death, but Domnall mac Uilleim, first of the Meic Uilleim, had considerable support in the Province of Moray. Another contender, imprisoned at Roxburgh since about 1130, was MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair, an illegitimate son of Alexander I. MÃ¡el Coluim&#x27;s sons were free men in 1153. They could be expected to contest the succession and did so.

As a new and young king, Malcolm also faced threats to his rule from his neighbours. Foremost among them were Somerled, King of Argyll; Fergus, Lord of Galloway; and Henry II, King of England. Only Rognvald Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney, was otherwise occupied (on a pilgrimage), and his death in 1158 brought the young and ambitious Harald Maddadsson to power in Orkney, who proved yet another threat to the young Malcolm.

The first open opposition to Malcolm came in November 1153, from family rivals, the sons of MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair. They mounted their challenge with the aid of a neighbour, Somerled of Argyll. This threat soon dissipated, because Somerled was beset with more pressing concerns: his war with GuÃ°rÃ¸Ã°r ÃlÃ¡fsson, King of the Isles lasted until 1156 and a possible conflict with Gille CrÃ­st, Mormaer of Menteith, over Cowal, loomed large. Support for the sons of MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair may also have come from areas closer to the core of the kingdom; two conspirators are named by chroniclers, one of whom died in trial by combat in February 1154.

In 1157, it is reported, King Malcolm was reconciled with MÃ¡el Coluim MacHeth, who was appointed to the Mormaerdom of Ross, which had probably been held by his father.

== Malcolm IV and Henry II ==
Malcolm was not only King of Scots but also inherited the Earldom of Northumbria, which his father and grandfather had gained during the wars between Stephen and Empress Matilda. Malcolm granted Northumbria to his brother William, keeping Cumbria for himself. Cumbria was, like the earldoms of Northumbria and Huntingdon, and later Chester, a fief of the English crown. While Malcolm delayed doing homage to Henry II of England for his possessions in Henry&#x27;s kingdom, he did so in 1157 at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire and later at Chester. Henry II refused to allow Malcolm to keep Cumbria, or William to keep Northumbria, but instead granted the Earldom of Huntingdon to Malcolm, for which Malcolm did homage.

After a second meeting between Malcolm and Henry, at Carlisle in 1158, &quot;they returned without having become good friends, and so that the king of Scots was not yet knighted.&quot; In 1159 Malcolm accompanied Henry to France, serving at the siege of Toulouse where he was, at last, knighted. &quot;Whether this was the act of a king of Scots or of an earl of Huntingdon we are not told; it was certainly the act of a man desperate for knightly arms, but that did not make it any more acceptable in Scotland.&quot;

Malcolm returned from Toulouse in 1160. At Perth, Roger of Hoveden reports, he faced a rebellion by six earls, led by Ferchar, Mormaer of Strathearn, who besieged the king. Given that Earl Ferchar heads the list of those named, it is presumed that Donnchad II, Mormaer of Fife, was not among the rebels. John of Fordun&#x27;s version in the &quot;Gesta Annalia&quot; appears to suggest a peaceful settlement to the affair, and both Fordun and Hoveden follow the report of the revolt and its ending by stating that the king led an expedition into Galloway where he eventually defeated Fergus, Lord of Galloway and took his son Uchtred as a hostage while Fergus became a monk at Holyrood, dying there in 1161. While it was assumed that the earls included Fergus among their number and that the expedition to Galloway was related to the revolt, it is now thought that the earls sought to have Malcolm attack Galloway, perhaps as a result of raids by Fergus.

Sometime before July 1163, when he did homage to Henry II, Malcolm was taken seriously ill at Doncaster. Scottish sources report that a revolt in Moray brought Malcolm north, and it is said that he:

Having made peace with Henry, replaced Fergus of Galloway with his sons, and resettled Moray, only one of Malcolm&#x27;s foes remained, Somerled, by 1160 king of the Isles as well as of Argyll. In 1164, Somerled led a large army of Islesmen and Irishmen to attack Glasgow and Renfrew, where Walter Fitzalan had newly completed a castle. There Somerled and his son Gillebrigte were killed in battle with the levies of the area, led by the Bishop of Glasgow, probably Herbert of Selkirk at that time. The chronicles of the day attributed the victory to the intercession of Saint Kentigern.

== Marriage project ==
In 1160, a marriage between Malcolm and Constance of PenthiÃ¨vre was considered. Constance&#x27;s brother Conan IV, Duke of Brittany had married Malcolm&#x27;s sister Margaret earlier the same year. However, Constance refused to marry the Scottish king, hoping to wed the French king Louis VII instead, but Louis married AdÃ¨le of Champagne.

== Death and posterity ==
Malcolm IV died on 9 December 1165 at Jedburgh, aged twenty-four. His premature death may have been hastened by Paget&#x27;s disease (a chronic disorder that typically results in enlarged and deformed bones). While his contemporaries were in no doubt that Malcolm had some of the qualities of a great king, later writers were less convinced. The compiler of the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, writing soon after 1165, praises Malcolm:

Likewise, William of Newburgh praises Malcolm, &quot;the most Christian king of the Scots&quot;, highly in his &quot;Historia Rerum Anglicarum&quot;.

Nonetheless, Malcolm was not well regarded in all quarters. The &quot;Gesta Annalia&quot; remarks:

According to legend, he had a daughter who was betrothed to Henry, Prince of Capua, on the latter&#x27;s deathbed, but this is said to be false as Malcolm had no heirs. However, since illegitimacy did not apply to medieval females, but it was often pretended that it did, she may have been overlooked. Malcolm&#x27;s mother had formulated a plan for a marriage to Constance, daughter of Conan III, Duke of Brittany, but Malcolm died before the wedding could be celebrated. This does not mean that Malcolm could not have had a concubine or mistress.

It is difficult, given the paucity of sources, to date many of the reforms of the Scoto-Norman era, but it appears that Malcolm continued the reforms begun by his grandfather and grand-uncles. The sheriffdoms of Crail, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, Forfar, Lanark and Linlithgow appear to date from Malcolm&#x27;s reign, and the office of Justiciar of Lothian may also date from this period.

Malcolm founded a Cistercian monastery at Coupar Angus, and the royal taste for continental religious foundations extended to the magnates, as in Galloway, where the Premonstratensians were established at Soulseat by 1161.

== Fictional portrayals ==
Malcolm IV has been depicted in historical novels. They include:

* &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot; (1983) by Nigel Tranter. The main character of the novel is Somerled, Lord of the Isles. The plot follows his military career, rise to power, swearing of fealty to David I of Scotland, and support of a revolt against Malcolm IV. It concludes with the murder of Somerled.
* &quot;Tapestry of the Boar&quot; (1993) by Nigel Tranter. The main character is Hugh De Swinton, a huntsman at the court of Malcolm IV. He is at first employed to slay wild boars which threaten humans, sheep and cattle of the Scottish countryside. He then serves as a scout to the army of the king during the conflict with Fergus of Galloway. Malcolm IV eventually tasks Hugh with establishing Soutra Aisle, &quot;the first real hospital for the sick and poor in Scotland&quot;.

<doc id="147998" wikidata="Q187" url="?curid=147998" title="Il Canto degli Italiani">
<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (; ) is a patriotic song written by Goffredo Mameli and set to music by Michele Novaro in 1847, currently used as the national anthem of Italy. It is best known among Italians as the &quot;&#x27;&quot; (; ), after the author of the lyrics, or &quot;&quot; (; ), from its opening line. The piece, in 4/4 time signature and B-flat major key, has six strophes, and a refrain sung after each. The sixth group of verses, almost never performed, recalls the first strophe&#x27;s text.

The song was very popular during Italian unification and the following decades. However, after the Kingdom of Italy&#x27;s 1861 proclamation, the republican and Jacobin connotations of &quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot; were difficult to reconcile with the new state&#x27;s monarchic constitution. The kingdom chose instead &quot;Marcia Reale&quot; (Royal March), the House of Savoy&#x27;s official anthem, composed by order of King Charles Albert of Sardinia in 1831.

After the Second World War, Italy became a republic. On 12 October 1946, it chose &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; as a provisional national anthem. The song would retain this role as &quot;de facto&quot; anthem of the Italian Republic, and after several unsuccessful attempts, gained &quot;de jure&quot; status on 4 December 2017.

==History==
===Origins===

The text of &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; was written by the Genoese Goffredo Mameli, then a young student and a fervent patriot, inspired by the mass mobilizations that would lead to the revolutions of 1848 and the First Italian War of Independence (1848â1849). Sources differ on the precise date of the text&#x27;s drafting: according to some scholars, Mameli wrote the hymn 10 September 1847, while others date the composition&#x27;s birth to two days before, 8 September. After discarding all extant music, on 10 November 1847 Goffredo Mameli sent the text to Turin and the Genoese composer Michele Novaro, who lived at the time with the activist Lorenzo Valerio.

The poem captured Novaro and he decided to set it to music on 24 November 1847. Thirty years later, the patriot and poet Anton Giulio Barrili recalled Novaro&#x27;s description of the event thus: 
Mameli held Republican and Jacobin sympathies and supported the French Revolution credo &quot;libertÃ©, Ã©galitÃ©, fraternitÃ©&quot;. The text of &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; drew inspiration from the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. For example, &quot;&quot; recalls the &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; verse, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Form your battalions&quot;).

In the original version of the hymn, the first line of the first verse read &quot;Hurray Italy&quot;, but Mameli changed it to &quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot; almost certainly at Novaro&#x27;s suggestion. The latter, when he received the manuscript, also added a rebellious &quot;Si!&quot; (&quot;Yes!&quot;) at the end of the final refrain.

Another verse in the first draft was dedicated to Italian women, but eliminated by Mameli before the official debut. It read: &quot;Tessete o fanciulle / bandiere e coccarde / fan l&#x27;alme gagliarde / l&#x27;invito d&#x27;amor. (. English: Weave maidens / flags and cockades / they make souls gallant / the invitation of love.)&quot;

===Debut===

On 10 December 1847, a demonstration before the in , Genoa, was officially dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the Portoria quarter&#x27;s popular rebellion during the War of the Austrian Succession, which had expulsed the Austrians from the city. In fact, it was an excuse to protest against foreign occupations in Italy and induce Charles Albert of Sardinia to embrace the Italian cause of liberty and of unity.

On this occasion, the flag of Italy was shown and Filarmonica Sestrese, the municipal band of Sestri Ponente, played Mameli&#x27;s anthem for 30,000 patriots who had come to Genoa from all over Italy for the event. This event is generally believed to be the song&#x27;s first public performance, but there may have been a previous public rendition on 9 November 1847 in Genoa, of which the original documentation was lost.

That performance would have been by the Filarmonica Voltrese founded by Goffredo&#x27;s brother , and used a first draft of &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; that differs from the final version (see above). As its author was infamously Mazzinian, the piece was forbidden by the Piedmontese police until March 1848: its execution was also forbidden by the Austrian police, which also pursued its singing interpretationÂ â considered a political crimeÂ â until their empire&#x27;s dissolution. On 18 December 1847, the Pisan newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Italia&quot; wrote how the song evoked public spirits: 

Two of Mameli&#x27;s autographed manuscripts have survived to the 21st century: the first draft, with Mameli&#x27;s hand annotations, at the , and the letter, from Mameli on 10 November 1847 to Novaro, at the Museo del Risorgimento in Turin.

Novaro&#x27;s autographed manuscript to the publisher is located in the Ricordi Historical Archive. The later Istituto Mazziniano sheet lacks the final strophe (&quot;Son giunchi che piegano...&quot;) for fear of censorship. These leaflets were to be distributed at the 10 December demonstration in Genoa. The hymn was also printed on leaflets in Genoa, by the printer Casamara.

===The following decades===
&quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; debuted with only a few months left to the revolutions of 1848. Shortly before the promulgation of the &quot;Statuto Albertino&quot;, the constitution that Charles Albert of Sardinia conceded to the Kingdom of Sardinia in Italy on 4 March 1848, political gatherings of more than ten people had become legal, and catchy songs like &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; could spread by word of mouth. Patriots from the 10 December demonstration spread the hymn all over the Italian peninsula. The hymn was very popular among the Italian people and the ranks of the Republican volunteers. It was commonly sung in most parts of Italy during demonstrations, protests and revolts as a symbol of the Italian unification.

The Savoyard authorities censored the fifth strophe to preserve diplomatic relations with the Austrians; but after the declaration of war against the Austrian Empire and the beginning of the First Italian War of Independence (1848â1849), the soldiers and the Savoy military bands performed it so frequently that King Charles Albert was forced to withdraw all censorship. The rebels sang &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; during the Five Days of Milan and at Charles Albert of Piedmont-Sardinia&#x27;s promulgation of the &quot;Statuto Albertino&quot; (also in 1848). Volunteers for the brief Roman Republic (1849) sang it, and Giuseppe Garibaldi hummed and whistled it during the defense of Rome and the flight to Venice.

===From the unification of Italy to the First World War===
In the 1860, the corps of volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi used to sing the hymn in the battles against the Bourbons in Sicily and Southern Italy during the Expedition of the Thousand. Giuseppe Verdi, in his &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot; (&quot;Hymn of the nations&quot;), composed for the London International Exhibition of 1862, chose &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; to represent Italy, putting it beside &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.

After the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy (1861), the &quot;Marcia Reale&quot; (&quot;Royal March&quot;), composed in 1831, was chosen as the national anthem of unified Italy. &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; had too radical content, with its strong republican and Jacobin connotations, and did not combine well with the monarchical conclusion to the unification of Italy. Mameli&#x27;s republicanÂ â in fact MazzinianÂ â creed, was, however, more historical than political, and socialist and anarchist circles also disliked &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; as too conservative. 
The song was one of the most common songs during the Third Italian War of Independence (1866). At the Capture of Rome on 20 September 1870, the last step in Italian unification, choirs sang it together with &quot;La bella Gigogin&quot; and the &quot;Marcia Reale&quot;; and &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; received bersaglieri fanfare.

After the end of the Italian unification, &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; was taught in schools, and remained very popular among Italians. However, other musical pieces connected to the political and social situation of the time, such as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Hymn of the Workers&quot;) or &quot;Goodbye to Lugano&quot;, addressed everyday problems. These partly obscured the popularity of reunification hymns.

&quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot;, thanks to references to patriotism and armed struggle, returned to success during the Italo-Turkish War (1911â1912), where it joined &quot;A Tripoli&quot;; and in the trenches of the First World War (1915â1918). That time&#x27;s Italian irredentism found a symbol in &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, although in the years following he would have been preferred, in the patriotic ambit, musical pieces of greater military style such as &quot;La Leggenda del Piave&quot;, the &quot; or &quot;. Shortly after Italy entered the First World War, on 25 July 1915, Arturo Toscanini performed &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; at an interventionist demonstration.

===During fascism===
Fascist chants, such as &quot;Giovinezza&quot; (or &quot;Inno Trionfale del Partito Nazionale Fascista&quot;) took on great importance, after the 1922 March on Rome. Although not official anthems, they were widely disseminated, publicized, and taught in schools. Non-fascist melodies, including &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani,&quot; were discouraged.

In 1932, the National Fascist Party secretary Achille Starace decided to prohibit musical pieces that did not sing to Benito Mussolini and, more generally, did not link to fascism. &quot;Subversive&quot; songs, i.e. those of anarchist or socialist type, such as the anthem of the workers or &quot;The Internationale&quot;, and non-sympathetic foreign nations&#x27; official anthems, such as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, were banned. Sympathetic regimes&#x27; anthems, such as the Nazi hymn &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; and the Francoist song &quot;Cara al Sol&quot;, were contrariwise encouraged. After the 1929 Lateran Treaty with the Holy See, anti-clerical passages were also banned.

In the spirit of this directive, some songs were resized, such as &quot;La Leggenda del Piave&quot;, sung almost exclusively during the National Unity and Armed Forces Day every 4 November. The chants used during the Italian unification were however tolerated: &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, which was forbidden in official ceremonies, received a certain condescension on particular occasions.

During the Second World War, regime musicians released fascist pieces via radio, but very few songs spontaneously arose among the population. Songs like &quot;A primavera viene il bello&quot;, &quot;Battaglioni M&quot;, &quot;Vincere!&quot; and &quot;Camerata Richard&quot; were common. The most famous spontaneous song was &quot;&quot;.

After the 8 September 1943 armistice, the Italian government provisionally adopted as a national anthem &quot;La Leggenda del Piave&quot;, replacing the &quot;Marcia Reale&quot;. Cooperation with the fascist dictatorship was now egg on the monarchy&#x27;s face; a song that recalled the Italian victory in World War I could infuse courage and hope to the Royal Italian Army troops who now fought against Mussolini&#x27;s Social Republic and Nazi Germany.

&quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot; resounded in Allies-freed Southern Italy and partisan-controlled areas to the north. &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, in particular, had a good success in anti-fascist circles, where it joined partisan songs &quot;Fischia il vento&quot; and &quot;Bella ciao&quot;. Some scholars believe that the success of the piece in anti-fascist circles then was decisive for its choice as provisional anthem of the Italian Republic.

Often, &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; is wrongly referred to as the national anthem of the Fascist era. However, Mussolini&#x27;s Republic had no official anthem, playing &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; and &quot;Giovinezza&quot; equally often at the ceremonies. &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; retained value to the fascists only for propaganda.

So Mameli&#x27;s hymn was, curiously, sung by both partisans and fascists.

===From provisional to official anthem===
In 1945, at the end of the war, Arturo Toscanini directed a performance of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s 1862 &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot; in London, including &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;. However, even after the birth of the Italian Republic, &quot;La Leggenda del Piave&quot; remained the temporary national anthem.

For the new anthem, a debate arose. Possible options included &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot;; a completely new piece; &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;; the &quot;Inno di Garibaldi&quot;; and confirmation of &quot;La Leggenda del Piave&quot;. The government then approved Republican War Minister Cipriano Facchinetti&#x27;s proposal to adopt &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; as provisional anthem.

&quot;La Leggenda del Piave&quot; thus served as national anthem until the Council of Ministers meeting on 12 October 1946, when Facchinetti officially announced the provisional anthem for the 4 November National Unity and Armed Forces Day celebrations. The press release stated:

Facchinetti also declared that a draft decree would be proposed to confirm &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; as the provisional national anthem of the newly formed Republic, but did not follow up on this promise. Instead, he proposed to formalize &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; in the Constitution of Italy, then being drafted.

The Constitution, finished in 1948, determined the national flag , but did not establish a national anthem or emblem; the latter was adopted by legislative decree on 5 May. A draft constitutional law prepared immediately afterwards sought to insert, after discussion of the national flag, the sentence &quot;The Anthem of the Republic is the &#x27;Il Canto degli Italiani&#x27;&quot;. This law, too, stalled.

&quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; nonetheless had great success among Italian emigrants: &quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot; scores are sold in Little Italies across the Anglosphere, and &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; is often played on more or less official occasions in North and South America. In particular, it was the &quot;soundtrack&quot; of post-WWII fundraisers in the Americas for the Italian population left devastated by the conflict.

President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, began, from 1999 to 2006, to revive &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; as a national symbol of Italy. Ciampi declared that: 

In August 2016, a bill was submitted to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to make &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; Italy&#x27;s national anthem, and passed out of committee in July 2017. On 15 December 2017, on &quot;Gazzetta Ufficiale&quot; law nÂº 181 of 4 December 2017, was published after passing both houses of Parliament, and the law came into force on 30 December 2017.

==Lyrics==

This is the complete Italian anthem text, as commonly performed on official occasions. Goffredo Mameli&#x27;s original poem includes neither repetitions nor the loud &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yes!&quot;) at the end of the chorus.

The first strophe presents a personification of Italy who is ready to war to become free, and shall be victorious as Rome was in ancient times, &quot;wearing&quot; the helmet of Scipio Africanus who defeated Hannibal at the final battle of the Second Punic War. It also alludes to the ancient Roman custom that slaves cut their hair short as a sign of servitude: hence the Goddess of Victory must cut her hair and enslave herself to Rome (to make Italy victorious).

In the second strophe the author complains that Italy has been a divided nation for a long time, and calls for unity. In this strophe Mameli uses three poetic and archaic words: (modern Italian: ), (modern ), (modern ).

The third strophe is an invocation to God to protect the loving union of the Italians struggling to unify their nation once and for all. The fourth strophe recalls popular heroic figures and moments of the Italian fight for independence: the battle of Legnano, the defence of Florence led by Ferruccio during the Italian Wars, the riot started in Genoa by Balilla, and the Sicilian Vespers. The fifth strophe unequivocally marks Habsburg Austria as the Italian cause&#x27;s primary enemy. It also links the Polish quest for independence to the Italian one.

The sixth and final verse, almost never performed, is missing in Mameli&#x27;s original draft but appears in his second manuscript. However, it was omitted in the first printed editions of the text on the leaflet. The verse joyfully announces the unity of Italy and goes on to close the song with the same six lines that conclude the initial verse, thus giving the poem a circular structure.

== Music ==
Novaro&#x27;s musical composition is written in a typical marching time (4/4) and the key of B-flat major. It has a catchy character and an easy melodic line that simplifies memory and execution. On the harmonic and rhythmic level, the composition presents greater complexity.

From a musical point of view, the piece is divided into three parts: the introduction, the strophes and the refrain.

The twelve-bar introduction is an instrumental at &quot;allegro martial&quot; pace, with a dactyl rhythm that alternates one-eighth-note two-sixteenth-notes. The introduction divides into three four-bar segments, each alternating between a tonic chord and its dominant. The first four bars are in Bâ­ major; the second in G minor; and the last four bars return to Bâ­ to introduce the verses.

The strophes, therefore, attack in Bâ­. They repeat the same melodic unit, in various degrees and at different pitches. Each melodic unit corresponds to a fragment of the Mamelian hexasyllable, in accordance with the classical bipartite scheme (&quot;Fratelli / d&#x27;Italia / &#x27; Italia / s&#x27;Ã¨ desta&quot;). However, the usual leap of a diatonic interval does not match the anacrusic rhythm: on the contrary, the verses Â«Fratelli / d&#x27;ItaliaÂ» and Â«dell&#x27;elmo / di ScipioÂ» each begin with identical notes (respectively F or D). This weakens the syllable accentuation, and produces an audibly syncopated effect, contrasting the natural short-long succession of the paroxytone verse.

As written, the basic melodic unit combines a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note: &lt;score sound=1&gt;\relative f&#x27; { \clef treble \time 4/4 \key bes \major r2 r4 f4 f8. g16 f4 r4 d&#x27;4 d8. ees16 d4 r4 d4 f8. ees16 d4 r4 c4 d8. c16 bes4 r4 } \addlyrics { Fra â tel â li d&#x27;I â ta â lia, l&#x27;I â ta â lia s&#x27;Ã¨ de â sta }&lt;/score&gt;

Some performances soften this rhythmic scan by equalizing the note durations (as an eighth note), for ease of singing and listening:
&lt;score sound=1&gt;\relative f&#x27; { \clef treble \time 4/4 \key bes \major r2 r4 f4 f8 g8 f4 r4 d&#x27;4 d8 ees8 d4 r4 d4 f8 ees8 d4 r4 c4 d8 c8 bes4 r4 } \addlyrics { Fra â tel â li d&#x27;I â ta â lia, l&#x27;I â ta â lia s&#x27;Ã¨ de â sta }&lt;/score&gt;

At bar 31, the song undergoes an unusual shift for the refrain recognizable in the most accredited recordings of the autograph score. It accelerates to an &quot;allegro mosso&quot;, and permanently modulates to Eâ­ major, yielding only to the relative minor (C minor) during the tercet &quot;Stringiamci a coorte / siam pronti alla morte / L&#x27;Italia chiamÃ²&quot;. Also, the refrain is characterized by a repeated melodic unit; in the last five bars, it grows in intensity, passing from &quot;pianissimo&quot; to &quot;forte&quot; to &quot;fortissimo&quot; with the indication &quot;crescendo e accelerando sino alla fine&quot; (&quot;growing and accelerating to the end&quot;).

==Recordings==

The two authors have been dead for more than 70 years, and the copyrights have lapsed; the work is public domain. Novaro disclaimed compensation for printing music, ascribing his work to the patriotic cause. Giuseppe Magrini, who made the first print of &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, asked only for a certain number of printed copies for personal use. At Tito Ricordi&#x27;s 1859 request to reprint the text of the song with his publishing house, Novaro ordered that the money be directly paid in favour of a subscription for Giuseppe Garibaldi.

Nevertheless, the publisher Sonzogno has attempted to collect royalties for use of the &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; score. It also has the possibility of making the official prints of the piece.

The oldest known sound recording of &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; (disc at 78 rpm for gramophone, 17Â cm in diameter) is a 1901 recording of the Municipal Band of Milan under the direction of .

One of the first recordings of &quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot; was that of 9 June 1915, which was performed by the Neapolitan opera and music singer . The song was recorded for the label of Naples.

Another ancient recording received is that of the Gramophone Band, recorded in London for His Master&#x27;s Voice on 23 January 1918.

==During events==
Over the years a public ritual has been established for the anthem&#x27;s performance, still in force. According to the custom, whenever the anthem is played, if in an outdoor military ceremony personnel in formation present arms while personnel not in formation stand at attention (unless when saluting during the raising and lowering of the national flag, as well as the trooping of the national flag for service or unit decorations). If indoors (including military band concerts), all personnel stand at attention. Civilians, if they wish, can also put themselves to attention. On the occasion of official events, only the first two stanzas should be performed without the introduction. If the event is institutional, and a foreign hymn must also be performed, this is played first as an act of courtesy.

In 1970, the obligation, however, to perform the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; of Ludwig van Beethoven, that is the official anthem of Europe, whenever &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; is played, remained almost always unfulfilled.

<text>Hormel Foods Corporation, doing business as Hormel Foods or simply Hormel, is an American multinational food processing company founded in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, by George A. Hormel as George A. Hormel &amp; Company. The company originally focused on the packaging and selling of ham, sausage and other pork, chicken, beef and lamb products to consumers, adding Spam in 1937. By the 1980s, Hormel began offering a wider range of packaged and refrigerated foods. The company changed its name to Hormel Foods Corporation in 1993 and uses the Hormel brand on many of its products; the company&#x27;s other brands include Planters, Columbus Craft Meats, Dinty Moore, Jennie-O, and Skippy. The company&#x27;s products are available in over 80 countries worldwide.

==History==
===18901920===
 The company was founded as George A. Hormel &amp; Company in Austin, Minnesota, by George A. Hormel in 1891. It changed its name to Hormel Foods in 1993.

George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there. He borrowed $500 and opened a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail. Their partnership dissolved in 1891 as Hormel started his own meat packing operation in northeast Austin in a creamery building on the Cedar River.

To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. The name was first used in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham.

In 1915, Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami. Hormel products began appearing in national magazines, such as &quot;Good Housekeeping,&quot; as early as 1916.

===19201950===

In 1921, when George&#x27;s son Jay Hormel returned from service in World War I, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to professionalize his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products, reportedly with the mantra âOriginate, don&#x27;t imitate&quot;. In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America&#x27;s first canned ham, and added a canned chicken product line in 1928. Throughout the 1930s, Hormel ads were featured on the radio program &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;.

Hormel Chili and Spam were introduced in 1936 and 1937 respectively. In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the &quot;Joint Savings Plan&quot; which allowed employees to share in the profits of the company.

In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation&#x27;s first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).

By 1942, George and Jay established the Hormel Foundation to act as trustees of the family trusts. The Foundation funded the Hormel Institute at the University of Minnesota, initially started with a study of the food value of soybeans. The institute&#x27;s scope later grew towards studying nutrition, animal diseases and food technology. Hormel&#x27;s production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945. founder George Hormel died in March 1946 at age 85.

===19502000===
In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.
Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961 and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963. Unfortunately Little Sizzler&#x27;s sausage has been discontinued per 10/10/19 email from Hormel&#x27;s Customer Service.

Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985. In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi&#x27;s brand products. The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon. In 1984, Hormel introduced the Frank &#x27;n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.

In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.

Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike. It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s.

The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. A commemorative mural painted by Mike Alewitz and P-9 workers during the strike was destroyed by the UFCW months after the strike ended. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized consumer boycott of Hormel products. The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months.

===20002010===

The Spam Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.

According to Triple Pundit, Hormel Foods began CSR reporting in 2006. The company has been included in &quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 best corporate citizens&quot; for 10 consecutive years.

In 2008 an article in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More&quot;, detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy. In 2009 Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States. Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi&#x27;s, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.

In September 2008, animal rights organization PETA released a video recorded over the course of three months showing workers at a pig factory farm in Iowa abusing pigs. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.

===2010present===

In 2011, Hormel Foods announced a two-for-one stock split. In 2013, Hormel Foods purchased Skippyâthe best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the worldâfrom Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy&#x27;s American and Chinese factories.

In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of meat products.

In 2015, the Hormel Health Labs division of Hormel Foods launched its Hormel Vital Cuisine line of packaged ready to eat meals, nutrition shakes and whey protein powders geared towards cancer patients and made available for home delivery. The line was developed in concert with three parties, as &quot;Hormel brought food formulation, packaging and shelf stability knowledge, (chef de cuisine) Ron DeSantis brought taste and texture expertise, and the Cancer Nutrition Consortium offered the nutritional framework.&quot;

In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS). Four years earlier, the company had made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans of this product to in-need families in Guatemala.

Also in 2015, after an undercover investigation by a group known as Compassion Over Killing at an Austin, Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was &quot;bringing humane handling officers to a Quality Pork Processors Incorporated facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards.&quot; It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. According to Reuters, &quot;in one scene of the video, pigs covered in feces or pus-filled abscesses are sent down the plantâs conveyor belt. At one point, a knife is used to cut open abscesses on dead pigs.&quot;

In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar. Also in 2016, Hormel acquired the nut butter producer Justin&#x27;s for 280 million.

In 2016, 2017, and 2018, the company was named as one of the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Best Places to Work for LGBT equality. In 2019, Hormel was again named to one of the best places to work for LGBT equality, as the company obtained a 95 out of 100 score in the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s &quot;Corporate Equality Index&quot;. The almost-perfect score was due to the area of &quot;equivalency in same and different-sex domestic partner medical and soft benefits&quot;, where Hormel received half-credit for providing parity in some, but not all, benefits.

In 2017, Hormel sold Clougherty Packing, owner of the Farmer John and Saag&#x27;s brands, to Smithfield Foods.

In October 2017, Hormel announced it would acquire deli meat company Columbus Manufacturing for $850 million.

In 2017, Mercy For Animals released undercover video footage of pigs being abused at The Maschhoffs LLC., a Hormel pork supplier in Hinton, Oklahoma, with piglets being castrated and having their tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, and mother pigs crammed into gestation crates unable to move. In response, Hormel temporarily suspended its buying from the supplier.

According to the Military Times, the company has been listed in the top 100 Best for Vets Employers category consistently since 2013.

In April 2019, together with Harvard University Dining Services, the company hosted the Small Change Big Impact Food Summit at Harvard University.

In September 2019, Hormel Foods announced that they had achieved their non-renewable energy use reduction goal a year ahead of schedule.

Also in September 2019, the company launched a vegetarian meat alternative called Happy Little Plants for foodservice and retail customers.

On September 18, 2020, Hormel Foods hosted the world&#x27;s largest virtual pizza party, when more than 3,000 people joined a Zoom-hosted pizza party. In order to break the record, at least 500 photos of individuals needed to be uploaded during the one-hour event. The final tally was 907 photos.

In February 2021, Kraft Heinz announced it would be selling its Planters and its other nuts businesses to Hormel for $3.35 billion.

===Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic===

On April 18, 2020, local health officials shut down a Hormel Foods plant in Rochelle, Illinois, that employed 800 people after at least 24 workers tested positive for coronavirus. On April 21, Hormel announced the closure of three meat processing plants, including its Alma Foods plant in Alma, Kansas. That plant employs about 100 workers and at least one worker tested positive for the coronavirus. Hormel also closed its Don Miguel Foods factory in Dallas, Texas, which is a joint venture with a Mexico City company, Herdez Del Fuerte. The plant made pork, beef and chicken burritos and tacos, and employed about 700 workers. On April 24, Hormel announced the closure of two plants in Willmar, Minnesota, after 14 workers tested positive for coronavirus. These Jennie-O turkey plants employed over 1,200 workers.

In October 2020, Hormel launched a bacon scented protective mask giveaway charity promotion.

<doc id="148000" wikidata="Q214648" url="?curid=148000" title="Samson">
<text>Samson (; &quot;Å Ä«mÅ¡Ån&quot; &quot;man of the sun&quot;) was the last of the judges of the ancient Israelites mentioned in the Book of Judges (chapters 13 to 16) and one of the last leaders who &quot;judged&quot; Israel before the institution of the monarchy. He is sometimes considered as an Israelite version of the popular Near Eastern folk hero also embodied by the Sumerian Gilgamesh and Enkidu, as well as the Greek Heracles. Samson was given superhuman powers by Yahweh in the form of extreme strength.

The biblical account states that Samson was a Nazirite and that he was given immense strength to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring a Philistine army with a donkey&#x27;s jawbone. The cutting of Samson&#x27;s long hair would violate his Nazirite vow and nullify his ability.

Samson is betrayed by his lover Delilah, who, sent by Philistine officials to entice him, orders a servant to cut his hair while he is sleeping and turns him over to the Philistines, who gouge out his eyes and force him to mill grain at Gaza City. While there, his hair begins to grow again. When the Philistines take Samson into their temple of Dagon, Samson asks to rest against one of the support pillars. After being granted permission, he prays to God and miraculously recovers his strength, allowing him to bring down the columnscollapsing the temple and killing both himself and the Philistines. In some Jewish traditions, Samson is believed to have been buried in Zorah in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley (also considered his birthplace). 

Samson has been the subject of rabbinic, Christian, and Islamic commentary, with some Christians viewing him as a type of Jesus, based on similarities between their lives. Notable depictions of Samson include John Milton&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; and Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1949 Hollywood film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. Samson also plays a major role in Western art and traditions.

==Biblical narrative==

===Birth===
According to the account in the Book of Judges, Samson lived during a time of repeated conflict between Israel and Philistia, when God was disciplining the Israelites by giving them &quot;into the hand of the Philistines&quot;. Manoah was an Israelite from Zorah, descended from the Danites, and his wife had been unable to conceive. The Angel of the Lord appears to Manoah&#x27;s wife and proclaims that the couple would soon have a son who would begin to deliver the Israelites from the Philistines.

The Angel of the Lord states that Manoah&#x27;s wife was to abstain from all alcoholic drinks, unclean foods, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair. He was to be a Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. Manoah&#x27;s wife believes the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prays and asks God to send the messenger once again to teach them how to raise the boy who is going to be born.

After the Angel of the Lord returns, Manoah asks him his name, but he says, &quot;Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.&quot; Manoah then prepares a sacrifice, but the Angel of the Lord will only allow it to be for God. He touches it with his staff, miraculously engulfing it in flames, and then ascends into the sky in the fire. This is such dramatic evidence of the nature of the Messenger that Manoah fears for his life, since it was said that no one could live after seeing God. However, his wife convinces him that, if God planned to slay them, he would never have revealed such things to them. In due time, their son Samson is born, and he is raised according to the angel&#x27;s instructions.

===Marriage to a Philistine===

When he is a young adult, Samson leaves the hills of his people to see the cities of Philistia. He falls in love with a Philistine woman from Timnah, whom he decides to marry, ignoring the objections of his parents over the fact that she is not an Israelite. In the development of the narrative, the intended marriage is shown to be part of God&#x27;s plan to strike at the Philistines.

According to the biblical account, Samson is repeatedly seized by the &quot;Spirit of the Lord,&quot; who blesses him with immense strength. The first instance of this is seen when Samson is on his way to ask for the Philistine woman&#x27;s hand in marriage, when he is attacked by a lion. He simply grabs it and rips it apart, as the spirit of God divinely empowers him. However, Samson keeps it a secret, not even mentioning the miracle to his parents. He arrives at the Philistine&#x27;s house and becomes betrothed to her. He returns home, then comes back to Timnah some time later for the wedding. On his way, Samson sees that bees have nested in the carcass of the lion and made honey. He eats a handful of the honey and gives some to his parents.

At the wedding feast, Samson tells a riddle to his thirty groomsmen (all Philistines). If they can solve it, he will give them thirty pieces of fine linen and garments, but if they cannot they must give him thirty pieces of fine linen and garments. The riddle is a veiled account of two encounters with the lion, at which only he was present:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Out of the eater came something to eat.
Out of the strong came something sweet.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Philistines are infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen tell Samson&#x27;s new wife that they will burn her and her father&#x27;s household if she did not discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them. At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson gives her the solution, and she passes it on to the thirty groomsmen.

Before sunset on the seventh day, they say to him,
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;What is sweeter than honey?
and what is stronger than a lion?&lt;/poem&gt;
Samson replies,
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;If you had not plowed with my heifer,
you would not have solved my riddle.&lt;/poem&gt;

Samson then travels to Ashkelon (a distance of roughly 30 miles) where he strikes down thirty Philistines for their garments; he then returns and gives those garments to his thirty groomsmen.
 In a rage, Samson returns to his father&#x27;s house. The family of his bride instead give her to one of the groomsmen as wife. Some time later, Samson returns to Timnah to visit his wife, unaware that she is now married to one of his former groomsmen. But her father refuses to allow Samson to see her, offering to give Samson a younger sister instead.

Samson goes out, gathers 300 foxes, and ties them together in pairs by their tails. He then attaches a burning torch to each pair of foxes&#x27; tails and turns them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learn why Samson burned their crops and burn Samson&#x27;s wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.

In revenge, Samson slaughters many Philistines, saying, &quot;I have done to them what they did to me.&quot; Samson then takes refuge in a cave in the rock of Etam. An army of Philistines go to the tribe of Judah and demand that 3,000 men of Judah deliver them Samson. With Samson&#x27;s consent, given on the condition that the Judahites would not kill him themselves, they tie him with two new ropes and are about to hand him over to the Philistines when he breaks free of the ropes. Using the jawbone of an ass, he slays 1,000 Philistines.

===Delilah===

Later, Samson travels to Gaza, where he sees a prostitute () and visits her. His enemies wait at the gate of the city to ambush him, but he tears the gate from its very hinges and frame and carries it to &quot;the hill that is in front of Hebron&quot;.

He then falls in love with Delilah in the valley of Sorek. The Philistines approach Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson&#x27;s strength so that they can capture their enemy, but Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her, telling her that he will lose his strength if he is bound with fresh bowstrings. She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings. She persists, and he tells her that he can be bound with new ropes. She ties him up with new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too. She asks again, and he says that he can be bound if his locks are woven into a weaver&#x27;s loom. She weaves them into a loom, but he simply destroys the entire loom and carries it off when he wakes.

Delilah, however, persists and Samson finally capitulates and tells Delilah that God supplies his power because of his consecration to God as a Nazirite, symbolized by the fact that a razor has never touched his head and that if his hair is cut off the vow would be broken and he would lose his strength. Delilah then woos him to sleep &quot;in her lap&quot; and calls in the servants to cut his hair.


===Death===
One day, the Philistine leaders assemble in a temple for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, one of their most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watchand all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. However, while in prison his hair had begun to grow again. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.

After his death, Samson&#x27;s family recovered his body from the rubble and buried him near the tomb of his father Manoah. A tomb structure which some attribute to Samson and his father stands on the top of the mountain in Tel Tzora, although a separate tradition passed down by the traveler Isaac Chelo in 1334 alleges that Samson was buried at the monument known as &quot;al-JÄrib&quot; in &quot;Sheikh AbÅ« MezÄr&quot;, a village (now ruin) located near Tel Beit Shemesh. Near the village there used to be shown a hewn rock, known as &quot;Qal&#x27;at al-mafrazah&quot;, on whose top and sides are quarried different impressions and thought to be the altar built by Manoah. At the conclusion of Judges 16, it is said that Samson had &quot;judged&quot; Israel for twenty years.

Rabbinic literature identifies Samson with Bedan, a Judge mentioned by Samuel in his farewell address () among the Judges who delivered Israel from their enemies. However, the name &quot;Bedan&quot; is not found in the Book of Judges. The name &quot;Samson&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;Å¡emeÅ¡&quot;, which means &quot;sun&quot;, so that Samson bore the name of God, who is called &quot;a sun and shield&quot; in ; and as God protected Israel, so did Samson watch over it in his generation, judging the people even as did God. Samson&#x27;s strength was divinely derived (Talmud, Tractate Sotah 10a).

Jewish legend records that Samson&#x27;s shoulders were sixty cubits broad. Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain that this is not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society; rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders. He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath&#x27;s, brought woe upon its possessor.

In licentiousness, he is compared with Amnon and Zimri, both of whom were punished for their sins. Samson&#x27;s eyes were put out because he had &quot;followed them&quot; too often. (As his eyes led him astray by lust, this was the reason he was blinded.) It is said that, in the twenty years during which Samson judged Israel, he never required the least service from an Israelite, and he piously refrained from taking the name of God in vain. Therefore, as soon as he told Delilah that he was a Nazarite of God, she immediately knew that he had spoken the truth. When he pulled down the temple of Dagon and killed himself and the Philistines, the structure fell backward so that he was not crushed, his family being thus enabled to find his body and to bury it in the tomb of his father.

In the Talmudic period, some seem to have denied that Samson was a historical figure, regarding him instead as a purely mythological personage. This was viewed as heretical by the rabbis of the Talmud, and they attempted to refute this. They named Hazzelelponi as his mother in Numbers Rabbah Naso 10 and in Bava Batra 91a and stated that he had a sister named &quot;Nishyan&quot; or &quot;Nashyan&quot;.

===Christian interpretations===

Samson&#x27;s story has also garnered commentary from a Christian perspective; the Epistle to the Hebrews praises him for his faith. Ambrose, following the portrayal of Josephus and Pseudo-Philo, represents Delilah as a Philistine prostitute, and declares that &quot;men should avoid marriage with those outside the faith, lest, instead of love of one&#x27;s spouse, there be treachery.&quot; Caesarius of Arles interpreted Samson&#x27;s death as prefiguring the crucifixion of Jesus, remarking: &quot;Notice here an image of the cross. Samson extends his hands spread out to the two columns as to the two beams of the cross.&quot; He also equates Delilah with Satan, who tempted Christ.

Following this trend, more recent Christian commentators have viewed Samson as a type of Jesus Christ, based on similarities between Samson&#x27;s story and the life of Jesus in the New Testament. Samson&#x27;s and Jesus&#x27; births were both foretold by angels, who predicted that they would save their people. Samson was born to a barren woman, and Jesus was born of a virgin. Samson defeated a lion; Jesus defeated Satan, whom the First Epistle of Peter describes as a &quot;roaring lion looking for someone to devour&quot;. Samson&#x27;s betrayal by Delilah has also been compared to Jesus&#x27; betrayal by Judas Iscariot; both Delilah and Judas were paid in pieces of silver for their respective deeds. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer notes in his &quot;A Guide to Scripture History: The Old Testament&quot; that Samson was &quot;blinded, insulted [and] enslaved&quot; prior to his death, and that Jesus was &quot;blindfolded, insulted, and treated as a slave&quot; prior to his crucifixion. Brewer also compares Samson&#x27;s death among &quot;the wicked&quot; with Christ being crucified between two thieves.

=== Islamic literature ===

The Quran and authentic hadith never mentions Samson by name and characteristics specifically. However, there is several non-canonical works of Quran exegesis and scholastic traditions among Islamic literatures that mention Samson, which mentioned as Samson () in Islamic literatures, particularly In the study of Tafsir.

Ibn Abi Hatim, a Hadith scholar and son of Abu Hatim Muhammad ibn Idris al-Razi, mentioned Samson in his exegesis by quoting the opinion of Mujahid ibn Jabr where he described Samson as &quot;an Israelite who wore armor and struggling in the way of God for 1,000 months&quot;.

Al-Tabari and Abu Ishaq al-Tha&#x27;labi incorporated the biblical figure of Samson into the Quranic prophetic world. Al-Tabari in particular has given details in History of the Prophets and Kings by incorporating biblical narratives with the authority of IsraÊ¼iliyyat tradition from Wahb ibn Munabbih, that his mother gave birth to him after she made a &quot;Nazar&quot; (vow) to God. Samson lived nearby a Paganism society, where he actively raided their settlement alone, armed with a camel&#x27;s jawbone and always obtained spoils of war from his successful raids. This tradition of Tabari was traced from one of his teacher, Muhammad ibn Hamid ar-Razi. This tradition by Muhammad ibn Hamid also recorded by Al-Dhahabi through the records from Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Tabari, and al-Baghawi. However, al-Dhahabi also reported that the tradition from Muhammad Ibn Hamid were deemed inauthentic or flawed narrator by Hadith experts such as Ya&#x27;qub ibn Syaibah and Muhammad al-Bukhari. Furthermore, Ibn Ishaq also criticize the transmitter whose Muhammad ibn Hamid received from, which was Salamah ibn al-Fadl. Ibn Ishaq deemed him as unreliable narrator who were notorious for narrating traditions without stating his sources.

Abu Ishaq al-Tha&#x27;labi featured al-Tabari&#x27;s narration in his tafsir with more extensive details, where the Nisba (onomastics) of Samson was &quot;Shamsun ibn Masuh&quot;. Furthermore, Abu Ishaq added the raids of Samson against the paganic kingdom were happened for the span of 1,000 month and killed &quot;thousands of infidels&quot;, where it became a proverb in the saying âbetter than a thousand months&quot; for the &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot; (Night of Power) which believed by Muslims as a moment of night where every good deeds and faith observance multiplied for more than 1,000 months.

Ibn Kathir has recorded in his Tafsir Ibn Kathir that the interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an episode Al-Qadr verses 3-4 was about the lifetime of Samson, who goes to Jihad (religious war) for the span of 1,000 month (83 years). Badr al-Din al-Ayni mentioned in his work of Umdat al-Qari Hadiths of Sahih al-Bukhari exegesis, about the similar episode of the religious war done by Samson in 1,000 month. Meanwhile, Tafsir al-Tha&#x27;labi work by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Thalabi also recorded this narration about Samson episode in Al-Qadr chapter interpretation. Aahmad al-Thalabi also interpreted that Samson was considered as one of Prophets and messengers in Islam and bestowed honorific Peace Be Upon Him for Samson. Tha&#x27;labi traced his interpretation to Wahb ibn Munabbih.

===Scholarly===
====Comparison with other religious and mythological figures====
Some modern academics have interpreted Samson as a solar deity, as a demi-god (such as Hercules or Enkidu, among others) somehow enfolded into Jewish religious lore, or as an archetypical folk hero.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some comparative mythologists interpreted Samson as a euhemerized solar deity, arguing that Samson&#x27;s name is derived from Hebrew &quot;Å¡emeÅ¡&quot;, meaning &quot;Sun&quot;, and that his long hair might represent the Sun&#x27;s rays. These solar theorists also pointed out that the legend of Samson is set within the general vicinity of Beth Shemesh, a village whose name means &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot;. They argued that the name &quot;Delilah&quot; may have been a wordplay with the Hebrew word for night, &quot;layla&quot;, which &quot;consumes&quot; the day. Although this hypothesis is still sometimes promoted in scholarly circles, it has generally fallen out of favor due to the superficiality of supporting evidence.

An interpretation far more popular among current scholars holds that Samson is a Hebrew variant of the same international Near Eastern folk hero which inspired the earlier Mesopotamian Enkidu and the later Greek Heracles (and, by extension, his Roman Hercules adaptation). Heracles and Samson both slew a lion bare-handed (the former killed the Nemean lion). Likewise, they were both believed to have once been extremely thirsty and drunk water which poured out from a rock, and to have torn down the gates of a city. They were both betrayed by a woman (Heracles by Deianira, Samson by Delilah), who led them to their respective dooms. Both heroes, champions of their respective peoples, die by their own hands: Heracles ends his life on a pyre; whereas Samson makes the Philistine temple collapse upon himself and his enemies. In this interpretation, the annunciation of Samson&#x27;s birth to his mother is a censored account of divine conception.

Samson also strongly resembles Shamgar, another hero mentioned in the Book of Judges, who, in , is described as having slain 600 Philistines with an ox-goad.

====Traditional views====
These views are disputed by traditional and conservative biblical scholars who consider Samson to be a literal historical figure and thus reject any connections to mythological heroes. The concept of Samson as a &quot;solar hero&quot; has been described as &quot;an artificial ingenuity&quot;. Joan Comay, co-author of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Bible: The Old Testament and the Apocrypha, The New Testament&quot;, believes that the biblical story of Samson is so specific concerning time and place that Samson was undoubtedly a real person who pitted his great strength against the oppressors of Israel.

====Religious and moral meaning or lack of it====
In contrast, James King West considers that the hostilities between the Philistines and Hebrews appear to be of a &quot;purely personal and local sort&quot;. He also considers that Samson stories have, in contrast to much of Judges, an &quot;almost total lack of a religious or moral tone&quot;.

Conversely, Elon Gilad of &quot;Haaretz&quot; writes &quot;some biblical stories are flat-out cautions against marrying foreign women, none more than the story of Samson&quot;. Gilad notes how Samson&#x27;s parents disapprove of his desire to marry a Philistine woman and how Samson&#x27;s relationship with Delilah leads to his demise. He contrasts this with what he sees as a more positive portrayal of intermarriage in the Book of Ruth.

====Suicide terrorist====
Some academic writers have interpreted Samson as a suicide terrorist portrayed in a positive light by the text, and compared him to those responsible for the September 11 attacks.

==Archaeology==
In August 2012, archaeologists from Tel Aviv University announced the discovery of a circular stone seal, approximately in diameter, which was found on the floor of a house at Beth Shemesh and appears to depict a man, possibly long-haired, next to the sketchy depiction of a large animal resembling contemporary images of lions. The seal is dated to the 12th century BCE. According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, &quot;excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal.&quot; The human figure appears to be unarmed, which would correspond to the Samson story.

==Cultural influence==

As an important biblical character, Samson has been referred to in popular culture and depicted in a vast array of films, artwork, and popular literature. Preserved Smith argued that John Milton&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; is an allegory for the downfall of the Puritans and the restoration of the English monarchy in which the blinded and imprisoned Samson represents Milton himself, the &quot;Chosen People&quot; represent the Puritans, and the Philistines represent the English Royalists. The play combines elements of ancient Greek tragedy and biblical narrative. Samson is portrayed as a hero, whose violent actions are mitigated by the righteous cause in whose name they are enacted. The play casts Delilah as an unrepentant, but sympathetic, deceiver and speaks approvingly of the subjugation of women.

In 1735, George Frideric Handel wrote the oratorio &quot;Samson&quot;, with a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton, based on &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;. The oratorio is almost entirely set inside Samson&#x27;s prison and Delilah only briefly appears in Part II. In 1877, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns composed the opera &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive &quot;femme fatale&quot;, but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her. The narrative of Samson and Delilah is retold in indie pop singer Regina Spektor&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot; (2002), which includes the lyrics &quot;I cut his hair myself one night / A pair of dull scissors and the yellow light / And he told me that I&#x27;d done alright.&quot;

The 1949 biblical drama &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the titular roles, was widely praised by critics for its cinematography, lead performances, costumes, sets, and innovative special effects. It became the highest-grossing film of 1950, and was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film portrays Samson as a stereotypical &quot;handsome but dumb hulk of muscle&quot;.

Samson has been especially honored in Russian artwork because the Russians defeated the Swedes in the Battle of Poltava on the feast day of St. Sampson, whose name is homophonous with Samson&#x27;s. The lion slain by Samson was interpreted to represent Sweden, as a result of the lion&#x27;s placement on the Swedish coat of arms. In 1735, C. B. Rastrelli&#x27;s bronze statue of Samson slaying the lion was placed in the center of the great cascade of the fountain at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg.

Samson is the emblem of Lungau, Salzburg, and parades in his honor are held annually in ten villages of the Lungau and two villages in the north-west Styria (Austria). During the parade, a young bachelor from the community carries a massive figure made of wood or aluminum said to represent Samson. The tradition, which was first documented in 1635, was entered into the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Austria in 2010.

<doc id="148001" wikidata="Q352800" url="?curid=148001" title="Kenneth II of Scotland">
<text>CinÃ¡ed mac MaÃ­l Coluim (, anglicised Kenneth II, and nicknamed , &quot;The Fratricidal&quot;; 932â995) was King of Alba (Scotland) from 971 to 995. The son of Malcolm I (MÃ¡el Coluim mac Domnaill), he succeeded King CuilÃ©n (CuilÃ©n mac Iduilb) on the latter&#x27;s death at the hands of Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal in 971.

== Primary sources ==
The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; was compiled in Kenneth&#x27;s reign, but many of the place names mentioned are entirely corrupt, if not fictitious. Whatever the reality, the Chronicle states that &quot;[h]e immediately plundered Strathclyde] in part. Kenneth&#x27;s infantry were slain with very great slaughter in Moin Uacoruar.&quot; The Chronicle further states that Kenneth plundered Northumbria three times, first as far as Stainmore, then to &quot;Cluiam&quot; and lastly to the River Dee by Chester. These raids may belong to around 980 when the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records attacks on Cheshire.

In 973, the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; reports that Kenneth, with MÃ¡el Coluim I (MÃ¡el Coluim mac Domnaill), the King of Strathclyde, &quot;Maccus, king of very many islands&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, MagnÃºs Haraldsson (Maccus mac Arailt), Kingdom of the Isles) and other kings, Welsh and Norse, came to Chester to acknowledge the overlordship of the English king Edgar the Peaceable at a council in Chester. It may be that Edgar here regulated the frontier between the southern lands of the kingdom of Alba and the northern lands of his English kingdom. Cumbria was English, and the western frontier lay on the Solway. In the east, the frontier lay somewhere in later Lothian, south of Edinburgh.

The &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;, in an aside, name three of the Mormaers of Alba in Kenneth&#x27;s reign in an entry in 976: Cellach mac FÃ­ndgaine, Cellach mac Baireda and Donnchad mac MorgaÃ­nd. The third of these, if not an error for Domnall mac MorgaÃ­nd, is very likely a brother of Domnall, and thus the Mormaer of Moray. The Mormaerdoms or kingdoms ruled by the two Cellachs cannot be identified.

The feud which had persisted since the death of king Indulf (Idulb mac CausantÃ­n) between his descendants and Kenneth&#x27;s family persisted. In 977 the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; report that &quot;AmlaÃ­b mac Iduilb AmlaÃ­b, son of Indulf], king of Scotland, was killed by CinÃ¡ed mac Domnaill.&quot; The &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; give the correct name of AmlaÃ­b&#x27;s killer: &quot;CinÃ¡ed mac MaÃ­l Coluim&quot;, or Kenneth II. Thus, even if only for a short time, Kenneth had been overthrown by the brother of the previous king.

Adam of Bremen tells that Sweyn Forkbeard found exile in Scotland at this time, but whether this was with Kenneth or one of the other kings in Scotland, is unknown. Also at this time, &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot;, the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; and other sources recount wars between &quot;the Scots&quot; and the Northmen, but these are more probably wars between Sigurd Hlodvisson, Earl of Orkney, and the Mormaers, or Kings, of Moray.

The Chronicle says that Kenneth founded a great monastery at Brechin.

Kenneth was killed in 995, the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; say &quot;by deceit&quot; and the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; say &quot;by his subjects&quot;. Some later sources, such as the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, John of Fordun and Andrew of Wyntoun provide more details, accurately or not. The simplest account is that he was killed by his own men in Fettercairn, through the treachery of Finnguala (also called Fimberhele or Fenella), daughter of Cuncar, Mormaer of Angus, in revenge for the killing of her only son.

&quot;The Prophecy of BerchÃ¡n&quot; adds little to our knowledge, except that it names Kenneth &quot;the kinslayer&quot;, and states he died in Strathmore.

== Children ==
Kenneth&#x27;s son Malcolm II (MÃ¡el Coluim mac CinÃ¡eda) was later king of Alba. Kenneth is also identified to have had a second son, DÃºngal, who was killed in 999 by his cousin Gille CoemgÃ¡in, son of Kenneth III. Boite mac CinÃ¡eda is sometimes ascribed as the son of Kenneth II, and by others as the son of Kenneth III (CinÃ¡ed mac Duib), however, is more commonly counted as a son of Kenneth II. Another son of Kenneth may have been Suibne mac CinÃ¡eda, a king of the &quot;Gall Gaidheil&quot; who died in 1034.

== Interpretation ==
Kenneth&#x27;s rival AmlaÃ­b, King of Scotland is omitted by the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; and later Scottish king lists. The Irish Annals of Tigernach appear to better reflect contemporary events. AmlaÃ­b could be a direct predecessor of Kenneth who suffered damnatio memoriae, or the rival king recognized in parts of Scotland. A period of divided kingship appears likely.

AmlaÃ­b was the heir of his brother CuilÃ©n, who was killed in a hall-burning. He might have served as a regent north of the River Forth, during the absence of his brother. Kenneth was brother to the deceased Dub, King of Scotland and was most likely an exile. He could claim the throne due to the support of friends and maternal kin. He was likely older and more experienced than his rival king. AmlaÃ­b is the Gaelic form of ÃlÃ¡fr, suggesting maternal descent from Norsemen. He could possibly claim descent from the UÃ­ Ãmair dynasty. Alex Woolf suggests he was a grandson of AmlaÃ­b CuarÃ¡n, King of Dublin or his cousin Olaf Guthfrithson, which suggests his own group of supporters.

== Death ==
According to John of Fordun (14th century), Kenneth II of Scotland (reigned 971â995) attempted to change the succession rules, allowing &quot;the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed&quot;, thus securing the throne for his own descendants. He reportedly did so to specifically exclude Constantine (III) and Kenneth (III), called Gryme in this source. The two men then jointly conspired against him, convincing Lady Finella, daughter of Cuncar, Mormaer of Angus, to kill the king. She reportedly did so to achieve personal revenge, as Kenneth II had killed her own son. Entries in &quot;the Chronicles of the Picts and Scots&quot;, collected by William Forbes Skene, provide the account of Finnela killing Kenneth II in revenge, but not her affiliation to Constantine or his cousins. These entries date to the 12th and 13th centuries. The Annals of Ulster simply record &quot;Cinaed son of Mael Coluim [Kenneth, son of Malcolm], king of Scotland, was deceitfully killed&quot;, with no indication of who killed him.

In the account of John of Fordun, Constantine III and Gryme were &quot;plotting unceasingly the death of the king and his son&quot;. One day, Kenneth II and his companions went hunting into the woods, &quot;at no great distance from his own abode&quot;. The hunt took him to Fettercairn, where Finella resided. She approached him to proclaim her loyalty and invited him to visit her residence, whispering into his ear that she had information about a conspiracy. She managed to lure him to &quot;an out-of-the-way little cottage&quot;, where a booby trap was hidden. Inside the cottage was a statue, connected by strings to a number of crossbows. If anyone touched or moved the statue, he would trigger the crossbows and fall victim to their arrows. Kenneth II gently touched the statue and &quot;was shot through by arrows sped from all sides, and fell without uttering another word.&quot; Finella escaped through the woods and managed to join her abettors, Constantine III and Gryme. The hunting companions soon discovered the bloody king. They were unable to locate Finella but burned Fettercairn to the ground. Smyth dismisses the elaborate plotting and the mechanical contraption as mere fables, but accepts the basic details of the story, that the succession plans of Kenneth II caused his assassination. Alan Orr Anderson raised his own doubts concerning the story of Finella, which he considered &quot;semi-mythical&quot;. He noted that the feminine name Finnguala or Findguala means &quot;white shoulders&quot;, but suggested it derived from &quot;find-ela&quot; (white swan). The name figures in toponyms such as Finella Hill (near Fordoun) and Finella Den (near St Cyrus), while local tradition in The Mearns (Kincardineshire) has Finella walking atop the treetops from one location to the other. Anderson thus theorized that Finella could be a mythical figure, suggesting she was a local stream-goddess. A later passage of John of Fordun mentions Finele as mother of Macbeth, King of Scotland (reigned 1040â1057), but this is probably an error based on the similarity of names. Macbeth was son of FindlÃ¡ech of Moray, not of a woman called Finella.

<text>Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee in 1971 by Alex Chilton (vocals, guitar), Chris Bell (vocals, guitar), Jody Stephens (drums), and Andy Hummel (bass). They have been described as the &quot;quintessential American power pop band&quot;, and &quot;one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock &amp; roll&quot;. In its first era, the band&#x27;s musical style drew influence from 1960s acts such as the Beatles and the Byrds, pioneering a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before they broke up, Big Star created a &quot;seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations&quot; according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Three of Big Star&#x27;s studio albums are included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

Big Star&#x27;s debut album, 1972&#x27;s &quot;#1 Record&quot;, was met with enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record&#x27;s commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, &quot;Radio City&quot;, was completed in December 1973. Like &quot;#1Â Record&quot;, &quot;Radio City&quot; received critical acclaim upon release, but label issues again thwarted salesâColumbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution.

After a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band&#x27;s third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27. During the group&#x27;s hiatus in the 1980s, the Big Star discography drew renewed attention when R.E.M. and the Replacements, as well as other popular bands, cited the group as an influence. In 1992, interest was further stimulated by Rykodisc&#x27;s reissues of the band&#x27;s albums, complemented by a collection of Bell&#x27;s solo work.

In 1993, Chilton and Stephens reformed Big Star with recruits Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies, and played a concert at the University of Missouri. The band remained active, performing tours in Europe and Japan, and released a new studio album, &quot;In Space&quot;, in 2005. Chilton died in March 2010 after suffering from heart problems, with Hummel dying of cancer four months later. These deaths left Stephens as the sole surviving founding member. Big Star was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014. Since December 2010, several surviving members have appeared in a series of live tribute performances of the album &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;, under the billing &quot;Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot;&quot;. , that project has remained active.

==First era: 1971â1974==

===Formation of the band===
From 1967 to 1970, Chilton was the lead singer for the blue-eyed soul group the Box Tops, who scored a No.Â 1 hit with the song &quot;The Letter&quot; when he was 16. After leaving the group, he recorded a solo studio album. He was offered the role of lead vocalist for Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, but turned down the offer as &quot;too commercial&quot;. Chilton had known Chris Bell for some time: Both lived in Memphis, each had spent time recording music at Ardent Studios, and each, when aged 13, had been impressed by the music of the Beatles during the band&#x27;s 1964 debut U.S. tour. A song Chilton wrote nearly six years after he first witnessed a Beatles performance, &quot;Thirteen&quot;, referred to the event with the line &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is here to stay&quot;.

Chilton asked Bell to work with him as a duo modeled on Simon &amp; Garfunkel; Bell declined, but invited Chilton to a performance by his own band, Icewater, comprising Bell, drummer Jody Stephens, and bassist Andy Hummel. Attracted by Icewater&#x27;s music, Chilton showed the three his new song &quot;Watch the Sunrise&quot;, and was asked to join the band. Both &quot;Watch the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Thirteen&quot; were subsequently included on Big Star&#x27;s first album, &quot;#1Â Record&quot;.

The now four-piece band adopted the name Big Star when one member was given the idea from a grocery store often visited for snacks during recording sessions. One of many Big Star Markets outlets in the Memphis region at the time, it had a logo consisting of a five-pointed star enclosing the words &quot;Big Star&quot;; as well as the store&#x27;s name, the band used its logo but without the word &quot;Star&quot; to avoid infringing copyright.

===&quot;#1 Record&quot;===

Although all four members contributed to songwriting and vocals on the first album, Chilton and Bell dominated as a duo intentionally modeled on John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album was recorded by Ardent founder John Fry, with Terry Manning contributing occasional backing vocals and keyboards. The title &quot;#1Â Record&quot; was decided towards the end of the recording sessions and evinced, albeit as a playful hope rather than a serious expectation, the chart position to be achieved by a big star. Although Fryâat the band&#x27;s insistenceâwas credited as &quot;executive producer&quot;, publicly he insisted that &quot;the band themselves really produced these records&quot;. Fry recalled how Ardent, one of the first recording studios to use a sixteen-track tape machine, worked experimentally with the band members: &quot;We started recording the songs with the intent that if it turned out OK we&#x27;d put it out [...] I wound up being the one that primarily worked on it: I recorded all the tracks and then they would often come late at night and do overdubs. One by one, they all learned enough engineering.&quot;
Describing the mix of musical styles present on &quot;#1 Record&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;â³s Bud Scoppa notes that the album includes &quot;reflective and acoustic&quot; numbers, saying that &quot;even the prettiest tunes have tension and subtle energy to them, and the rockers reverberate with power&quot;. Scoppa finds that in each mode, &quot;the guitar sound is sharp-edged and full&quot;. &quot;#1Â Record&quot; was released in June 1972, and quickly received strong reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot; went as far as to say, &quot;Every cut could be a single&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; judged the album &quot;exceptionally good&quot;, while &quot;Cashbox&quot; stated, &quot;This album is one of those red-letter days when everything falls together as a total sound&quot;, and called it &quot;an important record that should go to the top with proper handling&quot;.

Proper handling, however, was not forthcoming: Stax Records proved unable to either promote or distribute the record with any degree of success, and even when the band&#x27;s own efforts to get airplay generated interest, fans were unable to buy it as Stax could not make it available in many stores. Stax, in an effort to improve its catalog&#x27;s availability, signed a deal with Columbia Records, already successful distributors in the U.S., making Columbia responsible for the entire Stax catalog. But Columbia had no interest in dealing with the independent distributors previously used by Stax and removed even the existing copies of &quot;#1 Record&quot; from the stores.

===&quot;Radio City&quot;===

The frustration at &quot;#1 Record&quot;â³s obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being punched in the face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel&#x27;s new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell&#x27;s acoustic guitar in the latter&#x27;s unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry&#x27;s parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, and by the end of the year Big Star disbanded.
After a few months Chilton, Stephens, and Hummel decided to reform Big Star, and the three resumed work on the second album. The title chosen, &quot;Radio City&quot;, continued the play on the theme of a big star&#x27;s popularity and success, expressing what biographer Robert Gordon calls the band&#x27;s &quot;romantic expectation&quot;. As Hummel put it:

 Stephens recalled: &quot;&quot;Radio City&quot;, for me, was just an amazing record. Being a three-piece really opened things up for me in terms of playing drums. Drums take on a different role in a three-piece band, so it was a lot of fun. [...] &quot;Radio City&quot; was really more spontaneous, and the performances were pretty close to live performances.&quot;

Although uncredited, Bell contributed to the writing of some of the album&#x27;s songs, including &quot;O My Soul&quot; and &quot;Back of a Car&quot;. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, Hummel left the band: judging that it would not last, and in his final year at college, he elected to concentrate on his studies and live a more normal life. He was replaced by John Lightman for a short tenure prior to the band dissolving.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;â³s Ken Barnes, describing the musical style of &quot;Radio City&quot;, opens by noting as a backdrop that the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;#1Â Record&quot;, established them as &quot;one of the leading new American bands working in the mid-Sixties pop and rock vein&quot;. &quot;Radio City&quot;, Barnes finds, has &quot;plenty of shimmering pop delights&quot;, although &quot;the opening tune, &#x27;O My Soul,&#x27; is a foreboding, sprawling funk affair&quot;; Barnes concludes that &quot;Sometimes they sound like the Byrds, sometimes like the early Who, but usually like their own indescribable selves&quot;.

&quot;Radio City&quot; was released in February 1974 and, like &quot;#1Â Record&quot;, received excellent reviews. &quot;Record&quot; reported, &quot;The sound is stimulating, the musicianship superb, and the result is tight and rollickingly rhythmic.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; judged it &quot;a highly commercial set&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;â³s Bud Scoppa, then with &quot;Phonograph Record&quot;, affirmed, &quot;Alex Chilton has now emerged as a major talent, and he&#x27;ll be heard from again&quot;. &quot;Cashbox&quot; called it &quot;a collection of excellent material that hopefully will break this deserving band in a big way&quot;. But just as &quot;#1Â Record&quot; had fallen victim to poor marketing, so too did &quot;Radio City&quot;. Columbia, now in complete control of the Stax catalog, refused to process it following a disagreement. Without a distributor, sales of &quot;Radio City&quot;, though far greater than those of &quot;#1Â Record&quot;, were minimal at only around 20,000 copies.

===&quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;===

In September 1974, eight months after the release of &quot;Radio City&quot;, Chilton and Stephens returned to Ardent Studios to work on a third album. They were assisted by producer Jim Dickinson and an assortment of musicians (including drummer Richard Rosebrough) and Lesa Aldridge, Chilton&#x27;s girlfriend, who contributed on vocals. The sessions and mixing were completed in early 1975, and 250 copies of the album were pressed with plain labels for promotional use.

Parke Putterbaugh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; as &quot;extraordinary&quot;. It is, he wrote, &quot;Chilton&#x27;s untidy masterpiece. [...] beautiful and disturbing&quot;; &quot;vehemently original&quot;; of &quot;haunting brilliance&quot;:
To listen to it is to be &quot;plunged into a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Songs are drenched in strings and sweet sentiment one minute, starkly played and downcast the next. No pop song has ever bottomed out more than &quot;Holocaust&quot;, an anguished plaint sung at a snail&#x27;s pace over discordant slide-guitar fragments and moaning cello [...] On the up side, there&#x27;s the delicious pop minuet &quot;Stroke It Noel&quot;, the anticipatory magic of &quot;Nightime&quot; (&quot;Caught a glance in your eyes and fell through the skies,&quot; Chilton rhapsodizes) [...] Big Star&#x27;s baroque, guitar-driven pop reaches its apotheosis on songs like &quot;Kizza Me&quot;, &quot;Thank You Friends&quot; and &quot;O, Dana&quot;. [...] Without question, &quot;Third&quot; is one of the most idiosyncratic, deeply felt and fully realized albums in the pop idiom.
Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional copies and met employees of a number of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, &quot;We&#x27;d go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy&quot;. In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star&#x27;s first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was &quot;nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star &quot;Third&quot;, but I think it is important that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill.&quot;

Since quitting the band in 1972, Bell had spent time in several different countries trying to develop his solo career. In 1978, after his return to Memphis, the first two Big Star albums were released together in the U.K. as a double album, drawing enthusiastic reviews and interest from fans. Soon afterward, Big Star&#x27;s recognition grew further when, four years after its completion, the third album too was released in both the U.S. and the U.K. By now, the hitherto untitled &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; had become known by several unofficial names, including &quot;Third&quot; (reflecting its position in the discography), &quot;Beale Street Green&quot; (acknowledging the legendary site nearby, once a focal point for Memphis blues musicians), and &quot;Sister Lovers&quot; (because during the album&#x27;s recording sessions, Chilton and Stephens were dating sisters Lesa and Holliday Aldridge).

Not long after the release of &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;, Bell died in a car accident. He apparently lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.

==Second era: 1993â2010==
Big Star reformed in 1993 with a new lineup when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow was also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel declined to participate. First-era material dominated Big Star&#x27;s performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album &quot;In Space&quot;.

Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, &quot;We were working out the set list and we went to this little cafe. Little did I know we&#x27;d be playing that set for the next ten years&quot;. The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as &quot;Columbia: Live at Missouri University&quot;. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Big Star&#x27;s first post-reunion studio recording was the song &quot;Hot Thing&quot;, recorded in the mid-1990s for the Big Star tribute album &quot;Big Star, Small World&quot;. As with their prior studio release, however, the tribute album was delayed for years due to its record company going under. Originally scheduled for a 1998 release on Ignition Records, the album was eventually released in 2006 on Koch Records.

&quot;In Space&quot; was released on September 27, 2005, on the Rykodisc label. Recorded during 2004, the album consisted of new material mostly co-written by Chilton, Stephens, Auer, and Stringfellow. Reviewing &quot;In Space&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;â³s David Fricke first pointed out that the context of the release was now &quot;a world expecting that American Beatles ideal all over again&quot; from a band that &quot;achieved its power-pop perfection when no one else was looking.&quot; In Fricke&#x27;s estimation, this seemingly unrealistic expectation was met in part: &quot;It&#x27;s here â in the jangly longing and ice-wall harmonies of &#x27;Lady Sweet&#x27;&quot; â however, Fricke found that the successful songs were interleaved with &quot;the eccentric R&amp;B and demo-quality glam rock that have made Chilton&#x27;s solo records a mixed blessing,&quot; and that &quot;&#x27;A Whole New Thing&#x27; starts out like old T.Rex, then goes nowhere special.&quot; Warming nevertheless to &quot;the rough sunshine&quot; of &quot;Best Chance&quot;, Fricke concluded, &quot;&quot;In Space&quot; is no &quot;#1 Record&quot;, but at its brightest, it is Big Star in every way.&quot;

The band appeared at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium on October 20, 2007, with Oranger as the opening act. Big Star performed at the 2008 Rhythm Festival, staged from August 29â31 in Bedfordshire, U.K. On June 16, 2009, the &quot;#1Â Record&quot;/&quot;Radio City&quot; double album was reissued in remastered form. The same month, it was announced that a film of Big Star&#x27;s history, based on Rob Jovanovic&#x27;s book &quot;Big Star: The Story of Rock&#x27;s Forgotten Band&quot;, was in pre-production. On July 1, 2009, Big Star performed at a concert in Hyde Park, London, U.K. On September 15, 2009, Rhino Records issued a four-CD box set containing 98 recordings made between 1968 and 1975. &quot;Keep an Eye on the Sky&quot; included live and demo versions of Big Star songs, solo work, and material from Bell&#x27;s earlier bands Rock City and Icewater. On November 18, 2009, the band performed at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple in New York City.

== Post-Chilton releases and tributes ==

=== Alex Chilton memorial shows ===
On March 17, 2010, Chilton suffered a fatal heart attack. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans. Big Star had been scheduled to play at SXSW Music Festival that same week. The remaining members, joined by special guests original bassist Andy Hummel, M. Ward, Evan Dando, R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills, and Chris Stamey, staged the concert as a tribute to him.

=== &quot;Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot;&quot; shows ===

Four months after Chilton&#x27;s death, Hummel died of cancer on July 19, 2010. Asked about the band&#x27;s plans after the death of Chilton and Hummel, Stephens told &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s music we all really love to play, and we love to play it together, so we&#x27;re trying to figure out a way forward where we can keep doing it.&quot; In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Stephens said that the May 2010 tribute performance would be the group&#x27;s final show as Big Star, although not his last show with Auer and Stringfellow, stating, &quot;I can&#x27;t see us going out as Big StarÂ ... But I would hate to compound the loss of Alex by saying,&#x27;That&#x27;s it&#x27; for Ken and Jon, too. I can&#x27;t imagine not playing with them. There&#x27;s so much funâbut an emotional bond there too.&quot;

In December 2010, under the billing &quot;Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot;&quot;, Stephens teamed with Mitch Easter, Stamey, and Mills, along with a string section, to perform a live tribute performance of Big Star&#x27;s album &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Joined by additional performers such as Matthew Sweet, Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot; was performed in a similar tribute concert in New York City on March 26, 2011, and at the Barbican in London on May 28, 2012. The project continued with concerts in Chicago and New York in 2013, a January 2014 concert in Sydney, Australia, and a series of U.S. shows that included Seattle&#x27;s Bumbershoot festival on August 31, 2014. In November 2014, Auer and Stringfellow rejoined Stephens, Easter, Stamey, and Mills for a free benefit performance in Athens, Georgia. , Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot; were still performing.

On April 21, 2017, Concord Records released a Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot; live concert documentary on two DVDs, along with a three-CD live album, both titled &quot;Thank You, Friends: Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot; Live... and More&quot;. The concert was performed in April 2016 at Glendale, California&#x27;s Alex Theatre.

===Posthumous releases===
In June 2011, Ardent Records released the EP &quot;Live Tribute to Alex Chilton&quot;, and Stephens confirmed on the Ardent blog that the tribute performance in May 2010 was the last performance for Big Star as a band. A documentary titled &quot;Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me&quot; (2012), directed by Drew DeNicola and Olivia Mori, chronicled the group&#x27;s career and band members&#x27; solo efforts. In 2013, the documentary was released in theaters and on DVD, and it had a limited theatrical re-release in England in August 2014. In November 2014, &quot;Live in Memphis&quot; was released by Omnivore Recordings on CD, vinyl, and as a DVD of Big Star&#x27;s performance of October 29, 1994, their only known show to be professionally filmed in its entirety. According to &quot;Mojo&quot;, the DVD documents how Big Star&#x27;s 1990s lineup defied expectations and endured for another 16 years: &quot;Chilton&#x27;s musicality is mesmerising as he drives the band. â¦ Alternating between lead and rhythm, he plays with a mix of laser focus and utter insouciant cool.&quot;

==Musical style and influences==
Bell took up guitar when 12 or 13, but only on hearing the first Beatles records was he motivated to play the instrument regularly. He acted as lead and rhythm guitarist and vocalist for a sequence of bands, performing songs by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Zombies, and the Animals. Chilton&#x27;s first awareness of music came at the age of 6 when his brother repeatedly played a record by the Coasters. His father&#x27;s liking for jazz then exposed him over the next few years to the music of Glenn Miller, Ray Charles, and Dave Brubeck. Chilton&#x27;s enthusiasm for music took hold when at age 13 he first heard Beatles records; he recalled having known of 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, but &quot;by 1959 Elvis was syrup and Jerry Lee was pretty much gone, and the rockabilly thing was sort of over so I didn&#x27;t get really caught up in the rock scene until the Beatles came along&quot;.
Chilton took up electric guitar at 13, playing along with Beatles songs, later saying, &quot;I really loved the mid-sixties British pop music [...] all two and a half minutes or three minutes long, really appealing songs. So I&#x27;ve always aspired to that same format, that&#x27;s what I like. Not to mention the rhythm and blues and the Stax stuff, too&quot;. Chilton abandoned his guitar-playing during his time with the Box Tops and then took up the instrument again; he met Roger McGuinn, guitarist for the Byrds, and developed particular interest in electric guitar and acoustic folk. Stephens enjoyed the music of Otis Redding, the Isley Brothers, the Who, the Kinks, and especially the Beatles.

Hummel likewise was a member of more than one band during his early musical years, again influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion acts. The bassist also played acoustic guitar for personal enjoyment, following the styles of Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Joni Mitchell and using finger-picking techniques to play folk and bluegrass. Most songs on the first three albums are credited to either Bell/Chilton or Chilton, but some credit Hummel, Stephens and others, as either writer or co-writer. At the only seven live performances in the original era, the last of which took place before the second album&#x27;s release, all four members contributed vocally.

While primarily inspired by the music of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands, acknowledging too the jangle pop and power pop of the period, Big Star also incorporated dark, nihilistic themes to produce a striking blend of musical and lyrical styles. The body of work resulting from the first era was a precursor of the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s, at the same time yielding material today considered an outstanding example of power pop. The stylistic range is evident from modern day critiques. Bogdanov et al., commenting on &quot;#1Â Record&quot; in their &quot;All Music Guide to Rock&quot;, perceive in &quot;The Ballad of El Goodo&quot; a &quot;luminous, melancholy ballad&quot;, whereas John Borack&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Power Pop Guide&quot; singles out &quot;Radio City&quot;â³s &quot;September Gurls&quot; as a &quot;glorious, glittering jewel&quot; of power pop.

Borack notes too that &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; is &quot;slower, darker and a good deal weirder&quot; than the first two albums, identifying &quot;Holocaust&quot; as &quot;Alex Chilton at his haunting best&quot;, yet finds &quot;Thank You Friends&quot; exemplifying &quot;left-field gems&quot; also present in which &quot;the hooks are every bit as undeniable&quot; as before. Jovanovic writes that when recording what Peter Buckley in his &quot;Rough Guide to Rock&quot; terms the &quot;snarling guitar rock&quot; of the first album&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie to Me&quot;, the band, deeming conventional instruments inadequate for the task, wheeled two Norton Commando motorcycles into the studio and gunned the engines to intensify the song&#x27;s bridge. Bogdanov et al. reserve &quot;snarl&quot; for a &quot;Radio City&quot; song, &quot;Mod Lang&quot;; here Buckley writes that &quot;the power of the performance and the erratic mix gave a sense of chaos which only added to the thrill&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
Although Big Star&#x27;s first era came to an end in 1974, the band acquired a cult following in the 1980s when new acts began to acknowledge the early material&#x27;s significance. R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck admitted, &quot;We&#x27;ve sort of flirted with greatness, but we&#x27;ve yet to make a record as good as &quot;Revolver&quot; or &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; or &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; or Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Third&quot;. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;ll take to push us on to that level, but I think we&#x27;ve got it in us.&quot; Chilton, however, told an interviewer in 1992, &quot;I&#x27;m constantly surprised that people fall for Big Star the way they do... People say Big Star made some of the best rock &#x27;n roll albums ever. And I say they&#x27;re wrong.&quot;

In 2014, Paul Stanley cited Big Star as an influence to early Kiss moments: &quot;We&#x27;ve always been about verses, choruses, bridges (...) It&#x27;s called a hook for a reason, because it grabs you. And that&#x27;s my mentality. Give me the Raspberries. Give me Small Faces. Give me Big Star.&quot;

The band was also an inspiration for the Replacements, who recorded the song &quot;Alex Chilton&quot; on their &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot; album.

&quot;While the band no longer exists, the music that Alex, Chris, Andy and I originally made together under the auspices of John Fry still calls a community of those of us with like minds to come together and have fun with it,&quot; Stephens wrote in 2017 in a note published in the liner notes of &quot;The Best of Big Star&quot;.

Critics have continued to cite Big Star&#x27;s first three albums as a profound influence on subsequent musicians. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes that Big Star &quot;created a seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations of rockers, from the power-pop revivalists of the late 1970s to alternative rockers at the end of the century to the indie rock nation in the new millennium&quot;. Jason Ankeny, music critic for AllMusic, identifies Big Star as &quot;one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock &amp; roll&quot;, whose &quot;impact on subsequent generations of indie bands on both sides of the Atlantic is surpassed only by that of the Velvet Underground&quot;. Ankeny describes Big Star&#x27;s second album, &quot;Radio City&quot;, as &quot;their masterpieceâragged and raw guitar-pop infused with remarkable intensity and spontaneity&quot;.

In 1992, Rykodisc generated further interest in the band when it reissued &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; and released a posthumous compilation of Bell&#x27;s solo material, &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot;. In his 2007 book &quot;Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Power Pop Guide&quot;, John Borack ranks the &quot;#1Â Record&quot;/&quot;Radio City&quot; double album at No.Â 2 in his chart &quot;The 200 Greatest Power Pop Albums&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; includes &quot;#1 Record&quot;, &quot;Radio City&quot; and &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; in &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and &quot;September Gurls&quot; and &quot;Thirteen&quot; in &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In addition to R.E.M., artists including Teenage Fanclub, The Replacements, Primal Scream, the Posies, and Bill Lloyd and the dB&#x27;s cite Big Star as an inspiration, and the band&#x27;s influence on Game Theory, Matthew Sweet, and Velvet Crush is also acknowledged.

On their 2022 album &quot;Tremblers and Goggles by Rank&quot;, Guided By Voices paid tribute to Big Star with the song &quot;Alex Bell&quot;. The lyrics include the refrain &quot;Walking down Alex Bell, thinking of Alex...I see you around every time there&#x27;s a ghost in town.&quot;

* A cover version of &quot;September Gurls&quot; appeared on the Bangles&#x27; 1986 triple platinum album &quot;Different Light&quot;. &quot;September Gurls&quot;, Borack wrote, &quot;was and is the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of power pop, a glorious, glittering jewel with every facet cut and shined to absolute perfection... a peerless, aching distillation of love and longing. &#x27;September Gurls&#x27; may not actually be the greatest song ever recorded, but for the duration of its 2:47 running time, you can be forgiven for believing it is.&quot;
* The 1987 tribute song &quot;Alex Chilton&quot;, co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot; and contains the lyric &quot;I never travel far without a little Big Star.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Girl&quot; from &quot;Radio City&quot; features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film &quot;Adventureland&quot;.
* In 1998, an &quot;ad hoc&quot;, shortened version of &quot;#1 Record&quot;â³s &quot;In the Street&quot; (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, and in 1999, a new version titled &quot;That &#x27;70s Song (In the Street)&quot; was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. &quot;That &#x27;70s Song&quot; and Big Star&#x27;s own &quot;September Gurls&quot; are included on the 1999 album &quot;That &#x27;70s Album (Rockin&#x27;)&quot; released by the television program&#x27;s producers.
* The 2006 tribute album &quot;Big Star, Small World &quot; includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others.
* Lucero, a Memphis, Tennessee-based alternative country band, covered &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Girl&quot; on their 2015 release &quot;All a Man Should Do&quot;, an album which takes its title from a lyric in the song. Founding member Jody Stephens, and later additions to Big Star, provide backup on the track.
* &quot;Thirteen&quot; from &quot;Big Star&quot; is featured in the 2020 Disney+ film &quot;Stargirl&quot;. The song is then sung by the two leads, Grace VanderWaal as Susan &quot;Stargirl&quot; Caraway and Graham Verchere as Leo Borlock.
