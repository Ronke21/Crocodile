<text>Mircea Eliade (; – April 22, 1986) was a Romanian historian of religion, fiction writer, philosopher, and professor at the University of Chicago. One of the most influential scholars of religion of the 20th century and interpreter of religious experience, he established paradigms in religious studies that persist to this day. His theory that &quot;hierophanies&quot; form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into sacred and profane space and time, has proved influential. One of his most instrumental contributions to religious studies was his theory of &quot;eternal return&quot;, which holds that myths and rituals do not simply commemorate hierophanies, but (at least in the minds of the religious) actually participate in them.

Eliade&#x27;s literary works belong to the fantastic and autobiographical genres. The best known are the novels &quot;Maitreyi&quot; (&#x27;La Nuit Bengali&#x27; or &#x27;Bengal Nights&#x27;, 1933), &quot;Noaptea de Sânziene&quot; (&#x27;The Forbidden Forest&#x27;, 1955), &quot;Isabel și apele diavolului&quot; (&#x27;Isabel and the Devil&#x27;s Waters&#x27;), and &quot;Romanul Adolescentului Miop&quot; (&#x27;Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent&#x27;, 1989); the novellas &quot;Domnișoara Christina&quot; (&#x27;Miss Christina&#x27;, 1936) and &quot;Tinerețe fără tinerețe&quot; (&#x27;Youth Without Youth&#x27;, 1976); and the short stories &quot;Secretul doctorului Honigberger&quot; (&#x27;The Secret of Dr. Honigberger&#x27;, 1940) and &quot;La Țigănci&quot; (&#x27;With the Gypsy Girls&#x27;, 1963).

Early in his life, Eliade was a journalist and essayist, a disciple of Romanian philosopher and journalist Nae Ionescu, and a member of the literary society &quot;Criterion&quot;. In the 1940s, he served as cultural attaché of the Kingdom of Romania to the United Kingdom and Portugal. Several times during the late 1930s, Eliade publicly expressed his support for the Iron Guard, a Romanian Christian fascist organization. His involvement with fascism at the time, as well as his other far-right connections, came under frequent criticism after World War II.

Noted for his vast erudition, Eliade had fluent command of five languages (Romanian, French, German, Italian, and English) and a reading knowledge of three others (Hebrew, Persian, and Sanskrit). In 1990 he was elected a posthumous member of the Romanian Academy.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Born in Bucharest, he was the son of Romanian Land Forces officer Gheorghe Eliade (whose original surname was Ieremia) and Jeana &quot;née&quot; Vasilescu. An Orthodox believer, Gheorghe Eliade registered his son&#x27;s birth four days before the actual date, to coincide with the liturgical calendar feast of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Mircea Eliade had a sister, Corina, the mother of semiologist Sorin Alexandrescu. His family moved between Tecuci and Bucharest, ultimately settling in the capital in 1914, and purchasing a house on Melodiei Street, near Piața Rosetti, where Mircea Eliade resided until late in his teens.

Eliade kept a particularly fond memory of his childhood and, later in life, wrote about the impact various unusual episodes and encounters had on his mind. In one instance during the World War I Romanian Campaign, when Eliade was about ten years of age, he witnessed the bombing of Bucharest by German zeppelins and the patriotic fervor in the occupied capital at news that Romania was able to stop the Central Powers&#x27; advance into Moldavia.

He described this stage in his life as marked by an unrepeatable epiphany. Recalling his entrance into a drawing room that an &quot;eerie iridescent light&quot; had turned into &quot;a fairy-tale palace&quot;, he wrote,
I practiced for many years [the] exercise of recapturing that epiphanic moment, and I would always find again the same plenitude. I would slip into it as into a fragment of time devoid of duration—without beginning, middle, or end. During my last years of lycée, when I struggled with profound attacks of melancholy, I still succeeded at times in returning to the golden green light of that afternoon. [...] But even though the beatitude was the same, it was now impossible to bear because it aggravated my sadness too much. By this time I knew the world to which the drawing room belonged [...] was a world forever lost.

Robert Ellwood, a professor of religion who did his graduate studies under Mircea Eliade, saw this type of nostalgia as one of the most characteristic themes in Eliade&#x27;s life and academic writings.

===Adolescence and literary debut===
After completing his primary education at the school on Mântuleasa Street, Eliade attended the Spiru Haret National College in the same class as Arșavir Acterian, Haig Acterian, and Petre Viforeanu (and several years the senior of Nicolae Steinhardt, who eventually became a close friend of Eliade&#x27;s). Among his other colleagues was future philosopher Constantin Noica and Noica&#x27;s friend, future art historian Barbu Brezianu.

As a child, Eliade was fascinated with the natural world, which formed the setting of his very first literary attempts, as well as with Romanian folklore and the Christian faith as expressed by peasants. Growing up, he aimed to find and record what he believed was the common source of all religious traditions. The young Eliade&#x27;s interest in physical exercise and adventure led him to pursue mountaineering and sailing, and he also joined the Romanian Boy Scouts.

With a group of friends, he designed and sailed a boat on the Danube, from Tulcea to the Black Sea. In parallel, Eliade grew estranged from the educational environment, becoming disenchanted with the discipline required and obsessed with the idea that he was uglier and less virile than his colleagues. To cultivate his willpower, he would force himself to swallow insects and only slept four to five hours a night. At one point, Eliade was failing four subjects, among which was the study of the Romanian language.

Instead, he became interested in natural science and chemistry, as well as the occult, and wrote short pieces on entomological subjects. Despite his father&#x27;s concern that he was in danger of losing his already weak eyesight, Eliade read passionately. One of his favorite authors was Honoré de Balzac, whose work he studied carefully. Eliade also became acquainted with the modernist short stories of Giovanni Papini and social anthropology studies by James George Frazer.

His interest in the two writers led him to learn Italian and English in private, and he also began studying Persian and Hebrew. At the time, Eliade became acquainted with Saadi&#x27;s poems and the ancient Mesopotamian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. He was also interested in philosophy—studying, among others, Socrates, Vasile Conta, and the Stoics Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, and read works of history—the two Romanian historians who influenced him from early on were Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Nicolae Iorga. His first published work was the 1921 &quot;Inamicul viermelui de mătase&quot; (&quot;The Silkworm&#x27;s Enemy&quot;), followed by &quot;Cum am găsit piatra filosofală&quot; (&quot;How I Found the Philosophers&#x27; Stone&quot;). Four years later, Eliade completed work on his debut volume, the autobiographical &quot;Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent&quot;.

===University studies and Indian sojourn===

Between 1925 and 1928, he attended the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in 1928, earning his diploma with a study on Early Modern Italian philosopher Tommaso Campanella. In 1927, Eliade traveled to Italy, where he met Papini and collaborated with the scholar Giuseppe Tucci.

It was during his student years that Eliade met Nae Ionescu, who lectured in Logic, becoming one of his disciples and friends. He was especially attracted to Ionescu&#x27;s radical ideas and his interest in religion, which signified a break with the rationalist tradition represented by senior academics such as Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Dimitrie Gusti, and Tudor Vianu (all of whom owed inspiration to the defunct literary society &quot;Junimea&quot;, albeit in varying degrees).

Eliade&#x27;s scholarly works began after a long period of study in British India, at the University of Calcutta. Finding that the Maharaja of Kassimbazar sponsored European scholars to study in India, Eliade applied and was granted an allowance for four years, which was later doubled by a Romanian scholarship. In autumn 1928, he sailed for Calcutta to study Sanskrit and philosophy under Surendranath Dasgupta, a Bengali Cambridge alumnus and professor at Calcutta University, the author of a five volume &quot;History of Indian Philosophy&quot;. Before reaching the Indian subcontinent, Eliade also made a brief visit to Egypt. Once in India, he visited large areas of the region, and spent a short period at a Himalayan &quot;ashram&quot;.

He studied the basics of Indian philosophy, and, in parallel, learned Sanskrit, Pali and Bengali under Dasgupta&#x27;s direction. At the time, he also became interested in the actions of Mahatma Gandhi and the &quot;Satyagraha&quot; as a phenomenon; later, Eliade adapted Gandhian ideas in his discourse on spirituality and Romania.

In 1930, while living with Dasgupta, Eliade fell in love with his host&#x27;s daughter, Maitreyi Devi, later writing a barely disguised autobiographical novel &quot;Maitreyi&quot; (also known as &quot;La Nuit Bengali&quot; or &quot;Bengal Nights&quot;), in which he claimed that he carried on a physical relationship with her.

Eliade received his PhD in 1933, with a thesis on Yoga practices. The book, which was translated into French three years later, had significant impact in academia, both in Romania and abroad.

He later recalled that the book was an early step for understanding not just Indian religious practices, but also Romanian spirituality. During the same period, Eliade began a correspondence with the Ceylonese-born philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy. In 1936–1937, he functioned as honorary assistant for Ionescu&#x27;s course, lecturing in Metaphysics.

In 1933, Mircea Eliade had a physical relationship with the actress Sorana Țopa, while falling in love with Nina Mareș, whom he ultimately married. The latter, introduced to him by his new friend Mihail Sebastian, already had a daughter, Giza, from a man who had divorced her. Eliade subsequently adopted Giza, and the three of them moved to an apartment at 141 Dacia Boulevard. He left his residence in 1936, during a trip he made to the United Kingdom and Germany, when he first visited London, Oxford and Berlin.

===&quot;Criterion&quot; and &quot;Cuvântul&quot;===
After contributing various and generally polemical pieces in university magazines, Eliade came to the attention of journalist Pamfil Șeicaru, who invited him to collaborate on the nationalist paper &quot;Cuvântul&quot;, which was noted for its harsh tones. By then, &quot;Cuvântul&quot; was also hosting articles by Nae Ionescu.

As one of the figures in the &quot;Criterion&quot; literary society (1933–1934), Eliade&#x27;s initial encounter with the traditional far right was polemical: the group&#x27;s conferences were stormed by members of A. C. Cuza&#x27;s National-Christian Defense League, who objected to what they viewed as pacifism and addressed antisemitic insults to several speakers, including Sebastian; in 1933, he was among the signers of a manifesto opposing Nazi Germany&#x27;s state-enforced racism.

In 1934, at a time when Sebastian was publicly insulted by Nae Ionescu, who prefaced his book (&quot;De două mii de ani...&quot;) with thoughts on the &quot;eternal damnation&quot; of Jews, Mircea Eliade spoke out against this perspective, and commented that Ionescu&#x27;s references to the verdict &quot;Outside the Church there is no salvation&quot; contradicted the notion of God&#x27;s omnipotence. However, he contended that Ionescu&#x27;s text was not evidence of antisemitism.

In 1936, reflecting on the early history of the Romanian Kingdom and its Jewish community, he deplored the expulsion of Jewish scholars from Romania, making specific references to Moses Gaster, Heimann Hariton Tiktin and Lazăr Șăineanu. Eliade&#x27;s views at the time focused on innovation—in the summer of 1933, he replied to an anti-modernist critique written by George Călinescu:
All I wish for is a deep change, a complete transformation. But, for God&#x27;s sake, in any direction other than spirituality.

He and friends Emil Cioran and Constantin Noica were by then under the influence of &quot;Trăirism&quot;, a school of thought that was formed around the ideals expressed by Ionescu. A form of existentialism, &quot;Trăirism&quot; was also the synthesis of traditional and newer right-wing beliefs. Early on, a public polemic was sparked between Eliade and Camil Petrescu: the two eventually reconciled and later became good friends.

Like Mihail Sebastian, who was himself becoming influenced by Ionescu, he maintained contacts with intellectuals from all sides of the political spectrum: their entourage included the right-wing Dan Botta and Mircea Vulcănescu, the non-political Petrescu and Ionel Jianu, and Belu Zilber, who was a member of the illegal Romanian Communist Party.

The group also included Haig Acterian, Mihail Polihroniade, Petru Comarnescu, Marietta Sadova and Floria Capsali.

He was also close to Marcel Avramescu, a former Surrealist writer whom he introduced to the works of René Guénon. A doctor in the Kabbalah and future Romanian Orthodox cleric, Avramescu joined Eliade in editing the short-lived esoteric magazine &quot;Memra&quot; (the only one of its kind in Romania).

Among the intellectuals who attended his lectures were Mihai Şora (whom he deemed his favorite student), Eugen Schileru and Miron Constantinescu—known later as, respectively, a philosopher, an art critic, and a sociologist and political figure of the communist regime. Mariana Klein, who became Șora&#x27;s wife, was one of Eliade&#x27;s female students, and later authored works on his scholarship.

Eliade later recounted that he had himself enlisted Zilber as a &quot;Cuvântul&quot; contributor, for him to provide a Marxist perspective on the issues discussed by the journal. Their relation soured in 1935, when the latter publicly accused Eliade of serving as an agent for the secret police, &quot;Siguranța Statului&quot; (Sebastian answered to the statement by alleging that Zilber was himself a secret agent, and the latter eventually retracted his claim).

===1930s political transition===
Eliade&#x27;s articles before and after his adherence to the principles of the Iron Guard (or, as it was usually known at the time, the &quot;Legionary Movement&quot;), beginning with his &quot;Itinerar spiritual&quot; (&quot;Spiritual Itinerary&quot;, serialized in &quot;Cuvântul&quot; in 1927), center on several political ideals advocated by the far right.

They displayed his rejection of liberalism and the modernizing goals of the 1848 Wallachian revolution (perceived as &quot;an abstract apology of Mankind&quot; and &quot;ape-like imitation of [Western] Europe&quot;), as well as for democracy itself (accusing it of &quot;managing to crush all attempts at national renaissance&quot;, and later praising Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy on the grounds that, according to Eliade, &quot;[in Italy,] he who thinks for himself is promoted to the highest office in the shortest of times&quot;). He approved of an ethnic nationalist state centered on the Orthodox Church (in 1927, despite his still-vivid interest in Theosophy, he recommended young intellectuals &quot;the return to the Church&quot;), which he opposed to, among others, the secular nationalism of Constantin Rădulescu-Motru; referring to this particular ideal as &quot;Romanianism&quot;, Eliade was, in 1934, still viewing it as &quot;neither fascism, nor chauvinism&quot;.

Eliade was especially dissatisfied with the incidence of unemployment among intellectuals, whose careers in state-financed institutions had been rendered uncertain by the Great Depression.

In 1936, Eliade was the focus of a campaign in the far right press, being targeted for having authored &quot;pornography&quot; in his &quot;Domnișoara Christina&quot; and &quot;Isabel și apele diavolului&quot;; similar accusations were aimed at other cultural figures, including Tudor Arghezi and Geo Bogza. Assessments of Eliade&#x27;s work were in sharp contrast to one another: also in 1936, Eliade accepted an award from the Romanian Writers&#x27; Society, of which he had been a member since 1934. In summer 1937, through an official decision which came as a result of the accusations, and despite student protests, he was stripped of his position at the university.

Eliade decided to sue the Ministry of Education, asking for a symbolic compensation of 1 leu. He won the trial, and regained his position as Nae Ionescu&#x27;s assistant.

Nevertheless, by 1937, he gave his intellectual support to the Iron Guard, in which he saw &quot;a Christian revolution aimed at creating a new Romania&quot;, and a group able &quot;to reconcile Romania with God&quot;. His articles of the time, published in Iron Guard-affiliated papers such as &quot;Sfarmă-Piatră&quot; and &quot;Buna Vestire&quot;, contain ample praises of the movement&#x27;s leaders (Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, Ion Moța, Vasile Marin, and Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul). The transition he went through was similar to that of his fellow generation members and close collaborators—among the notable exceptions to this rule were Petru Comarnescu, sociologist Henri H. Stahl and future dramatist Eugène Ionesco, as well as Sebastian.

He eventually enrolled in the &quot;Totul pentru Țară&quot; (&quot;Everything for the Fatherland&quot; Party), the political expression of the Iron Guard, and contributed to its 1937 electoral campaign in Prahova County—as indicated by his inclusion on a list of party members with county-level responsibilities (published in &quot;Buna Vestire&quot;).

===Internment and diplomatic service===
The stance taken by Eliade resulted in his arrest on July 14, 1938, after a crackdown on the Iron Guard authorized by King Carol II. At the time of his arrest, he had just interrupted a column on &quot;Provincia și legionarismul&quot; (&quot;The Province and Legionary Ideology&quot;) in &quot;Vremea&quot;, having been singled out by Prime Minister Armand Călinescu as an author of Iron Guard propaganda.

Eliade was kept for three weeks in a cell at the &quot;Siguranța Statului&quot; Headquarters, in an attempt to have him sign a &quot;declaration of dissociation&quot; with the Iron Guard, but he refused to do so. In the first week of August he was transferred to a makeshift camp at Miercurea-Ciuc. When Eliade began coughing blood in October 1938, he was taken to a clinic in Moroeni. Eliade was simply released on November 12, and subsequently spent his time writing his play &quot;Iphigenia&quot; (also known as &quot;Ifigenia&quot;). In April 1940, with the help of Alexandru Rosetti, he became Cultural Attaché to the United Kingdom, a posting cut short when Romanian-British foreign relations were broken.

After leaving London he was assigned the office of Counsel and Press Officer (later Cultural Attaché) to the Romanian Embassy in Portugal, where he was kept on as diplomat by the National Legionary State (the Iron Guard government) and, ultimately, by Ion Antonescu&#x27;s regime. His office involved disseminating propaganda in favor of the Romanian state. In 1941, during his time in Portugal, Eliade stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Palácio. He would later find a house in Cascais, at Rua da Saudade.

In February 1941, weeks after the bloody Legionary Rebellion was crushed by Antonescu, &quot;Iphigenia&quot; was staged by the National Theater Bucharest—the play soon raised concerns that it owed inspiration to the Iron Guard&#x27;s ideology, and even that its inclusion in the program was a Legionary attempt at subversion.

In 1942, Eliade authored a volume in praise of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;, established in Portugal by António de Oliveira Salazar, claiming that &quot;The Salazarian state, a Christian and totalitarian one, is first and foremost based on love&quot;. On July 7 of the same year, he was received by Salazar himself, who assigned Eliade the task of warning Antonescu to withdraw the Romanian Army from the Eastern Front (&quot;[In his place], I would not be grinding it in Russia&quot;). Eliade also claimed that such contacts with the leader of a neutral country had made him the target for Gestapo surveillance, but that he had managed to communicate Salazar&#x27;s advice to Mihai Antonescu, Romania&#x27;s Foreign Minister.

In autumn 1943, he traveled to occupied France, where he rejoined Emil Cioran, also meeting with scholar Georges Dumézil and the collaborationist writer Paul Morand. At the same time, he applied for a position of lecturer at the University of Bucharest, but withdrew from the race, leaving Constantin Noica and Ion Zamfirescu to dispute the position, in front of a panel of academics comprising Lucian Blaga and Dimitrie Gusti (Zamfirescu&#x27;s eventual selection, going against Blaga&#x27;s recommendation, was to be the topic of a controversy). In his private notes, Eliade wrote that he took no further interest in the office, because his visits abroad had convinced him that he had &quot;something great to say&quot;, and that he could not function within the confines of &quot;a minor culture&quot;. Also during the war, Eliade traveled to Berlin, where he met and conversed with controversial political theorist Carl Schmitt, and frequently visited Francoist Spain, where he notably attended the 1944 Lusitano-Spanish scientific congress in Córdoba. It was during his trips to Spain that Eliade met philosophers José Ortega y Gasset and Eugenio d&#x27;Ors. He maintained a friendship with d&#x27;Ors, and met him again on several occasions after the war.

Nina Eliade fell ill with uterine cancer and died during their stay in Lisbon, in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, the disease was probably caused by an abortion procedure she had undergone at an early stage of their relationship. He came to suffer from clinical depression, which increased as Romania and her Axis allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front. Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a monk, he was on a continuous search for effective antidepressants, medicating himself with passion flower extract, and, eventually, with methamphetamine. This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking opium during his travels to Calcutta. Later, discussing the works of Aldous Huxley, Eliade wrote that the British author&#x27;s use of mescaline as a source of inspiration had something in common with his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was &quot;needless to explain why that is&quot;.

===Early exile===
At signs that the Romanian communist regime was about to take hold, Eliade opted not to return to the country. On September 16, 1945, he moved to France with his adopted daughter Giza. Once there, he resumed contacts with Dumézil, who helped him recover his position in academia. On Dumézil&#x27;s recommendation, he taught at the &quot;École Pratique des Hautes Études&quot; in Paris. It was estimated that, at the time, it was not uncommon for him to work 15 hours a day. Eliade married a second time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu. His second wife, the descendant of boyars, was the sister-in-law of the conductor Ionel Perlea.

Together with Emil Cioran and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat Alexandru Busuioceanu, helping him publicize anti-communist opinion to the Western European public. He was also briefly involved in publishing a Romanian-language magazine, titled &quot;Luceafărul&quot; (&quot;The Morning Star&quot;), and was again in contact with Mihai Șora, who had been granted a scholarship to study in France, and with Șora&#x27;s wife Mariana. In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and Ananda Coomaraswamy found him a job as a French-language teacher in the United States, at a school in Arizona; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy&#x27;s death in September.

Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal &quot;Critique&quot;, edited by French philosopher Georges Bataille. The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel &quot;Noaptea de Sânziene&quot; (he visited the country a third time in 1952). He collaborated with Carl Jung and the &quot;Eranos&quot; circle after Henry Corbin recommended him in 1949, and wrote for the &quot;Antaios&quot; magazine (edited by Ernst Jünger). In 1950, Eliade began attending &quot;Eranos&quot; conferences, meeting Jung, Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, Gershom Scholem and Paul Radin. He described &quot;Eranos&quot; as &quot;one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world.&quot;

In October 1956, he moved to the United States, settling in Chicago the following year. He had been invited by Joachim Wach to give a series of lectures at Wach&#x27;s home institution, the University of Chicago. Eliade and Wach are generally admitted to be the founders of the &quot;Chicago school&quot; that basically defined the study of religions for the second half of the 20th century. Upon Wach&#x27;s death before the lectures were delivered, Eliade was appointed as his successor, becoming, in 1964, the &quot;Sewell Avery Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions&quot;. Beginning in 1954, with the first edition of his volume on &quot;Eternal Return&quot;, Eliade also enjoyed commercial success: the book went through several editions under different titles, and sold over 100,000 copies.

In 1966, Mircea Eliade became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also worked as editor-in-chief of Macmillan Publishers&#x27; &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion&quot;, and, in 1968, lectured in religious history at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It was also during that period that Mircea Eliade completed his voluminous and influential &quot;History of Religious Ideas&quot;, which grouped together the overviews of his main original interpretations of religious history. He occasionally traveled out of the United States, attending the Congress for the History of Religions in Marburg (1960), and visiting Sweden and Norway in 1970.

===Final years and death===
Initially, Eliade was attacked with virulence by the Romanian Communist Party press, chiefly by &quot;România Liberă&quot;—which described him as &quot;the Iron Guard&#x27;s ideologue, enemy of the working class, apologist of Salazar&#x27;s dictatorship&quot;. However, the regime also made secretive attempts to enlist his and Cioran&#x27;s support: Haig Acterian&#x27;s widow, theater director Marietta Sadova, was sent to Paris to re-establish contacts with the two. Although the move was planned by Romanian officials, her encounters were to be used as evidence incriminating her at a February 1960 trial for treason (where Constantin Noica and Dinu Pillat were the main defendants). Romania&#x27;s secret police, the Securitate, also portrayed Eliade as a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service and a former agent of the Gestapo.

He was slowly rehabilitated at home beginning in the early 1960s, under the rule of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. In the 1970s, Eliade was approached by the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime in several ways, to have him return. The move was prompted by the officially sanctioned nationalism and Romania&#x27;s claim to independence from the Eastern Bloc, as both phenomena came to see Eliade&#x27;s prestige as an asset. An unprecedented event occurred with the interview that was granted by Mircea Eliade to poet Adrian Păunescu, during the latter&#x27;s 1970 visit to Chicago; Eliade complimented both Păunescu&#x27;s activism and his support for official tenets, expressing a belief that
the youth of Eastern Europe is clearly superior to that of Western Europe. [...] I am convinced that, within ten years, the young revolutionary generation shan&#x27;t be behaving as does today the noisy minority of Western contesters. [...] Eastern youth have seen the abolition of traditional institutions, have accepted it [...] and are not yet content with the structures enforced, but rather seek to improve them.

Păunescu&#x27;s visit to Chicago was followed by those of the nationalist official writer Eugen Barbu and by Eliade&#x27;s friend Constantin Noica (who had since been released from jail). At the time, Eliade contemplated returning to Romania, but was eventually persuaded by fellow Romanian intellectuals in exile (including Radio Free Europe&#x27;s Virgil Ierunca and Monica Lovinescu) to reject Communist proposals. In 1977, he joined other exiled Romanian intellectuals in signing a telegram protesting the repressive measures newly enforced by the Ceaușescu regime. Writing in 2007, Romanian anthropologist Andrei Oișteanu recounted how, around 1984, the Securitate unsuccessfully attempted to become an agent of influence in Eliade&#x27;s Chicago circle.

During his later years, Eliade&#x27;s past was progressively exposed publicly, the stress of which probably contributed to the decline of his health. By then, his writing career was hampered by severe arthritis. The last academic honors bestowed upon him were the French Academy&#x27;s Bordin Prize (1977) and the title of &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot;, granted by George Washington University (1985).

Mircea Eliade died at the Bernard Mitchell Hospital in April 1986. Eight days previously, he suffered a stroke while reading Emil Cioran&#x27;s &quot;Exercises of Admiration&quot;, and had subsequently lost his speech function. Four months before, a fire had destroyed part of his office at the Meadville Lombard Theological School (an event which he had interpreted as an omen). Eliade&#x27;s Romanian disciple Ioan Petru Culianu, who recalled the scientific community&#x27;s reaction to the news, described Eliade&#x27;s death as &quot;a &quot;mahaparanirvana&quot;&quot;, thus comparing it to the passing of Gautama Buddha. His body was cremated in Chicago, and the funeral ceremony was held on University grounds, at the Rockefeller Chapel. It was attended by 1,200 people, and included a public reading of Eliade&#x27;s text in which he recalled the epiphany of his childhood—the lecture was given by novelist Saul Bellow, Eliade&#x27;s colleague at the university. His student and the bearer of his legacy, Charles H. Long, co-founder of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School, gave the eulogy. His grave is located in Oak Woods Cemetery.

==Work==

===The general nature of religion===
In his work on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly regarded for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade&#x27;s thinking was in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (René Guénon and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade&#x27;s &quot;The Sacred and the Profane&quot; partially builds on Otto&#x27;s &quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot; to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.

Eliade is known for his attempt to find broad, cross-cultural parallels and unities in religion, particularly in myths. Wendy Doniger, Eliade&#x27;s colleague from 1978 until his death, has observed that &quot;Eliade argued boldly for universals where he might more safely have argued for widely prevalent patterns.&quot; His &quot;Treatise on the History of Religions&quot; was praised by French philologist Georges Dumézil for its coherence and ability to synthesize diverse and distinct mythologies.

Robert Ellwood describes Eliade&#x27;s approach to religion as follows. Eliade approaches religion by imagining an ideally &quot;religious&quot; person, whom he calls &quot;homo religiosus&quot; in his writings. Eliade&#x27;s theories basically describe how this &quot;homo religiosus&quot; would view the world. This does not mean that all religious practitioners actually think and act like &quot;homo religiosus&quot;. Instead, it means that religious behavior &quot;says through its own language&quot; that the world is as &quot;homo religiosus&quot; would see it, whether or not the real-life participants in religious behavior are aware of it. However, Ellwood writes that Eliade &quot;tends to slide over that last qualification&quot;, implying that traditional societies actually thought like &quot;homo religiosus&quot;.

====Sacred and profane====

Eliade argues that &quot;Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once.&quot; He also thought that the Indian and Chinese mystic tried to attain &quot;a state of perfect indifference and neutrality&quot; that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which &quot;pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness.&quot;

Eliade&#x27;s understanding of religion centers on his concept of hierophany (manifestation of the Sacred)—a concept that includes, but is not limited to, the older and more restrictive concept of theophany (manifestation of a god). From the perspective of religious thought, Eliade argues, hierophanies give structure and orientation to the world, establishing a sacred order. The &quot;profane&quot; space of nonreligious experience can only be divided up geometrically: it has no &quot;qualitative differentiation and, hence, no orientation [is] given by virtue of its inherent structure.&quot; Thus, profane space gives man no pattern for his behavior. In contrast to profane space, the site of a hierophany has a sacred structure to which religious man conforms himself. A hierophany amounts to a &quot;revelation of an absolute reality, opposed to the non-reality of the vast surrounding expanse.&quot; As an example of &quot;sacred space&quot; demanding a certain response from man, Eliade gives the story of Moses halting before Yahweh&#x27;s manifestation as a burning bush (&quot;Exodus&quot; 3:5) and taking off his shoes.

====Origin myths and sacred time====
Eliade notes that, in traditional societies, myth represents the absolute truth about primordial time. According to the myths, this was the time when the Sacred first appeared, establishing the world&#x27;s structure—myths claim to describe the primordial events that made society and the natural world be that which they are. Eliade argues that all myths are, in that sense, origin myths: &quot;myth, then, is always an account of a &quot;creation.&quot;&quot;

Many traditional societies believe that the power of a thing lies in its origin. If origin is equivalent to power, then &quot;it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid&quot; (a thing&#x27;s reality and value therefore lies only in its first appearance).

According to Eliade&#x27;s theory, only the Sacred has value, only a thing&#x27;s first appearance has value and, therefore, only the Sacred&#x27;s first appearance has value. Myth describes the Sacred&#x27;s first appearance; therefore, the mythical age is sacred time, the only time of value: &quot;primitive man was interested only in the &quot;beginnings&quot; [...] to him it mattered little what had happened to himself, or to others like him, in more or less distant times.&quot; Eliade postulated this as the reason for the &quot;nostalgia for origins&quot; that appears in many religions, the desire to return to a primordial Paradise.

====Eternal return and &quot;Terror of history&quot;====

Eliade argues that traditional man attributes no value to the linear march of historical events: only the events of the mythical age have value. To give his own life value, traditional man performs myths and rituals. Because the Sacred&#x27;s essence lies only in the mythical age, only in the Sacred&#x27;s first appearance, any later appearance is actually the first appearance; by recounting or re-enacting mythical events, myths and rituals &quot;re-actualize&quot; those events. Eliade often uses the term &quot;archetypes&quot; to refer to the mythical models established by the Sacred, although Eliade&#x27;s use of the term should be distinguished from the use of the term in Jungian psychology.

Thus, argues Eliade, religious behavior does not only commemorate, but also participates in, sacred events:

In &quot;imitating&quot; the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.

Eliade called this concept the &quot;eternal return&quot; (distinguished from the philosophical concept of &quot;eternal return&quot;). Wendy Doniger noted that Eliade&#x27;s theory of the eternal return &quot;has become a truism in the study of religions.&quot;

Eliade attributes the well-known &quot;cyclic&quot; vision of time in ancient thought to belief in the eternal return. For instance, the New Year ceremonies among the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians, and other Near Eastern peoples re-enacted their cosmogonic myths. Therefore, by the logic of the eternal return, each New Year ceremony &quot;was&quot; the beginning of the world for these peoples. According to Eliade, these peoples felt a need to return to the Beginning at regular intervals, turning time into a circle.

Eliade argues that yearning to remain in the mythical age causes a &quot;terror of history&quot;: traditional man desires to escape the linear succession of events (which, Eliade indicated, he viewed as empty of any inherent value or sacrality). Eliade suggests that the abandonment of mythical thought and the full acceptance of linear, historical time, with its &quot;terror&quot;, is one of the reasons for modern man&#x27;s anxieties. Traditional societies escape this anxiety to an extent, as they refuse to completely acknowledge historical time. But the return to the sources involved an apocalyptic experience. Doina Ruști, analyzing the story &quot;The Old Man and The Bureaucrats&quot; (&quot;Pe strada Mântuleasa&quot;), says The memories create the chaos, because &quot;the myth makes irruption in a world in tormented birth, without memory, and transform all in a labyrinth&quot;.

====&quot;Coincidentia oppositorum&quot;====
Eliade claims that many myths, rituals, and mystical experiences involve a &quot;coincidence of opposites&quot;, or &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot;. In fact, he calls the &quot; oppositorum&quot; &quot;the mythical pattern.&quot; Many myths, Eliade notes, &quot;present us with a twofold revelation&quot;:
they express on the one hand the diametrical opposition of two divine figures sprung from one and the same principle and destined, in many versions, to be reconciled at some &quot;illud tempus&quot; of eschatology, and on the other, the &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot; in the very nature of the divinity, which shows itself, by turns or even simultaneously, benevolent and terrible, creative and destructive, solar and serpentine, and so on (in other words, actual and potential).
The reconciling opposites „involves imitating gestures or situations from before the establishment of history, by recovering the initial state, by regenerating time and the world, but also by mystical initiation.&quot;
Eliade argues that &quot;Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once.&quot; He also thought that the Indian and Chinese mystic tried to attain &quot;a state of perfect indifference and neutrality&quot; that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which &quot;pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness&quot;.

According to Eliade, the &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot;&#x27;s appeal lies in &quot;man&#x27;s deep dissatisfaction with his actual situation, with what is called the human condition&quot;. In many mythologies, the end of the mythical age involves a &quot;fall&quot;, a fundamental &quot;ontological change in the structure of the World&quot;. Because the &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot; is a contradiction, it represents a denial of the world&#x27;s current logical structure, a reversal of the &quot;fall&quot;.

Also, traditional man&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the post-mythical age expresses itself as a feeling of being &quot;torn and separate&quot;. In many mythologies, the lost mythical age was a Paradise, &quot;a paradoxical state in which the contraries exist side by side without conflict, and the multiplications form aspects of a mysterious Unity&quot;. The &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot; expresses a wish to recover the lost unity of the mythical Paradise, for it presents a reconciliation of opposites and the unification of diversity:
On the level of pre-systematic thought, the mystery of totality embodies man&#x27;s endeavor to reach a perspective in which the contraries are abolished, the Spirit of Evil reveals itself as a stimulant of Good, and Demons appear as the night aspect of the Gods.

===Exceptions to the general nature===

Eliade acknowledges that not all religious behavior has all the attributes described in his theory of sacred time and the eternal return. The Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions embrace linear, historical time as sacred or capable of sanctification, while some Eastern traditions largely reject the notion of sacred time, seeking escape from the cycles of time.

Because they contain rituals, Judaism and Christianity necessarily—Eliade argues—retain a sense of cyclic time:
&quot;by the very fact that it is a religion&quot;, Christianity had to keep at least one mythical aspect—liturgical Time, that is, the periodic rediscovery of the &quot;illud tempus&quot; of the beginnings [and] an &quot;imitation&quot; of the Christ as &quot;exemplary pattern&quot;.

However, Judaism and Christianity do not see time as a circle endlessly turning on itself; nor do they see such a cycle as desirable, as a way to participate in the Sacred. Instead, these religions embrace the concept of linear history progressing toward the Messianic Age or the Last Judgment, thus initiating the idea of &quot;progress&quot; (humans are to work for a Paradise in the future). However, Eliade&#x27;s understanding of Judaeo-Christian eschatology can also be understood as cyclical in that the &quot;end of time&quot; is a return to God: &quot;The final catastrophe will put an end to history, hence will restore man to eternity and beatitude.&quot;

The pre-Islamic Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, which made a notable &quot;contribution to the religious formation of the West&quot;, also has a linear sense of time; although, according to Eliade, the Hebrews&#x27; linear sense of time predates their being influenced by Zoroastrianism. In fact, Eliade identifies the Hebrews, not the Zoroastrians, as the first culture to truly &quot;valorize&quot; historical time, the first to see all major historical events as episodes in a continuous divine revelation. However, Eliade argues, Judaism elaborated its mythology of linear time by adding elements borrowed from Zoroastrianism—including ethical dualism, a savior figure, the future resurrection of the body, and the idea of cosmic progress toward &quot;the final triumph of Good.&quot;

The Indian religions of the East generally retain a cyclic view of time—for instance, the Hindu doctrine of &quot;kalpas&quot;. According to Eliade, most religions that accept the cyclic view of time also embrace it: they see it as a way to return to the sacred time. However, in Buddhism, Jainism, and some forms of Hinduism, the Sacred lies outside the flux of the material world (called &quot;maya&quot;, or &quot;illusion&quot;), and one can only reach it by escaping from the cycles of time. Because the Sacred lies outside cyclic time, which conditions humans, people can only reach the Sacred by escaping the human condition. According to Eliade, Yoga techniques aim at escaping the limitations of the body, allowing the soul (&quot;atman&quot;) to rise above &quot;maya&quot; and reach the Sacred (&quot;nirvana&quot;, &quot;moksha&quot;). Imagery of &quot;freedom&quot;, and of death to one&#x27;s old body and rebirth with a new body, occur frequently in Yogic texts, representing escape from the bondage of the temporal human condition. Eliade discusses these themes in detail in &quot;Yoga: Immortality and Freedom&quot;.

===Symbolism of the Center===
A recurrent theme in Eliade&#x27;s myth analysis is the &quot;axis mundi&quot;, the Center of the World. According to Eliade, the Cosmic Center is a necessary corollary to the division of reality into the Sacred and the profane. The Sacred contains all value, and the world gains purpose and meaning only through hierophanies:
In the homogeneous and infinite expanse, in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established, the hierophany reveals an absolute fixed point, a center.

Because profane space gives man no orientation for his life, the Sacred must manifest itself in a hierophany, thereby establishing a sacred site around which man can orient himself. The site of a hierophany establishes a &quot;fixed point, a center&quot;. This Center abolishes the &quot;homogeneity and relativity of profane space&quot;, for it becomes &quot;the central axis for all future orientation&quot;.

A manifestation of the Sacred in profane space is, by definition, an example of something breaking through from one plane of existence to another. Therefore, the initial hierophany that establishes the Center must be a point at which there is contact between different planes—this, Eliade argues, explains the frequent mythical imagery of a Cosmic Tree or Pillar joining Heaven, Earth, and the underworld.

Eliade noted that, when traditional societies found a new territory, they often perform consecrating rituals that reenact the hierophany that established the center and founded the world. In addition, the designs of traditional buildings, especially temples, usually imitate the mythical image of the &quot;axis mundi&quot; joining the different cosmic levels. For instance, the Babylonian ziggurats were built to resemble cosmic mountains passing through the heavenly spheres, and the rock of the Temple in Jerusalem was supposed to reach deep into the &quot;tehom&quot;, or primordial waters.

According to the logic of the eternal return, the site of each such symbolic Center will actually be the Center of the World:
It may be said, in general, that the majority of the sacred and ritual trees that we meet with in the history of religions are only replicas, imperfect copies of this exemplary archetype, the Cosmic Tree. Thus, all these sacred trees are thought of as situated at the Centre of the World, and all the ritual trees or posts [...] are, as it were, magically projected into the Centre of the World.
According to Eliade&#x27;s interpretation, religious man apparently feels the need to live not only near, but &quot;at&quot;, the mythical Center as much as possible, given that the center is the point of communication with the Sacred.

Thus, Eliade argues, many traditional societies share common outlines in their mythical geographies. In the middle of the known world is the sacred Center, &quot;a place that is sacred above all&quot;; this Center anchors the established order. Around the sacred Center lies the known world, the realm of established order; and beyond the known world is a chaotic and dangerous realm, &quot;peopled by ghosts, demons, [and] &#x27;foreigners&#x27; (who are [identified with] demons and the souls of the dead)&quot;. According to Eliade, traditional societies place their known world at the Center because (from their perspective) their known world is the realm that obeys a recognizable order, and it therefore must be the realm in which the Sacred manifests itself; the regions beyond the known world, which seem strange and foreign, must lie far from the center, outside the order established by the Sacred.

===The High God===

According to some &quot;evolutionistic&quot; theories of religion, especially that of Edward Burnett Tylor, cultures naturally progress from animism and polytheism to monotheism. According to this view, more advanced cultures should be more monotheistic, and more primitive cultures should be more polytheistic. However, many of the most &quot;primitive&quot;, pre-agricultural societies believe in a supreme sky-god. Thus, according to Eliade, post-19th-century scholars have rejected Tylor&#x27;s theory of evolution from animism. Based on the discovery of supreme sky-gods among &quot;primitives&quot;, Eliade suspects that the earliest humans worshiped a heavenly Supreme Being. In &quot;Patterns in Comparative Religion&quot;, he writes, &quot;The most popular prayer in the world is addressed to &#x27;Our Father who art in heaven.&#x27; It is possible that man&#x27;s earliest prayers were addressed to the same heavenly father.&quot;

However, Eliade disagrees with Wilhelm Schmidt, who thought the earliest form of religion was a strict monotheism. Eliade dismisses this theory of &quot;primordial monotheism&quot; (&quot;Urmonotheismus&quot;) as &quot;rigid&quot; and unworkable. &quot;At most,&quot; he writes, &quot;this schema [Schmidt&#x27;s theory] renders an account of human [religious] evolution since the Paleolithic era&quot;. If an &quot;Urmonotheismus&quot; did exist, Eliade adds, it probably differed in many ways from the conceptions of God in many modern monotheistic faiths: for instance, the primordial High God could manifest himself as an animal without losing his status as a celestial Supreme Being.

According to Eliade, heavenly Supreme Beings are actually less common in more advanced cultures. Eliade speculates that the discovery of agriculture brought a host of fertility gods and goddesses into the forefront, causing the celestial Supreme Being to fade away and eventually vanish from many ancient religions. Even in primitive hunter-gatherer societies, the High God is a vague, distant figure, dwelling high above the world. Often he has no cult and receives prayer only as a last resort, when all else has failed. Eliade calls the distant High God a &quot;deus otiosus&quot; (&quot;idle god&quot;).

In belief systems that involve a &quot;deus otiosus&quot;, the distant High God is believed to have been closer to humans during the mythical age. After finishing his works of creation, the High God &quot;forsook the earth and withdrew into the highest heaven&quot;. This is an example of the Sacred&#x27;s distance from &quot;profane&quot; life, life lived after the mythical age: by escaping from the profane condition through religious behavior, figures such as the shaman return to the conditions of the mythical age, which include nearness to the High God (&quot;by his &quot;flight&quot; or ascension, the shaman [...] meets the God of Heaven face to face and speaks directly to him, as man sometimes did &quot;in illo tempore&quot;&quot;). The shamanistic behaviors surrounding the High God are a particularly clear example of the eternal return.

===Shamanism===

Eliade&#x27;s scholarly work includes a study of shamanism, &quot;&quot;, a survey of shamanistic practices in different areas. His &quot;Myths, Dreams and Mysteries&quot; also addresses shamanism in some detail.

In &quot;Shamanism&quot;, Eliade argues for a restrictive use of the word &quot;shaman&quot;: it should not apply to just any magician or medicine man, as that would make the term redundant; at the same time, he argues against restricting the term to the practitioners of the sacred of Siberia and Central Asia (it is from one of the titles for this function, namely, &quot;šamán&quot;, considered by Eliade to be of Tungusic origin, that the term itself was introduced into Western languages). Eliade defines a shaman as follows:
he is believed to cure, like all doctors, and to perform miracles of the fakir type, like all magicians [...] But beyond this, he is a psychopomp, and he may also be a priest, mystic, and poet.

If we define shamanism this way, Eliade claims, we find that the term covers a collection of phenomena that share a common and unique &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;history.&quot; (When thus defined, shamanism tends to occur in its purest forms in hunting and pastoral societies like those of Siberia and Central Asia, which revere a celestial High God &quot;on the way to becoming a &quot;deus otiosus&quot;.&quot; Eliade takes the shamanism of those regions as his most representative example.)

In his examinations of shamanism, Eliade emphasizes the shaman&#x27;s attribute of regaining man&#x27;s condition before the &quot;Fall&quot; out of sacred time: &quot;The most representative mystical experience of the archaic societies, that of shamanism, betrays the &quot;Nostalgia for Paradise&quot;, the desire to recover the state of freedom and beatitude before &#x27;the Fall&#x27;.&quot; This concern—which, by itself, is the concern of almost all religious behavior, according to Eliade—manifests itself in specific ways in shamanism.

====Death, resurrection and secondary functions====
According to Eliade, one of the most common shamanistic themes is the shaman&#x27;s supposed death and resurrection. This occurs in particular during his initiation. Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then put him back together and revive him. In more than one way, this death and resurrection represents the shaman&#x27;s elevation above human nature.

First, the shaman dies so that he can rise above human nature on a quite literal level. After he has been dismembered by the initiatory spirits, they often replace his old organs with new, magical ones (the shaman dies to his profane self so that he can rise again as a new, sanctified, being). Second, by being reduced to his bones, the shaman experiences rebirth on a more symbolic level: in many hunting and herding societies, the bone represents the source of life, so reduction to a skeleton &quot;is equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordial life, that is, to a complete renewal, a mystical rebirth&quot;. Eliade considers this return to the source of life essentially equivalent to the eternal return.

Third, the shamanistic phenomenon of repeated death and resurrection also represents a transfiguration in other ways. The shaman dies not once but many times: having died during initiation and risen again with new powers, the shaman can send his spirit out of his body on errands; thus, his whole career consists of repeated deaths and resurrections. The shaman&#x27;s new ability to die and return to life shows that he is no longer bound by the laws of profane time, particularly the law of death: &quot;the ability to &#x27;die&#x27; and come to life again [...] denotes that [the shaman] has surpassed the human condition.&quot;

Having risen above the human condition, the shaman is not bound by the flow of history. Therefore, he enjoys the conditions of the mythical age. In many myths, humans can speak with animals; and, after their initiations, many shamans claim to be able to communicate with animals. According to Eliade, this is one manifestation of the shaman&#x27;s return to &quot;the &quot;illud tempus&quot; described to us by the paradisiac myths.&quot;

The shaman can descend to the underworld or ascend to heaven, often by climbing the World Tree, the cosmic pillar, the sacred ladder, or some other form of the &quot;axis mundi&quot;. Often, the shaman will ascend to heaven to speak with the High God. Because the gods (particularly the High God, according to Eliade&#x27;s &quot;deus otiosus&quot; concept) were closer to humans during the mythical age, the shaman&#x27;s easy communication with the High God represents an abolition of history and a return to the mythical age.

Because of his ability to communicate with the gods and descend to the land of the dead, the shaman frequently functions as a psychopomp and a medicine man.

==Philosophy==

===Early contributions===
In addition to his political essays, the young Mircea Eliade authored others, philosophical in content. Connected with the ideology of Trăirism, they were often prophetic in tone, and saw Eliade being hailed as a herald by various representatives of his generation. When Eliade was 21 years old and publishing his &quot;Itinerar spiritual&quot;, literary critic Şerban Cioculescu described him as &quot;the column leader of the spiritually mystical and Orthodox youth.&quot; Cioculescu discussed his &quot;impressive erudition&quot;, but argued that it was &quot;occasionally plethoric, poetically inebriating itself through abuse.&quot; Cioculescu&#x27;s colleague Perpessicius saw the young author and his generation as marked by &quot;the specter of war&quot;, a notion he connected to various essays of the 1920s and 30s in which Eliade threatened the world with the verdict that a new conflict was looming (while asking that young people be allowed to manifest their will and fully experience freedom before perishing).

One of Eliade&#x27;s noted contributions in this respect was the 1932 &quot;Soliloquii&quot; (&#x27;Soliloquies&#x27;), which explored existential philosophy. George Călinescu who saw in it &quot;an echo of Nae Ionescu&#x27;s lectures&quot;, traced a parallel with the essays of another of Ionescu&#x27;s disciples, Emil Cioran, while noting that Cioran&#x27;s were &quot;of a more exulted tone and written in the aphoristic form of Kierkegaard.&quot; Călinescu recorded Eliade&#x27;s rejection of objectivity, citing the author&#x27;s stated indifference towards any &quot;naïveté&quot; or &quot;contradictions&quot; that the reader could possibly reproach him, as well as his dismissive thoughts of &quot;theoretical data&quot; and mainstream philosophy in general (Eliade saw the latter as &quot;inert, infertile and pathogenic&quot;). Eliade thus argued, &quot;a sincere brain is unassailable, for it denies itself to any relationship with outside truths.&quot;

The young writer was however careful to clarify that the existence he took into consideration was not the life of &quot;instincts and personal idiosyncrasies&quot;, which he believed determined the lives of many humans, but that of a distinct set comprising &quot;personalities&quot;. He described &quot;personalities&quot; as characterized by both &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;a much more complicated and dangerous alchemy.&quot; This differentiation, George Călinescu believed, echoed Ionescu&#x27;s metaphor of man, seen as &quot;the only animal who can fail at living&quot;, and the duck, who &quot;shall remain a duck no matter what it does&quot;. According to Eliade, the purpose of personalities is infinity: &quot;consciously and gloriously bringing [existence] to waste, into as many skies as possible, continuously fulfilling and polishing oneself, seeking ascent and not circumference.&quot;

In Eliade&#x27;s view, two roads await man in this process. One is glory, determined by either work or procreation, and the other the asceticism of religion or magic—both, Călinescu believed, were aimed at reaching the absolute, even in those cases where Eliade described the latter as an &quot;abyssal experience&quot; into which man may take the plunge. The critic pointed out that the addition of &quot;a magical solution&quot; to the options taken into consideration seemed to be Eliade&#x27;s own original contributions to his mentor&#x27;s philosophy, and proposed that it may have owed inspiration to Julius Evola and his disciples. He also recorded that Eliade applied this concept to human creation, and specifically to artistic creation, citing him describing the latter as &quot;a magical joy, the victorious break of the iron circle&quot; (a reflection of &quot;imitatio dei&quot;, having salvation for its ultimate goal).

===Philosopher of religion===

====Anti-reductionism and the &quot;transconscious&quot;====
By profession, Eliade was a historian of religion. However, his scholarly works draw heavily on philosophical and psychological terminology. In addition, they contain a number of philosophical arguments about religion. In particular, Eliade often implies the existence of a universal psychological or spiritual &quot;essence&quot; behind all religious phenomena. Because of these arguments, some have accused Eliade of overgeneralization and &quot;essentialism&quot;, or even of promoting a theological agenda under the guise of historical scholarship. However, others argue that Eliade is better understood as a scholar who is willing to openly discuss sacred experience and its consequences.

In studying religion, Eliade rejects certain &quot;reductionist&quot; approaches. Eliade thinks a religious phenomenon cannot be reduced to a product of culture and history. He insists that, although religion involves &quot;the social man, the economic man, and so forth&quot;, nonetheless &quot;all these conditioning factors together do not, of themselves, add up to the life of the spirit.&quot;

Using this anti-reductionist position, Eliade argues against those who accuse him of overgeneralizing, of looking for universals at the expense of particulars. Eliade admits that every religious phenomenon is shaped by the particular culture and history that produced it:
When the Son of God incarnated and became the Christ, he had to speak Aramaic; he could only conduct himself as a Hebrew of his times [...] His religious message, however universal it might be, was conditioned by the past and present history of the Hebrew people. If the Son of God had been born in India, his spoken language would have had to conform itself to the structure of the Indian languages.

However, Eliade argues against those he calls &quot;historicist or existentialist philosophers&quot; who do not recognize &quot;man in general&quot; behind particular men produced by particular situations (Eliade cites Immanuel Kant as the likely forerunner of this kind of &quot;historicism&quot;.) He adds that human consciousness transcends (is not reducible to) its historical and cultural conditioning, and even suggests the possibility of a &quot;transconscious&quot;. By this, Eliade does not necessarily mean anything supernatural or mystical: within the &quot;transconscious&quot;, he places religious motifs, symbols, images, and nostalgias that are supposedly universal and whose causes therefore cannot be reduced to historical and cultural conditioning.

====Platonism and &quot;primitive ontology&quot;====
According to Eliade, traditional man feels that things &quot;acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality&quot;. To traditional man, the profane world is &quot;meaningless&quot;, and a thing rises out of the profane world only by conforming to an ideal, mythical model.

Eliade describes this view of reality as a fundamental part of &quot;primitive ontology&quot; (the study of &quot;existence&quot; or &quot;reality&quot;). Here he sees a similarity with the philosophy of Plato, who believed that physical phenomena are pale and transient imitations of eternal models or &quot;Forms&quot; (&quot;see Theory of forms&quot;). He argued:
Plato could be regarded as the outstanding philosopher of &#x27;primitive mentality,&#x27; that is, as the thinker who succeeded in giving philosophic currency and validity to the modes of life and behavior of archaic humanity.

Eliade thinks the Platonic &quot;theory of forms&quot; is &quot;primitive ontology&quot; persisting in Greek philosophy. He claims that Platonism is the &quot;most fully elaborated&quot; version of this primitive ontology.

In &quot;The Structure of Religious Knowing: Encountering the Sacred in Eliade and Lonergan&quot;, John Daniel Dadosky argues that, by making this statement, Eliade was acknowledging &quot;indebtedness to Greek philosophy in general, and to Plato&#x27;s theory of forms specifically, for his own theory of archetypes and repetition&quot;. However, Dadosky also states that &quot;one should be cautious when trying to assess Eliade&#x27;s indebtedness to Plato&quot;. Dadosky quotes Robert Segal, a professor of religion, who draws a distinction between Platonism and Eliade&#x27;s &quot;primitive ontology&quot;: for Eliade, the ideal models are patterns that a person or object may or may not imitate; for Plato, there is a Form for everything, and everything imitates a Form by the very fact that it exists.

====Existentialism and secularism====
Behind the diverse cultural forms of different religions, Eliade proposes a universal: traditional man, he claims, &quot;always believes that there is an absolute reality, &quot;the sacred&quot;, which transcends this world but manifests itself in this world, thereby sanctifying it and making it real.&quot; Furthermore, traditional man&#x27;s behavior gains purpose and meaning through the Sacred: &quot;By imitating divine behavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods—that is, in the real and the significant.&quot; According to Eliade, &quot;modern nonreligious man assumes a new existential situation.&quot; For traditional man, historical events gain significance by imitating sacred, transcendent events. In contrast, nonreligious man lacks sacred models for how history or human behavior should be, so he must decide on his own how history should proceed—he &quot;regards himself solely as the subject and agent of history, and refuses all appeal to transcendence&quot;.

From the standpoint of religious thought, the world has an objective purpose established by mythical events, to which man should conform himself: &quot;Myth teaches [religious man] the primordial &#x27;stories&#x27; that have constituted him existentially.&quot; From the standpoint of secular thought, any purpose must be invented and imposed on the world by man. Because of this new &quot;existential situation&quot;, Eliade argues, the Sacred becomes the primary obstacle to nonreligious man&#x27;s &quot;freedom&quot;. In viewing himself as the proper maker of history, nonreligious man resists all notions of an externally (for instance, divinely) imposed order or model he must obey: modern man &quot;&quot;makes himself&quot;, and he only makes himself completely in proportion as he desacralizes himself and the world. [...] He will not truly be free until he has killed the last god.&quot;

====Religious survivals in the secular world====
Eliade says that secular man cannot escape his bondage to religious thought. By its very nature, secularism depends on religion for its sense of identity: by resisting sacred models, by insisting that man make history on his own, secular man identifies himself only through opposition to religious thought: &quot;He [secular man] recognizes himself in proportion as he &#x27;frees&#x27; and &#x27;purifies&#x27; himself from the &#x27;superstitions&#x27; of his ancestors.&quot; Furthermore, modern man &quot;still retains a large stock of camouflaged myths and degenerated rituals&quot;. For example, modern social events still have similarities to traditional initiation rituals, and modern novels feature mythical motifs and themes. Finally, secular man still participates in something like the eternal return: by reading modern literature, &quot;modern man succeeds in obtaining an &#x27;escape from time&#x27; comparable to the &#x27;emergence from time&#x27; effected by myths&quot;.

Eliade sees traces of religious thought even in secular academia. He thinks modern scientists are motivated by the religious desire to return to the sacred time of origins:
One could say that the anxious search for the origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the &#x27;mysteries of Nature&#x27;; the urge to penetrate and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal &quot;matrix&quot;. Matter, Substance, represents the &quot;absolute origin&quot;, the beginning of all things.
Eliade believes the rise of materialism in the 19th century forced the religious nostalgia for &quot;origins&quot; to express itself in science. He mentions his own field of History of Religions as one of the fields that was obsessed with origins during the 19th century:
The new discipline of History of Religions developed rapidly in this cultural context. And, of course, it followed a like pattern: the positivistic approach to the facts and the search for origins, for the very beginning of religion.
All Western historiography was during that time obsessed with the quest of &quot;origins&quot;. [...] This search for the origins of human institutions and cultural creations prolongs and completes the naturalist&#x27;s quest for the origin of species, the biologist&#x27;s dream of grasping the origin of life, the geologist&#x27;s and the astronomer&#x27;s endeavor to understand the origin of the Earth and the Universe. From a psychological point of view, one can decipher here the same nostalgia for the &#x27;primordial&#x27; and the &#x27;original&#x27;.

In some of his writings, Eliade describes modern political ideologies as secularized mythology. According to Eliade, Marxism &quot;takes up and carries on one of the great eschatological myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the &#x27;elect&#x27;, the &#x27;anointed&#x27;, the &#x27;innocent&#x27;, the &#x27;missioners&#x27;, in our own days the proletariat), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world.&quot; Eliade sees the widespread myth of the Golden Age, &quot;which, according to a number of traditions, lies at the beginning and the end of History&quot;, as the &quot;precedent&quot; for Karl Marx&#x27;s vision of a classless society. Finally, he sees Marx&#x27;s belief in the final triumph of the good (the proletariat) over the evil (the bourgeoisie) as &quot;a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology&quot;. Despite Marx&#x27;s hostility toward religion, Eliade implies, his ideology works within a conceptual framework inherited from religious mythology.

Likewise, Eliade notes that Nazism involved a pseudo-pagan mysticism based on ancient Germanic religion. He suggests that the differences between the Nazis&#x27; pseudo-Germanic mythology and Marx&#x27;s pseudo-Judaeo-Christian mythology explain their differing success:
In comparison with the vigorous optimism of the communist myth, the mythology propagated by the national socialists seems particularly inept; and this is not only because of the limitations of the racial myth (how could one imagine that the rest of Europe would voluntarily accept submission to the master-race?), but above all because of the fundamental pessimism of the Germanic mythology. [...] For the eschaton prophesied and expected by the ancient Germans was the ragnarok—that is, a catastrophic end of the world.

====Modern man and the &quot;terror of history&quot;====
According to Eliade, modern man displays &quot;traces&quot; of &quot;mythological behavior&quot; because he intensely needs sacred time and the eternal return. Despite modern man&#x27;s claims to be nonreligious, he ultimately cannot find value in the linear progression of historical events; even modern man feels the &quot;terror of history&quot;: &quot;Here too [...] there is always the struggle against Time, the hope to be freed from the weight of &#x27;dead Time,&#x27; of the Time that crushes and kills.&quot;

This &quot;terror of history&quot; becomes especially acute when violent and threatening historical events confront modern man—the mere fact that a terrible event has happened, that it is part of history, is of little comfort to those who suffer from it. Eliade asks rhetorically how modern man can &quot;tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to atomic bombings—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning&quot;. He indicates that, if repetitions of mythical events provided sacred value and meaning for history in the eyes of ancient man, modern man has denied the Sacred and must therefore invent value and purpose on his own. Without the Sacred to confer an absolute, objective value upon historical events, modern man is left with &quot;a relativistic or nihilistic view of history&quot; and a resulting &quot;spiritual aridity&quot;. In chapter 4 (&quot;The Terror of History&quot;) of &quot;The Myth of the Eternal Return&quot; and chapter 9 (&quot;Religious Symbolism and the Modern Man&#x27;s Anxiety&quot;) of &quot;Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries&quot;, Eliade argues at length that the rejection of religious thought is a primary cause of modern man&#x27;s anxieties.

====Inter-cultural dialogue and a &quot;new humanism&quot;====
Eliade argues that modern man may escape the &quot;Terror of history&quot; by learning from traditional cultures. For example, Eliade thinks Hinduism has advice for modern Westerners. According to many branches of Hinduism, the world of historical time is illusory, and the only absolute reality is the immortal soul or &quot;atman&quot; within man. According to Eliade, Hindus thus escape the terror of history by refusing to see historical time as the true reality.

Eliade notes that a Western or Continental philosopher might feel suspicious toward this Hindu view of history:
One can easily guess what a European historical and existentialist philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to &#x27;die to History&#x27;; but man is not, and he &quot;cannot be&quot; anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, to give up my authentic existence and to take refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the &quot;atman&quot;: I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History to live an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.

However, Eliade argues that the Hindu approach to history does not necessarily lead to a rejection of history. On the contrary, in Hinduism historical human existence is not the &quot;absurdity&quot; that many Continental philosophers see it as. According to Hinduism, history is a divine creation, and one may live contentedly within it as long as one maintains a certain degree of detachment from it: &quot;One is devoured by Time, by History, not because one lives in them, but because one thinks them &quot;real&quot; and, in consequence, one forgets or undervalues eternity.&quot; Furthermore, Eliade argues that Westerners can learn from non-Western cultures to see something besides absurdity in suffering and death. Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a rite of passage. In fact, their initiation rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into the next stage of one&#x27;s existence.

Eliade even suggests that traditional thought offers relief from the vague anxiety caused by &quot;our obscure presentiment of the end of the world, or more exactly of the end of &quot;our&quot; world, our &quot;own&quot; civilization&quot;. Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed &quot;in paralysing either Life or Culture&quot;. These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.

Eliade argues that a Western spiritual rebirth can happen within the framework of Western spiritual traditions. However, he says, to start this rebirth, Westerners may need to be stimulated by ideas from non-Western cultures. In his &quot;Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries&quot;, Eliade claims that a &quot;genuine encounter&quot; between cultures &quot;might well constitute the point of departure for a new humanism, upon a world scale&quot;.

====Christianity and the &quot;salvation&quot; of History====
Mircea Eliade sees the Abrahamic religions as a turning point between the ancient, cyclic view of time and the modern, linear view of time, noting that, in their case, sacred events are not limited to a far-off primordial age, but continue throughout history: &quot;time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time&quot;. He thus sees in Christianity the ultimate example of a religion embracing linear, historical time. When God is born as a man, into the stream of history, &quot;all history becomes a theophany&quot;. According to Eliade, &quot;Christianity strives to &quot;save&quot; history&quot;. In Christianity, the Sacred enters a human being (Christ) to save humans, but it also enters history to &quot;save&quot; history and turn otherwise ordinary, historical events into something &quot;capable of transmitting a trans-historical message&quot;.

From Eliade&#x27;s perspective, Christianity&#x27;s &quot;trans-historical message&quot; may be the most important help that modern man could have in confronting the terror of history. In his book &quot;Mito&quot; (&quot;Myth&quot;), Italian researcher Furio Jesi argues that Eliade denies man the position of a true protagonist in history: for Eliade, true human experience lies not in intellectually &quot;making history&quot;, but in man&#x27;s experiences of joy and grief. Thus, from Eliade&#x27;s perspective, the Christ story becomes the perfect myth for modern man. In Christianity, God willingly entered historical time by being born as Christ, and accepted the suffering that followed. By identifying with Christ, modern man can learn to confront painful historical events. Ultimately, according to Jesi, Eliade sees Christianity as the only religion that can save man from the &quot;Terror of history&quot;.

In Eliade&#x27;s view, traditional man sees time as an endless repetition of mythical archetypes. In contrast, modern man has abandoned mythical archetypes and entered linear, historical time—in this context, unlike many other religions, Christianity attributes value to historical time. Thus, Eliade concludes, &quot;Christianity incontestably proves to be the religion of &#x27;fallen man, of modern man who has lost &quot;the paradise of archetypes and repetition&quot;.

====&quot;Modern gnosticism&quot;, Romanticism and Eliade&#x27;s nostalgia====
In analyzing the similarities between the &quot;mythologists&quot; Eliade, Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, Robert Ellwood concluded that the three modern mythologists, all of whom believed that myths reveal &quot;timeless truth&quot;, fulfilled the role &quot;gnostics&quot; had in antiquity. The diverse religious movements covered by the term &quot;gnosticism&quot; share the basic doctrines that the surrounding world is fundamentally evil or inhospitable, that we are trapped in the world through no fault of our own, and that we can be saved from the world only through secret knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;). Ellwood claimed that the three mythologists were &quot;modern gnostics through and through&quot;, remarking,
Whether in Augustan Rome or modern Europe, democracy all too easily gave way to totalitarianism, technology was as readily used for battle as for comfort, and immense wealth lay alongside abysmal poverty. [...] Gnostics past and present sought answers not in the course of outward human events, but in knowledge of the world&#x27;s beginning, of what lies above and beyond the world, and of the secret places of the human soul. To all this the mythologists spoke, and they acquired large and loyal followings.

According to Ellwood, the mythologists believed in gnosticism&#x27;s basic doctrines (even if in a secularized form). Ellwood also believes that Romanticism, which stimulated the modern study of mythology, strongly influenced the mythologists. Because Romantics stress that emotion and imagination have the same dignity as reason, Ellwood argues, they tend to think political truth &quot;is known less by rational considerations than by its capacity to fire the passions&quot; and, therefore, that political truth is &quot;very apt to be found [...] in the distant past&quot;.

As modern gnostics, Ellwood argues, the three mythologists felt alienated from the surrounding modern world. As scholars, they knew of primordial societies that had operated differently from modern ones. And as people influenced by Romanticism, they saw myths as a saving &quot;gnosis&quot; that offered &quot;avenues of eternal return to simpler primordial ages when the values that rule the world were forged&quot;. In addition, Ellwood identifies Eliade&#x27;s personal sense of nostalgia as a source for his interest in, or even his theories about, traditional societies. He cites Eliade himself claiming to desire an &quot;eternal return&quot; like that by which traditional man returns to the mythical paradise: &quot;My essential preoccupation is precisely the means of escaping History, of saving myself through symbol, myth, rite, archetypes&quot;.

In Ellwood&#x27;s view, Eliade&#x27;s nostalgia was only enhanced by his exile from Romania: &quot;In later years Eliade felt about his own Romanian past as did primal folk about mythic time. He was drawn back to it, yet he knew he could not live there, and that all was not well with it.&quot; He suggests that this nostalgia, along with Eliade&#x27;s sense that &quot;exile is among the profoundest metaphors for all human life&quot;, influenced Eliade&#x27;s theories. Ellwood sees evidence of this in Eliade&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Terror of history&quot; from which modern man is no longer shielded. In this concept, Ellwood sees an &quot;element of nostalgia&quot; for earlier times &quot;when the sacred was strong and the terror of history had barely raised its head&quot;.

==Criticism of Eliade&#x27;s scholarship==

===Overgeneralization===
Eliade cites a wide variety of myths and rituals to support his theories. However, he has been accused of making overgeneralizations: many scholars think he lacks sufficient evidence to put forth his ideas as universal, or even general, principles of religious thought. According to one scholar, &quot;Eliade may have been the most popular and influential contemporary historian of religion&quot;, but &quot;many, if not most, specialists in anthropology, sociology, and even history of religions have either ignored or quickly dismissed&quot; Eliade&#x27;s works.

The classicist G. S. Kirk criticizes Eliade&#x27;s insistence that Australian Aborigines and ancient Mesopotamians had concepts of &quot;being&quot;, &quot;non-being&quot;, &quot;real&quot;, and &quot;becoming&quot;, although they lacked words for them. Kirk also believes that Eliade overextends his theories: for example, Eliade claims that the modern myth of the &quot;noble savage&quot; results from the religious tendency to idealize the primordial, mythical age. According to Kirk, &quot;such extravagances, together with a marked repetitiousness, have made Eliade unpopular with many anthropologists and sociologists&quot;. In Kirk&#x27;s view, Eliade derived his theory of eternal return from the functions of Australian Aboriginal mythology and then proceeded to apply the theory to other mythologies to which it did not apply. For example, Kirk argues that the eternal return does not accurately describe the functions of Native American or Greek mythology. Kirk concludes, &quot;Eliade&#x27;s idea is a valuable perception about certain myths, not a guide to the proper understanding of all of them&quot;.

Even Wendy Doniger, Eliade&#x27;s successor at the University of Chicago, claims (in an introduction to Eliade&#x27;s own &quot;Shamanism&quot;) that the eternal return does not apply to all myths and rituals, although it may apply to many of them. However, although Doniger agrees that Eliade made overgeneralizations, she notes that his willingness to &quot;argue boldly for universals&quot; allowed him to see patterns &quot;that spanned the entire globe and the whole of human history&quot;. Whether they were true or not, she argues, Eliade&#x27;s theories are still useful &quot;as starting points for the comparative study of religion&quot;. She also argues that Eliade&#x27;s theories have been able to accommodate &quot;new data to which Eliade did not have access&quot;.

===Lack of empirical support===
Several researchers have criticized Eliade&#x27;s work as having no empirical support. Thus, he is said to have &quot;failed to provide an adequate methodology for the history of religions and to establish this discipline as an empirical science&quot;, though the same critics admit that &quot;the history of religions should not aim at being an empirical science anyway&quot;. Specifically, his claim that the sacred is a structure of human consciousness is distrusted as not being empirically provable: &quot;no one has yet turned up the basic category &quot;sacred&quot;&quot;. Also, there has been mention of his tendency to ignore the social aspects of religion. Anthropologist Alice Kehoe is highly critical of Eliade&#x27;s work on Shamanism, namely because he was not an anthropologist but a historian. She contends that Eliade never did any field work or contacted any indigenous groups that practiced Shamanism, and that his work was synthesized from various sources without being supported by direct field research.

In contrast, Professor Kees W. Bolle of the University of California, Los Angeles argues that &quot;Professor Eliade&#x27;s approach, in all his works, is empirical&quot;: Bolle sets Eliade apart for what he sees as Eliade&#x27;s particularly close &quot;attention to the various particular motifs&quot; of different myths. French researcher Daniel Dubuisson places doubt on Eliade&#x27;s scholarship and its scientific character, citing the Romanian academic&#x27;s alleged refusal to accept the treatment of religions in their historical and cultural context, and proposing that Eliade&#x27;s notion of &quot;hierophany&quot; refers to the actual existence of a supernatural level.

Ronald Inden, a historian of India and University of Chicago professor, criticized Mircea Eliade, alongside other intellectual figures (Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell among them), for encouraging a &quot;romantic view&quot; of Hinduism. He argued that their approach to the subject relied mainly on an Orientalist approach, and made Hinduism seem like &quot;a private realm of the imagination and the religious which modern, Western man lacks but needs.&quot;

===Far-right and nationalist influences===
Although his scholarly work was never subordinated to his early political beliefs, the school of thought he was associated with in interwar Romania, namely &quot;Trăirism&quot;, as well as the works of Julius Evola he continued to draw inspiration from, have thematic links to fascism. Writer and academic has argued that, through Evola&#x27;s particular interpretation of Guénon&#x27;s works, Eliade kept a traceable connection with far right ideologies in his academic contributions. Daniel Dubuisson singled out Eliade&#x27;s concept of &quot;homo religiosus&quot; as a reflection of fascist elitism, and argued that the Romanian scholar&#x27;s views of Judaism and the Old Testament, which depicted Hebrews as the enemies of an ancient cosmic religion, were ultimately the preservation of an antisemitic discourse.

A piece authored in 1930 saw Eliade defining Julius Evola as a great thinker and offering praise to the controversial intellectuals Oswald Spengler, Arthur de Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. Evola, who continued to defend the core principles of mystical fascism, once protested to Eliade about the latter&#x27;s failure to cite him and Guénon. Eliade replied that his works were written for a contemporary public, and not to initiates of esoteric circles. After the 1960s, he, together with Evola, Louis Rougier, and other intellectuals, offered support to Alain de Benoist&#x27;s controversial &quot;Groupement de recherche et d&#x27;études pour la civilisation européenne&quot;, part of the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; intellectual trend.

Notably, Eliade was also preoccupied with the cult of Thracian deity Zalmoxis and its supposed monotheism. This, like his conclusion that Romanization had been superficial inside Roman Dacia, was a view celebrated by contemporary partisans of protochronist nationalism. According to historian Sorin Antohi, Eliade may have actually encouraged protochronists such as Edgar Papu to carry out research which resulted in the claim that medieval Romanians had anticipated the Renaissance.

In his study of Eliade, Jung, and Campbell, Ellwood also discusses the connection between academic theories and controversial political involvements, noting that all three mythologists have been accused of reactionary political positions. Ellwood notes the obvious parallel between the conservatism of myth, which speaks of a primordial golden age, and the conservatism of far right politics. However, Ellwood argues that the explanation is more complex than that. Wherever their political sympathies may have sometimes been, he claims, the three mythologists were often &quot;apolitical if not antipolitical, scorning any this-worldly salvation&quot;. Moreover, the connection between mythology and politics differs for each of the mythologists in question: in Eliade&#x27;s case, Ellwood believes, a strong sense of nostalgia (&quot;for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise&quot;), influenced not only the scholar&#x27;s academic interests, but also his political views.

Because Eliade stayed out of politics during his later life, Ellwood tries to extract an implicit political philosophy from Eliade&#x27;s scholarly works. Ellwood argues that the later Eliade&#x27;s nostalgia for ancient traditions did not make him a political reactionary, even a quiet one. He concludes that the later Eliade was, in fact, a &quot;radical modernist&quot;. According to Ellwood,
Those who see Eliade&#x27;s fascination with the primordial as merely reactionary in the ordinary political or religious sense of the word do not understand the mature Eliade in a sufficiently radical way. [...] Tradition was not for him exactly Burkean &#x27;prescription&#x27; or sacred trust to be kept alive generation after generation, for Eliade was fully aware that tradition, like men and nations, lives only by changing and even occultation. The tack is not to try fruitlessly to keep it unchanging, but to discover where it is hiding.

According to Eliade, religious elements survive in secular culture, but in new, &quot;camouflaged&quot; forms. Thus, Ellwood believes that the later Eliade probably thought modern man should preserve elements of the past, but should not try to restore their original form through reactionary politics. He suspects that Eliade would have favored &quot;a minimal rather than a maximalist state&quot; that would allow personal spiritual transformation without enforcing it.

Many scholars have accused Eliade of &quot;essentialism&quot;, a type of overgeneralization in which one incorrectly attributes a common &quot;essence&quot; to a whole group—in this case, all &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; societies. Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade&#x27;s essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations. To Ellwood, this connection &quot;seems rather tortured, in the end amounting to little more than an &quot;ad hominem&quot; argument which attempts to tar Eliade&#x27;s entire [scholarly] work with the ill-repute all decent people feel for storm troopers and the Iron Guard&quot;. However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in &quot;mythological thinking&quot; may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an &quot;essentialist&quot; way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: &quot;A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which as we shall see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as our three, can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way.&quot;

==Literary works==

===Generic traits===
Many of Mircea Eliade&#x27;s literary works, in particular his earliest ones, are noted for their eroticism and their focus on subjective experience. Modernist in style, they have drawn comparisons to the contemporary writings of Mihail Sebastian, I. Valerian, and Ion Biberi. Alongside Honoré de Balzac and Giovanni Papini, his literary passions included Aldous Huxley and Miguel de Unamuno, as well as André Gide. Eliade also read with interest the prose of Romain Rolland, Henrik Ibsen, and the Enlightenment thinkers Voltaire and Denis Diderot. As a youth, he read the works of Romanian authors such as Liviu Rebreanu and Panait Istrati; initially, he was also interested in Ionel Teodoreanu&#x27;s prose works, but later rejected them and criticized their author.

Investigating the works&#x27; main characteristics, George Călinescu stressed that Eliade owed much of his style to the direct influence of French author André Gide, concluding that, alongside Camil Petrescu and a few others, Eliade was among Gide&#x27;s leading disciples in Romanian literature. He commented that, like Gide, Eliade believed that the artist &quot;does not take a stand, but experiences good and evil while setting himself free from both, maintaining an intact curiosity.&quot; A specific aspect of this focus on experience is sexual experimentation—Călinescu notes that Eliade&#x27;s fiction works tend to depict a male figure &quot;possessing all practicable women in [a given] family&quot;. He also considered that, as a rule, Eliade depicts woman as &quot;a basic means for a sexual experience and repudiated with harsh egotism.&quot;

For Călinescu, such a perspective on life culminated in &quot;banality&quot;, leaving authors gripped by the &quot;cult of the self&quot; and &quot;a contempt for literature&quot;. Polemically, Călinescu proposed that Mircea Eliade&#x27;s supposed focus on &quot;aggressive youth&quot; served to instill his interwar Romanian writers with the idea that they had a common destiny as a generation apart. He also commented that, when set in Romania, Mircea Eliade&#x27;s stories lacked the &quot;perception of immediate reality&quot;, and, analyzing the non-traditional names the writer tended to ascribe to his Romanian characters, that they did not depict &quot;specificity&quot;. Additionally, in Călinescu&#x27;s view, Eliade&#x27;s stories were often &quot;sensationalist compositions of the illustrated magazine kind.&quot; Mircea Eliade&#x27;s assessment of his own pre-1940 literary contributions oscillated between expressions of pride and the bitter verdict that they were written for &quot;an audience of little ladies and high school students&quot;.

A secondary but unifying feature present in most of Eliade&#x27;s stories is their setting, a magical and part-fictional Bucharest. In part, they also serve to illustrate or allude to Eliade&#x27;s own research in the field of religion, as well as to the concepts he introduced. Thus, commentators such as Matei Călinescu and Carmen Mușat have also argued that a main characteristic of Eliade&#x27;s fantasy prose is a substitution between the supernatural and the mundane: in this interpretation, Eliade turns the daily world into an incomprehensible place, while the intrusive supernatural aspect promises to offer the sense of life. The notion was in turn linked to Eliade&#x27;s own thoughts on transcendence, and in particular his idea that, once &quot;camouflaged&quot; in life or history, miracles become &quot;unrecognizable&quot;.

===Oriental-themed novels===

==== &quot;Isabel și apele diavolului&quot; ====
One of Eliade&#x27;s earliest fiction writings, the controversial first-person narrative Isabel şi apele diavolului (&#x27;Isabel and the Devil&#x27;s Waters&#x27;), focused on the figure of a young and brilliant academic, whose self-declared fear is that of &quot;being common&quot;. The hero&#x27;s experience is recorded in &quot;notebooks&quot;, which are compiled to form the actual narrative, and which serve to record his unusual, mostly sexual, experiences in British India—the narrator describes himself as dominated by &quot;a devilish indifference&quot; towards &quot;all things having to do with art or metaphysics&quot;, focusing instead on eroticism. The guest of a pastor, the scholar ponders sexual adventures with his host&#x27;s wife, servant girl, and finally with his daughter Isabel. Persuading the pastor&#x27;s adolescent son to run away from home, becoming the sexual initiator of a twelve-year-old girl and the lover of a much older woman, the character also attempts to seduce Isabel. Although she falls in love, the young woman does not give in to his pressures, but eventually allows herself to be abused and impregnated by another character, letting the object of her affection know that she had thought of him all along.

==== &quot;Maitreyi&quot; ====
One of Eliade&#x27;s best-known works, the novel &quot;Maitreyi&quot;, dwells on Eliade&#x27;s own experience, comprising camouflaged details of his relationships with Surendranath Dasgupta and Dasgupta&#x27;s daughter Maitreyi Devi. The main character, Allan, is an Englishman who visits the Indian engineer Narendra Sen and courts his daughter, herself known as Maitreyi. The narrative is again built on &quot;notebooks&quot; to which Allan adds his comments. This technique Călinescu describes as &quot;boring&quot;, and its result &quot;cynical&quot;.

Allan himself stands alongside Eliade&#x27;s male characters, whose focus is on action, sensation and experience—his chaste contacts with Maitreyi are encouraged by Sen, who hopes for a marriage which is nonetheless abhorred by his would-be European son-in-law. Instead, Allan is fascinated to discover Maitreyi&#x27;s Oriental version of Platonic love, marked by spiritual attachment more than by physical contact. However, their affair soon after turns physical, and she decides to attach herself to Allan as one would to a husband, in what is an informal and intimate wedding ceremony (which sees her vowing her love and invoking an earth goddess as the seal of union). Upon discovering this, Narendra Sen becomes enraged, rejecting their guest and keeping Maitreyi in confinement. As a result, his daughter decides to have intercourse with a lowly stranger, becoming pregnant in the hope that her parents would consequently allow her to marry her lover. However, the story also casts doubt on her earlier actions, reflecting rumors that Maitreyi was not a virgin at the time she and Allan first met, which also seems to expose her father as a hypocrite.

George Călinescu objected to the narrative, arguing that both the physical affair and the father&#x27;s rage seemed artificial, while commenting that Eliade placing doubt on his Indian characters&#x27; honesty had turned the plot into a piece of &quot;ethnological humor&quot;. Noting that the work developed on a classical theme of miscegenation, which recalled the prose of François-René de Chateaubriand and Pierre Loti, the critic proposed that its main merit was in introducing the exotic novel to local literature.

==== &quot;Șantier&quot; ====
Mircea Eliade&#x27;s other early works include Șantier (&#x27;Building Site&#x27;), a part-novel, part-diary account of his Indian sojourn. George Călinescu objected to its &quot;monotony&quot;, and, noting that it featured a set of &quot;intelligent observations&quot;, criticized the &quot;banality of its ideological conversations.&quot; &quot;Șantier&quot; was also noted for its portrayal of drug addiction and intoxication with opium, both of which could have referred to Eliade&#x27;s actual travel experience.

===Portraits of a generation===

==== &quot;Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent&quot; ====
In his earliest novel, titled &quot;Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent&quot; and written in the first person, Eliade depicts his experience through high school. It is proof of the influence exercised on him by the literature of Giovanni Papini, and in particular by Papini&#x27;s story &quot;Un uomo finito&quot;. Each of its chapters reads like an independent novella, and, in all, the work experiments with the limits traced between novel and diary. Literary critic Eugen Simion called it &quot;the most valuable&quot; among Eliade&#x27;s earliest literary attempts, but noted that, being &quot;ambitious&quot;, the book had failed to achieve &quot;an aesthetically satisfactory format&quot;. According to Simion, the innovative intent of the &quot;Novel...&quot; was provided by its technique, by its goal of providing authenticity in depicting experiences, and by its insight into adolescent psychology. The novel notably shows its narrator practicing self-flagellation.

==== &quot;Întoarcerea din rai&quot; ====
Eliade&#x27;s 1934 novel Întoarcerea din rai (&#x27;Return from Paradise&#x27;) centers on Pavel Anicet, a young man who seeks knowledge through what Călinescu defined as &quot;sexual excess&quot;. His search leaves him with a reduced sensitivity: right after being confronted with his father&#x27;s death, Anicet breaks out in tears only after sitting through an entire dinner.

The other characters, standing for Eliade&#x27;s generation, all seek knowledge through violence or retreat from the world—nonetheless, unlike Anicet, they ultimately fail at imposing rigors upon themselves. Pavel himself eventually abandons his belief in sex as a means for enlightenment, and commits suicide in hopes of reaching the level of primordial unity. The solution, George Călinescu noted, mirrored the strange murder in Gide&#x27;s &quot;Lafcadio&#x27;s Adventures&quot;. Eliade himself indicated that the book dealt with the &quot;loss of the beatitude, illusions, and optimism that had dominated the first twenty years of &#x27;Greater Romania&#x27;.&quot; Robert Ellwood connected the work to Eliade&#x27;s recurring sense of loss in respect to the &quot;atmosphere of euphoria and faith&quot; of his adolescence. Călinescu criticizes &quot;Întoarcerea din rai&quot;, describing its dialog sequences as &quot;awkward&quot;, its narrative as &quot;void&quot;, and its artistic interest as &quot;non-existent&quot;, proposing that the reader could however find it relevant as the &quot;document of a mentality&quot;.

==== &quot;Huliganii&quot; ====
The novel Huliganii (&#x27;The Hooligans&#x27;) is intended as the fresco of a family, and, through it, that of an entire generation. The book&#x27;s main protagonist, Petru Anicet, is a composer who places value in experiments; other characters include Dragu, who considers &quot;a hooligan&#x27;s experience&quot; as &quot;the only fertile debut into life&quot;, and the totalitarian Alexandru Pleşa, who is on the search for &quot;the heroic life&quot; by enlisting youth in &quot;perfect regiments, equally intoxicated by a collective myth.&quot;

Călinescu thought that the young male characters all owed inspiration to Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (&quot;see Crime and Punishment&quot;). Anicet, who partly shares Pleșa&#x27;s vision for a collective experiment, is also prone to sexual adventures, and seduces the women of the Lecca family (who have hired him as a piano teacher). Romanian-born novelist Norman Manea called Anicet&#x27;s experiment: &quot;the paraded defiance of bourgeois conventions, in which venereal disease and lubricity dwell together.&quot; In one episode of the book, Anicet convinces Anișoara Lecca to gratuitously steal from her parents—an outrage which leads his mother to moral decay and, eventually, to suicide. George Călinescu criticized the book for inconsistencies and &quot;excesses in Dostoyevskianism&quot;, but noted that the Lecca family portrayal was &quot;suggestive&quot;, and that the dramatic scenes were written with &quot;a remarkable poetic calm&quot;.

==== &quot;Marriage in Heaven&quot; ====
The novel &quot;Marriage in Heaven&quot; depicts the correspondence between two male friends, an artist and a common man, who complain to each other about their failures in love: the former complains about a lover who wanted his children when he did not, while the other recalls being abandoned by a woman who, despite his intentions, did not want to become pregnant by him. Eliade lets the reader understand that they are in fact talking about the same woman.

===Fantastic and fantasy literature===
Mircea Eliade&#x27;s earliest works, most of which were published at later stages, belong to the fantasy genre. One of the first such literary exercises to be printed, the 1921 &quot;Cum am găsit piatra filosofală&quot;, showed its adolescent author&#x27;s interest in themes that he was to explore throughout his career, in particular esotericism and alchemy. Written in the first person, it depicts an experiment which, for a moment, seems to be the discovery of the philosophers&#x27; stone. These early writings also include two sketches for novels: &quot;Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii&quot; (&#x27;The Wonderful Journey of the Five Beetles into the Land of the Red Ants&#x27;) and &quot;Memoriile unui soldat de plumb&quot; (&#x27;The Memoirs of a Lead Soldier&#x27;). In the former, a company of beetle spies is sent among the red ants—their travel offers a setting for satirical commentary. Eliade himself explained that &quot;Memoriile unui soldat de plumb&quot; was an ambitious project, designed as a fresco to include the birth of the Universe, abiogenesis, human evolution, and the entire world history.

Eliade&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Domnișoara Christina&quot;, was, on its own, the topic of a scandal. The novel deals with the fate of an eccentric family, the Moscus, who are haunted by the ghost of a murdered young woman, known as Christina. The apparition shares characteristics with vampires and with &quot;strigoi&quot;: she is believed to be drinking the blood of cattle and that of a young family member. The young man Egor becomes the object of Christina&#x27;s desire, and is shown to have intercourse with her. Noting that the plot and setting reminded one of horror fiction works by the German author Hanns Heinz Ewers, and defending &quot;Domnişoara Christina&quot; in front of harsher criticism, Călinescu nonetheless argued that the &quot;international environment&quot; in which it took place was &quot;upsetting&quot;. He also depicted the plot as focused on &quot;major impurity&quot;, summarizing the story&#x27;s references to necrophilia, menstrual fetish and ephebophilia.

==== &quot;Șarpele&quot; ====
Eliade&#x27;s short story Șarpele (&#x27;The Snake&#x27;) was described by George Călinescu as &quot;hermetic&quot;. While on a trip to the forest, several persons witness a feat of magic performed by the male character Andronic, who summons a snake from the bottom of a river and places it on an island. At the end of the story, Andronic and the female character Dorina are found on the island, naked and locked in a sensual embrace. Călinescu saw the piece as an allusion to Gnosticism, to the Kabbalah, and to Babylonian mythology, while linking the snake to the Greek mythological figure and major serpent symbol Ophion. He was however dissatisfied with this introduction of iconic images, describing it as &quot;languishing&quot;.

In Curte la Dionis

In the relation between history and culture, „the memory acts from the event toward the creation, so that the cultural memory is the prisoner of history.&quot; When it will liberate itself, the human will escape the labyrinth, according to a character of the &quot;In Dionysus’ Court&quot;, of which ideal is the cultural memory; but, for him, the amnesia becomes a torment because, although he forgot details of his own existence, he kept the vague impression of a decisive meeting and with the obsession that he is not knowing his place in the universe: he had forgotten the message that he had to transmit to the world.

==== &quot;Un om mare&quot; ====
The short story Un om mare (&#x27;A Big Man&#x27;), which Eliade authored during his stay in Portugal, shows a common person, the engineer Cucoanes, who grows steadily and uncontrollably, reaching immense proportions and ultimately disappearing into the wilderness of the Bucegi Mountains. Eliade himself referenced the story and Aldous Huxley&#x27;s experiments in the same section of his private notes, a matter which allowed Matei Călinescu to propose that &quot;Un om mare&quot; was a direct product of its author&#x27;s experience with drugs. The same commentator, who deemed &quot;Un om mare&quot; &quot;perhaps Eliade&#x27;s most memorable short story&quot;, connected it with the &quot;uriași&quot; characters present in Romanian folklore.

===Other writings===
Eliade reinterpreted the Greek mythological figure Iphigeneia in his eponymous 1941 play. Here, the maiden falls in love with Achilles, and accepts to be sacrificed on the pyre as a means to ensure both her lover&#x27;s happiness (as predicted by an oracle) and her father Agamemnon&#x27;s victory in the Trojan War. Discussing the association Iphigenia&#x27;s character makes between love and death, Romanian theater critic Radu Albala noted that it was a possible echo of &quot;Meşterul Manole&quot; legend, in which a builder of the Curtea de Argeș Monastery has to sacrifice his wife in exchange for permission to complete work. In contrast with early renditions of the myth by authors such as Euripides and Jean Racine, Eliade&#x27;s version ends with the sacrifice being carried out in full.

In addition to his fiction, the exiled Eliade authored several volumes of memoirs and diaries and travel writings. They were published sporadically, and covered various stages of his life. One of the earliest such pieces was &quot;India&quot;, grouping accounts of the travels he made through the Indian subcontinent. Writing for the Spanish journal &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, commentator Sergio Vila-Sanjuán described the first volume of Eliade&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; (covering the years 1907 to 1937) as &quot;a great book&quot;, while noting that the other main volume was &quot;more conventional and insincere.&quot; In Vila-Sanjuán&#x27;s view, the texts reveal Mircea Eliade himself as &quot;a Dostoyevskyian character&quot;, as well as &quot;an accomplished person, a Goethian figure&quot;.

A work that drew particular interest was his &quot;Jurnal portughez&quot; (&#x27;Portuguese Diary&#x27;), completed during his stay in Lisbon and published only after its author&#x27;s death. A portion of it dealing with his stay in Romania is believed to have been lost. The travels to Spain, partly recorded in &quot;Jurnal portughez&quot;, also led to a separate volume, &quot;Jurnal cordobez&quot; (&#x27;Cordoban Diary&#x27;), which Eliade compiled from various independent notebooks. &quot;Jurnal portughez&quot; shows Eliade coping with clinical depression and political crisis, and has been described by Andrei Oișteanu as &quot;an overwhelming [read], through the immense suffering it exhales.&quot; Literary historian Paul Cernat argued that part of the volume is &quot;a masterpiece of its time&quot;, while concluding that some 700 pages were passable for the &quot;among others&quot; section of Eliade&#x27;s bibliography. Noting that the book featured parts where Eliade spoke of himself in eulogistic terms, notably comparing himself favorably to Goethe and Romania&#x27;s national poet Mihai Eminescu, Cernat accused the writer of &quot;egolatry&quot;, and deduced that Eliade was &quot;ready to step over dead bodies for the sake of his spiritual &#x27;mission&#x27; &quot;. The same passages led philosopher and journalist Cătălin Avramescu to argue that Eliade&#x27;s behavior was evidence of &quot;&quot;.

Eliade also wrote various essays of literary criticism. In his youth, alongside his study on Julius Evola, he published essays which introduced the Romanian public to representatives of modern Spanish literature and philosophy, among them Adolfo Bonilla San Martín, Miguel de Unamuno, José Ortega y Gasset, Eugenio d&#x27;Ors, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo. He also wrote an essay on the works of James Joyce, connecting it with his own theories on the eternal return (&quot;[Joyce&#x27;s literature is] saturated with nostalgia for the myth of the eternal repetition&quot;), and deeming Joyce himself an anti-historicist &quot;archaic&quot; figure among the modernists. In the 1930s, Eliade edited the collected works of Romanian historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu.

M. L. Ricketts discovered and translated into English a previously unpublished play written by Mircea Eliade in Paris 1946 &quot;Aventura Spirituală&quot; (&#x27;A Spiritual Adventure&#x27;). It was published first in &quot;Theory in Action&quot; – the journal of the Transformative Studies Institute, vol. 5 (2012): 2–58 -, and then in Italian (M. Eliade, &quot;Tutto il teatro&quot;, Milano: Edizioni Bietti, 2016).

==Controversy: antisemitism and links with the Iron Guard==

===Early statements===
The early years in Eliade&#x27;s public career show him to have been highly tolerant of Jews in general, and of the Jewish minority in Romania in particular. His early condemnation of Nazi antisemitic policies was accompanied by his caution and moderation in regard to Nae Ionescu&#x27;s various anti-Jewish attacks.

Late in the 1930s, Mihail Sebastian was marginalized by Romania&#x27;s antisemitic policies, and came to reflect on his Romanian friend&#x27;s association with the far right. The subsequent ideological break between him and Eliade has been compared by writer Gabriela Adameșteanu with that between Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. In his &quot;Journal&quot;, published long after his 1945 death, Sebastian claimed that Eliade&#x27;s actions during the 1930s show him to be an antisemite. According to Sebastian, Eliade had been friendly to him until the start of his political commitments, after which he severed all ties. Before their friendship came apart, however, Sebastian claimed that he took notes on their conversations (which he later published) during which Eliade was supposed to have expressed antisemitic views. According to Sebastian, Eliade said in 1939:

The Poles&#x27; resistance in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance. Only yids are capable of the blackmail of putting women and children in the front line, to take advantage of the Germans&#x27; sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save us... What is happening on the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.

The friendship between Eliade and Sebastian drastically declined during the war: the latter writer, fearing for his security during the pro-Nazi Ion Antonescu regime (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;), hoped that Eliade, by then a diplomat, could intervene in his favor; however, upon his brief return to Romania, Eliade did not see or approach Sebastian.

Later, Mircea Eliade expressed his regret at not having had the chance to redeem his friendship with Sebastian before the latter was killed in a car accident. Paul Cernat notes that Eliade&#x27;s statement includes an admission that he &quot;counted on [Sebastian&#x27;s] support, in order to get back into Romanian life and culture&quot;, and proposes that Eliade may have expected his friend to vouch for him in front of hostile authorities. Some of Sebastian&#x27;s late recordings in his diary show that their author was reflecting with nostalgia on his relationship with Eliade, and that he deplored the outcome.

Eliade provided two distinct explanations for not having met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the Gestapo, and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend. Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the Israeli magazine &quot;Toladot&quot;, which claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu&#x27;s agreement to implement the Final Solution in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (&quot;see Holocaust in Romania&quot;). In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareș had a physical relationship, one which could have contributed to the clash between the two literary figures.

Beyond his involvement with a movement known for its antisemitism, Eliade did not usually comment on Jewish issues. However, an article titled &quot;Piloții orbi&quot; (&quot;The Blind Pilots&quot;), contributed to the journal &quot;Vremea&quot; in 1936, showed that he supported at least some Iron Guard accusations against the Jewish community:

Since the war [that is, World War I], Jews have occupied the villages of Maramureș and Bukovina, and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in Bessarabia. [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves to become a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as far as I am concerned, I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.

One year later, a text, accompanied by his picture, was featured as answer to an inquiry by the Iron Guard&#x27;s &quot;Buna Vestire&quot; about the reasons he had for supporting the movement. A short section of it summarizes an anti-Jewish attitude:

Can the Romanian nation end its life in the saddest decay witnessed by history, undermined by misery and syphilis, conquered by Jews and torn to pieces by foreigners, demoralized, betrayed, sold for a few million lei?

According to the literary critic Z. Ornea, in the 1980s Eliade denied authorship of the text. He explained the use of his signature, his picture, and the picture&#x27;s caption, as having been applied by the magazine&#x27;s editor, Mihail Polihroniade, to a piece the latter had written after having failed to obtain Eliade&#x27;s contribution; he also claimed that, given his respect for Polihroniade, he had not wished to publicize this matter previously.

===Polemics and exile===
Dumitru G. Danielopol, a fellow diplomat present in London during Eliade&#x27;s stay in the city, later stated that the latter had identified himself as &quot;a guiding light of [the Iron Guard] movement&quot; and victim of Carol II&#x27;s repression. In October 1940, as the National Legionary State came into existence, the British Foreign Office blacklisted Mircea Eliade, alongside five other Romanians, due to his Iron Guard connections and suspicions that he was prepared to spy in favor of Nazi Germany. According to various sources, while in Portugal, the diplomat was also preparing to disseminate propaganda in favor of the Iron Guard. In &quot;Jurnal portughez&quot;, Eliade defines himself as &quot;a Legionary&quot;, and speaks of his own &quot;Legionary climax&quot; as a stage he had gone through during the early 1940s.

The depolitisation of Eliade after the start of his diplomatic career was also mistrusted by his former close friend Eugène Ionesco, who indicated that, upon the close of World War II, Eliade&#x27;s personal beliefs as communicated to his friends amounted to &quot;all is over now that Communism has won&quot;. This forms part of Ionesco&#x27;s severe and succinct review of the careers of Legionary-inspired intellectuals, many of them his friends and former friends, in a letter he sent to Tudor Vianu. In 1946, Ionesco indicated to Petru Comarnescu that he did not want to see either Eliade or Cioran, and that he considered the two of them &quot;Legionaries for ever&quot;—adding &quot;we are hyenas to one another&quot;.

Eliade&#x27;s former friend, the communist Belu Zilber, who was attending the Paris Conference in 1946, refused to see Eliade, arguing that, as an Iron Guard affiliate, the latter had &quot;denounced left-wingers&quot;, and contrasting him with Cioran (&quot;They are both Legionaries, but [Cioran] is honest&quot;). Three years later, Eliade&#x27;s political activities were brought into discussion as he was getting ready to publish a translation of his &quot;Techniques du Yoga&quot; with the left-leaning Italian company &quot;Giulio Einaudi Editore&quot;—the denunciation was probably orchestrated by Romanian officials.

In August 1954, when Horia Sima, who led the Iron Guard during its exile, was rejected by a faction inside the movement, Mircea Eliade&#x27;s name was included on a list of persons who supported the latter—although this may have happened without his consent. According to exiled dissident and novelist Dumitru Ţepeneag, around that date, Eliade expressed his sympathy for Iron Guard members in general, whom he viewed as &quot;courageous&quot;. However, according to Robert Ellwood, the Eliade he met in the 1960s was entirely apolitical, remained aloof from &quot;the passionate politics of that era in the United States&quot;, and &quot;[r]eportedly [...] never read newspapers&quot; (an assessment shared by Sorin Alexandrescu). Eliade&#x27;s student Ioan Petru Culianu noted that journalists had come to refer to the Romanian scholar as &quot;the great recluse&quot;. Despite Eliade&#x27;s withdrawal from radical politics, Ellwood indicates, he still remained concerned with Romania&#x27;s welfare. He saw himself and other exiled Romanian intellectuals as members of a circle who worked to &quot;maintain the culture of a free Romania and, above all, to publish texts that had become unpublishable in Romania itself&quot;.

Beginning in 1969, Eliade&#x27;s past became the subject of public debate in Israel. At the time, historian Gershom Scholem asked Eliade to explain his attitudes, which the latter did using vague terms. As a result of this exchange, Scholem declared his dissatisfaction, and argued that Israel could not extend a welcome to the Romanian academic. During the final years of Eliade&#x27;s life, his disciple Culianu exposed and publicly criticized his 1930s pro-Iron Guard activities; relations between the two soured as a result. Eliade&#x27;s other Romanian disciple, Andrei Oişteanu, noted that, in the years following Eliade&#x27;s death, conversations with various people who had known the scholar had made Culianu less certain of his earlier stances, and had led him to declare: &quot;Mr. Eliade was never antisemitic, a member of the Iron Guard, or pro-Nazi. But, in any case, I am led to believe that he was closer to the Iron Guard than I would have liked to believe.&quot;

At an early stage of his polemic with Culianu, Eliade complained in writing that &quot;it is not possible to write an objective history&quot; of the Iron Guard and its leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Arguing that people &quot;would only accept apologetics [...] or executions&quot;, he contended: &quot;After Buchenwald and Auschwitz, even honest people cannot afford being objective&quot;.

===Posterity===
Alongside the arguments introduced by Daniel Dubuisson, criticism of Mircea Eliade&#x27;s political involvement with antisemitism and fascism came from Adriana Berger, Leon Volovici, Alexandra Lagniel-Lavastine, Florin Țurcanu and others, who have attempted to trace Eliade&#x27;s antisemitism throughout his work and through his associations with contemporary antisemites, such as the Italian fascist occultist Julius Evola. Volovici, for example, is critical of Eliade not only because of his support for the Iron Guard, but also for spreading antisemitism and anti-Masonry in 1930s Romania. In 1991, exiled novelist Norman Manea published an essay firmly condemning Eliade&#x27;s attachment to the Iron Guard.

Other scholars, like Bryan S. Rennie, have claimed that there is, to date, no evidence of Eliade&#x27;s membership, active services rendered, or of any real involvement with any fascist or totalitarian movements or membership organizations, nor that there is any evidence of his continued support for nationalist ideals after their inherently violent nature was revealed. They further assert that there is no imprint of overt political beliefs in Eliade&#x27;s scholarship, and also claim that Eliade&#x27;s critics are following political agendas. Romanian scholar Mircea Handoca, editor of Eliade&#x27;s writings, argues that the controversy surrounding Eliade was encouraged by a group of exiled writers, of whom Manea was a main representative, and believes that Eliade&#x27;s association with the Guard was a conjectural one, determined by the young author&#x27;s Christian values and conservative stance, as well as by his belief that a Legionary Romania could mirror Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. Handoca opined that Eliade changed his stance after discovering that the Legionaries had turned violent, and argued that there was no evidence of Eliade&#x27;s actual affiliation with the Iron Guard as a political movement. Additionally, Joaquín Garrigós, who translated Eliade&#x27;s works into Spanish, claimed that none of Eliade&#x27;s texts he ever encountered show him to be an antisemite. Mircea Eliade&#x27;s nephew and commentator Sorin Alexandrescu himself proposed that Eliade&#x27;s politics were essentially conservative and patriotic, in part motivated by a fear of the Soviet Union which he shared with many other young intellectuals. Based on Mircea Eliade&#x27;s admiration for Gandhi, various other authors assess that Eliade remained committed to nonviolence.

Robert Ellwood also places Eliade&#x27;s involvement with the Iron Guard in relation to scholar&#x27;s conservatism, and connects this aspect of Eliade&#x27;s life with both his nostalgia and his study of primal societies. According to Ellwood, the part of Eliade that felt attracted to the &quot;freedom of new beginnings suggested by primal myths&quot; is the same part that felt attracted to the Guard, with its almost mythological notion of a new beginning through a &quot;national resurrection&quot;. On a more basic level, Ellwood describes Eliade as an &quot;instinctively spiritual&quot; person who saw the Iron Guard as a spiritual movement. In Ellwood&#x27;s view, Eliade was aware that the &quot;golden age&quot; of antiquity was no longer accessible to secular man, that it could be recalled but not re-established. Thus, a &quot;more accessible&quot; object for nostalgia was a &quot;secondary silver age within the last few hundred years&quot;—the Kingdom of Romania&#x27;s 19th century cultural renaissance. To the young Eliade, the Iron Guard seemed like a path for returning to the silver age of Romania&#x27;s glory, being a movement &quot;dedicated to the cultural and national renewal of the Romanian people by appeal to their spiritual roots&quot;. Ellwood describes the young Eliade as someone &quot;capable of being fired up by mythological archetypes and with no awareness of the evil that was to be unleashed&quot;.

Because of Eliade&#x27;s withdrawal from politics, and also because the later Eliade&#x27;s religiosity was very personal and idiosyncratic, Ellwood believes the later Eliade probably would have rejected the &quot;corporate sacred&quot; of the Iron Guard. According to Ellwood, the later Eliade had the same desire for a Romanian &quot;resurrection&quot; that had motivated the early Eliade to support the Iron Guard, but he now channeled it apolitically through his efforts to &quot;maintain the culture of a free Romania&quot; abroad. In one of his writings, Eliade says, &quot;Against the terror of History there are only two possibilities of defense: action or contemplation.&quot; According to Ellwood, the young Eliade took the former option, trying to reform the world through action, whereas the older Eliade tried to resist the terror of history intellectually.

Eliade&#x27;s own version of events, presenting his involvement in far right politics as marginal, was judged to contain several inaccuracies and unverifiable claims. For instance, Eliade depicted his arrest as having been solely caused by his friendship with Nae Ionescu. On another occasion, answering Gershom Scholem&#x27;s query, he is known to have explicitly denied ever having contributed to &quot;Buna Vestire&quot;. According to Sorin Antohi, &quot;Eliade died without ever clearly expressing regret for his Iron Guard sympathies&quot;. Z. Ornea noted that, in a short section of his &quot;Autobiography&quot; where he discusses the &quot;Einaudi&quot; incident, Eliade speaks of &quot;my imprudent acts and errors committed in youth&quot;, as &quot;a series of malentendus that would follow me all my life.&quot; Ornea commented that this was the only instance where the Romanian academic spoke of his political involvement with a dose of self-criticism, and contrasted the statement with Eliade&#x27;s usual refusal to discuss his stances &quot;pertinently&quot;. Reviewing the arguments brought in support of Eliade, Sergio Vila-Sanjuán concluded: &quot;Nevertheless, Eliade&#x27;s pro-Legionary columns endure in the newspaper libraries, he never showed his regret for this connection [with the Iron Guard] and always, right up to his final writings, he invoked the figure of his teacher Nae Ionescu.&quot;

In his &quot;Felix Culpa&quot;, Manea directly accused Eliade of having embellished his memoirs to minimize an embarrassing past. A secondary debate surrounding Eliade&#x27;s alleged unwillingness to dissociate with the Guard took place after &quot;Jurnalul portughez&quot; saw print. Sorin Alexandrescu expressed a belief that notes in the diary show Eliade&#x27;s &quot;break with his far right past&quot;. Cătălin Avramescu defined this conclusion as &quot;whitewashing&quot;, and, answering to Alexandrescu&#x27;s claim that his uncle&#x27;s support for the Guard was always superficial, argued that &quot;Jurnal portughez&quot; and other writings of the time showed Eliade&#x27;s disenchantment with the Legionaries&#x27; Christian stance in tandem with his growing sympathy for Nazism and its pagan messages. Paul Cernat, who stressed that it was the only one of Eliade&#x27;s autobiographical works not to have been reworked by its author, concluded that the book documented Eliade&#x27;s own efforts to &quot;camouflage&quot; his political sympathies without rejecting them altogether.

Oișteanu argued that, in old age, Eliade moved away from his earlier stances and even came to sympathize with the non-Marxist Left and the hippie youth movement. He noted that Eliade initially felt apprehensive about the consequences of hippie activism, but that the interests they shared, as well as their advocacy of communalism and free love had made him argue that hippies were &quot;a quasi-religious movement&quot; that was &quot;rediscovering the sacrality of Life&quot;. Andrei Oișteanu, who proposed that Eliade&#x27;s critics were divided into a &quot;maximalist&quot; and a &quot;minimalist&quot; camp (trying to, respectively, enhance or shadow the impact Legionary ideas had on Eliade), argued in favor of moderation, and indicated that Eliade&#x27;s fascism needed to be correlated to the political choices of his generation.

===Political symbolism in Eliade&#x27;s fiction===

Various critics have traced links between Eliade&#x27;s fiction works and his political views, or Romanian politics in general. Early on, George Călinescu argued that the totalitarian model outlined in &quot;Huliganii&quot; was: &quot;An allusion to certain bygone political movements [...], sublimated in the ever so abstruse philosophy of death as a path to knowledge.&quot; By contrast, &quot;Întoarcerea din rai&quot; partly focuses on a failed communist rebellion, which enlists the participation of its main characters.

&quot;Iphigenia&quot;‍&#x27;s story of self-sacrifice, turned voluntary in Eliade&#x27;s version, was taken by various commentators, beginning with Mihail Sebastian, as a favorable allusion to the Iron Guard&#x27;s beliefs on commitment and death, as well as to the bloody outcome of the 1941 Legionary Rebellion. Ten years after its premiere, the play was reprinted by Legionary refugees in Argentina: on the occasion, the text was reviewed for publishing by Eliade himself. Reading &quot;Iphigenia&quot; was what partly sparked Culianu&#x27;s investigation of his mentor&#x27;s early political affiliations.

A special debate was sparked by &quot;Un om mare&quot;. Culianu viewed it as a direct reference to Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and his rise in popularity, an interpretation partly based on the similarity between, on one hand, two monikers ascribed to the Legionary leader (by, respectively, his adversaries and his followers), and, on the other, the main character&#x27;s name (&quot;Cucoanes&quot;). Matei Călinescu did not reject Culianu&#x27;s version, but argued that, on its own, the piece was beyond political interpretations. Commenting on this dialog, literary historian and essayist Mircea Iorgulescu objected to the original verdict, indicating his belief that there was no historical evidence to substantiate Culianu&#x27;s point of view.

Alongside Eliade&#x27;s main works, his attempted novel of youth, &quot;Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii&quot;, which depicts a population of red ants living in a totalitarian society and forming bands to harass the beetles, was seen as a potential allusion to the Soviet Union and to communism. Despite Eliade&#x27;s ultimate reception in Communist Romania, this writing could not be published during the period, after censors singled out fragments which they saw as especially problematic.

==Cultural legacy==

===Tributes===
An endowed chair in the History of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School was named after Eliade in recognition of his wide contribution to the research on this subject; the first holder of this chair is Wendy Doniger, who was succeeded by Brook Ziporyn in 2020.

To evaluate the legacy of Eliade and Joachim Wach within the discipline of the history of religions, the University of Chicago chose 2006 (the intermediate year between the 50th anniversary of Wach&#x27;s death and the 100th anniversary of Eliade&#x27;s birth), to hold a two-day conference to reflect upon their academic contributions and their political lives in their social and historical contexts, as well as the relationship between their works and their lives.

In 1990, after the Romanian Revolution, Eliade was elected posthumously to the Romanian Academy. In Romania, Mircea Eliade&#x27;s legacy in the field of the history of religions is mirrored by the journal &quot;Archaeus&quot; (founded 1997, and affiliated with the University of Bucharest Faculty of History). The 6th European Association for the Study of Religion and International Association for the History of Religions Special Conference on &quot;Religious History of Europe and Asia&quot; took place from September 20 to September 23, 2006, in Bucharest. An important section of the Congress was dedicated to the memory of Mircea Eliade, whose legacy in the field of history of religions was scrutinized by various scholars, some of whom were his direct students at the University of Chicago.

As Antohi noted, Eliade, Emil Cioran and Constantin Noica &quot;represent in Romanian culture ultimate expressions of excellence, [Eliade and Cioran] being regarded as proof that Romania&#x27;s interwar culture (and, by extension, Romanian culture as a whole) was able to reach the ultimate levels of depth, sophistication and creativity.&quot; A Romanian Television 1 poll carried out in 2006 nominated Mircea Eliade as the 7th Greatest Romanian in history; his case was argued by the journalist Dragoş Bucurenci (&quot;see 100 greatest Romanians&quot;). His name was given to a boulevard in the northern Bucharest area of Primăverii, to a street in Cluj-Napoca, and to high schools in Bucharest, Sighişoara, and Reşiţa. The Eliades&#x27; house on Melodiei Street was torn down during the communist regime, and an apartment block was raised in its place; his second residence, on Dacia Boulevard, features a memorial plaque in his honor.

Eliade&#x27;s image in contemporary culture also has political implications. Historian Irina Livezeanu proposed that the respect he enjoys in Romania is matched by that of other &quot;nationalist thinkers and politicians&quot; who &quot;have reentered the contemporary scene largely as heroes of a pre- and anticommunist past&quot;, including Nae Ionescu and Cioran, but also Ion Antonescu and Nichifor Crainic. In parallel, according to Oişteanu (who relied his assessment on Eliade&#x27;s own personal notes), Eliade&#x27;s interest in the American hippie community was reciprocated by members of the latter, some of whom reportedly viewed Eliade as &quot;a guru&quot;.

Eliade has also been hailed as an inspiration by German representatives of the &quot;Neue Rechte&quot;, claiming legacy from the Conservative Revolutionary movement (among them is the controversial magazine &quot;Junge Freiheit&quot; and the essayist Karlheinz Weißmann). In 2007, Florin Ţurcanu&#x27;s biographical volume on Eliade was issued in a German translation by the Antaios publishing house, which is mouthpiece for the &quot;Neue Rechte&quot;. The edition was not reviewed by the mainstream German press. Other sections of the European far right also claim Eliade as an inspiration, and consider his contacts with the Iron Guard to be a merit—among their representatives are the Italian neofascist Claudio Mutti and Romanian groups who trace their origin to the Legionary Movement.

===Portrayals, filmography and dramatizations===
Early on, Mircea Eliade&#x27;s novels were the subject of satire: before the two of them became friends, Nicolae Steinhardt, using the pen name &quot;Antisthius&quot;, authored and published parodies of them. Maitreyi Devi, who strongly objected to Eliade&#x27;s account of their encounter and relationship, wrote her own novel as a reply to his &quot;Maitreyi&quot;; written in Bengali, it was titled &quot;Na Hanyate&quot; (&#x27;It Does Not Die&#x27;).

Several authors, including Ioan Petru Culianu, have drawn a parallel between Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s Absurdist play of 1959, &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, which depicts the population of a small town falling victim to a mass metamorphosis, and the impact fascism had on Ionesco&#x27;s closest friends (Eliade included).

In 2000, Saul Bellow published his controversial &quot;Ravelstein&quot; novel. Having for its setting the University of Chicago, it had among its characters Radu Grielescu, who was identified by several critics as Eliade. The latter&#x27;s portrayal, accomplished through statements made by the eponymous character, is polemical: Grielescu, who is identified as a disciple of Nae Ionescu, took part in the Bucharest Pogrom, and is in Chicago as a refugee scholar, searching for the friendship of a Jewish colleague as a means to rehabilitate himself. In 2005, the Romanian literary critic and translator Antoaneta Ralian, who was an acquaintance of Bellow&#x27;s, argued that much of the negative portrayal was owed to a personal choice Bellow made (after having divorced from Alexandra Bagdasar, his Romanian wife and Eliade disciple). She also mentioned that, during a 1979 interview, Bellow had expressed admiration for Eliade.

The film &quot;Mircea Eliade et la redécouverte du Sacré&quot; (1987), and part of the television series &quot;Architecture et Géographie sacrées&quot; by Paul Barbă Neagră, discuss Eliade&#x27;s works.

Eliade&#x27;s &quot;Iphigenia&quot; was again included in theater programs during the late years of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime: in January 1982, a new version, directed by Ion Cojar, premiered at the National Theater Bucharest, starring Mircea Albulescu, Tania Filip and Adrian Pintea in some of the main roles.

 has been the basis for two theater adaptations: &quot;Cazul Gavrilescu&quot; (&#x27;The Gavrilescu Case&#x27;), directed by Gelu Colceag and hosted by the Nottara Theater; and an eponymous play by director Alexandru Hausvater, first staged by the Odeon Theater in 2003, starring, among others, Adriana Trandafir, Florin Zamfirescu, and Carmen Tănase.

In March 2007, on Eliade&#x27;s 100th birthday, the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company hosted the &quot;Mircea Eliade Week&quot;, during which radio drama adaptations of several works were broadcast. In September of that year, director and dramatist Cezarina Udrescu staged a multimedia performance based on a number of works Mircea Eliade wrote during his stay in Portugal; titled &quot;Apocalipsa după Mircea Eliade&quot; (&#x27;The Apocalypse According to Mircea Eliade&#x27;), and shown as part of a Romanian Radio cultural campaign, it starred Ion Caramitru, Oana Pellea and Răzvan Vasilescu.

&quot;Domnișoara Christina&quot; has been the subject of two operas: the first, carrying the same Romanian title, was authored by Romanian composer Șerban Nichifor and premiered in 1981 at the Romanian Radio; the second, titled &quot;La señorita Cristina&quot;, was written by Spanish composer Luis de Pablo and premiered in 2000 at the Teatro Real in Madrid.

<doc id="155407" wikidata="Q1933521" url="?curid=155407" title="Kleene's recursion theorem">
<text>In computability theory, Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorems are a pair of fundamental results about the application of computable functions to their own descriptions. The theorems were first proved by Stephen Kleene in 1938 and appear in his 1952 book &quot;Introduction to Metamathematics&quot;. A related theorem, which constructs fixed points of a computable function, is known as Rogers&#x27;s theorem and is due to Hartley Rogers, Jr.

The recursion theorems can be applied to construct fixed points of certain operations on computable functions, to generate quines, and to construct functions defined via recursive definitions.

== Notation ==
The statement of the theorems refers to an admissible numbering formula_1 of the partial recursive functions, such that the function corresponding to index formula_2 is formula_3.

If formula_4 and formula_5 are partial functions on the natural numbers, the notation formula_6 indicates that, for each &quot;n&quot;, either formula_7 and formula_8 are both defined and are equal, or else formula_7 and formula_8 are both undefined.

== Rogers&#x27;s fixed-point theorem ==
Given a function formula_4, a fixed point of formula_4 is an index formula_2 such that formula_14. Note that the comparison of in- and outputs here is not in terms of numerical values, but in terms of their associated functions.

Rogers describes the following result as &quot;a simpler version&quot; of Kleene&#x27;s (second) recursion theorem.
This essentially means that if we apply an effective transformation to programs (say, replace instructions such as successor, jump, remove lines), there will always be a program whose behaviour is not altered by the transformation. This theorem can therefore be interpreted in the following manner: “given any effective procedure to transform programs, there is always a program that, when modified by the procedure, does exactly what it did before”, or: “it’s impossible to write a program that changes the extensional behaviour of all programs”.

=== Proof of the fixed-point theorem ===

The proof uses a particular total computable function formula_15, defined as follows. Given a natural number formula_16, the function formula_15 outputs the index of the partial computable function that performs the following computation:
:Given an input formula_18, first attempt to compute formula_19. If that computation returns an output formula_2, then compute formula_21 and return its value, if any. 
Thus, for all indices formula_16 of partial computable functions, if formula_23 is defined, then formula_24. If formula_23 is not defined, then formula_26 is a function that is nowhere defined. The function formula_15 can be constructed from the partial computable function formula_28 described above and the s-m-n theorem: for each formula_16, formula_30 is the index of a program which computes the function formula_31.

To complete the proof, let formula_4 be any total computable function, and construct formula_15 as above. Let formula_2 be an index of the composition formula_35, which is a total computable function. Then formula_36 by the definition of formula_15.
But, because formula_2 is an index of formula_35, formula_40, and thus formula_41. By the transitivity of formula_42, this means formula_43. Hence formula_44 for formula_45.

This proof is a construction of a partial recursive function which implements the Y combinator.

=== Fixed-point-free functions ===
A function formula_4 such that formula_47 for all formula_2 is called fixed-point free. The fixed-point theorem shows that no total computable function is fixed-point free, but there are many non-computable fixed-point-free functions. Arslanov&#x27;s completeness criterion states that the only recursively enumerable Turing degree that computes a fixed-point-free function is 0′, the degree of the halting problem.

== Kleene&#x27;s second recursion theorem ==
The second recursion theorem is a generalization of Rogers&#x27;s theorem with a second input in the function. One informal interpretation of the second recursion theorem is that it is possible to construct self-referential programs; see &quot;Application to quines&quot; below.

:The second recursion theorem. For any partial recursive function formula_49 there is an index formula_50 such that formula_51.

The theorem can be proved from Rogers&#x27;s theorem by letting formula_52 be a function such that formula_53 (a construction described by the S-m-n theorem). One can then verify that a fixed-point of this formula_4 is an index formula_50 as required. The theorem is constructive in the sense that a fixed computable function maps an index for formula_56 into the index formula_50.

=== Comparison to Rogers&#x27;s theorem ===
Kleene&#x27;s second recursion theorem and Rogers&#x27;s theorem can both be proved, rather simply, from each other. However, a direct proof of Kleene&#x27;s theorem does not make use of a universal program, which means that the theorem holds for certain subrecursive programming systems that do not have a universal program.

=== Application to quines ===
A classic example using the second recursion theorem is the function formula_58. The corresponding index formula_50 in this case yields a computable function that outputs its own index when applied to any value. When expressed as computer programs, such indices are known as quines.

The following example in Lisp illustrates how the formula_50 in the corollary can be effectively produced from the function formula_56. The function codice_1 in the code is the function of that name produced by the S-m-n theorem.

codice_2 can be changed to any two-argument function.

(setq Q &#x27;(lambda (x y) x))
(setq s11 &#x27;(lambda (f x) (list &#x27;lambda &#x27;(y) (list f x &#x27;y))))
(setq n (list &#x27;lambda &#x27;(x y) (list Q (list s11 &#x27;x &#x27;x) &#x27;y)))
(setq p (eval (list s11 n n)))
The results of the following expressions should be the same. formula_1 codice_3

(eval (list p nil))

codice_4

(eval (list Q p nil))
=== Application to elimination of recursion ===
Suppose that formula_63 and formula_15 are total computable functions that are used in a recursive definition for a function formula_65:

:formula_66

:formula_67

The second recursion theorem can be used to show that such equations define a computable function, where the notion of computability does not have to allow, prima facie, for recursive definitions (for example, it may be defined by μ-recursion, or by Turing machines). This recursive definition can be converted into a computable function formula_68 that assumes formula_2 is an index to itself, to simulate recursion:

:formula_70

:formula_71

The recursion theorem establishes the existence of a computable function formula_72 such that formula_73. Thus formula_65 satisfies the given recursive definition.

=== Reflexive programming ===
Reflexive, or reflective, programming refers to the usage of self-reference in programs. Jones presents a view of the second recursion theorem based on a reflexive language.
It is shown that the reflexive language defined is not stronger than a language without reflection (because an interpreter for the reflexive language can be implemented without using reflection); then, it is shown that the recursion theorem is almost trivial in the reflexive language.

== The first recursion theorem ==
While the second recursion theorem is about fixed points of computable functions, the first recursion theorem is related to fixed points determined by enumeration operators, which are a computable analogue of inductive definitions. An enumeration operator is a set of pairs (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) where &quot;A&quot; is a (code for a) finite set of numbers and &quot;n&quot; is a single natural number. Often, &quot;n&quot; will be viewed as a code for an ordered pair of natural numbers, particularly when functions are defined via enumeration operators. Enumeration operators are of central importance in the study of enumeration reducibility.

Each enumeration operator Φ determines a function from sets of naturals to sets of naturals given by
:formula_75
A recursive operator is an enumeration operator that, when given the graph of a partial recursive function, always returns the graph of a partial recursive function.

A fixed point of an enumeration operator Φ is a set &quot;F&quot; such that Φ(&quot;F&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;. The first enumeration theorem shows that fixed points can be effectively obtained if the enumeration operator itself is computable.

:First recursion theorem. The following statements hold.
:# For any computable enumeration operator Φ there is a recursively enumerable set &quot;F&quot; such that Φ(&quot;F&quot;) = &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is the smallest set with this property.
:# For any recursive operator Ψ there is a partial computable function φ such that Ψ(φ) = φ and φ is the smallest partial computable function with this property.
The first recursion theorem is also called Fixed point theorem (of recursion theory). There is also a definition which can be applied to recursive functionals as follows:

Let formula_76 be a recursive functional. Then formula_77 has a least fixed point formula_78 which is computable i.e.

1) formula_79

2) formula_80 such that formula_81 it holds that formula_82

3) formula_83 is computable

=== Example ===
Like the second recursion theorem, the first recursion theorem can be used to obtain functions satisfying systems of recursion equations. To apply the first recursion theorem, the recursion equations must first be recast as a recursive operator.

Consider the recursion equations for the factorial function &quot;f&quot;:formula_84The corresponding recursive operator Φ will have information that tells how to get to the next value of &quot;f&quot; from the previous value. However, the recursive operator will actually define the graph of &quot;f&quot;. First, Φ will contain the pair formula_85. This indicates that &quot;f&quot;(0) is unequivocally 1, and thus the pair (0,1) is in the graph of &quot;f&quot;.
Next, for each &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, Φ will contain the pair formula_86. This indicates that, if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is &quot;m&quot;, then is , so that the pair is in the graph of &quot;f&quot;. Unlike the base case , the recursive operator requires some information about &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) before it defines a value of .

The first recursion theorem (in particular, part 1) states that there is a set &quot;F&quot; such that . The set &quot;F&quot; will consist entirely of ordered pairs of natural numbers, and will be the graph of the factorial function &quot;f&quot;, as desired.

The restriction to recursion equations that can be recast as recursive operators ensures that the recursion equations actually define a least fixed point. For example, consider the set of recursion equations:formula_87There is no function &quot;g&quot; satisfying these equations, because they imply &quot;g&quot;(2) = 1 and also imply &quot;g&quot;(2) = 0. Thus there is no fixed point &quot;g&quot; satisfying these recursion equations. It is possible to make an enumeration operator corresponding to these equations, but it will not be a recursive operator.

=== Proof sketch for the first recursion theorem ===
The proof of part 1 of the first recursion theorem is obtained by iterating the enumeration operator Φ beginning with the empty set. First, a sequence &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot; is constructed, for formula_88. Let &quot;F&quot;0 be the empty set. Proceeding inductively, for each &quot;k&quot;, let &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot; + 1 be formula_89. Finally, &quot;F&quot; is taken to be formula_90. The remainder of the proof consists of a verification that &quot;F&quot; is recursively enumerable and is the least fixed point of Φ. The sequence &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot; used in this proof corresponds to the Kleene chain in the proof of the Kleene fixed-point theorem.

The second part of the first recursion theorem follows from the first part. The assumption that Φ is a recursive operator is used to show that the fixed point of Φ is the graph of a partial function. The key point is that if the fixed point &quot;F&quot; is not the graph of a function, then there is some &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot; is not the graph of a function.

=== Comparison to the second recursion theorem ===
Compared to the second recursion theorem, the first recursion theorem produces a stronger conclusion but only when narrower hypotheses are satisfied. Rogers uses the term weak recursion theorem for the first recursion theorem and strong recursion theorem for the second recursion theorem.

One difference between the first and second recursion theorems is that the fixed points obtained by the first recursion theorem are guaranteed to be least fixed points, while those obtained from the second recursion theorem may not be least fixed points.

A second difference is that the first recursion theorem only applies to systems of equations that can be recast as recursive operators. This restriction is similar to the restriction to continuous operators in the Kleene fixed-point theorem of order theory. The second recursion theorem can be applied to any total recursive function.

== Generalized theorem ==
In the context of his theory of numberings, Ershov showed that Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem holds for any precomplete numbering. A Gödel numbering is a precomplete numbering on the set of computable functions so the generalized theorem yields the Kleene recursion theorem as a special case.

Given a precomplete numbering formula_91, then for any partial computable function formula_65 with two parameters there exists a total computable function formula_93 with one parameter such that

<doc id="155410" wikidata="Q340556" url="?curid=155410" title="Akhmed Zakayev">
<text>Akhmed Halidovich Zakayev () is a Chechen statesman, political and military figure of the unrecognised Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI). Having previously been a Deputy Prime Minister, he now serves as Prime Minister of the ChRI government-in-exile. He was also the Foreign Minister of the Ichkerian government, appointed by Aslan Maskhadov shortly after his 1997 election, and again in 2006 by Abdul Halim Sadulayev. An active participant in the Russian-Chechen wars, Zakayev took part in the battles for Grozny and the defense of Goyskoye, along with other military operations, as well as in high-level negotiations with the Russian side.

In 2002, Russia accused him, by then in exile, of having been involved in a series of crimes including involvement in acts of terrorism. In 2003, judge Timothy Workman of Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in central London rejected the extradition request due to lack of evidence and declared the accusations to be politically motivated, also saying that there was substantial risk of Zakayev being tortured if he was returned to Moscow.

Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Zakayev has announced formation of the Separate Special Purpose Battalion of the Chechen Armed Forces, functioning as a Chechen volunteer battalion fighting with the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Akhmed Zakayev was born in the settlement of Kirovskiy, Kirovskiy Raion (today called Balpyk Bi, Koksu District), in the Kazakh SSR, Soviet Union, which is now in Almaty Region, in Kazakhstan; his family was deported by Stalin&#x27;s regime along with the rest of the Chechens in 1944. Akhmed is from the teip Chinkhoy. He graduated from acting and choreography schools in Voronezh and Moscow and worked as an actor at a theatre in the Chechen capital Grozny, specializing in Shakespearean roles. From 1991, he was the chairman of the Chechen Union of the Theatrical Actors. In 1994, Zakayev became a Minister of Culture in the Chechen separatist government of Dzhokhar Dudayev.

=== Chechen wars and the interwar period ===

After Russian forces entered Chechnya, starting the First Chechen War, Zakayev left his job and took up arms. Serving at first as a minor commander in the unit of Ruslan Gelayev, he took part in the 1995 battle of Grozny and then led the defence of the village of Goyskoye. After this the armed group under his command operated in the south-west part of Chechnya with its headquarters in the town of Urus-Martan. He was eventually promoted to the rank of brigadier general and appointed commander of the Urus-Martan Front. In February 1996, Zakayev became commander of the entire Western Group of Defense of Ichkeria. In August 1996, his forces took part in the decisive raid on Grozny, where he personally led the attack on the city&#x27;s central railway station. Zakayev&#x27;s war service paved his way to Chechen high politics. He became the acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev&#x27;s advisor for the security matters and the secretary of the Chechen Security Council and represented Chechnya at the peace talks in Khasav-Yurt, which brought a peaceful end to the first armed conflict between Moscow and Grozny.

After the war, Zakayev became Chechen Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of education and culture) and a special envoy of elected President of Ichkeria Aslan Maskhadov for relations with Moscow, taking part in the delegation that signed the official Chechen-Russian peace treaty at the Kremlin in 1997. During the interwar period, he opposed the rise of radical Islam in Chechnya and co-authored a book entitled &quot;Wahhabism – the Kremlin&#x27;s remedy against national liberation movements&quot;, alleging an association between Islamist extremism and Soviet global &quot;pro-terrorist&quot; policy and support for dictatorships in the Muslim world. During the early phases of the Second Chechen War in 1999–2000, Zakayev commanded Maskhadov&#x27;s presidential guard; he was also involved in negotiations with Russian representatives before and during the resumed hostilities. In 2000, having been wounded in a car accident during the new siege of Grozny, he left Chechnya for treatment. After this he stayed abroad and became President Maskhadov&#x27;s most prominent representative in Western Europe, while Ilyas Akhmadov was the Chechen emissary to the United States.

=== In exile ===

Since January 2002, Zakayev and his immediate family have been residing permanently in the United Kingdom. On 18 November 2001, Zakayev, officially internationally wanted by Russia, flew from Turkey to the Sheremetyevo International Airport near Moscow to meet the Kremlin&#x27;s envoy, General Viktor Kazantsev for the high-level talks since the start of the war. These negotiations were fruitless because Kazantsev demanded a complete capitulation of the Chechen side, with the only acceptable topic for the Russian side being the disarmament of Chechen separatists and their re-integration into civilian life. On 18 July 2002, Zakayev also met with the former secretary of Security Council of Russia Ivan Rybkin in Zürich, Switzerland.

In October 2002, Zakayev organized the World Chechen Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark (which was attended among others by the former first speaker of the State Duma, Ruslan Khasbulatov). During the congress, Zakayev was accused by Russia of involvement in planning of the Moscow theater hostage crisis. He was detained there on 30 October 2002, under an Interpol warrant filed by Russia, which named him a suspect in the theater siege. Zakayev denied involvement in the theater capture. He was held in Denmark for five weeks and then released due to lack of evidence, as Russia&#x27;s formal extradition request did not include any evidence linking him to the siege.

On 7 December 2002, Zakayev returned to the UK but the British authorities arrested him briefly at London Heathrow Airport; he was released on 50,000 GBP bail, which was paid by British actress Vanessa Redgrave, his friend who had travelled with him from Denmark. He was accused by Russian authorities of 13 criminal acts. Zakayev welcomed the British deportation hearings as an opportunity to put his case before an international public. All accusations were proven to be false. One accusation, cutting fingers of a suspected FSB informer Ivan Solovyov, was based on a written testimony by Zakayev&#x27;s former bodyguard, Duk-Vakha Dushuyev, provided by Russian authorities; however, it appeared that Solovyev had lost his fingers much earlier to frostbite. Dushuyev himself has escaped from Russia and then in his statement claimed that he was tortured at a Russian army base with electric shocks to extort the false testimony to be used against Zakayev. In another accusation, Father Sergei, one of two Russian Orthodox Church priests allegedly murdered by Zakayev, turned out to be in fact still alive. The witness Reverend Filipp, allegedly kidnapped by Zakayev in 1996, also refuted his supposed testimony and even denounced Russian authorities for &quot;implicating the Church in politics&quot;. Leading Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev told the court Zakayev would be at risk of death in Russian captivity (Kovalev spoke about two high-profile Chechen prisoners, field commanders Salman Raduyev and Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev, who died soon after being jailed in Russia, and of another, parliamentary speaker Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev, who has &quot;disappeared&quot; without trace after his arrest in 2000). According to Alexander Goldfarb, one of the defence&#x27;s most important arguments was the 2001 meeting between Zakayev and General Kazantsev, since this meeting took place when the Chechen envoy had already been put by Russia on the international wanted list. At the time of the meeting Kremlin&#x27;s spokesman on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on television that Russian government had no grievances against Zakayev. Therefore, on 13 November 2003, Judge Timothy Workman rejected the Russian request, deciding that it was politically motivated and that Zakayev would be at risk of torture in the case of &quot;unjust and oppressive&quot; extradition. The judge also said the crimes which involved Zakayev allegedly using armed force against combatants were not extraditable because they took place in the situation of internal armed conflict. Russian authorities in turn responded by accusing the court of double standards. On 29 November 2003, it was announced that Zakayev had been granted political asylum in the UK.

After receiving political asylum in Britain in 2003, Zakayev made London his permanent residence, and he visited several countries (including France, Germany and Poland) without being arrested. During the September 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, Zakayev consented to the request of the civilian negotiators and authorities of North Ossetia–Alania to fly to Russia to negotiate with the hostage takers. However, the siege ended in bloody confusion just a few hours before this could happen. As an envoy of Maskhadov, he also met in London with the representatives of the Union of the Committees of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia in February 2005, where they agreed on a peace proposal centred around a gradual cessation of violence by rebels corresponding with the three-week ceasefire unilaterally declared by Maskhadov (who once again called for President of Russia Vladimir Putin to negotiate). These efforts were ignored by the Russian government and Maskhadov himself was soon killed in Chechnya.

On 31 October 2007, Zakayev officially distanced himself from the newly resigned Chechen separatist leader Doku Umarov and the Chechen Islamist ideologist Movladi Udugov, who together had declared the creation of Caucasus Emirate in the place of abolished ChRI. In response, Zakayev called for the remnants of the separatist parliament to form the new government and salvage legitimacy. Soon after, on 20 November 2007, Zakayev submitted his resignation from the post of foreign minister, but said this should not be viewed as a departure from &quot;the fight for our independence, our freedom, and for the recognition of our state&quot;. He subsequently assumed the position of prime minister of the exile government. In September 2008, Ramzan Kadyrov said he was now trying to persuade Chechens refugees and exiles to return, including Akhmed Zakayev, whom Kadyrov described as &quot;a valuable artist who would be welcome to return to help revive Chechnya&#x27;s cultural heritage.&quot; Zakayev and Alla Dudayeva, the widow of the first Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, accused Udugov of being a paid agent provocateur for the Russia&#x27;s FSB.

In London, Zakayev became friends with the Russian dissident and former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, later murdered by radioactive poisoning in November 2006; Zakayev accused the Russian President Putin of ordering the death of Litvinenko. In 2007, British police warned Zakayev that there was an increased threat to his personal security shortly before the alleged attempt to kill Berezovsky by the FSB-connected Chechen gangster Movladi Atlangeriyev (or &quot;Mr A&quot;). According to the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky in 2008, Zakayev was placed #2 on the FSB assassination list, between Berezovsky and Litvinenko. In January 2008, Zakayev&#x27;s name showed up on the purported hit list of Ramzan Kadyrov&#x27;s enemies abroad to be killed, which was published on the Internet following the murder of the Chechen dissident Umar Israilov (a former bodyguard of Kadyrov who was shot dead after receiving asylum in Austria). Zakayev was arrested by the Polish police during his visit to Poland on 17 September 2010. He was released the same day.

In 2021, Zakayev expressed his condolences to the friends and relatives of the killed head of &quot;Islamic State – Caucasus Province&quot;, Aslan Byutukayev, calling him and his followers &quot;best of the best representatives of our people&quot;, a statement that met criticism from Ramzan Kadyrov.

In September 2021, Zakayev released a statement on behalf of the Chechen government-in-exile regarding the Fall of Kabul and the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban. According to researcher Aslan Doukaev, the statement was &quot;cautious&quot;, as it voiced concerns over &quot;possible violations of fundamental human rights&quot; and urged the Taliban to not abuse their power, pointing out that Muhammad had also behaved mercifully upon conquering Mecca. Doukaev contrasted Zakayev&#x27;s wording with much more enthusiastic comments made by Islamist Chechen separatists.

===Increased activism amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine===
In 2022, Russia launched a full invasion of Ukraine. At this point, several anti-Kadyrov Chechen militant groups like the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion and the Sheikh Mansur Battalion were already fighting for Ukraine. In May 2022, Zakayev travelled to Kyiv and met with Ukrainian officials for &quot;confidential&quot; talks. Later, the creation of the &quot;Separate Special Purpose Battalion of the Chechen Republic&#x27;s Armed Forces&quot; was announced by Zakayev; this unit officially styled itself as the continuation of the Armed Forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. A fourth separatist unit, called &quot;Khamzat Gelayev Joint Task Detachment&quot; was also founded. As the Russo-Ukrainian War continued to escalate, the pro-Ukrainian Chechen separatists increasingly framed the war as a chance to restore the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. On 18 October 2022, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament recognized the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as &quot;temporarily occupied&quot; state. Zakayev had lobbied in support of this resolution.

In November 2023, the &quot;Congress of the Peoples of the North Caucasus&quot; (a political alliance of various northern Caucasus separatist groups) appointed Zakayev the head of its Defense Commission alongside Akhmad Akhmedov, Sheikh Mansur Battalion deputy commander. The Congress aims at coordinating the different separatist exiles to unite their efforts against Russia.

== Invitations to return to Chechnya ==

On 11 February 2009, Ramzan Kadyrov said he personally invited Zakayev to return to Chechnya if he does not want to be &quot;used by special services and other forces against Russia&quot;. At the same time, Russia&#x27;s ambassador in London, said Britain had turned into a &quot;sanctuary&quot; for Russia&#x27;s fugitives, including Zakayev, still-wanted on terrorism charges. In an interview for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Zakayev claimed to rebuff the Chechen president&#x27;s reported offer and said that Kadyrov was only following the Kremlin&#x27;s orders; he also reinstates this stance two days later in the interview for the BBC Russian Service. Kadyrov has said that &quot;He [Zakayev] is the only man on the part of Ichkeria who I would like to bring back home. I do not know what the competent bodies think, but I believe he did not commit serious crimes.&quot;

According to the Kavkaz Center, Zakayev, who may be granted amnesty, stated his readiness to return and &quot;contribute to a long-term peace in the region&quot; in an interview for Ekho Moskvy on the same day. Kavkaz Center – which supported Umarov – has called Zakayev &quot;the head of a telephone government&quot;, referring to the fact that Zakayev has little influence on the insurgents on the ground.

On 23 August 2009, in a controversial move, he was reportedly dismissed as prime minister by the Chairman of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria parliament in exile, as he &quot;transgressed his mandate and recognized the legitimacy of the Kremlin’s puppet regime&quot;, and shortly afterwards, he was sentenced to death by Sharia Court of the Caucasus Emirate, because he &quot;professes democratic religion, propagates secularism, and prefers the laws established by men to the Shari&#x27;a law of Almighty and Great Allah.&quot;

<text>Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, computability theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.

Basic questions addressed by computability theory include:
* What does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable?
* How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?

Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages. The study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics.

==Introduction==

Computability theory originated in the 1930s, with the work of Kurt Gödel, Alonzo Church, Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, and Emil Post.

The fundamental results the researchers obtained established Turing computability as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation. In 1952, these results led Kleene to coin the two names &quot;Church&#x27;s thesis&quot; and &quot;Turing&#x27;s thesis&quot;. Nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis, the Church–Turing thesis, which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function. Although initially skeptical, by 1946 Gödel argued in favor of this thesis:

With a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that cannot be effectively decided. In 1936, Church and Turing were inspired by techniques used by Gödel to prove his incompleteness theorems - in 1931, Gödel independently demonstrated that the is not effectively decidable. This result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false.

Many problems in mathematics have been shown to be undecidable after these initial examples were established. In 1947, Markov and Post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups cannot be effectively decided. Extending this result, Pyotr Novikov and William Boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable: there is no effective procedure that, given a word in a finitely presented group, will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved (using results of Julia Robinson) Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem, which implies that Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem has no effective solution; this problem asked whether there is an effective procedure to decide whether a Diophantine equation over the integers has a solution in the integers.

==Turing computability==
The main form of computability studied in the field was introduced by Turing in 1936. A set of natural numbers is said to be a &quot;computable set&quot; (also called a &quot;decidable&quot;, &quot;recursive&quot;, or &quot;Turing computable&quot; set) if there is a Turing machine that, given a number &quot;n&quot;, halts with output 1 if &quot;n&quot; is in the set and halts with output 0 if &quot;n&quot; is not in the set. A function &quot;f&quot; from natural numbers to natural numbers is a &quot;(Turing) computable,&quot; or &quot;recursive function&quot; if there is a Turing machine that, on input &quot;n&quot;, halts and returns output &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). The use of Turing machines here is not necessary; there are many other models of computation that have the same computing power as Turing machines; for example the μ-recursive functions obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator.

The terminology for computable functions and sets is not completely standardized. 
The definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of functions by Gödel led to the traditional name &quot;recursive&quot; for sets and functions computable by a Turing machine. The word &quot;decidable&quot; stems from the German word which was used in the original papers of Turing and others. In contemporary use, the term &quot;computable function&quot; has various definitions: according to Nigel J. Cutland, it is a partial recursive function (which can be undefined for some inputs), while according to Robert I. Soare it is a total recursive (equivalently, general recursive) function. This article follows the second of these conventions. In 1996, Soare gave additional comments about the terminology.

Not every set of natural numbers is computable. The halting problem, which is the set of (descriptions of) Turing machines that halt on input 0, is a well-known example of a noncomputable set. The existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countably many Turing machines, and thus only countably many computable sets, but according to the Cantor&#x27;s theorem, there are uncountably many sets of natural numbers.

Although the halting problem is not computable, it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt. Thus the halting problem is an example of a &quot;computably enumerable (c.e.) set&quot;, which is a set that can be enumerated by a Turing machine (other terms for computably enumerable include &quot;recursively enumerable&quot; and &quot;semidecidable&quot;). Equivalently, a set is c.e. if and only if it is the range of some computable function. The c.e. sets, although not decidable in general, have been studied in detail in computability theory.

==Areas of research==
Beginning with the theory of computable sets and functions described above, the field of computability theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics. These are not independent areas of research: each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others, and most computability theorists are familiar with the majority of them.

===Relative computability and the Turing degrees===
Computability theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on &quot;relative computability&quot;, a generalization of Turing computability defined using oracle Turing machines, introduced by Turing in 1939. An oracle Turing machine is a hypothetical device which, in addition to performing the actions of a regular Turing machine, is able to ask questions of an &quot;oracle&quot;, which is a particular set of natural numbers. The oracle machine may only ask questions of the form &quot;Is &quot;n&quot; in the oracle set?&quot;. Each question will be immediately answered correctly, even if the oracle set is not computable. Thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a Turing machine without an oracle cannot.

Informally, a set of natural numbers &quot;A&quot; is &quot;Turing reducible&quot; to a set &quot;B&quot; if there is an oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are in &quot;A&quot; when run with &quot;B&quot; as the oracle set (in this case, the set &quot;A&quot; is also said to be (&quot;relatively&quot;) &quot;computable from&quot; &quot;B&quot; and &quot;recursive in&quot; &quot;B&quot;). If a set &quot;A&quot; is Turing reducible to a set &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;A&quot; then the sets are said to have the same &quot;Turing degree&quot; (also called &quot;degree of unsolvability&quot;). The Turing degree of a set gives a precise measure of how uncomputable the set is.

The natural examples of sets that are not computable, including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem, have two properties in common:
#They are computably enumerable, and
#Each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction. That is, given such sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, there is a total computable function &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;A&quot; = {&quot;x&quot; : &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∈ &quot;B&quot;}. These sets are said to be &quot;many-one equivalent&quot; (or &quot;m-equivalent&quot;).

Many-one reductions are &quot;stronger&quot; than Turing reductions: if a set &quot;A&quot; is many-one reducible to a set &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;B&quot;, but the converse does not always hold. Although the natural examples of noncomputable sets are all many-one equivalent, it is possible to construct computably enumerable sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; such that &quot;A&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;B&quot; but not many-one reducible to &quot;B&quot;. It can be shown that every computably enumerable set is many-one reducible to the halting problem, and thus the halting problem is the most complicated computably enumerable set with respect to many-one reducibility and with respect to Turing reducibility. In 1944, Post asked whether &quot;every&quot; computably enumerable set is either computable or Turing equivalent to the halting problem, that is, whether there is no computably enumerable set with a Turing degree intermediate between those two.

As intermediate results, Post defined natural types of computably enumerable sets like the simple, hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets. Post showed that these sets are strictly between the computable sets and the halting problem with respect to many-one reducibility. Post also showed that some of them are strictly intermediate under other reducibility notions stronger than Turing reducibility. But Post left open the main problem of the existence of computably enumerable sets of intermediate Turing degree; this problem became known as &quot;Post&#x27;s problem&quot;. After ten years, Kleene and Post showed in 1954 that there are intermediate Turing degrees between those of the computable sets and the halting problem, but they failed to show that any of these degrees contains a computably enumerable set. Very soon after this, Friedberg and Muchnik independently solved Post&#x27;s problem by establishing the existence of computably enumerable sets of intermediate degree. This groundbreaking result opened a wide study of the Turing degrees of the computably enumerable sets which turned out to possess a very complicated and non-trivial structure.

There are uncountably many sets that are not computably enumerable, and the investigation of the Turing degrees of all sets is as central in computability theory as the investigation of the computably enumerable Turing degrees. Many degrees with special properties were constructed: &quot;hyperimmune-free degrees&quot; where every function computable relative to that degree is majorized by a (unrelativized) computable function; &quot;high degrees&quot; relative to which one can compute a function &quot;f&quot; which dominates every computable function &quot;g&quot; in the sense that there is a constant &quot;c&quot; depending on &quot;g&quot; such that &quot;g(x) &lt; f(x)&quot; for all &quot;x &gt; c&quot;; &quot;random degrees&quot; containing algorithmically random sets; &quot;1-generic&quot; degrees of 1-generic sets; and the degrees below the halting problem of limit-computable sets.

The study of arbitrary (not necessarily computably enumerable) Turing degrees involves the study of the Turing jump. Given a set &quot;A&quot;, the &quot;Turing jump&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is a set of natural numbers encoding a solution to the halting problem for oracle Turing machines running with oracle &quot;A&quot;. The Turing jump of any set is always of higher Turing degree than the original set, and a theorem of Friedburg shows that any set that computes the Halting problem can be obtained as the Turing jump of another set. Post&#x27;s theorem establishes a close relationship between the Turing jump operation and the arithmetical hierarchy, which is a classification of certain subsets of the natural numbers based on their definability in arithmetic.

Much recent research on Turing degrees has focused on the overall structure of the set of Turing degrees and the set of Turing degrees containing computably enumerable sets. A deep theorem of Shore and Slaman states that the function mapping a degree &quot;x&quot; to the degree of its Turing jump is definable in the partial order of the Turing degrees. A survey by Ambos-Spies and Fejer gives an overview of this research and its historical progression.

===Other reducibilities===
An ongoing area of research in computability theory studies reducibility relations other than Turing reducibility. Post introduced several &quot;strong reducibilities&quot;, so named because they imply truth-table reducibility. A Turing machine implementing a strong reducibility will compute a total function regardless of which oracle it is presented with. &quot;Weak reducibilities&quot; are those where a reduction process may not terminate for all oracles; Turing reducibility is one example.

The strong reducibilities include:
: One-one reducibility: &quot;A&quot; is &quot;one-one reducible&quot; (or &quot;1-reducible&quot;) to &quot;B&quot; if there is a total computable injective function &quot;f&quot; such that each &quot;n&quot; is in &quot;A&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is in &quot;B&quot;.
: Many-one reducibility: This is essentially one-one reducibility without the constraint that &quot;f&quot; be injective. &quot;A&quot; is &quot;many-one reducible&quot; (or &quot;m-reducible&quot;) to &quot;B&quot; if there is a total computable function &quot;f&quot; such that each &quot;n&quot; is in &quot;A&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is in &quot;B&quot;.
: Truth-table reducibility: &quot;A&quot; is truth-table reducible to &quot;B&quot; if &quot;A&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;B&quot; via an oracle Turing machine that computes a total function regardless of the oracle it is given. Because of compactness of Cantor space, this is equivalent to saying that the reduction presents a single list of questions (depending only on the input) to the oracle simultaneously, and then having seen their answers is able to produce an output without asking additional questions regardless of the oracle&#x27;s answer to the initial queries. Many variants of truth-table reducibility have also been studied.
Further reducibilities (positive, disjunctive, conjunctive, linear and their weak and bounded versions) are discussed in the article Reduction (computability theory).

The major research on strong reducibilities has been to compare their theories, both for the class of all computably enumerable sets as well as for the class of all subsets of the natural numbers. Furthermore, the relations between the reducibilities has been studied. For example, it is known that every Turing degree is either a truth-table degree or is the union of infinitely many truth-table degrees.

Reducibilities weaker than Turing reducibility (that is, reducibilities that are implied by Turing reducibility) have also been studied. The most well known are arithmetical reducibility and hyperarithmetical reducibility. These reducibilities are closely connected to definability over the standard model of arithmetic.

===Rice&#x27;s theorem and the arithmetical hierarchy===
Rice showed that for every nontrivial class &quot;C&quot; (which contains some but not all c.e. sets) the index set &quot;E&quot; = {&quot;e&quot;: the &quot;e&quot;th c.e. set &quot;We&quot; is in &quot;C&quot;} has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to &quot;E&quot;, that is, can be mapped using a many-one reduction to &quot;E&quot; (see Rice&#x27;s theorem for more detail). But, many of these index sets are even more complicated than the halting problem. These type of sets can be classified using the arithmetical hierarchy. For example, the index set FIN of the class of all finite sets is on the level Σ2, the index set REC of the class of all recursive sets is on the level Σ3, the index set COFIN of all cofinite sets is also on the level Σ3 and the index set COMP of the class of all Turing-complete sets Σ4. These hierarchy levels are defined inductively, Σ&quot;n&quot;+1 contains just all sets which are computably enumerable relative to Σ&quot;n&quot;; Σ1 contains the computably enumerable sets. The index sets given here are even complete for their levels, that is, all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets.

===Reverse mathematics===
The program of &quot;reverse mathematics&quot; asks which set-existence axioms are necessary to prove particular theorems of mathematics in subsystems of second-order arithmetic. This study was initiated by Harvey Friedman and was studied in detail by Stephen Simpson and others; in 1999, Simpson gave a detailed discussion of the program. The set-existence axioms in question correspond informally to axioms saying that the powerset of the natural numbers is closed under various reducibility notions. The weakest such axiom studied in reverse mathematics is &quot;recursive comprehension&quot;, which states that the powerset of the naturals is closed under Turing reducibility.

===Numberings===
A numbering is an enumeration of functions; it has two parameters, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;x&quot; and outputs the value of the &quot;e&quot;-th function in the numbering on the input &quot;x&quot;. Numberings can be partial-computable although some of its members are total computable functions. Admissible numberings are those into which all others can be translated. A Friedberg numbering (named after its discoverer) is a one-one numbering of all partial-computable functions; it is necessarily not an admissible numbering. Later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of computably enumerable sets. Goncharov discovered for example a class of computably enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to computable isomorphisms.

===The priority method===

Post&#x27;s problem was solved with a method called the &quot;priority method&quot;; a proof using this method is called a &quot;priority argument&quot;. This method is primarily used to construct computably enumerable sets with particular properties. To use this method, the desired properties of the set to be constructed are broken up into an infinite list of goals, known as &quot;requirements&quot;, so that satisfying all the requirements will cause the set constructed to have the desired properties. Each requirement is assigned to a natural number representing the priority of the requirement; so 0 is assigned to the most important priority, 1 to the second most important, and so on. The set is then constructed in stages, each stage attempting to satisfy one of more of the requirements by either adding numbers to the set or banning numbers from the set so that the final set will satisfy the requirement. It may happen that satisfying one requirement will cause another to become unsatisfied; the priority order is used to decide what to do in such an event.

Priority arguments have been employed to solve many problems in computability theory, and have been classified into a hierarchy based on their complexity. Because complex priority arguments can be technical and difficult to follow, it has traditionally been considered desirable to prove results without priority arguments, or to see if results proved with priority arguments can also be proved without them. 
For example, Kummer published a paper on a proof for the existence of Friedberg numberings without using the priority method.

===The lattice of computably enumerable sets===
When Post defined the notion of a simple set as a c.e. set with an infinite complement not containing any infinite c.e. set, he started to study the structure of the computably enumerable sets under inclusion. This lattice became a well-studied structure. Computable sets can be defined in this structure by the basic result that a set is computable if and only if the set and its complement are both computably enumerable. Infinite c.e. sets have always infinite computable subsets; but on the other hand, simple sets exist but do not always have a coinfinite computable superset. Post introduced already hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets; later maximal sets were constructed which are c.e. sets such that every c.e. superset is either a finite variant of the given maximal set or is co-finite. Post&#x27;s original motivation in the study of this lattice was to find a structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property is neither in the Turing degree of the computable sets nor in the Turing degree of the halting problem. Post did not find such a property and the solution to his problem applied priority methods instead; in 1991, Harrington and Soare found eventually such a property.

===Automorphism problems===
Another important question is the existence of automorphisms in computability-theoretic structures. One of these structures is that one of computably enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, &quot;A&quot; is below &quot;B&quot; if and only if the set difference &quot;B&quot; − &quot;A&quot; is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be automorphic to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the computably enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned, then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. In 1974, Soare showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are automorphic. So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.

Besides the lattice of computably enumerable sets, automorphisms are also studied for the structure of the Turing degrees of all sets as well as for the structure of the Turing degrees of c.e. sets. In both cases, Cooper claims to have constructed nontrivial automorphisms which map some degrees to other degrees; this construction has, however, not been verified and some colleagues believe that the construction contains errors and that the question of whether there is a nontrivial automorphism of the Turing degrees is still one of the main unsolved questions in this area.

===Kolmogorov complexity===
The field of Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Levin, Martin-Löf and Solomonoff (the names are given here in alphabetical order; much of the research was independent, and the unity of the concept of randomness was not understood at the time). The main idea is to consider a universal Turing machine &quot;U&quot; and to measure the complexity of a number (or string) &quot;x&quot; as the length of the shortest input &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;U&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) outputs &quot;x&quot;. This approach revolutionized earlier ways to determine when an infinite sequence (equivalently, characteristic function of a subset of the natural numbers) is random or not by invoking a notion of randomness for finite objects. Kolmogorov complexity became not only a subject of independent study but is also applied to other subjects as a tool for obtaining proofs.
There are still many open problems in this area.

===Frequency computation===
This branch of computability theory analyzed the following question: For fixed &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; with 0 &lt; &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, for which functions &quot;A&quot; is it possible to compute for any different &quot;n&quot; inputs &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;xn&quot; a tuple of &quot;n&quot; numbers &quot;y1, y2, ..., yn&quot; such that at least &quot;m&quot; of the equations &quot;A&quot;(&quot;xk&quot;) = &quot;yk&quot; are true. Such sets are known as (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)-recursive sets. The first major result in this branch of computability theory is Trakhtenbrot&#x27;s result that a set is computable if it is (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)-recursive for some &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; with 2&quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. On the other hand, Jockusch&#x27;s semirecursive sets (which were already known informally before Jockusch introduced them 1968) are examples of a set which is (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)-recursive if and only if 2&quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; + 1. There are uncountably many of these sets and also some computably enumerable but noncomputable sets of this type. Later, Degtev established a hierarchy of computably enumerable sets that are (1, &quot;n&quot; + 1)-recursive but not (1, &quot;n&quot;)-recursive. After a long phase of research by Russian scientists, this subject became repopularized in the west by Beigel&#x27;s thesis on bounded queries, which linked frequency computation to the above-mentioned bounded reducibilities and other related notions. One of the major results was Kummer&#x27;s Cardinality Theory which states that a set &quot;A&quot; is computable if and only if there is an &quot;n&quot; such that some algorithm enumerates for each tuple of &quot;n&quot; different numbers up to &quot;n&quot; many possible choices of the cardinality of this set of &quot;n&quot; numbers intersected with &quot;A&quot;; these choices must contain the true cardinality but leave out at least one false one.

===Inductive inference===
This is the computability-theoretic branch of learning theory. It is based on E. Mark Gold&#x27;s model of learning in the limit from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning. The general scenario is the following: Given a class &quot;S&quot; of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, computable functional) which outputs for any input of the form (&quot;f&quot;(0), &quot;f&quot;(1), ..., &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) a hypothesis. A learner &quot;M&quot; learns a function &quot;f&quot; if almost all hypotheses are the same index &quot;e&quot; of &quot;f&quot; with respect to a previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; &quot;M&quot; learns &quot;S&quot; if &quot;M&quot; learns every &quot;f&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. Basic results are that all computably enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of computably enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold&#x27;s pioneering paper in 1967 onwards.

===Generalizations of Turing computability===
Computability theory includes the study of generalized notions of this field such as arithmetic reducibility, hyperarithmetical reducibility and α-recursion theory, as described by Sacks in 1990. These generalized notions include reducibilities that cannot be executed by Turing machines but are nevertheless natural generalizations of Turing reducibility. These studies include approaches to investigate the analytical hierarchy which differs from the arithmetical hierarchy by permitting quantification over sets of natural numbers in addition to quantification over individual numbers. These areas are linked to the theories of well-orderings and trees; for example the set of all indices of computable (nonbinary) trees without infinite branches is complete for level formula_1 of the analytical hierarchy. Both Turing reducibility and hyperarithmetical reducibility are important in the field of effective descriptive set theory. The even more general notion of degrees of constructibility is studied in set theory.

===Continuous computability theory===
Computability theory for digital computation is well developed. Computability theory is less well developed for analog computation that occurs in analog computers, analog signal processing, analog electronics, artificial neural networks and continuous-time control theory, modelled by differential equations and continuous dynamical systems. For example, models of computation such as the Blum–Shub–Smale machine model have formalized computation on the reals.

==Relationships between definability, proof and computability==
There are close relationships between the Turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty (in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy) of defining that set using a first-order formula. One such relationship is made precise by Post&#x27;s theorem. A weaker relationship was demonstrated by Kurt Gödel in the proofs of his completeness theorem and incompleteness theorems. Gödel&#x27;s proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a computably enumerable set, and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable. Similarly, Tarski&#x27;s indefinability theorem can be interpreted both in terms of definability and in terms of computability.

Computability theory is also linked to second-order arithmetic, a formal theory of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers. The fact that certain sets are computable or relatively computable often implies that these sets can be defined in weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic. The program of reverse mathematics uses these subsystems to measure the non-computability inherent in well known mathematical theorems. In 1999, Simpson discussed many aspects of second-order arithmetic and reverse mathematics.

The field of proof theory includes the study of second-order arithmetic and Peano arithmetic, as well as formal theories of the natural numbers weaker than Peano arithmetic. One method of classifying the strength of these weak systems is by characterizing which computable functions the system can prove to be total. For example, in primitive recursive arithmetic any computable function that is provably total is actually primitive recursive, while Peano arithmetic proves that functions like the Ackermann function, which are not primitive recursive, are total. Not every total computable function is provably total in Peano arithmetic, however; an example of such a function is provided by Goodstein&#x27;s theorem.

==Name==
The field of mathematical logic dealing with computability and its generalizations has been called &quot;recursion theory&quot; since its early days. Robert I. Soare, a prominent researcher in the field, has proposed that the field should be called &quot;computability theory&quot; instead. He argues that Turing&#x27;s terminology using the word &quot;computable&quot; is more natural and more widely understood than the terminology using the word &quot;recursive&quot; introduced by Kleene. Many contemporary researchers have begun to use this alternate terminology. These researchers also use terminology such as &quot;partial computable function&quot; and &quot;computably enumerable &quot;(&quot;c.e.&quot;)&quot; set&quot; instead of &quot;partial recursive function&quot; and &quot;recursively enumerable &quot;(&quot;r.e.&quot;)&quot; set&quot;. Not all researchers have been convinced, however, as explained by Fortnow and Simpson.
Some commentators argue that both the names &quot;recursion theory&quot; and &quot;computability theory&quot; fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in computability theory are not computable.

In 1967, Rogers has suggested that a key property of computability theory is that its results and structures should be invariant under computable bijections on the natural numbers (this suggestion draws on the ideas of the Erlangen program in geometry). The idea is that a computable bijection merely renames numbers in a set, rather than indicating any structure in the set, much as a rotation of the Euclidean plane does not change any geometric aspect of lines drawn on it. Since any two infinite computable sets are linked by a computable bijection, this proposal identifies all the infinite computable sets (the finite computable sets are viewed as trivial). According to Rogers, the sets of interest in computability theory are the noncomputable sets, partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers.

== Professional organizations ==
The main professional organization for computability theory is the &quot;Association for Symbolic Logic&quot;, which holds several research conferences each year. The interdisciplinary research Association &quot;Computability in Europe&quot; (&quot;CiE&quot;) also organizes a series of annual conferences.

<doc id="155418" wikidata="Q244941" url="?curid=155418" title="Xi'an Incident">
<text>The Xi&#x27;an Incident was a Chinese political crisis that lasted from 12 to 26 December 1936. Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Nationalist government of China, was arrested in Xi&#x27;an by soldiers of the Northeastern Army under the command of General Zhang Xueliang. Zhang demanded that Chiang agree to a ceasefire in the Chinese Civil War so that the Nationalist government could ally with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against Japanese expansionism. Negotiations were held between Chiang in the CCP, resulting in verbal agreement on the broad outlines of an alliance. After Chiang was released, he publicly renounced the terms he had agreed to in captivity, but secretly continued the negotiations that would result in the Second United Front.

The Xi&#x27;an Incident followed months of secret negotiations between the CCP and the Nationalists. Only minor progress had been made by December 1936. However, the CCP had also been negotiating directly with the Nationalist armies that surrounded it, including the Northeastern Army. These negotiations had been much more successful. The CCP formed a secret alliance with Zhang&#x27;s Northeastern Army and Yang Hucheng&#x27;s Northwestern Army that aimed to see the civil war ended and a war of national liberation begun against Japan. With encouragement from the CCP, Zhang repeatedly but unsuccessfully pressured Chiang to agree to a ceasefire with the CCP. After Chiang gave Zhang an ultimatum to either attack the Communists are be reassigned, Zhang decided to take Chiang hostage and force a settlement.

Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s sudden capture was shocking news. The CCP was ecstatic, believing that an agreement with Chiang was no longer necessary now that he was in the custody of their ally, and they recommended he be put on trial and executed. Joseph Stalin, however, was worried that executing Chiang would make an alliance with the Nationalist government impossible, and ordered the CCP to bring the incident to a peaceful resolution. The CCP accepted this directive and instructed Zhou Enlai to begin negotiations. The Nationalist government was thrown into disarray and was at first unsure at how to react. A full military assault on Xi&#x27;an was nearly carried out by General He Yingqin before Soong Mei-ling (Chiang&#x27;s wife) and other leaders of the &quot;peace faction&quot; prevailed. Soong and other close advisors to Chiang flew to Xi&#x27;an and convinced him to begin negotiations with the Communists. After a few weeks of slow progress, Chiang had agreed in principle to a ceasefire and a united front against Japan. 

On December 26, Zhang agreed to release Chiang and accompany him back to Nanjing. Upon arrival, Chiang immediately had Zhang arrested—he would remain under house arrest for the next 50 years. Chiang publicly reneged on his agreements, but in private he invited Zhou Enlai to come to Nanjing. Negotiations on the specifics of an alliance continued until shortly after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, at which point the two sides were able to finalize their terms.

==Background==
===Gradual changes in policy===
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in November 1931 posed a clear threat to both sides of the Chinese Civil War (as well as to the Soviet Union), but it did not lead to an immediate cessation of hostilities. The failure of the First United Front four years previously had created deep, lasting distrust. Chiang Kai-shek articulated his policy as &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance.&quot; The CCP called for simultaneously &quot;Resisting Japan and Opposing Chiang&quot;. 

The first subtle changes in this mutual policy of non-cooperation was initiated by the Communists in Manchuria. There, guerilla groups found it impossible to fight against the Japanese while also fighting the Nationalists. Starting in late 1932 the Comintern authorized the Communist guerillas in Manchuria to cooperate with all anti-Japanese forces. That same year, the USSR restored diplomatic relations with the Nationalist Government. The events in Europe—including Hitler&#x27;s rise to power—were a major influence on the move towards a united front. The 7th World Congress of the Comintern encouraged Communist parties everywhere to form a united front with moderate forces to resist the Fascists. Wang Ming, head of the CCP delegation, published the &quot;1 August Declaration&quot; in October, which publicly called on all parties in China to form a united front against Japanese Imperialism. They proposed creating a anti-Japanese defense government to coordinate resistance. Importantly, though, the offer did not extend to Chiang himself; the CCP&#x27;s delegation still considered him and his central government the &quot;running dog&quot; of the Japanese.

The CCP itself (cut off from radio communication with Moscow) learned of the 1 August Declaration in November 1935. Party leaders held a conference at Wayaobu in December to discuss the implications of this new policy. Their Wayaobu Manifesto marked an important retreat from the hardline positions they had held during the early civil war. It called for &quot;the most broad national united front&quot; to resist Japan, and announced that the CCP would suspend class conflict in the interests of cross-class collaboration. However, it also made clear that they did not want to give up their military strength. As a basis from which to resist the Japanese, the Manifesto called for the Red Army to be expanded to 1 million men and for the Chinese Soviet to dramatically increase its land area.

=== Early attempts at negotiations ===
In late 1935 Japan stepped up its expansionist policies in north China, severely worsening relations between Nanjing and Tokyo. Negotiations had reached an apparent impasse by October. China reached out to Nazi Germany for mediation, but afraid of offending Japan, the Germans declined to get involved. Chiang Kai-shek was concerned that war was imminent, and wanted to secure the material and diplomatic support of the Soviet Union. He also faced growing public pressure to actively resist Japan: on December 9, 1935, for example, a major student protest broke out in Beiping.

In January, Chiang Kai-shek sent emissaries to Moscow to negotiate a military mutual assistance treaty. However, as a precondition for a treaty, Chiang wanted the Soviet Union to order the CCP to submit to the Nationalist Government. The Soviet ambassador told Chiang that while the USSR hoped the CCP would agree to a unified command under the Nationalists, Chiang would have to negotiate directly with the CCP. This upset Chiang, who worried that if the USSR was unwilling to order the CCP to stop, they might be willing to support further revolutionary actions by the CCP if a ceasefire broke down. Progress halted, and after news leaked to the press that Chiang was contemplating a treaty with the USSR, he called off negotiations. These maneuvers left Stalin wary of Chiang&#x27;s intentions. 

Nevertheless, Chiang still sought contacts with the CCP inside China. Soong Ching-ling managed to recruit a Communist priest, Dong Jianwu, to cross the front lines and bring the CCP the message that Chiang was interested in ending the civil war. Dong arrived on February 27. The CCP Central Committee told him that the CCP would be interested in negotiating a ceasefire along the lines of the Wayaobu Manifesto (i.e., an alliance that excluded Chiang). Given the complete incompatibility of the CCP and KMT&#x27;s conditions, serious negotiations did not take place during the first half of 1936. 

=== Creation of an alliance between the CCP and Zhang Xueliang===

The Nationalist forces besieging the Communists were composed of two armies: the 130,000-strong Northeastern Army led by Zhang Xueliang and the 40,000-strong Northwestern Army led by Yang Hucheng. Both Yang and Zhang were former warlords who had pledged their armies to the Nationalist Government. Zhang had governed Manchuria before it was overrun by the Japanese, and strongly wished to retake his homeland. He opposed the concessions that Chiang had made to Japan, and was frustrated by his orders to fight the Communists rather than the Japanese. Yang had likewise become skeptical of Chiang&#x27;s anti-Japanese commitment after the public demonstrations in December 1935. Zhang and Yang had been promised an easy victory against the Communists. They were surprised and dismayed when the Red Army defeated them in several major engagements. The Red Army treated their POWs well and gave them a political education, sending them back to spread the word that the Communists wanted to form an anti-Chiang and anti-Japanese alliance. This effectively destroyed morale in the Nationalist armies, and the soldiers began pressing for a truce with the Communists. With his officer Nan Hanchen acting as intermediary, Yang Hucheng was able to conclude a ceasefire quickly. Negotiations with Zhang Xueliang took longer because there the CCP had no established contacts in the Northeastern Army. But after Dong Jianwu requested passage to CCP territory on a mission from the central government, Zhang realized that the central government was negotiating with the CCP and was encouraged to do so himself. A ceasefire was agreed on February 25.

On April 9, Zhang Xueliang met with Zhou Enlai. Zhou, an experienced negotiator, was able to solidify the ceasefire and secure supplies for the Red Army. In this and subsequent meetings, Zhang Xueliang would argue that resisting Japan would only be possible if the CCP gave up its opposition to Chiang. Zhou said that the CCP would discuss the point, but refused to commit to changing the policy. As negotiations between Zhang and the CCP continued, the Communists infiltrated the Northeastern Army. They spread communist ideas among the soldiers and recruited officers into secret societies. In June they set up an officer training camp that celebrated the united front. This support from within the army helped them to persuade Zhang to form an alliance. They planned to use Soviet support to take over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang and turn northwest China into a base under Zhang&#x27;s command to resist Japan and oppose Chiang. Zhang agreed that in 1937, the CCP would be able to move their capital from Bao&#x27;an to Yan&#x27;an. In order to deceive Chiang, the Communists and the Northeastern Army even staged fake military battles with mock units.

===Renewed negotiations===

Over the course of the year, the Soviets had become more convinced that the united front should include Chiang. This created a problem when, in late June, the CCP re-established radio communications with Moscow. They transmitted the Wayaobu Manifesto and informed the Comintern of their alliance with Zhang. They asked for assistance in carrying out their plan to form an anti-Japan, anti-Chiang base. The Comintern responded with a telegram on August 15 admonishing the CCP for continuing to oppose Chiang. The Comintern did approve the other provisions of the Wayaobu Manifesto, agreeing that neither soviet power nor the independence of the Red Army should be sacrificed. But they absolutely vetoed the CCP&#x27;s plan to form a base in the northwest, knowing that such a move would scuttle any chance for a united front with the KMT. The CCP accepted the new directive from the Comintern. They adopted the new slogan &quot;compelling Chiang to resist Japan,&quot; and Pan Hannian was sent to Nanjing to begin negotiating a truce with Chen Lifu. 

Chiang continued to try to resolve the civil war militarily. He had always considered negotiations with the CCP to be a last resort, and after bringing the Liangguang Incident to a peaceful conclusion in September, he could bring all his force to bear on wiping out the Communists entirely. He was encouraged by the results of the Ningxia campaign in mid-to-late October. The Second and Fourth Corps of the Red Army marched north to pick up supplies dropped in Mongolia by the Soviet Union, but found themselves trapped on the wrong side of the Yellow River. They were cut to pieces by the Hui cavalry allied with the Nationalists. Chiang began making preparations for a sixth encirclement campaign, and instructed Zhang and Yang to participate. During Chiang&#x27;s birthday celebrations on October 31, Zhang Xueliang and Yan Xishan attempted to convince Chiang to give up the bandit suppression campaign and focus on Japan instead. He angrily refused, and gave a speech the following day where he proclaimed that &quot;the Communists are our greatest traitors&quot;. In early November, Chen Lifu presented Pan Hannian with a set of extremely harsh conditions for a deal. Pan balked, calling them &quot;conditions for surrender&quot;. In late November, Chiang ordered the Northeastern Army and forces from the central Nationalist Army, Hu Zongnan&#x27;s Right Route Army, to attack towards the Communist capital at Bao&#x27;an. At the resulting Battle of Shanchengbao, the Northeastern Army withheld most of its forces from the attack. This allowed the Red Army to ambush and nearly wipe out Hu&#x27;s 78th regiment. This reversed the diplomatic situation: Chen Lifu moderated his conditions, but the CCP recalled Pan Hannian from Nanjing on December 10.

The tensions between Zhang and Chiang were reaching a breaking point. On November 23, Chiang ordered the arrest of seven leaders of the National Salvation Association. The move created an outcry across China. Zhang flew to Luoyang and tried to convince Chiang to release the seven prisoners and to form a united front with the CCP against Japan, to no avail. He left feeling that it would be impossible to convince Chiang to join a united front. According to Zhang&#x27;s later account, Yang Hucheng suggested that they should take Chiang hostage in order to force him to agree to a negotiated peace. Yang argued that this was a &quot;bingjian&quot; (), a practice from Chinese history where a subordinate would attempt to force his superior to change his policy. In the rare cases when it had happened, it had been rewarded rather than punished. 

==Events==
===Chiang&#x27;s arrest===
Chiang arrived in Xi&#x27;an on December 4, 1936 in order to make preparations for another assault on the Communists. By this time he was aware through intelligence reports that Zhang had been collaborating with the Communists, but he did not realize that he was in any actual danger. Chiang believed that he could convince Zhang to join his sixth encirclement campaign in earnest. He stayed at the Huaqing Pool complex, an ancient resort located in the town of Lintong, about 10 miles outside Xi&#x27;an. Chiang&#x27;s associates were staying in the city of Xi&#x27;an itself, in the newly built Western Capital Hotel. Once again, Zhang, Yang, and Chiang met to discuss policy. Once again, they reached an impasse. On December 9, 1936, a crowd of tens of thousands of students marched towards Lintong to demand that Chiang end the civil war and resist the Japanese. Chiang demanded that Zhang disperse the crowd or he would have his guards open fire on them. Zhang succeeded by promising them &quot;a definite reply in action within one week.&quot; 

Chiang was scheduled to leave on December 12. At 10 PM on Friday, December 11 Zhang Xueliang ordered Sun Mingjiu (), the captain of his personal guard, to arrest Chiang Kai-shek. According to Sun&#x27;s later account, his orders were to bring Chiang to Xi&#x27;an unharmed. As Sun prepared, Zhang gathered the top officers of the Northeastern and Northwestern Armies to inform them of his decision. He also sent off a telegram to the CCP Central Committee. Mao and the other Central Committee members were surprised but elated by the news. At 5 AM, December 12, Sun Mingjiu led a few hundred soldiers on an assault of the Huaqing Pool complex. They reached the gate at 6 AM, where they were asked for the password. Unable to give it, the began a firefight with Chiang&#x27;s guards. This alerted Chiang to the attack, and he in panic he jumped out of his window in his nightshirt. Without his false teeth or one of his shoes, he fled up the side of a snow-covered mountain, injuring his back in the process. He was discovered a few hours later, shivering and exhausted. Sun carried Chiang down the mountain on his back. He was then driven to Xi&#x27;an in an armored car.

Meanwhile, troops from the Northwestern Army seized important locations around Xi&#x27;an, taking over the government headquarters, the airport, the police station, and the Western Capital Hotel where Chiang&#x27;s associates were staying. The others taken prisoner included (governor of Shaanxi), General Chen Cheng, and General Jiang Dingwen. Chiang was brought to Yang Hucheng&#x27;s headquarters, where Zhang explained that he had kidnapped him in order to force him to change his policies. Chiang was indignant, and after an initial exchange, he refused to speak.

Zhang and Yang sent telegrams to Nanjing and all across China, explaining what they had done and listing eight demands for the government:
=== Reactions ===
In Bao&#x27;an, the CCP was estatic. News had spread overnight through the city. At a mass meeting of all party members and soldiers, Mao proposed that Chiang be put on public trial as a traitor. The measure was approved. The CCP radioed Zhang to tell him that Zhou would go to Xi&#x27;an to discuss the matter. They also advised him to prepare for attacks by the Nationalist central government, and promised that the Red Army would not take advantage of the situation to occupy Northeastern Army territory. They also notified the Comintern of what had occurred and asked permission to form a &quot;revolutionary government of national defense&quot; with Zhang, Yang, and other dissent Nationalists. A meeting of the CCP Central Committee was held on December 13 to discuss the situation in more detail. The vast majority approved the plan to force Chiang to step down and stand trial, and to sentence him to death. They also planned to make Xi&#x27;an the center of a national resistance government. On December 15, the CCP sent a telegram to Nanjing urging them to comply with the Eight Demands, force Chiang to step down, and allow him to be tried. 

Nanjing received word of Chiang&#x27;s arrest by 1 pm on December 12. An emergency meeting of the Central Standing Committee was convened that night. Minister of War He Yingqin forcefully argued for an immediate attack on Xi&#x27;an by ground forces and aerial bombardment to free Chiang. In the end, they agreed to appoint H.H. Kung acting President, Feng Yuxiang head of the Military Affairs Commission, and He Yingqin to be in charge of the military response to the coup. H.H. Kung and Soong Mei-ling, who had been in Shanghai when news reached them, arrived back in Nanjing the following day. Together with T.V. Soong, they formed a &quot;Peace Faction&quot; () opposed to attacking Xi&#x27;an. All three were related to Chiang by blood or marriage, and if he died in an attack, they would lose their influence. Soong Mei-ling even argued that Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s demands were worth hearing out. He Yingqin&#x27;s plan for a swift military response was supported by He Zhonghan, Liu Zhi, and many other army officers. He Yingqin immediately sent a regiment to capture the pass in Tongguan. American journalist James Bertram recalled feeling how another civil war was about to break out, and personally observed fleets of government aircraft flying low over the roofs of Xi&#x27;an. H.H. Kung declared over radio that there would be &quot;no dealings with armed rebellion, no truce with the &#x27;Communist bandits.&#x27;&quot; By mid-December, Nationalist aircraft were bombing the railway line through the Shaanxi mountains, accompanied by a spearhead of several elite divisions from the Central Army. 

News of the abduction spawned a wave of &quot;extraordinarily widespread&quot; popular support for Chiang Kai-Shek, according to an American diplomat. This was paralleled by a surge of reproach directed at Zhang Xueliang by both the Nationalist government and the wider Chinese public, who viewed Zhang&#x27;s actions as treachery. The Northeastern Army had attempted to broadcast their demands to explain why they had seized Chiang, but Nationalist censorship prevented their publication outside the Communist-held areas. 

Of key importance was the reaction of China&#x27;s leaders. Many major figures, including warlord opponents of Chiang like Yan Xishan, were wary of a potential power vacuum that would follow Chiang&#x27;s death or deposition. Chiang&#x27;s ability to control the various factions of the Nationalist government was unique to his leadership and survival. Moreover, Chiang was implacably anti-Japanese, unlike his potential successor Wang Jingwei. This was a factor not lost on a key stakeholder in China, Joseph Stalin.

=== Stalin&#x27;s intervention ===
Moscow received news of Chiang&#x27;s arrest on December 13. The head of the Comintern, Georgi Dimitrov, was delighted. He was preparing to authorize Chiang&#x27;s execution until he read the articles in &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestia&quot; the next morning, which condemned the Xi&#x27;an Incident as a plot by &quot;pro-Japanese elements&quot;. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin made it clear to Dimitrov that he viewed Chiang as indispensable. 

Stalin feared that in Chiang&#x27;s absence, a figure like Wang Jingwei, perhaps assisted by He Yingqin (who had already contacted Wang in Italy after Chiang&#x27;s arrest), would take control of the Nationalists and create a pro-Japanese Chinese regime, placing the Soviet Union in extreme danger of a Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union. His anxieties were confirmed when Chiang&#x27;s rival Wang Jingwei met with Adolf Hitler to discuss the prospect of China enlisting in the anti-Communist Axis in exchange for greater German aid to China. Following the Chiang&#x27;s abduction, Pan Hannian had explained to Stalin that without Chiang, &quot;China would be without a leader to fight the Japanese and this would not benefit the Soviet Union.&quot;

Fearing a possible two-front war with both the Nazis and the Japanese, and potentially a pro-Japanese China in support, Stalin ordered that the CCP settle its disagreement with Chiang peacefully and release him alive. To this end, Zhou Enlai instructed Zhang Xueliang not to harm Chiang in any capacity.

=== Negotiations ===

At first, Chiang refused to formally agree to any demands while held a captive, and appeared fully prepared to accept death rather than submission. This changed when Zhou Enlai, who Chiang had been in secret negotiations with since the summer of that year, arrived in Xi&#x27;an on December 16 to represent the CCP. On December 24, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa Military Academy over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying: &quot;In the ten years since we have met, you seem to have aged very little.&quot; Chiang nodded and said: &quot;Enlai, you were my subordinate. You should do what I say.&quot; Zhou replied that if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang&#x27;s command. 
In their meeting, Chiang and Zhou finalized the secret agreements that had been in tentative form since summer of 1936, where the Communists would accept orders from Chiang in a national unity coalition, and Chiang would allow the Communists to field their own independent army. To the public, it seemed as if Chiang had been compelled into an alliance against the Japanese, but in reality the terms of the arrangement were almost identical to those agreed upon in secret before the kidnapping took place.

At the end of the meeting, Chiang invited Zhou to Nanjing for further talks. Chiang was released on 26 December and returned to Nanjing with Zhang Xueliang.

== Aftermath ==

When Chiang was released, public opinion was decisively in his favor. His arrival to Nanjing was greeted by cheering crowds of over 400,000 people. Edgar Snow declared that Chiang had returned with a national standing &quot;higher than that of any leader in modern Chinese history.&quot;

Historian Jay Taylor writes how Xi&#x27;an turned Chiang from a &quot;popular leader&quot; into a &quot;national hero.&quot; American ambassador Nelson T. Johnson wrote how &quot;Whereas the outstanding developments during the first half of 1936 increased the precariousness of China&#x27;s position, the significant events of the second half, in their larger aspects, have had the opposite effect.&quot; He observed that the Xi&#x27;an crisis &quot;fostered another spontaneous outburst of nationalism throughout the country and caused universal rejoicing when the Generalissimo was released on Christmas Day.&quot; 

=== The Second United Front ===
After Chiang returned to Nanjing, he announced a cease fire in the civil war. However, he also repudiated any promises that he had made in Xi&#x27;an. He had Zhang imprisoned and charged with treason. Chiang then sent 37 army divisions north to surround the Northeastern Army and force them to stand down. The army was deeply divided on the appropriate response. Yang Hucheng and the Anti-Japanese Comrade Society wanted to stand and fight if the KMT army attacked, and refuse to negotiate until Zhang was released. The Communist representatives strongly disagreed and cautioned that civil war would, in the words of Zhou Enlai, &quot;make China into another Spain&quot;.

Further negotiations between the CCP and Nanjing continued. However, when a conference of Northeastern officers in January 1937 overwhelmingly resolved not to surrender peacefully, the CCP reluctantly decided that they could not abandon their allies and pledged to fight alongside them if the KMT attacked. The situation was again reversed when the five most senior Northeastern generals met separately and decided to surrender. The radical officers were enraged and assassinated one of the generals on 2 February, but this only turned the majority of the soldiers against the plan to stand and fight. The Northeastern Army peacefully surrendered to advancing KMT forces and was divided into new units, which were sent to Hebei, Hunan, and Anhui. Yang Hucheng, however, was arrested and eventually executed, while the leaders of the Anti-Japanese Comrade Society defected to the Red Army. Zhang was kept under house arrest for over 50 years before emigrating to Hawaii in 1993.

The rapprochement between the Communists and Nationalists outraged the Japanese, and eventually helped lead to the Second Sino-Japanese War. This in turn hastened the two Chinese factions into formalizing their alliance as the Second United Front.

The Xi&#x27;an Incident was a turning point for the CCP. Chiang&#x27;s leadership over political and military affairs in China was affirmed, while the CCP was able to expand its own strength under the new united front, which played a role in the Chinese Communist Revolution.

== Legacy ==
In present day China, Zhang Xueliang is portrayed as a patriot who was shocked by Chiang&#x27;s unwillingness to face the looming threat of Japan, rather focusing on fighting his fellow Chinese. In this narrative, Zhang kidnapped Chiang to force a change in attitude. Historian Rana Mitter, however, attributes Zhang&#x27;s agenda to a more straightforward motivation: that Chiang was likely to deprive him of military command. To this end, Zhang&#x27;s decision would have been influenced more out of self-preservation over patriotism.

<doc id="155421" wikidata="Q956126" url="?curid=155421" title="Glyn Johns">
<text>Glyn Thomas Johns (born 15 February 1942) is an English recording engineer and record producer. He has worked with many of the most famous rock recording acts from both the UK and abroad, such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Who, Led Zeppelin, the Kinks, Eagles, Bob Dylan, the Band, Eric Clapton, the Clash, Steve Miller Band, Small Faces, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils and Joan Armatrading. Throughout his career, he has generally preferred a live, natural approach to recording in the studio, and developed a method of recording drums sometimes referred to as the &quot;Glyn Johns method&quot;. 

The years 1964–1984 marked Johns&#x27;s peak era of activity in which he engineered or produced numerous hit records. In 1965 Johns became one of the first independent British recording engineers to operate freelance rather than under the hire of a particular record label or studio. He was involved in making some of the most influential albums of the rock era such as &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; by the Rolling Stones, &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; by the Who, and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s debut album. Johns was the chief engineer during the Beatles&#x27; Get Back sessions for what became the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, as documented in the films &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; (2021). Since 1984 Johns has continued to be active in the industry. 

Johns is the father of Ethan Johns, and the older brother of Andy Johns (1950–2013), all three of whom shared the same career. In addition to his work as an engineer and producer, Johns has recorded as a solo musical artist. In 2012, Johns was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, receiving the Award for Musical Excellence.

==Early life==
Johns was born in Epsom, Surrey, England, on 15 February 1942, and is the older brother of Andy Johns. In his autobiography, Glyn Johns recounts that at the age of eight he joined a local church choir as a boy soprano. Felton Rapley, considered one of the leading pipe organists in the UK at the time, became the choirmaster, and as Johns progressed, Johns was given occasional solos and eventually rose to head chorister at the age of eleven. Johns attributes his experience in the choir, particularly hearing and watching Rapley play the organ, as having a profound impact on his musical direction. As he approached adolescence, Johns left the choir after his vocal cords began to change.
Johns recounts that his next-door neighbour lent him a Guild electric guitar, which sparked his interest playing guitar. At this time Johns was attending the church&#x27;s Wednesday night youth club, where for the first time he saw Jimmy Page play guitar. Johns became a fan of traditional jazz and joined a local ragtag jazz band on tea chest bass. He cites the record &quot;Little Rock Getaway&quot; by Les Paul and Mary Ford as an influence. Les Paul was one of the first musicians to experiment with tape multi-tracking and sound effects. Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s skiffle hit version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; was also influential—according to Johns, &quot;I had heard nothing like it and rushed out to buy it the next day&quot;. He soon bought his own guitar and was introduced to blues and folk recordings by a neighbour, who lent him records by artists such as Snooks Eaglin, Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Woody Guthrie, and Burl Ives. Johns began to keep company with a group of friends interested in music, whose ranks included Ian Stewart (later in the Rolling Stones). In 1959 at the age of 17, Johns left school, and with Mayhew and Golding formed the band the Presidents.

==Career in music and recording==
Over a long career as an engineer and/or producer, Johns has worked with numerous successful musical acts in the industry. Johns has also recorded as a solo musical artist.

===Early years: 1959–1963===
====IBC Studios and as performing artist====

In 1959, Johns began his career as an assistant recording engineer at IBC Studios on Portland Place in London. IBC was an independent recording studio and had no affiliation with a label. Johns recounts that his early duties included odd tasks and providing basic support for the experienced engineers. His first session as a recording engineer was for the popular skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan.

At the time IBC had a busy schedule. Coats and ties were required to be worn by recording engineers (and white lab coats for technical engineers). Most recordings were done then in mono (except for classical music). During Johns&#x27;s first year at IBC, the popularity of rock and roll increased and demand for records that sounded more American. Engineers were confronted with the challenge of capturing louder music. Younger engineers were more apt to try new approaches, and Terry Johnson, another young engineer at IBC, convinced Johns to move in this direction. Johns recounts that Jack Good, one of the UK&#x27;s early successful television rock and roll producers, made regular use of IBC Studios, and did many of his recordings with Johns and Johnson engineering sessions. They engineered pre-recorded tracks for the &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; television programme, which featured leading British rock and roll performers of the day, such as Joe Brown, Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, Wee Willie Harris, and others.

Johns recounts that in the early 1960s, he was signed to Decca Records as a solo musical performing artist at the urging of Jack Good. Johns&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sioux Indian&quot;, was produced by Jack Good and the next two produced by Tony Meehan. Johns later went on to record for Pye Records and Immediate Records, but none of his solo records became hits.

During this time, Johns was playing in the Presidents, who, according to Johns, began to put the phrase &quot;Featuring Decca Recording Star Glyn Johns&quot; on their posters. Johns realised that he could invite musicians to IBC on Sundays, when the studio was not booking sessions—letting musicians play in the sound room whilst he honed his engineering and producing skills at the console. The makeshift sessions attracted many of the best young musicians in London, such as Jimmy Page, Ian Stewart, Alexis Korner, Brian Jones, and Nicky Hopkins. Johns recounts that his first session as chief engineer was for a recording by Joe Brown, which was produced by Tony Hatch. In 1962, Johns entered into an arrangement with George Clouston, the manager at IBC studios, to let him produce records by certain artists.

====The Rolling Stones 1962–1963====

Johns&#x27;s friend, Ian Stewart was playing piano with the Rolling Stones. The two lived for a while in a house nicknamed &quot;the Bungalow&quot; with one of Stewart&#x27;s friends, Brian Wiles, who played in a group with Jeff Beck. It was through Stewart that Johns became involved in recording the Rolling Stones on their earliest recordings. Johns mentions that in March 1963, he brought them to IBC to record several tracks. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the Rolling Stones&#x27; manager, Stewart was asked to leave the group, and Oldham took over the role as producer of the group&#x27;s recordings. Oldham moved the Rolling Stones&#x27; sessions to other studios, such as Regent Sound, using other engineers, and for more than a year Johns was not involved with the Rolling Stones recordings.

====As engineer for Shel Talmy====
In 1963, Johns made arrangements to produce and record a session with Georgie Fame, but was paired, only as engineer, with producer Shel Talmy. Initially he was skeptical, but unexpectedly enjoyed working with Talmy, and the two formed a successful partnership on many recordings for the next couple of years, recording hit songs for acts such as the Kinks and the Who.

===Peak years: 1964–1984===
====The Kinks, the Who, and Eric Clapton and as independent====
During the mid 1960s, Johns worked with several of the popular British beat groups of the era. With producer Shel Talmy he engineered many of the early records by the Kinks and the Who, such as &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; by the Kinks, and &quot;My Generation&quot; by the Who.

In 1965, Johns left IBC studios to further pursue his solo career as a singer and performer and promote his latest record &quot;Mary Anne&quot;, but the record failed to chart. At the urging of Talmy, Johns began working freelance as an independent producer and engineer—one of the first independent engineers in the UK. Subsequently, he did sessions at various studios such as Decca, Pye, Marble Arch, and Olympic.

In 1971, Johns reunited with the Who for the first time since the mid-1960s, this time as a co-producer, to work on what became the album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. According to Pete Townshend in his autobiography:

Johns continued to work with the Who throughout the 1970s as an engineer on parts of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in 1973. He produced and engineered &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; (1975) and produced early sessions for &quot;Who Are You&quot; (1978) with engineer John Astley, who later took over as producer. Johns returned to work with the group, producing and engineering 1982&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot;. 

Pete Townshend recruited Johns to engineer &quot;Eric Clapton&#x27;s Rainbow Concert&quot; in 1973. Johns produced and engineered Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1977 album, &quot;Slowhand&quot;, which featured hits such as &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, and his version of J. J. Cale&#x27;s &quot;Cocaine&quot;, and Clapton&#x27;s next album, &quot;Backless&quot; in 1978, which contained another hit &quot;Promises&quot;. In his autobiography Eric Clapton wrote about Johns:

====The Rolling Stones 1965–1975====
Though Johns briefly ceased recording the Rolling Stones in late 1963 and 1964, in 1965 he returned to the role on their British sessions and assisted the group with much of their most famous material. With Johns that year they recorded &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; and the albums &quot;December&#x27;s Children (And Everybody&#x27;s)&quot; and &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;. Johns worked regularly with the Rolling Stones as engineer for the remainder of the decade and into the mid-1970s—from &quot;December&#x27;s Children (And Everybody&#x27;s)&quot; (1965) through to &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1975).

Starting with the sessions for &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; in late 1966, Johns and the Rolling Stones began to record extensively at Olympic Studios. Olympic Studios became Johns&#x27;s preferred studio for many years, and it became one of the most in-demand recording facilities in England.
In 1968 the Rolling Stones expressed the desire to work with an American producer and Johns recommended Jimmy Miller, who he had seen working with Traffic. Johns stayed on as engineer, and with this team the group recorded &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (1968) and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1969). Glyn Johns engineered some of the tracks on &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971), and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972), both produced by Jimmy Miller. On these two albums his brother, Andy Johns, also worked as an engineer. His brother engineered &quot;Goat&#x27;s Head Soup&quot;, the last Rolling Stones album produced by Jimmy Miller. Glyn Johns contributed to certain tracks on &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, and returned as chief recording engineer on the early sessions for &quot;Black and Blue&quot;.

====The Small Faces, the Faces, Humble Pie, and Ronnie Lane and Pete Townshend====
In the 1960s, Johns engineered many of the records made by the Small Faces, such as &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot; &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;, their 1967 hit, &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, which featured the use of bizarre phasing effects Johns learned from another Olympic engineer, George Chkiantz. Johns engineered the Small Faces&#x27; 1968 LP, &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot;.

After the group&#x27;s breakup, guitarist and lead vocalist Steve Marriot formed Humble Pie, whose membership included Peter Frampton—Johns produced engineered their third and fourth albums, &quot;Humble Pie&quot; and &quot;Rock On&quot;. The other former Small Faces, Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones, joined with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, both from Jeff Beck Group to form the Faces, and Johns engineered and co-produced (with the band) the albums &quot;A Nod Is as Good as a Wink... to a Blind Horse&quot; and &quot;Ooh La La&quot;. During the 1970s, after leaving the Faces, Ronnie Lane worked on several projects including the &quot;Rough Mix&quot; album with Pete Townshend, which was produced by Glyn Johns. Lane began to experience health problems and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In 1983, Eric Clapton and Johns helped organize the ARMS Charity Concerts to raise money for Lane&#x27;s medical bills and research for the disease, and assembled a cast of musicians for the show, which included Clapton, Jimmy Page, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Steve Winwood and others.

====Led Zeppelin====

Johns engineered Led Zeppelin&#x27;s debut album recorded in October 1968. Though Jimmy Page was credited as producer, Johns was involved in the production during the making of the album. According to Johns, when working on the album, he developed his method of using three microphones to record drums for stereo mixes.

====The Beatles====

Glyn Johns worked as the chief recording engineer on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, which were both taped and filmed. The project resulted the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album and &quot;Let it Be&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; (2021) documentary films. In 1969, Paul McCartney called Johns and asked him to assist with sessions. George Martin, though officially listed as the producer, only made occasional appearances. During taping and shooting, John Lennon in jest referred to him as &quot;Glynis&quot; (referring to the apparently unrelated actress Glynis Johns).

According to Johns, he suggested the band play a concert on the rooftop of their Apple Studio facility, where much of the sessions were being recorded and filmed, and rigged the recording wires onto the rooftop connected to control room for the performance. He also recommended that the album be structured as an &quot;audio documentary&quot; with talk and banter included between each track. Johns helped the band compile several versions of the album, all of which got shelved before the project was turned over to producer Phil Spector in 1970, who reworked it and released it as the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

Johns engineered early recorded parts of the song &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; at Trident Studios on 23 February 1969, that in later finished form appeared on the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album. For &quot;Abbey Road&quot; remaining tracks, the group returned to EMI Studios and re-united with producer George Martin and a team of engineers including Geoff Emerick, Phil McDonald, and Alan Parsons.

Johns assisted with early sessions of Paul McCartney and Wings&#x27; &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;. Johns quit the project due to what he described as his lack of satisfaction with the material.

====Procol Harum, Joe Cocker, the Move, and the Easybeats and others====

Johns also worked with other British acts such as Procol Harum, Joe Cocker, the Move, and Fairport Convention. He engineered several songs by Australia&#x27;s the Easybeats, including their 1967 hit &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;, which was produced by Shel Talmy. Johns worked with the French musician Johnny Hallyday.

====The Steve Miller Band, Bob Dylan, the Band, the Eagles====
In the late 1960s and 1970s, Johns was in demand on both sides of the Atlantic and worked with American acts such as the Steve Miller Band, and the Eagles. Johns did his first work with an American act in 1968 with the Steve Miller Band, whom he had seen perform live at the Fillmore in San Francisco. The group came to England to record their debut album, &quot;Children of the Future&quot;, at Olympic with Johns as engineer. 
During the sessions, Johns assumed the role of producer. Johns produced and engineered their next three albums, &quot;Sailor,&quot; &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and &quot;Your Saving Grace&quot;.
At the request of producer Bob Johnston, Johns engineered the live recordings of Bob Dylan&#x27;s performance backed by the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969, some of which appeared on his 1970 &quot;Self Portrait&quot; album. He later produced and engineered Dylan&#x27;s 1984 live album, &quot;Real Live&quot;. Johns also did one of the mixes for the Band&#x27;s &quot;Stage Fright&quot; in 1970.

Johns engineered and produced the Eagles&#x27; first three albums, bringing them to Olympic Studios in London to record their self-titled debut, followed by &quot;Desperado&quot;, and the early sessions for &quot;On the Border&quot;. During these years they achieved success, recording hits such as &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, and &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, which became their first number one hit single. Increasingly the group began to develop internal friction and with Johns. They also objected to Johns&#x27; ban on use of drugs in the studio. By 1974, singer/guitarist Glenn Frey and drummer/vocalist Don Henley gained control of the band, and sought a more hard-rocking approach. Johns, who preferred their early country-rock orientation, fell out of favour with the group and left during the making of &quot;On the Border&quot;, so they moved the sessions to California and brought in producer/engineer Bill Szymczyk to finish the album. Eventually, Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon departed, and the band recruited Don Felder and former James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh.

====Other American acts====
Johns engineered and co-produced the first two albums by the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, which provided the hits &quot;If You Wanna Get to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Jackie Blue&quot;. Johns worked with others such as Spooky Tooth, Billy Preston, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Johns engineered the song &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; on Neil Young&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Harvest&quot; album. Johns has also worked with Emmylou Harris.

====Joan Armatrading====

After assessing the disappointing sales of Joan Armatrading&#x27;s second album, A&amp;M Records selected Johns to produce her next three albums, beginning in 1976 with &quot;Joan Armatrading&quot;, followed by &quot;Show Some Emotion&quot; (1977), and &quot;To the Limit&quot; (1978). Providing Armatrading with her first chart hit, &quot;Love and Affection&quot;, the eponymous third album cemented her career, and was once described by Johns as his best work.

====The Clash====
In 1982, Johns worked with the Clash during the late stages of making the album &quot;Combat Rock&quot;. Initially it was intended to be a double album tentatively under the working title &quot;Rat Patrol from Fort Brag&quot;. The group&#x27;s chief songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer disagreed on how to proceed, and according to Johns even booked separate studios in New York to do their own competing mixes of the album. According to Clash biographer Marcus Gray, the group&#x27;s manager Bernie Rhodes, pushed to bring in either Gus Dudgeon, who had produced Elton John, or Glyn Johns. Johns recounts that the chief of London&#x27;s CBS Records A &amp; R department, Muff Winwood (brother of musician Steve Winwood), having been dissatisfied with Jones&#x27; and Strummer&#x27;s mixes, asked Johns to remix the album. Johns agreed and, upon hearing an acetate of one of the previous mixes, was concerned about the record&#x27;s apparent self-indulgence, but was also impressed with many of its tracks and realised that there was enough strong material to make a good album. Johns recommended that the album be shortened to one disc, and proceeded to reduce the number of tracks for inclusion, plus he edited down the length of several tracks in addition to remixing all of the songs that ended up on the final release.

===1985–present===
Though Johns&#x27;s output slowed in the mid-1980s, he undertook work with Midnight Oil, Nanci Griffith, Belly, New Model Army, Joe Satriani, John Hiatt, Buckacre, Gallagher and Lyle, Georgie Fame, Helen Watson, and many others. Johns produced much of Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s 1998 &quot;We Ran&quot; album.

In 2011, after a number of years spent largely away from production, Johns worked with Ryan Adams on his album, &quot;Ashes &amp; Fire&quot;. In February 2012, Johns began work on the Band of Horses album, &quot;Mirage Rock&quot;. Johns and Clapton collaborated once again for Clapton&#x27;s 2016 release &quot;I Still Do&quot;.

==Approach to recording==

Johns has stated that he prefers, when possible, to record instrumental tracks with musicians playing together live in the studio as a collective unit, using a limited number of microphones and tracks—in a space suitable for ensemble playing that has unique acoustical characteristics, and he generally prefers recording the basic track from one continuous take of a whole performance, rather than editing together different pieces.
::&quot;I have never lost the value of musicians interacting with one another as they play. This can be so subtle and invariably is nothing more than a subconscious emotive reaction to what others are playing around you, with what you are contributing having the same effect on them. When a musician overdubs his or her part onto an existing track, this ceases to be a two-way interaction.

Johns developed an approach for recording drums in stereo, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Glyn Johns Method&quot;, that aims to achieve a natural perspective of the whole kit, rarely employing more than three or four microphones. His method consists of using two overhead microphones, with one placed over the snare drum and the other slightly over and to the right of the floor tom (both pointed towards and equidistant from the snare drum), as well as a third microphone set in front of the bass drum. He sometimes uses an additional close mic for the snare drum.

==Family==
Glyn Johns is the older brother of the producer and engineer Andy Johns (1950–2013), who began as an engineer with Jimi Hendrix under the tutelage of Eddie Kramer, and like Glyn Johns, worked with the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. Glyn Johns has two older sisters.

With Glyn Johns&#x27;s first wife Sylvia, Johns had two children, including a son Ethan Johns, who is a producer and engineer who has worked with artists such as Paul McCartney, Kings of Leon, and like his father Ryan Adams, as well as a daughter Abigail Johns.

Glyn Johns is the uncle of the blues musician Will Johns (son of Andy Johns).

==Legacy==
Glyn Johns is recognized as one of the pre-eminent audio engineers and record producers of the rock era. On 14 April 2012, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. He received an Award for Musical Excellence and was honoured for his work on landmark recordings by many famous artists. He was also the winner of the 2013 Music Producers Guild Inspiration Award.

Johns has written an autobiography titled &quot;Sound Man&quot;, published by Blue Rider Press on 13 November 2014, in which he recounts his experiences working with the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Who, the Eagles, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and others.

<text>Donald Kenneth Woods (February 5, 1928 – June 12, 2012) was an American meteorologist and cartoonist. He was the first television weatherman in Oklahoma to hold a degree in meteorology. He started his Oklahoma career in 1954 on KTUL, the ABC affiliate television station originally licensed to Muskogee and to Tulsa after 1957. He used a cartoon character called Gusty during his weather forecasts every night, drawing on-air, with a reference to recent weather as the focus of his simple line-drawn character.

Woods used Gusty to demonstrate how to be weather smart during thunderstorm and tornado activity. At various times, Gusty would also be drawn swimming, fishing, water skiing, or playing American football. Gusty was a responsible individual — raking leaves in the fall, mowing the grass in the summer, or sometimes just relaxing with a good book.

Every night during the weather forecast, Woods would announce a winner for that night&#x27;s original Gusty. The Gusty drawings became one of the longest promotions for KTUL, lasting from the mid-1950s until Woods&#x27;s retirement in 1989. Gusty drawings are installed in Tulsa&#x27;s Gilcrease Museum and the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. The Gusty character also became a fixture at KTUL&#x27;s sister station KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas, where beginning in 1972 Gusty was drawn by station weathermen Vic Shedler, Ron Sherman, Tom McBee, and Chuck Gaidica.

Woods&#x27;s work was part of a 2010 exhibition on Oklahoma cartoonists at the Oklahoma History Center.

Woods has received numerous local, state, and national awards and recognitions. Woods taught at Tulsa Community College for a time. In April 2005, Gusty was named Oklahoma&#x27;s state cartoon.

On June 12, 2012, Woods died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 84.

<doc id="155430" wikidata="Q2634506" url="?curid=155430" title="Kleene algebra">
<text>In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a Kleene algebra ( ; named after Stephen Cole Kleene) is a semiring that generalizes the theory of regular expressions: it consists of a set supporting union (addition), concatenation (multiplication), and Kleene star operations subject to certain algebraic laws. The addition is required to be idempotent (formula_1 for all formula_2), and induces a partial order defined by formula_3 if formula_4. The Kleene star operation, denoted formula_5, must satisfy the laws of the closure operator.

Kleene algebras have their origins in the theory of regular expressions and regular languages introduced by Kleene in 1951 and studied by others including V.N. Redko and John Horton Conway. The term was introduced by Dexter Kozen in the 1980s, who fully characterized their algebraic properties and, in 1994, gave a finite axiomatization.

Kleene algebras have a number of extensions that have been studied, including Kleene algebras with tests (KAT) introduced by Kozen in 1997. Kleene algebras and Kleene algebras with tests have applications in formal verification of computer programs. They have also been applied to specify and verify computer networks.

== Definition ==

Various inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras and related structures have been given in the literature. Here we will give the definition that seems to be the most common nowadays.

A Kleene algebra is a set &quot;A&quot; together with two binary operations + : &quot;A&quot; × &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; and · : &quot;A&quot; × &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; and one function * : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot;, written as &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;, &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;a&quot;* respectively, so that the following axioms are satisfied.
* Associativity of + and ·: &quot;a&quot; + (&quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) + &quot;c&quot; and &quot;a&quot;(&quot;bc&quot;) = (&quot;ab&quot;)&quot;c&quot; for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.
* Commutativity of +: &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;b&quot; + &quot;a&quot; for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;A&quot;
* Distributivity: &quot;a&quot;(&quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;) = (&quot;ab&quot;) + (&quot;ac&quot;) and (&quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;)&quot;a&quot; = (&quot;ba&quot;) + (&quot;ca&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in &quot;A&quot;
* Identity elements for + and ·: There exists an element 0 in &quot;A&quot; such that for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;: &quot;a&quot; + 0 = 0 + &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;. There exists an element 1 in &quot;A&quot; such that for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;: &quot;a&quot;1 = 1&quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;.
* Annihilation by 0: &quot;a&quot;0 = 0&quot;a&quot; = 0 for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.
The above axioms define a semiring. We further require:
* + is idempotent: &quot;a&quot; + &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.
It is now possible to define a partial order ≤ on &quot;A&quot; by setting &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; if and only if &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;b&quot; (or equivalently: &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; if and only if there exists an &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; + &quot;x&quot; = &quot;b&quot;; with any definition, &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; implies &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;). With this order we can formulate the last four axioms about the operation *:
* 1 + &quot;a&quot;(&quot;a&quot;*) ≤ &quot;a&quot;* for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.
* 1 + (&quot;a&quot;*)&quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;* for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.
* if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are in &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;ax&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;a&quot;*&quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;
* if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are in &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;xa&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;x&quot;(&quot;a&quot;*) ≤ &quot;x&quot; 

Intuitively, one should think of &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; as the &quot;union&quot; or the &quot;least upper bound&quot; of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and of &quot;ab&quot; as some multiplication which is monotonic, in the sense that &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;ax&quot; ≤ &quot;bx&quot;. The idea behind the star operator is &quot;a&quot;* = 1 + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;aa&quot; + &quot;aaa&quot; + ... From the standpoint of programming language theory, one may also interpret + as &quot;choice&quot;, · as &quot;sequencing&quot; and * as &quot;iteration&quot;.

== Examples ==
Let Σ be a finite set (an &quot;alphabet&quot;) and let &quot;A&quot; be the set of all regular expressions over Σ. We consider two such regular expressions equal if they describe the same language. Then &quot;A&quot; forms a Kleene algebra. In fact, this is a free Kleene algebra in the sense that any equation among regular expressions follows from the Kleene algebra axioms and is therefore valid in every Kleene algebra.

Again let Σ be an alphabet. Let &quot;A&quot; be the set of all regular languages over Σ (or the set of all context-free languages over Σ; or the set of all recursive languages over Σ; or the set of &quot;all&quot; languages over Σ). Then the union (written as +) and the concatenation (written as ·) of two elements of &quot;A&quot; again belong to &quot;A&quot;, and so does the Kleene star operation applied to any element of &quot;A&quot;. We obtain a Kleene algebra &quot;A&quot; with 0 being the empty set and 1 being the set that only contains the empty string.

Let &quot;M&quot; be a monoid with identity element &quot;e&quot; and let &quot;A&quot; be the set of all subsets of &quot;M&quot;. For two such subsets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, let &quot;S&quot; + &quot;T&quot; be the union of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; and set &quot;ST&quot; = {&quot;st&quot; : &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;t&quot; in &quot;T&quot;}. &quot;S&quot;* is defined as the submonoid of &quot;M&quot; generated by &quot;S&quot;, which can be described as {&quot;e&quot;} ∪ &quot;S&quot; ∪ &quot;SS&quot; ∪ &quot;SSS&quot; ∪ ... Then &quot;A&quot; forms a Kleene algebra with 0 being the empty set and 1 being {&quot;e&quot;}. An analogous construction can be performed for any small category.

The linear subspaces of a unital algebra over a field form a Kleene algebra. Given linear subspaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, define &quot;V&quot; + &quot;W&quot; to be the sum of the two subspaces, and 0 to be the trivial subspace {0}. Define , the linear span of the product of vectors from &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively. Define , the span of the unit of the algebra. The closure of &quot;V&quot; is the direct sum of all powers of &quot;V&quot;.

formula_6

Suppose &quot;M&quot; is a set and &quot;A&quot; is the set of all binary relations on &quot;M&quot;. Taking + to be the union, · to be the composition and * to be the reflexive transitive closure, we obtain a Kleene algebra.

Every Boolean algebra with operations formula_7 and formula_8 turns into a Kleene algebra if we use formula_7 for +, formula_8 for · and set &quot;a&quot;* = 1 for all &quot;a&quot;.

A quite different Kleene algebra can be used to implement the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, computing the shortest path&#x27;s length for every two vertices of a weighted directed graph, by Kleene&#x27;s algorithm, computing a regular expression for every two states of a deterministic finite automaton.
Using the extended real number line, take &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; to be the minimum of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;ab&quot; to be the ordinary sum of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; (with the sum of +∞ and −∞ being defined as +∞). &quot;a&quot;* is defined to be the real number zero for nonnegative &quot;a&quot; and −∞ for negative &quot;a&quot;. This is a Kleene algebra with zero element +∞ and one element the real number zero. 
A weighted directed graph can then be considered as a deterministic finite automaton, with each transition labelled by its weight.
For any two graph nodes (automaton states), the regular expressions computed from Kleene&#x27;s algorithm evaluates, in this particular Kleene algebra, to the shortest path length between the nodes.

== Properties ==

Zero is the smallest element: 0 ≤ &quot;a&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.

The sum &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; is the least upper bound of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;: we have &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; and if &quot;x&quot; is an element of &quot;A&quot; with &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. Similarly, &quot;a&quot;1 + ... + &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the least upper bound of the elements &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Multiplication and addition are monotonic: if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, then 
* &quot;a&quot; + &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;x&quot;, 
* &quot;ax&quot; ≤ &quot;bx&quot;, and 
* &quot;xa&quot; ≤ &quot;xb&quot; 
for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.

Regarding the star operation, we have 
* 0* = 1 and 1* = 1, 
* &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;a&quot;* ≤ &quot;b&quot;* (monotonicity),
* &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;* for every natural number &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is defined as &quot;n&quot;-fold multiplication of &quot;a&quot;,
* (&quot;a&quot;*)(&quot;a&quot;*) = &quot;a&quot;*,
* (&quot;a&quot;*)* = &quot;a&quot;*, 
* 1 + &quot;a&quot;(&quot;a&quot;*) = &quot;a&quot;* = 1 + (&quot;a&quot;*)&quot;a&quot;, 
* &quot;ax&quot; = &quot;xb&quot; implies (&quot;a&quot;*)&quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;b&quot;*),
* ((&quot;ab&quot;)*)&quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;((&quot;ba&quot;)*),
* (&quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot;)* = &quot;a&quot;*(&quot;b&quot;(&quot;a&quot;*))*, and
* &quot;pq&quot; = 1 = &quot;qp&quot; implies &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;*)&quot;p&quot; = (&quot;qap&quot;)*.

If &quot;A&quot; is a Kleene algebra and &quot;n&quot; is a natural number, then one can consider the set M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) consisting of all &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices with entries in &quot;A&quot;.
Using the ordinary notions of matrix addition and multiplication, one can define a unique *-operation so that M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) becomes a Kleene algebra.

== History ==

Kleene introduced regular expressions and gave some of their algebraic laws.
Although he didn&#x27;t define Kleene algebras, he asked for a decision procedure for equivalence of regular expressions.
Redko proved that no finite set of &quot;equational&quot; axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.
Salomaa gave complete axiomatizations of this algebra, however depending on problematic inference rules.
The problem of providing a complete set of axioms, which would allow derivation of all equations among regular expressions, was intensively studied by John Horton Conway under the name of &quot;regular algebras&quot;, however, the bulk of his treatment was infinitary.
In 1981, Kozen gave a complete infinitary equational deductive system for the algebra of regular languages.
In 1994, he gave the above finite axiom system, which uses unconditional and conditional equalities (considering &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;b&quot;), and is equationally complete for the algebra of regular languages, that is, two regular expressions &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; denote the same language only if &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; follows from the above axioms.

== Generalization (or relation to other structures) ==
Kleene algebras are a particular case of closed semirings, also called quasi-regular semirings or Lehmann semirings, which are semirings in which every element has at least one quasi-inverse satisfying the equation: &quot;a&quot;* = &quot;aa&quot;* + 1 = &quot;a&quot;*&quot;a&quot; + 1. This quasi-inverse is not necessarily unique. In a Kleene algebra, &quot;a&quot;* is the least solution to the fixpoint equations: &quot;X&quot; = &quot;aX&quot; + 1 and &quot;X&quot; = &quot;Xa&quot; + 1.

Closed semirings and Kleene algebras appear in algebraic path problems, a generalization of the shortest path problem.

<text>A by-election, also known as a special election in the United States and the Philippines, or a bypoll in India, is an election used to fill an office that has become vacant between general elections.

A vacancy may arise as a result of an incumbent dying or resigning, or when the incumbent becomes ineligible to continue in office (because of a recall, a prohibited dual mandate, criminal conviction, or failure to maintain a minimum attendance), or when an election is invalidated by voting irregularities. In some cases a vacancy may be filled by a method other than a by-election (such as the outgoing member&#x27;s party nominating a replacement) or the office may be left vacant. These elections can be held anytime in the country. 

An election to fill a vacancy created when a general election cannot take place in a particular constituency (such as if a candidate dies shortly before election day) may be called a by-election in some jurisdictions, or may have a distinct name (&quot;e.g.&quot;, supplementary election, as in Australia).

== Origins ==

The procedure for filling a vacant seat in the House of Commons of England was developed during the Reformation Parliament of the 16th century by Thomas Cromwell; previously a seat had remained empty upon the death of a member. Cromwell devised a new election that would be called by the king at a time of the king&#x27;s choosing. This made it a simple matter to ensure the seat rewarded an ally of the crown.

During the eighteen-year Cavalier Parliament of Charles II, which lasted from 1661 to 1679, by-elections were the primary means by which new members entered the House of Commons.

== In single-member constituencies ==

By-elections are held in most nations that elect their parliaments through single-member constituencies, whether with or without a runoff round. This includes most Commonwealth countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as non-Commonwealth countries such as France and Italy (until 2006). However, in some cases, such as the French National Assembly, by-elections are only used to fill some vacancies, with the others being filled by the assumption of a seat by a running mate nominated by the vacator.

In the United States, these contests have been called &quot;special elections&quot; because they do not always occur on Election Day like regular congressional elections. Special elections are held when a seat in the House of Representatives, state legislature, or local legislature becomes vacant. At the federal level, the U.S. Constitution requires that vacancies in the House of Representatives be filled with a special election (unlike the Senate, where it is up to law of the state involved to determine how the vacancy is filled). In most cases where a vacancy is filled through a special election, a primary will also be held to determine which candidates will represent the major parties.

== In multi-member constituencies ==

When one seat in a multi-member constituency becomes vacant, the consequences vary. For example, a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy, all the seats in the constituency could be contested in the by-election, or the vacancy could be filled by other means.

Typically, party-list proportional representation systems do not hold by-elections. Instead, the most successful unelected candidate named on the vacator&#x27;s list fills the vacancy automatically. However, Turkey is an exception, as it holds by-elections when too many seats become vacant in the parliament (as in 1986) or a repeat vote has to be held (as in 2003).

In multi-member district systems that do not employ party lists – single transferable vote, single non-transferable vote and plurality at-large – vacancies may be filled by a by-election. This is done, for example, in the Dáil of the Republic of Ireland (STV), in the Parliament of Vanuatu (SNTV), and in the Senate of the Philippines (Pl. AL). In those systems, alternatives to holding a by-election include:

# re-determining the election results with the vacators disregarded, as in Tasmania or the Australian Capital Territory,
# keeping the seat vacant until the next general election. This usually occurs if a vacancy arises shortly before a planned general election (within six months in New Zealand).
# nominating another candidate with the same affiliation as the former member, such as European Parliament seats in the Republic of Ireland.

For the Australian Senate (in which each state forms a multi-member constituency elected via single transferable vote), the state parliament appoints a replacement in the event of a vacancy; in 1977 a referendum amended the Constitution to require that the person appointed must belong to the same political party (if any) as the Senator originally elected to that seat. The states with an upper house elected via STV (NSW, Victoria, and South Australia) use the same method, except for Western Australia, which holds a recount of ballots to determine the new winner, with sitting members retaining their seats.

== In mixed systems ==

Mixed-member proportional representation, additional member, and parallel voting systems, in which some members are chosen by party lists and some from single-member constituencies, usually hold by-elections to fill a vacancy in a constituency seat; for example, the assassination of Shinzo Abe resulted in a by-election in Yamaguchi&#x27;s 4th district, which Abe represented in the House of Representatives of Japan (elected under parallel voting). If a vacancy arises in a party list seat, it would be filled in the manner usual for party-list proportional systems; for example, on the resignation of Darren Hughes from the Parliament of New Zealand in March 2011, Louisa Wall filled the seat after all the five candidates above her on the New Zealand Labour Party&#x27;s list declined it.

Exceptions to this rule exist: In the German Bundestag, which uses mixed-member proportional representation, by-elections were originally held upon the vacancy of any constituency seat. This was changed in January 1953, since which time vacancies in constituency seats have been filled by the next candidate on the state list of the party which won the seat, in the same manner as vacancies among list seats. Confusingly, this change occurred alongside a switch from mixed single vote, where a single set of votes was used for both constituency and list seats, to a conventional two-vote mixed member proportional system - a change which granted constituency members an electoral mandate distinct from the party&#x27;s list seats. By-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it – typically, if the former member was elected as an independent. This is referred to as a substitute election (&quot;Ersatzwahl&quot;). Since no independents have been elected to the Bundestag since the first legislative period, no such substitute election has ever taken place.

== Significance and consequences ==

=== Direct effects ===

By-elections can be crucial when the ruling party has only a small majority. In parliamentary systems, party discipline is often so strong that the governing party or coalition can only lose a vote of no confidence after losing enough supporters, whether by floor-crossing or through losing by-elections, for it to become a minority government. Examples are the Labour government of James Callaghan 1976–1979 and Conservative government of John Major 1992–1997. In the United States Senate, Scott Brown&#x27;s election in 2010 ended the filibuster-proof supermajority formerly enjoyed by Democrats.

By-elections can also be important if a minority party needs to gain one or more seats in order to gain official party status or the balance of power in a minority or coalition situation. For example, Andrea Horwath&#x27;s win in an Ontario provincial by-election in 2004 allowed the Ontario New Democratic Party to regain official party status with important results in terms of parliamentary privileges and funding.

In Australia, a by-election in 1996 in the Queensland state electoral district of Mundingburra overturned the results of the 1995 state election. In that election, held in July 1995, Wayne Goss and his Labor Party had won by a slim 45-seat majority in a 89-seat parliament. The seat of Mundingburra had been awarded to the Labor Party on the basis of a majority of 16 votes. However, in December 1995 the Court of Disputed Returns threw out the result in Mundingburra after it was found that 22 overseas military personnel had been denied the chance to vote. Consequently, a by-election for Mundingburra was held in February 1996, in which the electorate was won by the opposition Liberal Party, pushing the Goss government into minority. A vote of no confidence in the government was then passed by the opposition, with the support of Independent Liz Cunningham. After the no confidence vote, Rob Borbidge the leader of the Nationals the senior partner in the coalition became premier until his government&#x27;s defeat in the 1998 state election.

=== Predictive value ===
Non-experts often interpret by-election results as a bellwether or early indicator of the results of the next general election, but political scientists generally caution against overinterpretation. The evidence suggests that while the margin of victory relative to the district&#x27;s normal performance may be relevant, other indicators generally provide stronger evidence with a larger sample size.

A 2016 study of special elections to the United States House of Representatives found &quot;that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes, presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well. Furthermore, we find that the effect of presidential approval on special election outcomes has increased in magnitude from 1995 to 2014, with the 2002 midterm representing an important juncture in the nationalization of special elections.&quot;

Seats which have unexpectedly changed hands in by-elections often revert to the former party in the next general election. One reason for this is that voter turnout at by-elections tends to be lower and skewed toward highly motivated supporters of the opposition party.

=== Indirect impact ===

By-election upsets can have a psychological impact by creating a sense of momentum for one party or a sense of impending defeat for a government. For example, in Canada, Deborah Grey&#x27;s 1989 by-election victory in Beaver River was seen as evidence that the newly formed Reform Party of Canada would be a serious political contender and that it posed a serious political threat for the ruling Progressive Conservatives. Similarly, the upset 1960 by-election victory of Walter Pitman in Peterborough as a &quot;New Party&quot; candidate was a significant boost for the movement to replace the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation with an unnamed &quot;New Party&quot; which would be integrated with the labour movement. Pitman&#x27;s candidacy in a riding in which the CCF was traditionally weak was seen as a test of this concept, and his upset victory convinced the CCF and the labour movement to launch the New Democratic Party (NDP). Gilles Duceppe&#x27;s 1990 upset landslide by-election victory in Laurier—Sainte-Marie with 66% of the vote on behalf of the newly formed Bloc Québécois was the first electoral test for what was initially a loose parliamentary formation created two months earlier after several Quebec MPs defected from the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties to protest the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and provided the first indication that the party could be a serious force in the province of Quebec. On the strength of the by-election victory, the BQ went on to be officially formed as a party in 1991 and win 54 seats in the 1993 federal election, enough to form the Official Opposition.

By-elections may occur singly or in small bunches, especially if the authority responsible for calling them has discretion over the timing and can procrastinate. They are sometimes bunched to save money, as holding multiple by-elections is likely to cost more than holding a by-election to fill the vacancies all at once. In Canada, in 1978, 15 by-elections were held on a single date, restoring the House of Commons to 264 members. The media called it a &quot;mini-election&quot;, a test of the Liberal government&#x27;s popularity with a general election due in less than a year. In Hong Kong, in January 2010, five members of the Legislative Council from the Pro-democracy camp, one from each of Hong Kong&#x27;s five geographical constituencies, resigned and stood in simultaneous by-elections, at which the entire electorate would participate, in an attempt to stage a de facto referendum on democratizing the Hong Kong political system. The effect of the manoeuvre was blunted when the Pro-Beijing camp refused to stand candidates against them.

=== Upsets ===

==== Australia ====

The 1918 Swan by-election was held following the death of John Forrest. The seat was traditionally a safe seat for the Nationalist Party against the Labor Party, but the emergence of the Country Party lead to a &quot;three-cornered contest&quot;. As Australia used a first-past-the-post system at the time, the conservative vote was split between the Country and Nationalists, allowing Labor candidate Edwin Corboy to come in first place and win the seat. The Swan by-election is cited as the reason for the introduction of preferential voting, to prevent Labor from benefiting from a divided opposition in the future.

The 2018 Wentworth by-election was held after the resignation of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who had served as the member for Wentworth since 2004. Wentworth was considered an exceptionally safe seat for the Liberal Party, as it had only ever been held by the Liberal Party and its predecessor parties since its creation in 1901. Former Ambassador to Israel Dave Sharma was preselected as the Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate for the by-election. The major challenger in the by-election was independent candidate Kerryn Phelps. A huge 17.7% two-party-preferred swing was required for the Liberal Party to lose the seat. Ultimately, the Liberals suffered a 19.0% swing to Phelps, the largest by-election swing in Australian history, which won her the seat. This loss deprived the Liberal Party of its majority in federal Parliament, forcing them into a minority government.

==== Canada ====
In 1942, the Conservatives&#x27; Arthur Meighen (who had already served as Prime Minister during the 1920s) sought to re-enter the House of Commons of Canada through a by-election in York South. His surprise defeat at the hand of Joseph Noseworthy of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ended his political career, and may also have been a factor in the Conservative Party&#x27;s decision to move to the left and rebrand itself the Progressive Conservative Party under Meighen&#x27;s replacement. Noseworthy&#x27;s victory was also a significant breakthrough for the CCF giving it credibility as a national party where it has previously been seen as a Western Canadian regional protest party.

On November 1, 1944, General Andrew McNaughton was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Defence without having a seat in parliament, after his predecessor resigned during the Conscription Crisis of 1944. A by-election was arranged in Grey North which the opposition Progressive Conservative party contested. The major campaign issue became the government&#x27;s policy of &quot;limited conscription&quot; during World War II, which McNaughton supported, and which the Conservatives rejected. They called, instead, for &quot;full conscription&quot;. McNaughton was defeated in the February 1945 by-election. As a result, with confidence in his government undermined, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King called the 1945 federal election several weeks later; originally he had intended to postpone the election until the war was clearly won. McNaughton sought a seat in the 1945 contest but was again defeated, and resigned shortly after.

The most recent example of a cabinet minister appointed from outside parliament having to resign after losing a by-election was in 1975, when Minister of Communications Pierre Juneau was appointed to Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal cabinet directly from the private sector, and tried to enter parliament through a by-election in Hochelaga. Juneau unexpectedly lost to the Progressive Conservative candidate and resigned from cabinet 10 days after his by-election defeat.

In Ontario, John Tory, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario ran in a 2009 by-election in Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock, after he convinced one of his caucus members to step down, in hopes of re-entering the Ontario legislature. His by-election defeat resulted in his resignation as party leader.

==== Hong Kong ====

In the March 2018 Hong Kong by-elections, the pro-democracy camp lost their majority status for the first time in the Geographical constituency part of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong By-elections were held after six pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified by the High Court of Hong Kong during the oath-taking controversy. The pro-democracy camp was considered safe in the de facto first past the post by-election because both pro-democracy camp and pro-Beijing camp would only nominate one candidate to fill in the by-election. However, the pro-democracy camp lost twice in Kowloon West, which had been considered a safe seat for them.

==== Singapore ====
Under Article 49(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, a by-election should be called for any vacancy arising from a constituency—particularly Single Member Constituency—within a reasonable time period. Since the introduction of partial self-governance in 1955, 34 by-elections have been held, and some have been major upsets:
* In the 1957 Cairnhill by-election, the then-ruling Labour Front government saw its vote collapse to 19.23% from 47.58% in the previous general election.
* Each by-election in 1961 was important for the survival of the ruling party&#x27;s small majority.
** After being dismissed as the Minister for National Development, Ong Eng Guan resigned his seat. Standing in the 1961 by-election in Hong Lim as an independent, he polled 73.31% of the vote, the largest loss of votes for an incumbent party in a by-election.
** The 1961 by-election in Anson saw a comeback by the opposition leader, the Workers&#x27; Party Chairperson and former Chief Minister, David Marshall.
* In the 1981 Anson by-election, the Workers&#x27; Party Secretary-General J. B. Jeyaretnam broke the ruling PAP&#x27;s monopoly in Parliament, marking the first opposition presence since 1966 and the re-entry of the Workers&#x27; Party into Singapore&#x27;s legislature since 1961.
* The 2013 Punggol East by-election was the first time the People&#x27;s Action Party lost a seat in a by-election since 1981 and the last time the ruling party failed to retain a constituency in a by-election.

==== Ireland ====

A by-election held in Dublin South-West during 2014 provided a very surprising upset. The Sinn Féin candidate, Cathal King, was the favourite to take the seat. Sinn Féin had done extremely well in the area during that year&#x27;s local elections. Sinn Féin captured high percentages of the first preference vote across the constituency. However, the Anti-Austerity Alliance candidate, Paul Murphy, was elected on the eighth count. Although Murphy had received a lower first preference total than Cathal King, he outperformed the Sinn Féin candidate in attracting transfers. Murphy then took his seat in the 31st Dáil. As a direct result of this defeat in the by-election, Sinn Féin hardened their stance against Irish Water and called for the complete abolition of water charges in Ireland.

==== United Kingdom ====
In 1965, the British Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker stood in the Leyton by-election for election to the UK Parliament, having been defeated in controversial circumstances in Smethwick at the previous year&#x27;s general election. His appointment as a senior minister while not a member of either house of Parliament was against convention, and he therefore sought to regularise the position by standing in the first available by-election, which was at Leyton in January 1965. However a strong swing against Labour resulted in Gordon Walker&#x27;s defeat: as a result, he resigned as Foreign Secretary.

==== United States ====

In 2010, Republican Scott Brown defeated Martha Coakley in the Massachusetts special election to the United States Senate. Coakley, a Democrat, had been widely expected to win, but Brown unexpectedly closed the gap and won, a shocking result in the heavily-Democratic state of Massachusetts. This eliminated the Democratic Party&#x27;s filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes. Another upset occurred in the 2017 special election in Alabama, one of the most heavily Republican states in the nation. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore in a close race after Moore was accused of sexual assault by multiple women.

<text>Corrosion is a natural process that converts a refined metal into a more chemically stable oxide. It is the gradual deterioration of materials (usually a metal) by chemical or electrochemical reaction with their environment. Corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and preventing corrosion.

In the most common use of the word, this means electrochemical oxidation of metal in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen, hydrogen, or hydroxide. Rusting, the formation of red-orange iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. This type of corrosion typically produces oxides or salts of the original metal and results in a distinctive coloration. Corrosion can also occur in materials other than metals, such as ceramics or polymers, although in this context, the term &quot;degradation&quot; is more common. Corrosion degrades the useful properties of materials and structures including mechanical strength, appearance, and permeability to liquids and gases. Corrosive is distinguished from caustic: the former implies mechanical degradation, the latter chemical.

Many structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in air, but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a wide area, more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result, methods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface, such as passivation and chromate conversion, can increase a material&#x27;s corrosion resistance. However, some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable.

The chemistry of corrosion is complex; it can be considered an electrochemical phenomenon. During corrosion at a particular spot on the surface of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as an anode. The electrons released at this anodic spot move through the metal to another spot on the object, and reduce oxygen at that spot in presence of H+ (which is believed to be available from carbonic acid () formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water in moist air condition of atmosphere. Hydrogen ion in water may also be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the atmosphere). This spot behaves as a cathode.

== Galvanic corrosion ==
Galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. Galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.

Factors such as relative size of anode, types of metal, and operating conditions (temperature, humidity, salinity, etc.) affect galvanic corrosion. The surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials. Galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes.

=== Galvanic series ===

In any given environment (one standard medium is aerated, room-temperature seawater), one metal will be either more &quot;noble&quot; or more &quot;active&quot; than others, based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface. Two metals in electrical contact share the same electrons, so that the &quot;tug-of-war&quot; at each surface is analogous to competition for free electrons between the two materials. Using the electrolyte as a host for the flow of ions in the same direction, the noble metal will take electrons from the active one. The resulting mass flow or electric current can be measured to establish a hierarchy of materials in the medium of interest. This hierarchy is called a &quot;galvanic series&quot; and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion.

== Corrosion removal ==

Often, it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For example, phosphoric acid in the form of &quot;naval jelly&quot; is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust. Corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing, which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of copper corrosion.

== Resistance to corrosion ==
Some metals are more intrinsically resistant to corrosion than others (for some examples, see galvanic series). There are various ways of protecting metals from corrosion (oxidation) including painting, hot-dip galvanization, cathodic protection, and combinations of these.

=== Intrinsic chemistry ===
The materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamically unfavorable. Any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal, which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on Earth and have long been valued. More common &quot;base&quot; metals can only be protected by more temporary means.

Some metals have naturally slow reaction kinetics, even though their corrosion is thermodynamically favorable. These include such metals as zinc, magnesium, and cadmium. While corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing, it happens at an acceptably slow rate. An extreme example is graphite, which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation, but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions.

=== Passivation ===

Passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the metal&#x27;s surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal. Typical passive film thickness on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range – the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. Passivation in natural environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium, stainless steel, titanium, and silicon.

Passivation is primarily determined by metallurgical and environmental factors. The effect of pH is summarized using Pourbaix diagrams, but many other factors are influential. Some conditions that inhibit passivation include high pH for aluminium and zinc, low pH or the presence of chloride ions for stainless steel, high temperature for titanium (in which case the oxide dissolves into the metal, rather than the electrolyte) and fluoride ions for silicon. On the other hand, unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected, as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar. Exposure to a liquid metal such as mercury or hot solder can often circumvent passivation mechanisms.

It has been shown using electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy that during iron passivation, an n-type semiconductor Fe(III) oxide grows at the interface with the metal that leads to the buildup of an electronic barrier opposing electron flow and an electronic depletion region that prevents further oxidation reactions. These results indicate a mechanism of &quot;electronic passivation&quot;. The electronic properties of this semiconducting oxide film also provide a mechanistic explanation of corrosion mediated by chloride, which creates surface states at the oxide surface that lead to electronic breakthrough, restoration of anodic currents, and disruption of the electronic passivation mechanism.

== Corrosion in passivated materials ==
Passivation is extremely useful in mitigating corrosion damage, however even a high-quality alloy will corrode if its ability to form a passivating film is hindered. Proper selection of the right grade of material for the specific environment is important for the long-lasting performance of this group of materials. If breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors, the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking.

=== Pitting corrosion ===
Certain conditions, such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations of species such as chloride which compete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy&#x27;s ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, almost all of the surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause &quot;corrosion pits&quot; of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy&#x27;s environment.

Pitting results when a small hole, or cavity, forms in the metal, usually as a result of de-passivation of a small area. This area becomes anodic, while part of the remaining metal becomes cathodic, producing a localized galvanic reaction. The deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure. This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect because it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds.

=== Weld decay and knifeline attack ===

Stainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges, since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment, chromium carbides can form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary, making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to &quot;weld decay&quot; (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones) in highly corrosive environments. This process can seriously reduce the mechanical strength of welded joints over time.

A stainless steel is said to be &quot;sensitized&quot; if chromium carbides are formed in the microstructure. A typical microstructure of a normalized type 304 stainless steel shows no signs of sensitization, while a heavily sensitized steel shows the presence of grain boundary precipitates. The dark lines in the sensitized microstructure are networks of chromium carbides formed along the grain boundaries.

Special alloys, either with low carbon content or with added carbon &quot;getters&quot; such as titanium and niobium (in types 321 and 347, respectively), can prevent this effect, but the latter require special heat treatment after welding to prevent the similar phenomenon of &quot;knifeline attack&quot;. As its name implies, corrosion is limited to a very narrow zone adjacent to the weld, often only a few micrometers across, making it even less noticeable.

=== Crevice corrosion ===
Crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces (crevices), to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited. Formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits, and under sludge piles.

Crevice corrosion is influenced by the crevice type (metal-metal, metal-non-metal), crevice geometry (size, surface finish), and metallurgical and environmental factors. The susceptibility to crevice corrosion can be evaluated with ASTM standard procedures. A critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material&#x27;s resistance to crevice corrosion.

=== Hydrogen grooving ===
In the chemical industry, hydrogen grooving is the corrosion of piping at grooves created by the interaction of a corrosive agent, corroded pipe constituents, and hydrogen gas bubbles. For example, when sulfuric acid () flows through steel pipes, the iron in the steel reacts with the acid to form a passivation coating of iron sulfate () and hydrogen gas (). The iron sulfate coating will protect the steel from further reaction; however, if hydrogen bubbles contact this coating, it will be removed. Thus, a groove can be formed by a travelling bubble, exposing more steel to the acid, causing a vicious cycle. The grooving is exacerbated by the tendency of subsequent bubbles to follow the same path.

== High-temperature corrosion ==

High-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material (typically a metal) as a result of heating. This non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen, sulfur (&quot;sulfidation&quot;), or other compounds capable of oxidizing (or assisting the oxidation of) the material concerned. For example, materials used in aerospace, power generation, and even in car engines must resist sustained periods at high temperature, during which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing the potentially highly-corrosive products of combustion.

Some products of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the advantage of the engineer. The formation of oxides on stainless steels, for example, can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack, allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions. Such high-temperature corrosion products, in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes, prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic (or metallic and ceramic) surfaces. Thermal oxidation is also commonly used to produce controlled oxide nanostructures, including nanowires and thin films.

== Microbial corrosion ==

Microbial corrosion, or commonly known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in the presence or absence of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide stress cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion. Concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products, leading to localized corrosion.

Accelerated low-water corrosion (ALWC) is a particularly aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile. Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed at the time of construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.

== Metal dusting ==

Metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities, such as synthesis gas and other high-CO environments. The corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder. The suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal, usually from carbon monoxide (CO) in the vapor phase. This graphite layer is then thought to form metastable M3C species (where M is the metal), which migrate away from the metal surface. However, in some regimes, no M3C species is observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer.

== Protection from corrosion ==

Various treatments are used to slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which are exposed to the weather, salt water, acids, or other hostile environments. Some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion, such as those used in neodymium magnets, which can spall or crumble into powder even in dry, temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated.

=== Surface treatments ===
When surface treatments are used to reduce corrosion, great care must be taken to ensure complete coverage, without gaps, cracks, or pinhole defects. Small defects can act as an &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;, allowing corrosion to penetrate the interior and causing extensive damage even while the outer protective layer remains apparently intact for a period of time.

==== Applied coatings ====

Plating, painting, and the application of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium. If the zinc coating is not thick enough the surface soon becomes unsightly with rusting obvious. The design life is directly related to the metal coating thickness.

Painting either by roller or brush is more desirable for tight spaces; spray would be better for larger coating areas such as steel decks and waterfront applications. Flexible polyurethane coatings, like Durabak-M26 for example, can provide an anti-corrosive seal with a highly durable slip resistant membrane. Painted coatings are relatively easy to apply and have fast drying times although temperature and humidity may cause dry times to vary.

==== Reactive coatings ====
If the environment is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water (Roman water systems are known for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other conducting polymers, and a wide range of specially designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e., long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).

==== Anodization ====
Aluminium alloys often undergo a surface treatment. Electrochemical conditions in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal&#x27;s oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At the end of the treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area.

Anodizing is very resilient to weathering and corrosion, so it is commonly used for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular contact with the elements. While being resilient, it must be cleaned frequently. If left without cleaning, panel edge staining will naturally occur. Anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it.

====Biofilm coatings====
A new form of protection has been developed by applying certain species of bacterial films to the surface of metals in highly corrosive environments. This process increases the corrosion resistance substantially. Alternatively, antimicrobial-producing biofilms can be used to inhibit mild steel corrosion from sulfate-reducing bacteria.

=== Controlled permeability formwork ===

Controlled permeability formwork (CPF) is a method of preventing the corrosion of reinforcement by naturally enhancing the durability of the cover during concrete placement. CPF has been used in environments to combat the effects of carbonation, chlorides, frost, and abrasion.

=== Cathodic protection ===

Cathodic protection (CP) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. Cathodic protection systems are most commonly used to protect steel pipelines and tanks; steel pier piles, ships, and offshore oil platforms.

==== Sacrificial anode protection ====

For effective CP, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative until the metal surface has a uniform potential. With a uniform potential, the driving force for the corrosion reaction is halted. For galvanic CP systems, the anode material corrodes under the influence of the steel, and eventually it must be replaced. The polarization is caused by the current flow from the anode to the cathode, driven by the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode. The most common sacrificial anode materials are aluminum, zinc, magnesium and related alloys. Aluminum has the highest capacity, and magnesium has the highest driving voltage and is thus used where resistance is higher. Zinc is general purpose and the basis for galvanizing.

A number of problems are associated with sacrificial anodes. Among these, from an environmental perspective, is the release of zinc, magnesium, aluminum and heavy metals such as cadmium into the environment including seawater. From a working perspective, sacrificial anodes systems are considered to be less precise than modern cathodic protection systems such as Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) systems. Their ability to provide requisite protection has to be checked regularly by means of underwater inspection by divers. Furthermore, as they have a finite lifespan, sacrificial anodes need to be replaced regularly over time.

==== Impressed current cathodic protection ====
For larger structures, galvanic anodes cannot economically deliver enough current to provide complete protection. Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems use anodes connected to a DC power source (such as a cathodic protection rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires.

=== Anodic protection ===

Anodic protection impresses anodic current on the structure to be protected (opposite to the cathodic protection). It is appropriate for metals that exhibit passivity (e.g. stainless steel) and suitably small passive current over a wide range of potentials. It is used in aggressive environments, such as solutions of sulfuric acid. Anodic protection is an electrochemical method of corrosion protection by keeping metal in passive state

===Rate of corrosion===

The formation of an oxide layer is described by the Deal–Grove model, which is used to predict and control oxide layer formation in diverse situations. A simple test for measuring corrosion is the weight loss method. The method involves exposing a clean weighed piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight. The rate of corrosion () is calculated as

:formula_1

where is a constant, is the weight loss of the metal in time , is the surface area of the metal exposed, and is the density of the metal (in g/cm3).

Other common expressions for the corrosion rate is penetration depth and change of mechanical properties.

== Economic impact ==

In 2002, the US Federal Highway Administration released a study titled &quot;Corrosion Costs and Preventive Strategies in the United States&quot; on the direct costs associated with metallic corrosion in the US industry. In 1998, the total annual direct cost of corrosion in the US roughly $276 billion (or 3.2% of the US gross domestic product at the time). Broken down into five specific industries, the economic losses are $22.6 billion in infrastructure, $17.6 billion in production and manufacturing, $29.7 billion in transportation, $20.1 billion in government, and $47.9 billion in utilities.

Rust is one of the most common causes of bridge accidents. As rust displaces a much higher volume than the originating mass of iron, its build-up can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent components. It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in 1983, when support bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support. Three drivers on the roadway at the time died as the slab fell into the river below. The following NTSB investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road re-surfacing, and had not been unblocked; as a result, runoff water penetrated the support hangers. Rust was also an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed within a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers who were on the bridge at the time.

Similarly, corrosion of concrete-covered steel and iron can cause the concrete to spall, creating severe structural problems. It is one of the most common failure modes of reinforced concrete bridges. Measuring instruments based on the half-cell potential can detect the potential corrosion spots before total failure of the concrete structure is reached.

Until 20–30 years ago, galvanized steel pipe was used extensively in the potable water systems for single and multi-family residents as well as commercial and public construction. Today, these systems have long ago consumed the protective zinc and are corroding internally, resulting in poor water quality and pipe failures. The economic impact on homeowners, condo dwellers, and the public infrastructure is estimated at $22 billion as the insurance industry braces for a wave of claims due to pipe failures.

== Corrosion in nonmetals ==

Most ceramic materials are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical energy in the structure; they can be thought of as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to soda–lime glass to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.

=== Corrosion of polymers ===

Polymer degradation involves several complex and often poorly understood physiochemical processes. These are strikingly different from the other processes discussed here, and so the term &quot;corrosion&quot; is only applied to them in a loose sense of the word. Because of their large molecular weight, very little entropy can be gained by mixing a given mass of polymer with another substance, making them generally quite difficult to dissolve. While dissolution is a problem in some polymer applications, it is relatively simple to design against.

A more common and related problem is &quot;swelling&quot;, where small molecules infiltrate the structure, reducing strength and stiffness and causing a volume change. Conversely, many polymers (notably flexible vinyl) are intentionally swelled with plasticizers, which can be leached out of the structure, causing brittleness or other undesirable changes.

The most common form of degradation, however, is a decrease in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and can be as simple as a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g., titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.

=== Corrosion of glass ===

Glass is characterized by a high degree of corrosion resistance. Because of its high water resistance, it is often used as primary packaging material in the pharmaceutical industry since most medicines are preserved in a watery solution. Besides its water resistance, glass is also robust when exposed to certain chemically-aggressive liquids or gases.

Glass disease is the corrosion of silicate glasses in aqueous solutions. It is governed by two mechanisms: diffusion-controlled leaching (ion exchange) and hydrolytic dissolution of the glass network. Both mechanisms strongly depend on the pH of contacting solution: the rate of ion exchange decreases with pH as 10−0.5pH, whereas the rate of hydrolytic dissolution increases with pH as 100.5pH.

Mathematically, corrosion rates of glasses are characterized by normalized corrosion rates of elements (g/cm2·d) which are determined as the ratio of total amount of released species into the water (g) to the water-contacting surface area (cm2), time of contact (days), and weight fraction content of the element in the glass :

:formula_2.

The overall corrosion rate is a sum of contributions from both mechanisms (leaching + dissolution): . Diffusion-controlled leaching (ion exchange) is characteristic of the initial phase of corrosion and involves replacement of alkali ions in the glass by a hydronium (H3O+) ion from the solution. It causes an ion-selective depletion of near surface layers of glasses and gives an inverse-square-root dependence of corrosion rate with exposure time. The diffusion-controlled normalized leaching rate of cations from glasses (g/cm2·d) is given by:

:formula_3,

where is time, is the th cation effective diffusion coefficient (cm2/d), which depends on pH of contacting water as , and is the density of the glass (g/cm3).
Glass network dissolution is characteristic of the later phases of corrosion and causes a congruent release of ions into the water solution at a time-independent rate in dilute solutions (g/cm2·d):

:formula_4,

where is the stationary hydrolysis (dissolution) rate of the glass (cm/d). In closed systems, the consumption of protons from the aqueous phase increases the pH and causes a fast transition to hydrolysis. However, a further saturation of solution with silica impedes hydrolysis and causes the glass to return to an ion-exchange; e.g., diffusion-controlled regime of corrosion.

In typical natural conditions, normalized corrosion rates of silicate glasses are very low and are of the order of 10−7 to 10−5 g/(cm2·d). The very high durability of silicate glasses in water makes them suitable for hazardous and nuclear waste immobilisation.

==== Glass corrosion tests ====

There exist numerous standardized procedures for measuring the corrosion (also called chemical durability) of glasses in neutral, basic, and acidic environments, under simulated environmental conditions, in simulated body fluid, at high temperature and pressure, and under other conditions.

The standard procedure ISO 719 describes a test of the extraction of water-soluble basic compounds under neutral conditions: 2 g of glass, particle size 300–500 μm, is kept for 60 min in 50 mL de-ionized water of grade 2 at 98 °C; 25 mL of the obtained solution is titrated against 0.01 mol/L HCl solution. The volume of HCl required for neutralization is classified according to the table below.
The standardized test ISO 719 is not suitable for glasses with poor or not extractable alkaline components, but which are still attacked by water; e.g., quartz glass, B2O3 glass or P2O5 glass.

Usual glasses are differentiated into the following classes:

* Hydrolytic class 1 (Type I): This class, which is also called neutral glass, includes borosilicate glasses (e.g., Duran, Pyrex, Fiolax). Glass of this class contains essential quantities of boron oxides, aluminium oxides and alkaline earth oxides. Through its composition neutral glass has a high resistance against temperature shocks and the highest hydrolytic resistance. Against acid and neutral solutions it shows high chemical resistance, because of its poor alkali content against alkaline solutions.
* Hydrolytic class 2 (Type II): This class usually contains sodium silicate glasses with a high hydrolytic resistance through surface finishing. Sodium silicate glass is a silicate glass, which contains alkali- and alkaline earth oxide and primarily sodium oxide and calcium oxide.
* Hydrolytic class 3 (Type III): Glass of the 3rd hydrolytic class usually contains sodium silicate glasses and has a mean hydrolytic resistance, which is two times poorer than of type 1 glasses. Acid class DIN 12116 and alkali class DIN 52322 (ISO 695) are to be distinguished from the hydrolytic class DIN 12111 (ISO 719).

<text>Andrea Zanzotto (10 October 1921 – 18 October 2011) was an Italian poet.

==Biography==
Andrea Zanzotto was born in Pieve di Soligo (province of Treviso, Veneto), Italy to Giovanni and Carmela Bernardi.

His father, Giovanni (born 18 November 1888), had received degrees from the &quot;École supérieure de peinture&quot; at Brussels (1911, specializing in trompe-l&#x27;œil in wood and marble) and the Academy of Fine Arts at Bologna (1913, diploma di professore di disegno). Having been hired by a large painting business in Trieste, he was inducted into the army in 1915 and took part in combat on the Piave River. Giovanni had been involved with Carmela for some time but postponed marriage until his work abroad (Trieste at that time belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire) earned him enough to support a family.

===Education===
For the first two years of his life, Zanzotto lived with his parents near via Sartori. In 1922, they moved into a house that the father acquired in the Cal Santa district. This would be the setting and house most often described by the poet. As he wrote in his &quot;Self-portrait&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1977), this was from the very beginning, the centre of his world.

In 1923, his sisters Angela and Marina were born. In 1924 he attended a Montessori kindergarten run by nuns. In 1925, his sister Maria was born.

In the meantime, his father, who had openly espoused support for Giacomo Matteotti, was accused of anti-fascism. In the course of time, his opposition to the fascist regime made it difficult for him to find any kind of work, to the point of deciding in 1925 to take refuge in Paris and then at Annoeullin (near Lille), where he worked for some friends of his. He returned to his home country for a brief period, but in 1926 was forced back to France, remaining in Royan until December of that year.

====Elementary school====
Thanks to his teacher, Marcellina Dalto, Zanzotto already knew how to write when he started elementary school in 1927. He passed immediately to the second grade. As the poet recounts in his &quot;Self-portrait&quot;, he already took pleasure in the music of words: &quot;I felt something infinitely sweet listening to chants, nursery rhymes and little verses, even those of the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Il Corriere dei Piccoli&quot; -- not so much in singing, but insofar as they were pronounced or simply spoken, according to harmony linked to the very function of language, to its inner song.&quot;

In 1928 his father Giovanni took a job as a teacher in a school in Cadore and decided to move with the family to Santo Stefano where Zanzotto completed his second grade. By the end of summer, however, Giovanni realized that the distance between his wife and her mother was causing his wife to suffer. He decided to move the family back to Pieve.

The death of Zanzotto&#x27;s sister Marina in 1929 made a lasting impression on the mind of the young poet.

In that year, his father Giovanni came to public attention for his campaigning against the fascist plebiscite, and was condemned to remain in exile. Nevertheless, he managed to work on the restoration of the church at Costalissoio. Zanzotto, attending third grade at the time, joined him during summer vacation, but suffered homesickness.

In 1930, Zanzotto&#x27;s brother Ettore was born. At the same time, Giovanni was forced to go into debt due to the embezzlement and flight of a clerk at the company (a labour cooperative for injured veterans) which was providing him with the means to support the family. This imposed financial constraints on the entire family.

During this period, he became close to his maternal grandmother and to his aunt Maria, who as he wrote in &quot;Uno squardo dalla periferia&quot; (&quot;A view from the edge&quot;), made him listen to &quot;fragments of &quot;Latino maccheronico&quot; (mock Latin)&quot; and involved him in the activity of the little theatre where she worked as a dramaturge, &quot;capocomico&quot;, director and actress.

At school, he proved a lively but not always disciplined student, often receiving the scoldings of his father. The young man showed no talent for drawing, the very subject which the father had mastered. The father insisted then that Zanzotto take music lessons since music was the passion of the town thanks to the fame of local soprano Toti Dal Monte (whom Zanzotto would recall at the being of his opera, &quot;Idioma&quot;).

====Middle school====
Having completed elementary school in 1931 as an off-campus student at the &quot;Collegio Balbi-Valier&quot; and taken his examinations in Vittorio Veneto, Zanzotto began middle school, gradually arriving at the decision to study to pursue a teaching diploma, a decision driven above all by his family&#x27;s precarious financial position.

His father worked in the meantime in Santo Stefano, but was forced, in 1932, due to poorer wages, to return to Annoeullin where he remained until November. He returned to Pieve in 1933 and although he remained under a ban that prevented him from teaching, he was able to contribute to the upkeep of his family thanks to a part-time position at &quot;Collegio Balbi-Valier&quot; and to various odd jobs. Taking account of his responsibilities to the family, he avoided any direct conflict with his political enemies.

====Teaching school====
With the transition to teaching school, which Zanzotto commuted to Treviso to attend, commenced his first strong literary interests, which he nourished at the moment by consulting the encyclopedia compiled by Giacomo Prampolini.

In 1936, his first love re-emerged alongside the inspiration for the first verses he succeeded in publishing, with the cooperation of his grandmother and aunt, in an anthology for which he paid a small fee.

The verses didn&#x27;t yet have a personal style, and felt the influence of Giovanni Pascoli, given that a nephew of Pascoli worked in the local bank, and knowing his passion for poetry, presented him with a gift of some of the poet&#x27;s work in the first edition.

====High school====
In 1937 his sister Angela died of typhus. To the pain of grief, which had stricken him profoundly, was added the fatigue of the commute to Treviso and the intensification of his studies. Wanting to graduate in the shortest time possible, he had undergone an examination in October of the previous year, comprising all of the junior year subjects. He passed it and started to study Greek in order to pass the entrance examination for &quot;liceo classico&quot; (a high school focused on Classics).

Allergies and asthma, from which he had already suffered, began to present themselves in more forceful episodes. In addition to the symptoms, these brought on a feeling of exclusion and peril: &quot;I think it may have had a negative influence on my childhood and adolescence, this particular aberrant idea which gradually took root in me: the impossibility of actively participating in the game of life, insofar as I would soon be excluded. I suffered from various types of allergies, and at that time, the diagnosis could be rather confused and doubtful. Asthma and hay fever, which had tormented me since I was a boy, were sometimes interpreted as a condition that could seriously worsen, even in the short term&quot; (from the &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;).

Having received his teaching credentials, he was entrusted with several pupils for private lessons by the director of &quot;Collegio Balbi-Valler&quot; and obtained 2,000 lire as a debt of honour from the parish priest, Monsignor Martin, for continuing his studies.

Zanzotto passed the admission examination, finally achieving his classical diploma by examination without formal preparation at the &quot;Liceo Canova&quot; in Treviso.

====University====
In 1939, he enrolled in the College of Letters at the University of Padua where he studied under Diego Valeri and the Latinist, Concetto Marchesi.

With Valeri&#x27;s encouragement, he immersed himself in the writings of Baudelaire and discovered Rimbaud as well as (thanks to Luigi Stefanini) the poetry of Hölderlin, which he read for the first time in Vincenzo Errante&#x27;s translation.

Meanwhile, he began to study German so that he might read Hölderlin, Goethe and Heine in the original.

In 1940, he worked for the first time as a substitute teacher in Valdobbiadene. He discovered at that time that within the regime and above all in the student clubs, there were many who nevertheless acted with practical autonomy, or in contrast to himself, as he came to be informed by his friend, Ettore Luccini, history and philosophy teacher at the &quot;liceo classico&quot;.

In this period, they put out the magazine &quot;Il Bo&quot; in Padua, marked by a notable non-conformist stance, as well as the University of Treviso periodical, &quot;Signum&quot; (along with Giorgio Strehler, Mario Luzi and Mario Tobino, among others), which exhibited a superficial adherence to the positions of the regime.

The news of the outbreak of World War II was met in the town with great consternation, the economic crisis came to the fore, and Zanzotto&#x27;s family had to sell half of the house at Col Santa.

In 1941 the substitute teaching position in Valdobbiadene was not renewed, but Zanzotto managed to find one in Treviso with a middle school.

At the Young Fascists University of Treviso (Gioventù Universitaria Fascista), within which there were also people practising anti-fascism, he made, in 1942, a &quot;presentation&quot; on Eugenio Montale, where he interpreted the pessimism of the author in a political and ethical light.

He received his diploma in Italian literature on 30 October 1942, with a thesis on the work of Grazia Deledda. Professor Natale Busetto was his advisor (&quot;relatore&quot;).

===The war===
Called to military service, he received a deferment for his weak upper body and his severe allergy-related asthma, and thus was exempted from conscription into the army of &#x27;21, the protagonist of the military campaign in Russia and Greece. He then refused to respond to the recruitment of volunteers organized by the Fascist Party.

He published a prose poem entitled &quot;Adagio&quot; in issue 10 of &quot;Signum&quot;, and the first drafts of fiction, lyrical and prose, that would make up the older core of &quot;Sull&#x27;Altopiano&quot; (&quot;On the Plateau&quot;, published in 1964) date back to that year.

An opportunity to publish presented itself in the collection of poetry assembled by the Florentine magazine &quot;Rivoluzione&quot;, founded by Mario Tobino, but due to the war, the periodical was forced to shut down.

<doc id="155452" wikidata="Q607742" url="?curid=155452" title="Hey Jude">
<text>&quot;Hey Jude&quot; is a song by the English rock band The Beatles that was released as a non-album single in August 1968. It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The single was the Beatles&#x27; first release on their Apple record label and one of the &quot;First Four&quot; singles by Apple&#x27;s roster of artists, marking the label&#x27;s public launch. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year&#x27;s top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts, a record it held for nine years. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics&#x27; lists of the greatest songs of all time.

The writing and recording of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; coincided with a period of upheaval in The Beatles. The ballad evolved from &quot;Hey Jules&quot;, a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon&#x27;s young son Julian Lennon, after Lennon had left his wife Cynthia Lennon for the Japanese artist Yoko Ono. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging &quot;Jude&quot; to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a coda featuring a &quot;Na-na-na na&quot; refrain that lasts for over four minutes.

&quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the first Beatles song to be recorded on eight-track recording equipment. The sessions took place at Trident Studios in central London, midway through the recording of the group&#x27;s self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;), and led to an argument between McCartney and George Harrison over the song&#x27;s guitar part. Ringo Starr later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg and first aired on David Frost&#x27;s UK television show &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot;. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song&#x27;s theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.

At over seven minutes in length, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the longest single to top the British charts up to the time. Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named it the 10th &quot;biggest&quot; song of all time in terms of chart success. McCartney has continued to perform &quot;Hey Jude&quot; in concert since Lennon&#x27;s murder in 1980, leading audiences in singing the coda. Julian Lennon and McCartney have each purchased memorabilia related to the song&#x27;s creation.

==Inspiration and writing==

In May 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia Lennon separated due to his affair with artist Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit the Lennons&#x27; five-year-old son Julian Lennon, at Kenwood, the family&#x27;s home in Weybridge. Cynthia had been part of the Beatles&#x27; social circle since before the band&#x27;s rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it &quot;a bit much for them suddenly to be &quot;personae non gratae&quot; and out of my life&quot;. Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney&#x27;s surprise visit: &quot;I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; in the car. I will never forget Paul&#x27;s gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.&quot; The song&#x27;s original title was &quot;Hey Jules&quot;, and it was intended to comfort Julian from the stress of his parents&#x27; separation. McCartney said, &quot;I knew it was not going to be easy for him&quot;, and that he changed the name to &quot;Jude&quot; &quot;because I thought that sounded a bit better&quot;.

According to music journalist Chris Hunt, in the weeks after writing the song, McCartney &quot;test[ed] his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. And that meant .&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;Hunt, Chris. &quot;Here Comes the Son&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band&#x27;s rendition of his instrumental &quot;Thingumybob&quot; in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at the village of Harrold in Bedfordshire and performed &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot;, in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffiths of the group the Iveys – soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an early signing to the Beatles&#x27; new record label Apple Records – recalled that on one of their first days in the studio, McCartney &quot;gave us a full concert rendition of &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27;&quot;.
The intensity of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s relationship made any songwriting collaboration between Lennon and McCartney impossible. In support of his friend nevertheless, McCartney let the couple stay at his house in St John&#x27;s Wood, but amidst growing tensions, the couple soon moved out. McCartney presented &quot;Hey Jude&quot; to Lennon on 26 July, when he and Ono visited McCartney&#x27;s home. McCartney assured him that he would &quot;fix&quot; the line &quot;the movement you need is on your shoulder&quot;, reasoning that &quot;it&#x27;s a stupid expression; it sounds like a parrot.&quot; According to McCartney, Lennon replied: &quot;You won&#x27;t, you know. That&#x27;s the best line in the song.&quot; McCartney retained the phrase. Although McCartney originally wrote &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for Julian, Lennon thought it had actually been written for him. In a 1980 interview, Lennon stated that he &quot;always heard it as a song to me&quot; and contended that, on one level, McCartney was giving his blessing to Lennon and Ono&#x27;s relationship, while, on another, he was disappointed to be usurped as Lennon&#x27;s friend and creative partner.
Other people believed McCartney wrote the song about them, including Judith Simons, a journalist with the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Still others, including Lennon, have speculated that in the lyrics to &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, McCartney&#x27;s failing long-term relationship with Jane Asher provided an unconscious &quot;message to himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney and Asher had announced their engagement on 25 December 1967, yet he began an affair with Linda Eastman in June 1968; that same month, Francie Schwartz, an American who was in London to discuss a film proposal with Apple, began living with McCartney in St John&#x27;s Wood. When Lennon mentioned that he thought the song was about him and Ono, McCartney denied it and told Lennon he had written the song about himself.

Author Mark Hertsgaard has commented that &quot;many of the song&#x27;s lyrics do seem directed more at a grown man on the verge of a powerful new love, especially the lines &#x27;you have found her now go and get her&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;re waiting for someone to perform with.&#x27;&quot; Music critic and author Tim Riley writes: &quot;If the song is about self-worth and self-consolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in himself.&quot;
==Production==

===EMI rehearsals===
Having earmarked the song for release as a single, the Beatles recorded &quot;Hey Jude&quot; during the sessions for their self-titled double album, commonly known as &quot;the &quot;White Album&quot;&quot;. The sessions were marked by an element of discord within the group for the first time, partly as a result of Ono&#x27;s constant presence at Lennon&#x27;s side. The strained relations were also reflective of the four band members&#x27; divergence following their communal trip to Rishikesh in the spring of 1968 to study Transcendental Meditation.

The Beatles first taped 25 takes of the song at EMI Studios in London over two nights, 29 and 30 July 1968, with George Martin as their producer. These dates served as rehearsals, however, since they planned to record the master track at Trident Studios to utilise their eight-track recording machine (EMI was still limited to four-tracks). The first two takes from 29 July, which author and critic Kenneth Womack describes as a &quot;jovial&quot; session, have been released on the 50th Anniversary box set of the &quot;White Album&quot; in 2018 and the &quot;Anthology 3&quot; compilation in 1996, respectively.

The 30 July rehearsals were filmed for a short documentary titled &quot;Music!&quot;, which was produced by the National Music Council of Great Britain. This was the first time that the Beatles had permitted a camera crew to film them developing a song in the studio. The film shows only three of the Beatles performing &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, as George Harrison remained in the studio control room, with Martin and EMI recording engineer Ken Scott. During the rehearsals that day, Harrison and McCartney had a heated disagreement over the lead guitar part for the song. Harrison&#x27;s idea was to play a guitar phrase as a response to each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney&#x27;s conception of the song&#x27;s arrangement, and he vetoed it. Author Simon Leng views this as indicative of how Harrison was increasingly allowed little room to develop ideas on McCartney compositions, whereas he was free to create empathetic guitar parts for Lennon&#x27;s songs of the period. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, &quot;looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, because I could have bowed to the pressure.&quot; Ron Richards, a record producer who worked with Martin at both Parlophone and Associated Independent Recording, said McCartney was &quot;oblivious to anyone else&#x27;s feelings in the studio&quot;, and that he was driven to making the best possible record, at almost any cost.

===Trident Studios recording===
The Beatles recorded the master track for &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at Trident, where McCartney and Harrison had each produced sessions for their Apple artists, on 31 July. Trident&#x27;s founder, Norman Sheffield, recalled that Mal Evans, the Beatles&#x27; aide and former roadie, insisted that some marijuana plants he had brought be placed in the studio to make the place &quot;soft&quot;, consistent with the band&#x27;s wishes. Barry Sheffield served as recording engineer for the session. The line-up on the basic track was McCartney on piano and lead vocal, Lennon on acoustic guitar, Harrison on electric guitar, and Ringo Starr on drums. The Beatles recorded four takes of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, the first of which was selected as the master. With drums intended to be absent for the first two verses, McCartney began this take unaware that Starr had just left for a toilet break. Starr soon returned – &quot;tiptoeing past my back rather quickly&quot;, in McCartney&#x27;s recollection – and performed his cue perfectly.
On 1 August, the group carried out overdubs on the basic track, again at Trident. These additions included McCartney&#x27;s lead vocal and bass guitar; backing vocals from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison; and tambourine, played by Starr. McCartney&#x27;s vocal over the long coda, starting at around three minutes into the song, included a series of improvised shrieks that he later described as &quot;Cary Grant on heat!&quot; They then added a 36-piece orchestra over the coda, scored by Martin. The orchestra consisted of ten violins, three violas, three cellos, two flutes, one contra bassoon, one bassoon, two clarinets, one contra bass clarinet, four trumpets, four trombones, two horns, percussion and two string basses. According to Norman Sheffield, there was dissension initially among the orchestral musicians, some of whom &quot;were looking down their noses at the Beatles, I think&quot;. Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by demanding: &quot;Do you guys want to get fucking paid or not?&quot; During the first few takes, McCartney was unhappy about the lack of energy and passion in the orchestra&#x27;s performance, so he stood up on the grand piano and started conducting the musicians from there.

The Beatles then asked the orchestra members if they would clap their hands and sing along to the refrain in the coda. All but one of the musicians complied (for a double fee), with the abstainer reportedly saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to clap my hands and sing Paul McCartney&#x27;s bloody song!&quot; Apple Records assistant Chris O&#x27;Dell says she joined the cast of backing singers on the song; one of the label&#x27;s first signings, Jackie Lomax, also recalled participating.

&quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the first Beatles song to be recorded on eight-track equipment. Trident Studios were paid £25 per hour by EMI for the sessions. Sheffield said that the studio earned about £1,000 in total, but by having the Beatles record there, and in turn raving about the facility, the value was incalculable. The band carried out further work at Trident during 1968, and Apple artists such as Lomax, Mary Hopkin, Billy Preston and the Iveys all recorded there over the next year.

===Mixing===
Scott, Martin and the Beatles mixed the finished recording at Abbey Road. The transfer of the Trident master tape to acetate proved problematic due to the recording sounding murky when played back on EMI&#x27;s equipment. The issue was resolved with the help of Geoff Emerick, whom Scott had recently replaced as the Beatles&#x27; principal recording engineer. Emerick happened to be visiting Abbey Road, having recently refused to work with the Beatles any longer, due to the tension and abuse that had become commonplace at their recording sessions. A stereo mix of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was then completed on 2 August and the mono version on 8 August.

Musicologist Walter Everett writes that the song&#x27;s &quot;most commented-on feature&quot; is its considerable length, at 7:11. Like McCartney, Martin was concerned that radio stations would not play the track because of the length, but Lennon insisted: &quot;They will if it&#x27;s us.&quot; According to Ken Mansfield, Apple&#x27;s US manager, McCartney remained unconvinced until Mansfield previewed the record for some American disc jockeys and reported that they were highly enthusiastic about the song. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was one second longer than Richard Harris&#x27;s recent hit recording of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, the composer of which, Jimmy Webb, was a visitor to the studio around this time. According to Webb, Martin admitted to him that &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was only allowed to run over seven minutes because of the success of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. Pleased with the result, McCartney played an acetate copy of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at a party held by Mick Jagger, at Vesuvio&#x27;s nightclub in central London, to celebrate the completion of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; album. The song upstaged the Stones&#x27; album and, in author John Winn&#x27;s description, &quot;reportedly ruin[ed]&quot; the party.

In the song&#x27;s final bridge section, at 2:58, the spoken phrase &quot;Fucking hell!&quot; appears, uttered by Lennon. Scott admits that although he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, recalled that Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out &quot;Whoa!&quot; then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off. In his 2021 book &quot;The Lyrics&quot;, however, McCartney recalls that he uttered the expletive (rather than Lennon) when he missed a piano chord.

==Composition and structure==
&quot;Hey Jude&quot; begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano. The patterns he plays are based on three chords: F, C and B (I, V and IV). The main chord progression is &quot;flipped on its head&quot;, in Hertsgaard&#x27;s words, for the coda, since the C chord is replaced by E. Everett comments that McCartney&#x27;s melody over the verses borrows in part from John Ireland&#x27;s 1907 liturgical piece &quot;Te Deum&quot;, as well as (with the first change to a B chord) suggesting the influence of the Drifters&#x27; 1960 hit &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;.

The second verse of the song adds accompaniment from acoustic guitar and tambourine. Tim Riley writes that, with the &quot;restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill&quot; that introduces the drum part, &quot;the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival (&#x27;And any time you feel the ″).&quot; At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (&quot;Na-na-na na …&quot;), supported by an electric guitar fill, before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to &quot;reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside&quot;. Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.

The verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song&#x27;s double plagal cadence. During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase &quot;Na-na-na na&quot; followed by the words &quot;hey Jude&quot; until the song gradually fades out. In his analysis of the composition, musicologist Alan Pollack comments on the unusual structure of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, in that it uses a &quot;binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, mantra-like jam on a simple chord progression&quot;.

Riley considers that the coda&#x27;s repeated chord sequence (I–VII–IV–I) &quot;answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges&quot;, since &quot;The flat seventh that posed dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it.&quot; This three-chord refrain allows McCartney &quot;a bedding ... to leap about on vocally&quot;, so he ad-libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song. In Riley&#x27;s estimation, the song &quot;becomes a tour of Paul&#x27;s vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;Hey Jude&quot; was released on a 7-inch single on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom, backed with &quot;Revolution&quot; on the B-side. It was one of four singles issued simultaneously to launch Apple Records – the others being Mary Hopkin&#x27;s &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, Jackie Lomax&#x27;s &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot;, and the Black Dyke Mills Band&#x27;s &quot;Thingumybob&quot;. In advance of the release date, Apple declared 11–18 August to be &quot;National Apple Week&quot; in the UK, and sent gift-wrapped boxes of the records, marked &quot;Our First Four&quot;, to Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family, and to Harold Wilson, the prime minister. The release was promoted by Derek Taylor, who, in author Peter Doggett&#x27;s description, &quot;hyped the first Apple records with typical elan&quot;. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the first of the four singles, since it was still designated as an EMI/Parlophone release in the UK and a Capitol release in the US, but with the Apple Records logo now added. In the US, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the first Capitol-distributed Beatles single to be issued without a picture sleeve. Instead, the record was presented in a black sleeve bearing the words &quot;The Beatles on Apple&quot;.

Author Philip Norman comments that aside from &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot;, which Harrison wrote and produced, the first Apple A-sides were all &quot;either written, vocalised, discovered or produced&quot; by McCartney. Lennon wanted &quot;Revolution&quot; to be the A-side of the Beatles single, but his bandmates opted for &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. In his 1970 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he said &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was worthy of an A-side, &quot;but we could have had both.&quot; In 1980, he told &quot;Playboy&quot; he still disagreed with the decision.

Doggett describes &quot;Hey Jude&quot; as a song that &quot;glowed with optimism after a summer that had burned with anxiety and rage within the group and in the troubled world beyond&quot;. The single&#x27;s release coincided with the violent subjugation of Vietnam War protestors at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and condemnation in the West of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia and its crushing of attempts to introduce democratic reforms there. In this climate, Lennon&#x27;s espousal of a pacifist agenda over violent confrontation in &quot;Revolution&quot; drew heavy criticism from New Left activists. By contrast, with its more universal message, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was adopted as an anthem by Czech citizens in their struggle.

The song was first released on an album in February 1970, as the title track to Capitol&#x27;s North American compilation &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. The album was conceived as a way to generate income for the Beatles by Allen Klein, the American businessman who, despite McCartney&#x27;s strong opposition, the other Beatles had appointed to manage the ailing Apple organisation in 1969. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; subsequently appeared on the compilation albums &quot;1967–1970&quot;, &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Past Masters, Volume Two&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.

==Promotion==
===Apple shop window graffiti===
A failed early promotional attempt for the single took place after the Beatles&#x27; all-night recording session on 7–8 August 1968. With Apple Boutique having closed a week before, McCartney and Francie Schwartz painted &quot;Hey Jude/Revolution&quot; across its large, whitewashed shop windows. The words were mistaken for antisemitic graffiti (since &quot;Jude&quot; means &quot;Jew&quot; in German), leading to complaints from the local Jewish community, and the windows being smashed by a passer-by.

Discussing the episode in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, McCartney explained that he had been motivated by the location – &quot;Great opportunity. Baker Street, millions of buses going around…&quot; – and added: &quot;I had no idea it meant &#x27;Jew&#x27;, but if you look at footage of Nazi Germany, ″&quot;Juden Raus&quot;″ was written in whitewashed windows with a Star of David. I swear it never occurred to me.&quot; According to Barry Miles, McCartney caused further controversy in his comments to Alan Smith of the &quot;NME&quot; that month, when, in an interview designed to promote the single, he said: &quot;Starvation in India doesn&#x27;t worry me one bit, not one iota … And it doesn&#x27;t worry you, if you&#x27;re honest. You just pose.&quot;

===Promotional film===

The Beatles hired Michael Lindsay-Hogg to shoot promotional clips for &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;, after he had previously directed the clips for &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; in 1966. For &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, they settled on the idea of shooting with a live, albeit controlled, audience. In the clip, the Beatles are first seen by themselves, performing the initial chorus and verses, before the audience moves forward and joins them in singing the coda. The decision was made to hire an orchestra and for the vocals to be sung live, to circumvent the Musicians&#x27; Union&#x27;s ban on miming on television, but otherwise the Beatles performed to a backing track. Lindsay-Hogg shot the clip at Twickenham Film Studios on 4 September 1968. Tony Bramwell, a friend of the Beatles, later described the set as &quot;the piano, there; drums, there; and orchestra in two tiers at the back.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cushley/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;Cushley, Joe. &quot;Boys on Film&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; The event marked Starr&#x27;s return to the group, after McCartney&#x27;s criticism of his drumming had led to him walking out during a session for the &quot;White Album&quot; track &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; Starr was absent for two weeks.

The final edit was a combination of two different takes and included &quot;introductions&quot; to the song by David Frost (who introduced the Beatles as &quot;the greatest tea-room orchestra in the world&quot;) and Cliff Richard, for their respective TV programmes. It first aired in the UK on &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; on 8 September 1968, two weeks after Lennon and Ono had appeared on the show to promote their views on performance art and the avant-garde. The &quot;Hey Jude&quot; clip was broadcast in the United States on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; on 6 October.

According to Riley, the &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; broadcast &quot;kicked &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; into the stratosphere&quot; in terms of popularity. Norman comments that it evoked &quot;palpable general relief&quot; for viewers who had watched Frost&#x27;s show two weeks before, as Lennon now adopted a supporting role to McCartney, and Ono was &quot;nowhere in sight&quot;. Hertsgaard pairs the band&#x27;s performance with the release of the animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; as two events that created &quot;a state of nirvana&quot; for Beatles fans, in contrast with the problems besetting the band regarding Ono&#x27;s influence and Apple. Referring to the sight of the Beatles engulfed by a crowd made up of &quot;young, old, male, female, black, brown, and white&quot; fans, Hertsgaard describes the promotional clip as &quot;a quintessential sixties moment, a touching tableau of contentment and togetherness&quot;.

The 4 September 1968 promo clip is included in the Beatles&#x27; 2015 video compilation &quot;1&quot;, while the three-disc versions of that compilation, titled &quot;1+&quot;, also include an alternate video, with a different introduction and vocal, from the same date.

==Critical reception==
In his contemporary review of the single, Derek Johnson of &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;The intriguing features of &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; are its extreme length and the 40-piece orchestral accompaniment – and personally I would have preferred it without either!&quot; While he viewed the track overall as &quot;a beautiful, compelling song&quot;, and the first three minutes as &quot;absolutely sensational&quot;, Johnson rued the long coda&#x27;s &quot;vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus&quot;. Johnson nevertheless concluded that &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; &quot;prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Beatles are still streets ahead of their rivals&quot;. Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said he had initially been unimpressed, but came to greatly admire &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for its &quot;slow, heavy, piano-ridden beat, sensuous, soulful vocals and nice thumpy drums&quot;. He added that the track would have benefited from being edited in length, as the climactic ending was &quot;a couple of minutes too long&quot;.

&quot;Cash Box&quot;″s reviewer said that the extended fadeout, having been a device pioneered by the Beatles on &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, &quot;becomes something of an art form&quot; in &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, comprising a &quot;trance-like ceremonial that becomes almost timeless in its continuity&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described it as &quot;a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records&quot;. The reviewer contrasted &quot;Hey Jude&quot; with &quot;Revolution&quot;, saying that McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;urges activism of a different sort&quot; by &quot;liltingly exhort[ing] a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love&quot;. Catherine Manfredi of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also read the lyrics as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative relationships with women: &quot;to break the old pattern; to really go through with love&quot;. Manfredi commented on the duality of the song&#x27;s eponymous protagonist as a representation of good, in Saint Jude, &quot;the Patron of that which is called Impossible&quot;, and of evil, in Judas Iscariot. Other commentators interpreted &quot;Hey Jude&quot; as being directed at Bob Dylan, then semi-retired in Woodstock.

Writing in 1971, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;one of [McCartney&#x27;s] truest and most forthright love songs&quot; and said that McCartney&#x27;s romantic side was ill-served by the inclusion of &quot;&#x27;I Will&#x27;, a piece of fluff&quot; on &quot;The Beatles&quot;. In their 1975 book &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler wrote that &quot;Hey Jude&quot; &quot;promised great things&quot; for the ill-conceived Apple enterprise and described the song as &quot;the last great Beatles single recorded &quot;specifically&quot; for the 45s market&quot;. They commented also that &quot;the epic proportions of the piece&quot; encouraged many imitators, yet these other artists &quot;[failed] to capture the gentleness and sympathy of the Beatles&#x27; communal feel&quot;. Walter Everett admires the melody as a &quot;marvel of construction, contrasting wide leaps with stepwise motions, sustained tones with rapid movement, syllabic with melismatic word-setting, and tension ... with resolution&quot;. He cites Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis&quot;, the Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Never Comes the Day&quot; and the Allman Brothers&#x27; &quot;Revival&quot; among the many songs with &quot;mantralike repeated sections&quot; that followed the release of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. In his entry for the song in his 1993 book &quot;Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles&quot;, Paul Williams describes it as a &quot;song about breathing&quot;. He adds: &quot;&#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; kicks ass like Van Gogh or Beethoven in their prime. It is, let&#x27;s say, one of the wonders of this corner of creation ... It opens out like the sky at night or the idea of the existence of God.&quot;

Alan Pollack highlights the song as &quot;such a good illustration of two compositional lessons – how to fill a large canvas with simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast.&quot; Pollack says that the long coda provides &quot;an astonishingly transcendental effect&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger similarly opines: &quot;What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in rock, ranging from mantra-like chants to soulful lines to James Brown power screams.&quot; In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald wrote that the &quot;pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out may be a blemish&quot; but he praised the song as &quot;a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms&quot;. MacDonald concluded: &quot;&#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; strikes a universal note, touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired.&quot; Lennon said the song was &quot;one of [McCartney&#x27;s] masterpieces&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The single was a highly successful debut for Apple Records, a result that contrasted with the public embarrassment the band faced after the recent closure of their short-lived retail venture, Apple Boutique. In the description of music journalist Paul Du Noyer, the song&#x27;s &quot;monumental quality ... amazed the public in 1968&quot;; in addition, the release silenced detractors in the British mainstream press who had relished the opportunity to criticise the band for their December 1967 television special, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, and their trip to Rishikesh in early 1968. In the US, the single similarly brought an end to speculation that the Beatles&#x27; popularity might be diminishing, after &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; had peaked at number 4.

&quot;Hey Jude&quot; reached the top of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart (subsequently adopted as the UK Singles Chart) in September 1968. It lasted two weeks on top before being replaced by Hopkin&#x27;s &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, which McCartney helped promote. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 13 September; that same week, &quot;NME&quot; reported that two million copies of the single had been sold. The song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US on 14 September, beginning a nineteen-week chart run there. It reached number one on 28 September and held that position for nine weeks, for three of which &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; held the number-two spot. This was the longest run at number one for a single in the US until 1977. The song was the 16th number-one hit there for the Beatles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownfield/SEP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the number-one song for 1968. In Australia, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was number one for 13 weeks, which remained a record there until ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Fernando&quot; in 1976. It also topped the charts in Belgium, Brazil, Canada (3 weeks), Denmark, France, the Irish Singles Chart, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany.

On 30 November 1968, &quot;NME&quot; reported that sales had reached nearly six million copies worldwide. By 1999, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; had sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide. That year, it was certified 4× platinum by the RIAA, representing four million units shipped in the US. As of December 2018, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the 54th-best-selling single of all time in the UK – one of six Beatles songs included on the top sales rankings published by the Official Charts Company. It has since been described as an international global hit.

==Awards and accolades==
&quot;Hey Jude&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Awards of 1969 in the categories of Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, but failed to win any of them. In the 1968 &quot;NME&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was named the best single of the year, and the song also won the 1968 Ivor Novello Award for &quot;A-Side With the Highest Sales&quot;. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001 and it is one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

In 2001, the 1968 release of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; on Apple Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at number eight on the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, making it the highest-placed Beatles song on the list; it dropped to number 89 in the 2021 revised list. Among its many appearances in other best-song-of-all-time lists, VH1 placed it ninth in 2000 and &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked it at number 29 in the same year, having placed the song seventh in a 1997 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Singles of All Time&quot;. In 1976, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it 38th on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Singles of All Time&quot;, and the track appeared at number 77 on the same publication&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2014. In January 2001, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; came in third on Channel 4&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singles&quot;. The Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association ranks &quot;Hey Jude&quot; as the 11th-best jukebox single of all time. In 2008, the song appeared in eighth place on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;All Time Hot 100 Songs&quot;.

In July 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; placed &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at number 12 on its list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. On a similar list compiled four years later, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at number seven. In 2015, the ITV program &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Beatles Number One&quot; ranked &quot;Hey Jude&quot; in first place. In 2018, the music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked it at number 49 on their list of the best Beatles songs. Writing in the magazine, Nick Levine said: &quot;Don&#x27;t allow yourself to overlook this song because of its sheer ubiquity ... &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; is a huge-hearted, super-emotional epic that climaxes with one of pop&#x27;s most legendary hooks.&quot;

==Auctioned lyrics and memorabilia==

In his 1996 article about the single&#x27;s release, for &quot;Mojo&quot;, Paul Du Noyer said that the writing of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; had become &quot;one of the best-known stories in Beatles folklore&quot;. In a 2005 interview, Ono said that for McCartney and for Julian and Cynthia Lennon, the scenario was akin to a drama, in that &quot;Each person has something to be totally miserable about, because of the way they were put into this play. I have incredible sympathy for each of them.&quot; Du Noyer quoted Cynthia Lennon as saying of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;it always bring tears to my eyes, that song.&quot;

Julian discovered that &quot;Hey Jude&quot; had been written for him almost 20 years after the fact. He recalled of his and McCartney&#x27;s relationship: &quot;Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.&quot; In 1996, Julian paid for the recording notes to &quot;Hey Jude&quot; at an auction. He spent a further at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon&#x27;s manager, stated at the time: &quot;He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like.&quot;

In 2002, the original handwritten lyrics for the song were nearly auctioned off at Christie&#x27;s in London. The sheet of notepaper with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to at the auction, which was scheduled for 30 April 2002. McCartney went to court to stop the auction, claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London home. Richard Morgan, representing Christie&#x27;s, said McCartney had provided no evidence that he had ever owned the piece of paper on which the lyrics were written. The courts decided in McCartney&#x27;s favour and prohibited the sale of the lyrics. They had been sent to Christie&#x27;s for auction by Frenchman Florrent Tessier, who said he purchased the piece of paper at a street market stall in London for in the early 1970s. In the original catalogue for the auction, Julian Lennon had written, &quot;It&#x27;s very strange to think that someone has written a song about you. It still touches me.&quot;

Along with &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was one of the songs that McCartney has highlighted when attempting to have some of the official Beatles songwriting credits changed to McCartney–Lennon. McCartney applied the revised credit to this and 18 other Lennon–McCartney songs on his 2002 live album &quot;Back in the U.S.&quot;, attracting criticism from Ono, as Lennon&#x27;s widow, and from Starr, the only other surviving member of the Beatles.

In April 2020, the handwritten lyrics used during the original recording sold for $910,000 at auction via Julien&#x27;s Auctions ().

==Cover versions and McCartney live performances==
In 1968, R&amp;B singer Wilson Pickett released a cover of the song from his album &quot;Hey Jude&quot; recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, with a guitar part played by a young Duane Allman, who recommended the song to Pickett. Eric Clapton commented, &quot;I remember hearing [it] and calling either Ahmet Ertegun or Tom Dowd and saying, &#x27;Who&#x27;s that guitar player?&#x27; ... To this day, I&#x27;ve never heard better rock guitar playing on an R&amp;B record. It&#x27;s the best.&quot; Session musician Jimmy Johnson, who played on the recording, said that Allman&#x27;s solo &quot;created Southern rock&quot;. Pickett&#x27;s version reached number 23 on the Hot 100 and 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart.

&quot;Hey Jude&quot; was one of the few Beatles songs that Elvis Presley covered, when he rehearsed the track at his 1969 Memphis sessions with producer Chips Moman, a recording that appeared on the 1972 album &quot;Elvis Now&quot;. A medley of &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was included on the 1999 reissue of Presley&#x27;s 1970 live album &quot;On Stage&quot;. Katy Perry performed &quot;Hey Jude&quot; as part of the 2012 MusiCares Person of the Year concert honouring McCartney.

McCartney played &quot;Hey Jude&quot; throughout his 1989–90 world tour, his first tour since Lennon&#x27;s murder in 1980. McCartney had considered including it as the closing song on his band Wings&#x27; 1975 Wings Over the World Tour, but decided that &quot;it just didn&#x27;t feel right.&quot; He has continued to feature the song in his concerts, leading the audience in organised singalongs whereby different segments of the crowd – such as those in a certain section of the venue, then only men followed by only the women – chant the &quot;Na-na-na na&quot; refrain. He performed the song at the White House in June 2010, and at the end of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

<text>Maurice Gustave Duruflé (; 11 January 1902 – 16 June 1986) was a French composer, organist, musicologist, and teacher.

==Life and career==
Duruflé was born in Louviers, Eure in 1902. He became a chorister at the Rouen Cathedral Choir School from 1912 to 1918, where he studied piano and organ with Jules Haelling, a pupil of Alexandre Guilmant. The choral plainsong tradition at Rouen became a strong and lasting influence. At age 17, upon moving to Paris, he took private organ lessons with Charles Tournemire, whom he assisted at Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris until 1927. In 1920 Duruflé entered the Conservatoire de Paris, eventually graduating with first prizes in organ with Eugène Gigout (1922), harmony with Jean Gallon (1924), fugue with Georges Caussade (1924), piano accompaniment with César Abel Estyle (1926) and composition with Paul Dukas (1928).

In 1927, Louis Vierne nominated him as his assistant at Notre-Dame. Duruflé and Vierne remained lifelong friends, and Duruflé was at Vierne&#x27;s side acting as assistant when Vierne died at the console of the Notre-Dame organ on 2 June 1937, even though Duruflé had become titular organist of St-Étienne-du-Mont in Paris in 1929, a position he held for the rest of his life. In 1930 he won a prize for his &quot;Prélude, adagio et choral varié sur le &quot;Veni Creator&quot;&quot;, and in 1936 he won the Prix Blumenthal. In 1939, he premiered Francis Poulenc&#x27;s Organ Concerto (the &quot;Concerto for Organ, Strings and Timpani in G minor&quot;); he had advised Poulenc on the registrations of the organ part. In 1943 he became Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he worked until 1970; among his pupils were the revered organists Pierre Cochereau, Jean Guillou and Marie-Claire Alain.

In 1947 he completed probably the most famous of his few pieces: the &quot;Requiem&quot; op. 9, for soloists, choir, organ, and orchestra. He had begun composing the work in 1941, following a commission from the Vichy regime. Also in 1947, Marie-Madeleine Chevalier became his assistant at St-Étienne-du-Mont. They married on 15 September 1953. (Duruflé&#x27;s first marriage to Lucette Bousquet, in 1932, ended in civil divorce in 1947 and was declared null by the Vatican on 23 June 1953.) The couple became a famous and popular organ duo, going on tour together several times throughout the sixties and early seventies.

He was made a Chevalier de la Legion d&#x27;honneur in 1954. He was promoted to an Officier de la Legion d&#x27;honneur in 1966.

==Perfectionism==
Duruflé was highly critical of his own compositions. He particularly disparaged the third and final movement &#x27;Toccata&#x27; from his &quot;Suite, op. 5&quot;, and never recorded it. He never programmed the Toccata, his &quot;Sicilienne&quot; or the Prelude or Adagio from &quot;Veni Creator&quot;.

He published only a handful of works and often continued to edit and change pieces after publication. For instance, the Toccata from &quot;Suite&quot; has a completely different ending in the first edition than in the more recent version, and the score to the &quot;Fugue sur le nom d&#x27;Alain&quot; originally indicated accelerando throughout. The result of this perfectionism is that his music, especially his organ music, tends to be well polished, and is still frequently performed in concerts by organists around the world.

Duruflé and his wife were musically conservative. In 1969 they attended a &quot;jazz mass&quot; at St-Étienne-du-Mont. Marie-Madeleine was visibly upset by the experience, and Duruflé called it a scandalous travesty.

==Later life and death==
Duruflé suffered severe injuries in a car crash on 29 May 1975, and as a result he gave up performing; indeed he was largely confined to his apartment, leaving the service at St-Étienne-du-Mont to his wife Marie-Madeleine (who was also injured in the crash). He died in a clinic at Louveciennes (near Paris) in 1986, aged 84, having never fully recovered from the crash.

<doc id="155461" wikidata="Q714209" url="?curid=155461" title="Marcel Moyse">
<text>Marcel Moyse ([mɔiz]; May 17, 1889, in St. Amour, France – November 1, 1984, in Brattleboro, Vermont, United States) was a French flautist. Moyse studied at the Paris Conservatory and was a student of Philippe Gaubert, Adolphe Hennebains, and Paul Taffanel; all of whom were flute virtuosos in their time. Moyse played principal flute in various Paris orchestras and appeared widely as a soloist and made many recordings. His trademark tone was clear, flexible, penetrating, and controlled by a fast vibrato. This was a characteristic of the &#x27;French style&#x27; of flute playing that was to influence the modern standard for flutists worldwide.

Moyse taught on the faculty of the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal, and was a founder of the Marlboro Music School and festival in Vermont. Moyse strove to teach his students &quot;not how to play the flute, but to make music&quot;. Among his students were James Galway, Paula Robison, Trevor Wye, William Bennett, Carol Wincenc, Bernard Goldberg, Robert Aitken, Arthur Kitti, Karen Reynolds, September Payne and Julia Bogorad. Moyse authored many flute studies, including &quot;De la Sonorite&quot; and &quot;Tone Development Through Interpretation&quot;, published by McGinnis &amp; Marx.

==Paris Conservatoire==
Marcel Moyse moved to Paris in 1904 to live with his uncle, Joseph Moyse. By living with his uncle, Marcel observed firsthand the life of the average professional musician. Joseph played in the cello section of the Lamoureux Orchestra, or Concerts Lamoureux, a highly respected musical institution founded in 1881 by Charles Lamoureux. Marcel depended on his uncle to interpret Parisian life and to guide him in determining his place in it. Joseph established a plan for his nephew, designed to bring him socially and intellectually up to speed. In the first month, Marcel could do what he pleased: attend concerts, visit museums, stroll the streets. Marcel had told his uncle that he wanted to be a sculptor, so Joseph enrolled him in a drawing class at the Ecole Boule, however Joseph also intended to find him a flute teacher.

With the help of Alfred Moyse, Joseph purchased a new flute for Marcel and immediately assigned him several daily practice sessions of forty-five minutes each, interspersed with fifteen minutes of reading from his extensive personal library. Along with this extensive study on flute, Joseph took Marcel to rehearsals and concerts to give Marcel an insight into what was possible for the future. In May 1904, Joseph presented Marcel to Adolphe Hennebains. Hennebains remarked favorably on the boy&#x27;s abilities and accepted him as a pupil, a decision that brought Marcel one giant step closer to the Conservatoire.

After just a few months of studying with Hennebains, Moyse made swift progress with him and was invited to audit Paul Taffanel&#x27;s class at the Paris Conservatoire. Taffanel was looked upon highly and although by the time Moyse had him as a teacher, Taffanel was sixty and retired from playing, Moyse&#x27;s time with Taffanel was invaluable. Moyse immediately grasped the standard repertoire required for admittance into the Conservatoire. Under the guidance of Hennebains and with the approval of Taffanel, Moyse auditioned for and won a place in the flute class at the Paris Conservatoire in the fall of 1905. In 1906 with only one year of Conservatoire training, Moyse performed the newly written exam piece, &quot;Nocturne et Allegro scherzando&quot; by Philippe Gaubert. If Moyse was nervous, he did not betray it in his performance, with the stretching melody of the nocturne and the skipping, whimsical turns of the scherzo were perfect vehicles for his expressive tone and nimble technique. At the age of seventeen, Moyse accepted the first prize and was deemed ready for a professional career.

Moyse had become one of a handful of flutists in the history of the Conservatoire to qualify for a first prize in one year, but his playing lacked polish, and he knew it. Soon after leaving the school he approached Hennebains for more lessons, but his former teacher turned him down, saying the eighteen-year-old was already an accomplished artist. So Moyse went to Philippe Gaubert, who then played with the Opéra and the Société des Concerts. Gaubert, who had been impressed by Moyse&#x27;s performance of his concours solo, was pleased to accept him as a private student, every Friday at five o&#x27;clock in the evening. Moyse remained with Gaubert for about four years. &quot;Gaubert was an instinctive musician,&quot; Moyse recalled. &quot;He played as naturally as someone walks, stepping out with his left foot, then his right, avoiding all obstacles. The musical instinct of Gaubert was like an instinct of the body--music without thinking about it.&quot;

==Career==
Diligent practice, additional study, and a growing number of performing opportunities in the 1906-07 season absorbed Moyse completely. After having studied in Lucien Capet&#x27;s chamber music class, he continued independently to work through the repertoire for solo violin and eventually added cello literature to his practice sessions, &quot;to try to develop a rich sound, as my uncle had on his cello.&quot;

In 1913, Moyse toured the United States with operatic soprano Nellie Melba in her private train. Soon after, World War I arrived and Moyse was rejected by the army because of recurring pneumonia. This was a very difficult time in his life, particularly as Moyse was slowly trying to rebuild his health.

From the years 1916 to 1918, Nadia Boulanger invited Moyse to play at her classes on musical analysis. Moyse was principal flute soloist in Paris&#x27;s Opéra Comique and simultaneously, in order to prove himself, applied for the solo flute position at the Paris Opera. Although offered the position, he turned it down as it would interfere with his frequent visits home to St. Amour. Moyse&#x27;s career continued to flourish, and he became the first flutist with the orchestra of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire.

In 1931, Moyse was teaching in Geneva when the flutist of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Marcel Welsch, committed suicide. Welsch was scheduled to play Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto No. 5&quot; with the orchestra; it was Blanche Honegger who suggested Moyse as a replacement. This was the beginning of the famous Moyse Trio: Marcel - the founder and director - playing flute; Blanche, playing violin and viola; and his son Louis, playing both flute and piano. From its conception in 1934, the Moyse Trio performed and recorded for the next 20 years.

In 1932, Moyse succeeded Philippe Gaubert as Professor at the Paris Conservatoire and in addition, was appointed Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire from 1933 to 1949, which entailed a weekly trip to Geneva. Geneva being fairly close to St. Amour, meant more frequent visits to the village where he was born and which he loved. He never failed to visit his adoptive mother when he passed by St. Amour.

By 1936, he was on top of the world. He became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour for his artistic contributions as a musician, and he traveled widely, performing in most of the major European cities, which included several performances and recordings in London. In 1938, he was invited to play at the Tanglewood Festival held in the United States for two weeks; both Blanche and Louis went with him as the Trio also had been invited by Arturo Toscanini to play on the NBC Radio in New York.

==The End of an Era==
In his later years when he was barely able to play the flute himself he travelled each year to his birthplace St. Amour together with a handful of his students. They stayed at the Hotel du Commerce where Moyse gave them flute lessons. Today the square in front of the hotel is called Place Marcel Moyse.

In Moyse&#x27;s last years, he was troubled by various medical problems which necessitated many operations and hospitalizations. Marcel Moyse died on November 1, 1984, at the age of 95, and was cremated in Brattleboro, Vermont. His ashes were buried in the cemetery of St. Amour Church in Jura, France, in August 1985.

The end of his life marked the close of an era. Generations of both distinguished and less distinguished flute players have been profoundly influenced by his playing and his teaching. There were several tributes to Moyse in remembrance, notably the memorial concert held at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on January 6, 1985, and shortly after a concert &quot;In Memory of Marcel Moyse&quot; held in Brattleboro, Vermont on February 3, 1985. On Moyse&#x27;s centenary in 1989, there was the &quot;Marcel Moyse Centennial Celebration&quot; which took place from the 17th-20th of the May in Marlboro and Brattleboro, Vermont. At the same time, a &quot;Flute Celebration&quot; was presented in London which paid tribute to the great flutist and teacher on his birth date, May 17. There were many memorials and remembrances to Moyse in the world&#x27;s flute press, and a flourishing Marcel Moyse Society was formed in the U.S.A.

<text>Charles Arnould Tournemire (22 January 1870 – 3 or 4 November 1939) was a French composer and organist, notable partly for his improvisations, which were often rooted in the music of Gregorian chant. His compositions include eight symphonies (one of them choral), four operas, twelve chamber works and eighteen piano solos. He is mainly remembered for his organ music, the best known being a set of pieces called &quot;L&#x27;Orgue mystique&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Bordeaux, Tournemire moved in adolescence to Paris, and there became one of César Franck&#x27;s three youngest students (the other two were Henri Büsser and a Belgian, Guillaume Lekeu, the latter having been born only two days before Tournemire).

From 1898 (on the resignation of Gabriel Pierné) to 1939, Tournemire served as the &quot;organiste titulaire&quot; at Franck&#x27;s old church, the Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris. He was also professor of chamber music at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1931, he published a biography of Franck.

A year before the biography appeared, Tournemire recorded five organ improvisations, which were later transcribed by Maurice Duruflé from phonograph recordings. Of ten 78-rpm discs which Tournemire made in 1930, playing the Aristide Cavaillé-Coll organ of Sainte-Clotilde, five contain compositions by Franck. This set of discs was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque in 1931 and has been reissued on both LP and CD.

Insofar as Tournemire&#x27;s name is now remembered, it is usually spoken of in connection with his largest composition, &quot;L&#x27;Orgue mystique&quot;, a group of 51 sets of five pieces each (except for Holy Saturday, which contains only three pieces), all written between 1927 and 1932. This collection covers the cycle of the Roman Catholic liturgical year, each set being based on the Gregorian chants for the day. Unlike the symphonies of Charles-Marie Widor, which are usually heard in secular recitals (even when individual movements of these symphonies had liturgical origins), &quot;L&#x27;Orgue mystique&quot; was designed for church use.

Tournemire died in Arcachon, France, in 1939. The precise cause of his death is uncertain. All that is known is he left his house on October 31 for a walk and never returned. His body was found in a bog in Arcachon, a fair distance from where he left, on November 4 and he was presumed to have died on November 3 or 4.

A rare revival of one of his four operas took place in December 2022, when Theater Ulm staged &quot;La Légende de Tristan&quot; (based on &quot;Le Roman de Tristan et Iseut&quot; by Joseph Bédier) conducted by Felix Bender.

<text>Louis Victor Jules Vierne (8 October 1870 – 2 June 1937) was a French organist and composer. As the organist of Notre-Dame de Paris from 1900 until his death, he focused on organ music, including six organ symphonies and a &quot;Messe solennelle&quot; for choir and two organs. He toured Europe and the United States as a concert organist. His students included Nadia Boulanger and Maurice Duruflé.

== Life ==
Louis Vierne was born in Poitiers on 8 October 1870, the son of Henri-Alfred Vierne (1828–1886), a teacher, who became a journalist. He was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Journal de la Vienne&quot; in Poitiers, where he met his future wife, Marie-Joséphine Gervaz. The couple had four children. Louis was born nearly blind due to congenital cataracts. His unusual gift for music was discovered early. When he was only two years of age, he heard the piano for the first time: his neighbor played him a Schubert lullaby, and after he had finished young Louis promptly began to pick out the notes of the lullaby on the piano. From April 1873, his father worked for the &quot;Paris-Journal&quot;, moving with the family to Paris. At age six, Louis underwent an iridectomy in both eyes. He was then able to distinguish shapes and people, and could read large letters. He took piano lessons with Madame Gosset in Lille, where his father worked for the &quot;Lille Memorial&quot;. She transcribed the music on large staves. He also learned Braille.

In 1880, the family returned to Paris where his father worked for several newspapers including &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. Vierne studied the piano with Louis Specht, a blind teacher at the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles (National Institute for the Young Blind). He was impressed when listening to César Franck playing the organ in 1881: Vierne was accepted as a student of the institution in 1881. Franck recommended that he study the organ, and Vierne began lessons with Louis Lebel and Adolphe Marty. He studied harmony privately with Franck, and attended classes at the Paris Conservatoire, admitted as a full-time student in 1890. When Franck died on 8 November 1890, Charles-Marie Widor succeeded him. Vierne became his assistant in the organ class and as organist at Saint-Sulpice. Vierne was awarded first prize in the organ class of the Conservatoire in 1894. He remained assistant to Widor in the organ class, and also to his successor Alexandre Guilmant from 1896.

In July 1898, Vierne was godfather at a baptism, and Berthe Arlette Taskin the godmother. She was born in 1880, and was a contralto singing who had worked with her father, the baritone and teacher at the Conservatoire Émile-Alexandre Taskin. Vierne proposed to her on 18 July, and they got married on 20 April 1899. Widor was the organist in the church ceremony on 22 April at Saint-Sulpice. Their first son, Jacques, was born on 6 March 1900.

On 21 May 1900, Vierne won the competition for the position of titular organist at Notre-Dame de Paris. On 11 September, he gave a recital together with his wife, as part of the world fair, Exposition Universelle. He held the post until his death in 1937. Although he held one of the most prestigious organ posts in France, the organ of Notre-Dame was in a state of disrepair throughout much of his tenure at the instrument. He eventually undertook a transcontinental concert tour of North America to raise money for its restoration. The tour, which included major recitals on the famous Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia and its smaller sister instrument, the Wanamaker Auditorium Organ in New York City, was very successful, although the trip physically drained him.

When Vierne&#x27;s mother died on 25 March 1902, he moved to a larger flat on Rue ses Saints-Pères. A second son, André, was born on 6 January 1903, and a daughter, Collette, was born on 5 January 1907. In 1906, a street accident in Paris caused him to badly fracture his leg, and it was briefly thought that his leg would need to be amputated. The leg was saved, but his recovery, and the task of completely re-learning his pedal technique, took a half a year.

Vierne obtained a divorce on 4 August 1909, citing the infidelity of his wife. While she became custodian of the younger children, Jacques remained with his father. 

Vierne taught, as an assistant, at the Conservatoire for nineteen years, where his students included Joseph Bonnet, Nadia Boulanger, Marcel Dupré and Henri Mulet. He was expected to succeed Guilmant as head of the organ class, but instead, Eugène Gigout was appointed, succeeded in 1926 by Dupré. Vierne taught at the Schola cantorum from 1912. His students uniformly described him as a kind, patient and encouraging teacher. Among his pupils were Augustin Barié, Edward Shippen Barnes, Lili Boulanger, André Fleury, Isadore Freed, Henri Gagnebin, Gaston Litaize, Édouard Mignan, Émile Poillot, Adrien Rougier, Alexander Schreiner, and Georges-Émile Tanguay. In the summer of 1913, he was awarded two medals from the Salon des musiciens.

With the outbreak of WW1 in 1914, Vierne&#x27;s son Jacques, still a minor, wished to enlist in the military. Louis Vierne signed the necessary dispensation. Vierne went to Switzerland in 1916 for glaucoma treatment, expecting to be away for only four months, with Dupré deputy organist at Notre-Dame, but due to complications, he returned four years later. In May 1917, Jacques was transferred to the 44th Field Regiment as a driver. He committed suicide on 12 November 1917 in Prosne in the Marne. Vierne composed the Piano Quintet, Op. 42, in commemoration. His brother René died at the front on 29 May 1918, remembered in &quot;Solitude&quot;, a poem for piano.

Vierne returned to Paris in 1920. A year later, he met Madeleine Richepin, a young singer for whom he set poems by Baudelaire (&quot;Poème d&#x27;amour&quot;) which they performed in concerts together. In June 1922, he toured Switzerland, Italy and Germany. In 1924, he toured England and Scotland, and played in Lyon and Brussels. In 1927, he undertook a U.S. tour of three months with Richepin. In 1928, they spent the summer at a castle in Angers, where he composed &quot;Les Angélus&quot;, orchestrated &quot;Poème d&#x27;amour&quot; which they premiered in Paris on 1 March 1930), and began his lyrical drama &quot;Antigone&quot;. After the death of Vincent d&#x27;Indy and the conflicts that followed, he left the Schola cantorum for the César Franck School in 1931.

The government of France made Vierne a Chevalier de la Legion d&#x27;honneur in 1931.

== Death ==

On 2 June 1937, Vierne gave his 1,750th organ recital at Notre-Dame. He completed the main concert, which members of the audience said showed him at his full powers (&quot;as well as he has ever played&quot;), playing his &quot;Stèle pour un enfant défunt&quot; from his &quot;Triptyque&quot;, Op. 58. The closing section was to be two improvisations on submitted themes. He read the first theme in Braille, then selected the stops he would use for the improvisation. He suddenly pitched forward, and fell off the bench as his foot hit the low &quot;E&quot; pedal of the organ. He lost consciousness as the single note echoed throughout the church. He had thus fulfilled his oft-stated lifelong dream — to die at the console of the great organ of Notre-Dame. Maurice Duruflé, another major French organist and composer, was at his side at the time of his death.

== Music ==
: See &quot;List of compositions by Louis Vierne&quot;, :Category:Compositions by Louis Vierne

Vierne had an elegant, clean style of writing that respected form above all else. His harmonic language was romantically rich, but not as sentimental or theatrical as that of his early mentor César Franck. Like all of the great &quot;fin de siècle&quot; French organists, Vierne&#x27;s music was very idiomatic for his chosen instrument and has inspired most of the great Parisian organist-composers who followed him.

His output for organ includes six organ symphonies, &quot;24 Fantasy Pieces&quot; (which includes his famous &quot;Carillon de Westminster&quot;), and &quot;Vingt-quatre pièces en style libre&quot;, among other works. There are also several chamber works (sonatas for violin and cello, a piano quintet and a string quartet for example), vocal and choral music, and a Symphony in A minor for orchestra.

<text>Marcel Jean-Jules Dupré (; 3 May 1886 – 30 May 1971) was a French organist, composer, and pedagogue.

==Early life and education==
Born in Rouen into a wealthy musical family, Marcel Dupré was a child prodigy. His father Aimable Albert Dupré was titular organist of Saint-Ouen Abbey from 1911 till his death and a friend of Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, who built an organ in the family house when Marcel was 10 years old. His mother Marie-Alice (née Chauvière) was a cellist who also gave music lessons, and his paternal uncle Henri Auguste Dupré was a violinist and violist. Both of his grandfathers, Étienne-Pierre Chauvière (maître de chapelle at Saint-Patrice in Rouen and an operatic bass) and Aimable Auguste-Pompée Dupré (also a friend of Cavaillé-Coll) were also organists.

Having already taken lessons from Alexandre Guilmant (due to his appealing to his father), Dupre entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1904, where he studied with Louis Diémer and Lazare Lévy (piano), Guilmant and Louis Vierne (organ), and Charles-Marie Widor (fugue and composition). In 1914, Dupré won the Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata &quot;Psyché&quot;.

==Performances==
Dupré became famous for performing more than 2,000 organ recitals throughout Australia, the United States, Canada and Europe, which included a recital series of 10 concerts of the complete works of J. S. Bach in 1920 (Paris Conservatoire) and 1921 (Palais du Trocadéro), both performed entirely from memory. The sponsorship of an American transcontinental tour by the John Wanamaker Department Store interests rocketed his name into international prominence. Dupré&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie-Passion&quot; began as an improvisation on Philadelphia&#x27;s Wanamaker Organ. 

Succeeding Widor in 1934 as titular organist at St. Sulpice in Paris, Dupré retained this position for the rest of his life; thus it happened that, since Widor had been there for more than six decades, the position changed hands only once in a century. In 1937, he was engaged to perform at the wedding of the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson. The same year, Widor died.

==Teaching==
In 1926, he was appointed professor of organ performance and improvisation at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held until 1954. From 1947 to 1954, Dupré was director of the American Conservatory, which occupies the Louis XV wing of the Château de Fontainebleau near Paris. In 1954, after the death of Claude Delvincourt in a traffic accident, Dupré became director of the Paris Conservatoire; he held this post for only two years before the prevailing national laws forced him to retire at the age of 70.

He taught two generations of well-known organists such as Jehan Alain and Marie-Claire Alain, Jean-Marie Beaudet, Pierre Cochereau, Françoise Renet, Jeanne Demessieux, Rolande Ginabat-Falcinelli, Jean-Jacques Grunenwald, Odile Pierre, Jean Guillou, Jean Langlais, Carl Weinrich, Clarence Watters and, most famously, Olivier Messiaen, to name only a few.

He prepared study editions of the organ works of Bach, Handel, Mozart, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Schumann, César Franck, and Alexander Glazunov. He also wrote a method for organ (1927), two treatises on organ improvisation (1926 and 1937), and books on harmonic analysis (1936), counterpoint (1938), fugue (1938), and accompaniment of Gregorian chant (1937), in addition to essays on organ building, acoustics, and philosophy of music.

==Composing==
As a composer, he produced a wide-ranging oeuvre of 65 opus numbers (+1 &quot;bis&quot;). Aside from a few fine works for aspiring organists (such as the &quot;79 Chorales&quot; op. 28) most of Dupré&#x27;s music for the organ ranges from moderately to extremely difficult, and some of it makes almost impossible technical demands on the performer (e.g., &quot;Évocation&quot; op. 37, &quot;Suite&quot;, op. 39, &quot;Deux Esquisses&quot; op. 41, &quot;Vision&quot; op. 44).

Dupré&#x27;s most often heard and recorded compositions tend to be from the earlier part of his career. During this time he wrote the &quot;Three Preludes and Fugues&quot;, Op. 7 (1912), with the First and Third Preludes (in particular the G minor with its phenomenally fast tempo and its pedal chords) being pronounced unplayable by no less a figure than Widor. Such, indeed, is these preludes&#x27; level of complexity that Dupré was the only organist able to play them in public for years.

In many ways Dupré may be viewed as a Paganini of the organ. Being a virtuoso of the highest order, he contributed extensively to the development of technique (both in his organ music and in his pedagogical works) although, like Paganini, his music is largely unknown to musicians other than those who play the instrument for which the music was written. A fair and objective critique of his output should take into account the fact that, occasionally, the emphasis on virtuosity and technique can be detrimental to the musical content and substance. Nevertheless, his more successful works combine this virtuosity with a high degree of musical integrity, qualities found in compositions such as the &quot;Symphonie-Passion&quot;, the &quot;Chemin de la Croix&quot;, the &quot;Preludes and Fugues&quot;, the &quot;Esquisses&quot; and &quot;Évocation&quot;, and the &quot;Cortège et Litanie&quot;.

As an improviser, Dupré excelled as perhaps no other did during the 20th century, and he was able to take given themes and spontaneously weave whole symphonies around them, often with elaborate contrapuntal devices including fugues. The achievement of these feats was partially due to his native genius and partially due to his extremely hard work doing paper exercises when he was not busy practising or composing.

Although his emphasis as composer was the organ, Dupré&#x27;s compositions also includes works for piano, orchestra and choir, as well as chamber music, and a number of transcriptions.

==Death and legacy==
Dupré died after suffering cardiac arrest in 1971 in Meudon (near Paris) at the age of 85, on Pentecost Sunday; playing for two services shortly beforehand. His wife, Jeanne-Claire Marguerite Dupré-Pascouau (his nickname for her was &#x27;Jeannette&#x27;) lived until 1978. She donated all of her husband&#x27;s musical manuscripts to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. His daughter Marguerite (later Dupré-Tollet) was a concert pianist (a pupil of Nikolai Medtner), and to a lesser extent, an organist.

The Association des amis de l&#x27;art de Marcel Dupré was founded in 1970 with the composer&#x27;s own consent to help promote his work. They own his former house in Meudon.

<text>Roger Désormière () (13 September 1898 – 25 October 1963) was a French conductor. He was an enthusiastic champion of contemporary composers, but also conducted performances of early eighteenth century French music.

==Life and career==
Désormière was born in Vichy in 1898. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, where his professors included Philippe Gaubert (flute), Xavier Leroux and Charles Koechlin (composition), and Vincent d&#x27;Indy (conducting). In 1922 he won the Prix Blumenthal and in 1923 became part of the Ecole d’Arcueil.

Désormière&#x27;s early conducting experience was largely with the Ballets suédois and Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. He was conductor of the Ballets suédois&#x27;s premiere of &quot;Relâche&quot; (1924), a film and music presentation by Francis Picabia and Erik Satie, with the film segment, &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot;, directed by René Clair. He then worked for the Diaghilev company from 1925 until the impresario&#x27;s death, conducting the premieres of &quot;Barabau&quot; by Vittorio Rieti, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; and &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier &quot; by Sergei Prokofiev, and &quot;La Chatte&quot; by Henri Sauguet.

From 1932 he became involved in music for films with Pathé-Nathan, composing music for &quot;La Règle du jeu&quot;, &quot;Le Mariage de Chiffon&quot;, and &quot;Le Voyageur de la Toussaint&quot;. He also conducted the orchestra in over 20 other films, such as &quot;Partie de campagne&quot;, &quot;Remorques&quot;, &quot;La Belle et la bête&quot;, and &quot;La Beauté du diable&quot;.

He conducted the first complete recording of Claude Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, the sessions taking place in the Salle de l&#x27;Ancien Conservatoire, Paris, from 24 April to 26 May 1941, during the Nazi occupation, with the 20-record set being issued in January 1942. He also recorded excerpts from Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;étoile&quot; with Opéra-Comique forces during the war.

Désormière was a member of the French Communist Party and personally a friend of Maurice Thorez. During the occupation of Paris he was a member of the Front National des Musiciens. Following the fall of France the composer Darius Milhaud was obliged to leave France. Désormière saved his paintings and personal possessions as well as paying the apartment rent during the Occupation.

He also won considerable fame as an enthusiastic champion of 20th-century repertoire: Satie, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Henri Dutilleux, and Maurice Duruflé all benefited from his advocacy of their pieces. At the other chronological extreme, Désormière edited and performed early music, reviving mostly forgotten compositions by the likes of François Couperin, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Michel Richard Delalande. From 1937 he was a leading conductor for the Paris Opéra-Comique, conducting, in addition to the creations below and recordings above, &quot;Une éducation manquée&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot;, &quot;Le médecin malgré lui&quot;, &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Enlèvement au Sérail&quot;. He became an associate director of the Paris Opéra from 1945 to 1946.

While driving in Rome during 1952, he suffered a massive paralytic stroke that ended all his musical activities. Aphasic for the rest of his life, he remained a recluse. He died in Paris in 1963.

<doc id="155466" wikidata="Q935950" url="?curid=155466" title="Paul Paray">
<text>Paul Marie-Adolphe Charles Paray (French: [pɔl paʁɛ]; 24 May 1886 – 10 October 1979) was a French conductor, organist and composer. After winning France&#x27;s top musical award, the Prix de Rome, he fought in the First World War and was a prisoner of war for nearly four years. He held a succession of chief conductorships, including those of the Lamoureux and Colonne Orchestras in Paris and the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra in Monaco. For ten years from 1952 he was chief conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, with which he made a celebrated series of recordings for Mercury Records&#x27; &quot;Living Presence&quot; series, many of which have been digitally released in the 21st century. 

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Paul Paray was born in Le Tréport, Normandy, on 10 October 1886, the second son and youngest of three children of Auguste Paray and his wife Hortense Picard. Auguste&#x27;s principal occupation was as an ivory sculptor, but he was also a working musician – organist of the church of Saint-Jacques au Tréport and musical director of the town’s municipal band and theatre. He gave his three children their first music lessons. Both sons sang in the choir of Rouen Cathedral, for which, aged fourteen, Paray composed his first Magnificat, which his biographer David Patmore writes has remained in the choir&#x27;s repertoire ever since.

With the help of Henri Dallier, organist of La Madeleine, Paris, Paray entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1904, where he studied harmony with Xavier Leroux and counterpoint and composition with Georges Caussade. He also studied with Charles Lenepveu and Paul Vidal. He played the piano, cello and timpani, but remained best known for his organ playing: in 1907 &quot;L&#x27;Ouest-Éclair&quot;, reporting a Saint Cecilia&#x27;s Day concert, singled out Paray&#x27;s organ playing for its perfection. After compulsory military service, not far from his home, in an infantry regiment in Dieppe, he accepted in 1909 the position of piano accompanist in the Parisian Cabaret des Quat&#x27;z&#x27;Arts an establishment directed by Gabriel Montoya. There he met Maurice Yvain, and became friends with several famous chansonniers of the time.

===Prix de Rome and First World War===
In 1911 Paray competed for France&#x27;s most prestigious musical prize, the Prix de Rome, and was awarded first prize for his cantata &quot;Yanitza&quot; by a jury that included Gabriel Fauré – director of the Conservatoire – and other composers including Camille Saint-Saëns. Charles-Marie Widor and Gabriel Pierné. Paray won the first prize with nineteen out of twenty votes.

The Prix de Rome brought with it two years&#x27; residence and study at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome. Shortly after his return to Paris the First World War broke out and Paray was conscripted into the French army. He was taken prisoner after two months&#x27; fighting and held in an internment camp at Darmstadt until the end of the war in 1918. He refused any musical collaboration with the Germans and he had no instrument, except for the modest harmonium he played on Sundays, to accompany the two religious services for Catholic and Protestant prisoners. Denied paper, he composed in his head, and after the war he transcribed the string quartet he had conceived while a prisoner.

===Conductor===
After his release, Paray conducted professionally for the first time at the Casino in Cauterets, and shortly afterwards, on Pierné&#x27;s recommendation, he made his début with the Lamoureux Orchestra in Paris and was appointed its assistant conductor in 1920. Camille Chevillard, the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor since 1897, died in May 1923; Paray was elected to succeed him. He remained with the orchestra for five years, including in his programmes the works of many French composers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Fauré, Debussy, Ravel and Ibert, whose he and the orchestra premiered in 1924, before it was taken up by better-known conductors including Arturo Toscanini and Leopold Stokowski. They also performed with several well-known solo players who were making their Paris débuts, including Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein and Yehudi Menuhin.

In 1928 Paray accepted the post of chief conductor of the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra and in the summer months he was also musical director at the Vichy Casino. In 1933 he moved to the Colonne Orchestra in Paris, succeeding Pierné as its chief conductor. He also worked at the Paris Opéra, where he conducted several operas by Wagner, including &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. While with the Colonne Orchestra, Paray engaged in a celebrated dispute with the music critic Émile Vuillermoz, who complained in print in 1935 about what he saw as the frequent inadequacy of the performances of new works at symphony concerts. From the Colonne platform Paray denounced Vuillermoz as hypocritical and venal.

===1939–1952===
The French government sent Paray to America to represent France at the 1939 World’s Fair, conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He made a sufficiently strong impression to be offered the post of co-conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Toscanini, but chose to return to France, just as the Second World War was about to start. The Colonne and Lamoureux Orchestras had merged to form a single ensemble, and Paray agreed to share its musical direction jointly with Eugène Bigot. After the German invasion of France in 1940 the Nazi administration wished to drop the name Colonne because the orchestra&#x27;s founder, Edouard Colonne, was of Jewish descent. Paray resigned and refused to appear again in occupied Paris. In Limoges and Marseille in Vichy France he conducted French Radio’s Orchestre National. Asked to identify the Jewish members of the orchestra, he refused, resigned and moved to neutral Monaco. According to Patmore, in Monte Carlo Paray helped many musicians and became an active member of the French resistance. He later criticised other musicians, most conspicuously Charles Munch and Arthur Honegger, who remained in Paris; the biographer D. Kern Holoman gives a different angle on this, writing that Paray stayed safely in Monte Carlo while Munch and Honegger, despite impeccable and personally dangerous anti-Nazi credentials, had the more challenging time by remaining in Paris. After a lawsuit, Paray had to retract his defamations and apologise. Holoman attributes Paray&#x27;s animus against Munch to &quot;simple jealousy&quot; of the latter&#x27;s professional eminence, outstripping his own.

Paray married his long-term partner, Yolande Falck in 1942. Returning to Paris after the Liberation he once again directed the Colonne Orchestra between 1945 and 1952. He toured Europe with the Vienna Philharmonic. He conducted the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in 1949 and was invited back every year, continuing to appear with the orchestra until shortly before his death. Following a successful appearance in America in 1951 with the recently reconstituted Detroit Symphony Orchestra, he was appointed as the orchestra’s chief conductor with effect from 1952.

===Detroit: 1952–1962===
For his first three years at Detroit, Paray managed to divide his activities between the US and Europe, but from 1956 he made his home in Detroit. He left the Colonne Orchestra (succeeded by Munch) and restricted his returns to France to two annual series of concerts, mainly with the Orchestre National de France. In Detroit – and also in Pittsburgh, New York and Philadelphia, where he was regularly invited – Paray took satisfaction in conducting, along with mainstream classical works, music by American and Canadian composers including Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Ned Rorem and Walter Piston.

In Detroit, Paray made a series of recordings, served by the new &quot;Living Presence&quot; technique of the Mercury record company – developed by Robert Fine and Wilma Cozart Fine – which were bestsellers in the United States, and were soon distributed worldwide. In October 1956 he conducted the inaugural concert at the Ford Auditorium in Detroit, in a programme that included his own &quot;Mass for the 550th Anniversary of Joan of Arc&quot;. He retired from the chief conductorship at Detroit in 1962 and was given the title of Emeritus Conductor. He returned to the orchestra for four weeks each year, from his home in Monte Carlo.

===Last years: 1962–1979===
As a freelance, Paray was continually invited to conduct major symphony orchestras in France and mainland Europe and in North America. At the age of 80 he conducted the Orchestre National de l&#x27;Opéra de Monte-Carlo on a tour of 43 concerts throughout the United States and Canada, from February to April 1966. A year later, replacing Munch at short notice, he took the Orchestre de Paris to Kiev, Moscow, Leningrad and Riga.

In July 1977, at the age of 91, Paray conducted an orchestral concert in honour of Marc Chagall&#x27;s 90th birthday celebrations in Nice. Shortly after conducting a concert in which his old friend Menuhin was soloist, Paray died in Monte Carlo on 10 October 1979 aged 93. At his wish, he was buried in the cemetery of his native Le Tréport.

==Reputation==
===Composer===
&quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot; describes Paray as &quot;the composer of several highly competent works&quot; including &quot;Yanita&quot;, the Mass, the Violin Sonata, a Cello Sonata (1919) a ballet – (1922), a Fantasie for piano and orchestra (1923) and two symphonies (1935 and 1940). &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; comments, &quot;As a composer he tended towards academic propriety&quot;.

===Conductor===
According to &quot;Grove&quot;, Paray gained a reputation as &quot;a reliable conductor in a wide range of the classical repertory&quot;. The British magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot;, reviewing the release of his Mercury recordings on 45 CDs, classed him as a great conductor and said that he created a magnificent ensemble during his ten years as the Detroit Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s music director. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of him, &quot;He was credited with establishing the Detroit Symphony as a thoroughly professional ensemble of national stature, and within two years after taking it over, he brought it to New York for its first concert here&quot;. The same paper remarked &quot;Mr Paray limited his conducting of 20th‐century works to those of a conservative stamp&quot;.

===Honours===
Paray was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1950. His awards included a doctorate of law from Wayne University, the City Medal from Tel Aviv, and honorary citizenships of Detroit, Diemeringen, Le Tréport and Monaco. He was named a Grand Officer of the Order of Grimaldi in 1967, and awarded the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit in 1971. In the Legion of Honour, like Saint-Saëns and Fauré before him, he was promoted to the highest rank, Grand Cross.

<doc id="155469" wikidata="Q26473" url="?curid=155469" title="Gregorian chant">
<text>Gregorian chant is the central tradition of Western plainchant, a form of monophonic, unaccompanied sacred song in Latin (and occasionally Greek) of the Roman Catholic Church. Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. Although popular legend credits Pope Gregory I with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later Carolingian synthesis of the Old Roman chant and Gallican chant.

Gregorian chants were organized initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 modes. Typical melodic features include a characteristic ambitus, and also characteristic intervallic patterns relative to a referential mode final, incipits and cadences, the use of reciting tones at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called centonization to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct tetrachords, producing a larger pitch system called the gamut. The chants can be sung by using six-note patterns called hexachords. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using neumes, an early form of musical notation from which the modern four-line and five-line staff developed. Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as organum, were an early stage in the development of Western polyphony.

Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by choirs of men and boys in churches, or by women and men of religious orders in their chapels. It is the music of the Roman Rite, performed in the Mass and the monastic Office. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, Ambrosian chant still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the Mozarabic chant of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship.

==History==

===Development of earlier plainchant===
Singing has been part of the Christian liturgy since the earliest days of the Church. It is widely accepted that the psalmody of ancient Jewish worship significantly influenced and contributed to early Christian ritual and chant. Christians read Scriptures and sang chants, as their Jewish predecessors had done. Although new Christian liturgy was developed, the source of much of this Christian liturgy was Jewish psalmody. The source materials for newly emergent Christian chants were originally transmitted by Jews in sung form. Early Christian rites also incorporated elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. Canonical hours have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. &quot;Amen&quot; and &quot;alleluia&quot; come from Hebrew, and the threefold &quot;sanctus&quot; derives from the threefold &quot;kadosh&quot; of the Kedushah.

The New Testament mentions singing hymns during the Last Supper: &quot;When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives&quot; (). Other ancient witnesses such as Pope Clement I, Tertullian, St. Athanasius, and Egeria confirm the practice, although in poetic or obscure ways that shed little light on how music sounded during this period. 

Musical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot;, attributed to the theologian Hippolytus, attests the singing of Hallel (Jewish) psalms with Alleluia as the refrain in early Christian &quot;agape&quot; feasts. Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following St. Anthony introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, antiphonal psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, St. Ambrose introduced this practice to the West. In the fifth century, a singing school, the Schola Cantorum, was founded at Rome to provide training in church musicianship.

Scholars are still debating how plainchant developed during the 5th through the 9th centuries, as information from this period is scarce. Around 410, St. Augustine described the responsorial singing of a Gradual psalm at Mass. At c. 520, Benedict of Nursia established what is called the rule of St. Benedict, in which the protocol of the Divine Office for monastic use was laid down. Around 678, Roman chant was taught at York. Distinctive regional traditions of Western plainchant arose during this period, notably in the British Isles (Celtic chant), Spain (Mozarabic), Gaul (Gallican), and Italy (Old Roman, Ambrosian and Beneventan). These traditions may have evolved from a hypothetical year-round repertory of 5th-century plainchant after the western Roman Empire collapsed.

John the Deacon, biographer (c. 872) of Pope Gregory I, modestly claimed that the saint &quot;compiled a patchwork antiphonary&quot;, unsurprisingly, given his considerable work with liturgical development. He reorganized the Schola Cantorum and established a more uniform standard in church services, gathering chants from among the regional traditions as widely as he could manage. Of those, he retained what he could, revised where necessary, and assigned particular chants to the various services. According to Donald Jay Grout, his goal was to organize the bodies of chants from diverse traditions into a uniform and orderly whole for use by the entire western region of the Church. His renowned love for music was recorded only 34 years after his death; the epitaph of Honorius testified that comparison to Gregory was already considered the highest praise for a music-loving pope. While later legends magnified his real achievements, these significant steps may account for why his name came to be attached to Gregorian chant.

===Origins of mature plainchant===

The Gregorian repertory was further systematized for use in the Roman Rite, and scholars weigh the relative influences of Roman and Carolingian practices upon the development of plainchant. The late 8th century saw a steadily increasing influence of the Carolingian monarchs over the popes. During a visit to Gaul in 752–753, Pope Stephen II celebrated Mass using Roman chant. According to Charlemagne, his father Pepin abolished the local Gallican Rites in favor of the Roman use, to strengthen ties with Rome. Thirty years later (785–786), at Charlemagne&#x27;s request, Pope Adrian I sent a papal sacramentary with Roman chants to the Carolingian court. According to James McKinnon, over a brief period in the 8th century, a project overseen by Chrodegang of Metz in the favorable atmosphere of the Carolingian monarchs, also compiled the core liturgy of the Roman Mass and promoted its use in Francia and throughout Gaul.

Willi Apel and Robert Snow assert a scholarly consensus that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from a synthesis of Roman and Gallican chants, and was commissioned by the Carolingian rulers in France. Andreas Pfisterer and Peter Jeffery have shown that older melodic essentials from Roman chant are clear in the synthesized chant repertory. There were other developments as well. Chants were modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and fitted into the theory of the ancient Greek octoechos system of modes in a manner that created what later came to be known as the western system of the eight church modes. The Metz project also invented an innovative musical notation, using freeform neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. This notation was further developed over time, culminating in the introduction of staff lines (attributed to Guido d&#x27;Arezzo) in the early 11th century, what we know today as plainchant notation. The whole body of Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, coalesced into a single body of chant that was called &quot;Gregorian.&quot;

The changes made in the new system of chants were so significant that they have led some scholars to speculate that it was named in honor of the contemporary Pope Gregory II. Nevertheless, the lore surrounding Pope Gregory I was sufficient to culminate in his portrayal as the actual author of Gregorian Chant. He was often depicted as receiving the dictation of plainchant from a dove representing the Holy Spirit, thus giving Gregorian chant the stamp of being divinely inspired. Scholars agree that the melodic content of much Gregorian Chant did not exist in that form in Gregory I&#x27;s day. In addition, it is known definitively that the familiar neumatic system for notating plainchant had not been established in his time. Nevertheless, Gregory&#x27;s authorship is popularly accepted by some as fact to this day.

===Dissemination and hegemony===
Gregorian chant appeared in a remarkably uniform state across Europe within a short time. Charlemagne, once elevated to Holy Roman Emperor, aggressively spread Gregorian chant throughout his empire to consolidate religious and secular power, requiring the clergy to use the new repertory on pain of death. From English and German sources, Gregorian chant spread north to Scandinavia, Iceland and Finland. In 885, Pope Stephen V banned the Slavonic liturgy, leading to the ascendancy of Gregorian chant in Eastern Catholic lands including Poland, Moravia and Slovakia.

The other plainchant repertories of the Christian West faced severe competition from the new Gregorian chant. Charlemagne continued his father&#x27;s policy of favoring the Roman Rite over the local Gallican traditions. By the 9th century the Gallican rite and chant had effectively been eliminated, although not without local resistance. The Gregorian chant of the Sarum Rite displaced Celtic chant. Gregorian coexisted with Beneventan chant for over a century before Beneventan chant was abolished by papal decree (1058). Mozarabic chant survived the influx of the Visigoths and Moors, but not the Roman-backed prelates newly installed in Spain during the Reconquista. Restricted to a handful of dedicated chapels, modern Mozarabic chant is highly Gregorianized and bears no musical resemblance to its original form. Ambrosian chant alone survived to the present day, preserved in Milan due to the musical reputation and ecclesiastical authority of St. Ambrose.

Gregorian chant eventually replaced the local chant tradition of Rome itself, which is now known as Old Roman chant. In the 10th century, virtually no musical manuscripts were being notated in Italy. Instead, Roman Popes imported Gregorian chant from (German) Holy Roman Emperors during the 10th and 11th centuries. For example, the Credo was added to the Roman Rite at the behest of the Emperor Henry II in 1014. Reinforced by the legend of Pope Gregory, Gregorian chant was taken to be the authentic, original chant of Rome, a misconception that continues to this day. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had supplanted or marginalized all the other Western plainchant traditions.

Later sources of these other chant traditions show an increasing Gregorian influence, such as occasional efforts to categorize their chants into the Gregorian modes. Similarly, the Gregorian repertory incorporated elements of these lost plainchant traditions, which can be identified by careful stylistic and historical analysis. For example, the &quot;Improperia&quot; of Good Friday are believed to be a remnant of the Gallican repertory.

===Early sources and later revisions===
The first extant sources with musical notation were written around 930 (Graduale Laon). Before this, plainchant had been transmitted orally. Most scholars of Gregorian chant agree that the development of music notation assisted the dissemination of chant across Europe. The earlier notated manuscripts are primarily from Regensburg in Germany, St. Gall in Switzerland, Laon and St. Martial in France.

Gregorian chant has in its long history been subjected to a series of redactions to bring it up to changing contemporary tastes and practice. The more recent redaction undertaken in the Benedictine Abbey of St. Pierre, Solesmes, has turned into a huge undertaking to restore the allegedly corrupted chant to a hypothetical &quot;original&quot; state. Early Gregorian chant was revised to conform to the theoretical structure of the modes. In 1562–63, the Council of Trent banned most sequences. Guidette&#x27;s &quot;Directorium chori&quot;, published in 1582, and the &quot;Editio medicea&quot;, published in 1614, drastically revised what was perceived as corrupt and flawed &quot;barbarism&quot; by making the chants conform to contemporary aesthetic standards. In 1811, the French musicologist Alexandre-Étienne Choron, as part of a conservative backlash following the liberal Catholic orders&#x27; inefficacy during the French Revolution, called for returning to the &quot;purer&quot; Gregorian chant of Rome over French corruptions.

In the late 19th century, early liturgical and musical manuscripts were unearthed and edited. Earlier, Dom Prosper Guéranger revived the monastic tradition in Solesmes. Re-establishing the Divine Office was among his priorities, but no proper chantbooks existed. Many monks were sent out to libraries throughout Europe to find relevant Chant manuscripts. In 1871, however, the old Medicea edition was reprinted (Pustet, Regensburg) which Pope Pius IX declared the only official version. In their firm belief that they were on the right way, Solesmes increased its efforts. In 1889, after decades of research, the monks of Solesmes released the first book in a planned series, the Paléographie Musicale. The incentive of its publication was to demonstrate the corruption of the &#x27;Medicea&#x27; by presenting photographed notations originating from a great variety of manuscripts of one single chant, which Solesmes called forth as witnesses to assert their own reforms.

The monks of Solesmes brought in their heaviest artillery in this battle, as indeed the academically sound &#x27;Paleo&#x27; was intended to be a war-tank, meant to abolish once and for all the corrupted Pustet edition. On the evidence of congruence throughout various manuscripts (which were duly published in facsimile editions with ample editorial introductions) Solesmes was able to work out a practical reconstruction. This reconstructed chant was academically praised, but rejected by Rome until 1903, when Pope Leo XIII died. His successor, Pope Pius X, promptly accepted the Solesmes chant – now compiled as the &quot;Liber usualis&quot; – as authoritative. In 1904, the Vatican edition of the Solesmes chant was commissioned. Serious academic debates arose, primarily owing to stylistic liberties taken by the Solesmes editors to impose their controversial interpretation of rhythm. The Solesmes editions insert phrasing marks and note-lengthening &quot;episema&quot; and &quot;mora&quot; marks not found in the original sources.

Conversely, they omit significative letters found in the original sources, which give instructions for rhythm and articulation such as speeding up or slowing down. These editorial practices have placed the historical authenticity of the Solesmes interpretation in doubt. Ever since restoration of Chant was taken up in Solesmes, there have been lengthy discussions of exactly what course was to be taken. Some favored a strict academic rigour and wanted to postpone publications, while others concentrated on practical matters and wanted to supplant the corrupted tradition as soon as possible. Roughly a century later, there still exists a breach between a strict musicological approach and the practical needs of church choirs. Thus the performance tradition officially promulgated since the onset of the Solesmes restoration is substantially at odds with musicological evidence.

In his motu proprio &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot;, Pius X mandated the use of Gregorian chant, encouraging the faithful to sing the Ordinary of the Mass, although he reserved the singing of the Propers for males. While this custom is maintained in traditionalist Catholic communities (most of which allow all-female scholas as well, though), the Catholic Church no longer persists with this ban. Vatican II officially allowed worshipers to substitute other music, particularly sacred polyphony, in place of Gregorian chant, although it did reaffirm that Gregorian chant was still the official music of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and the music most suitable for worship in the Roman Liturgy.

==Musical form==

===Melodic types===
Gregorian chant is, as &#x27;chant&#x27; implies, vocal music. The text, the phrases, words and eventually the syllables, can be sung in various ways. The most straightforward is recitation on the same tone, which is called &quot;syllabic&quot; as each syllable is sung to a single tone. Likewise, simple chants are often syllabic throughout with only a few instances where two or more notes are sung on one syllable. &quot;Neumatic&quot; chants are more embellished and ligatures, a connected group of notes, written as a single compound neume, abound in the text. Melismatic chants are the most ornate chants in which elaborate melodies are sung on long sustained vowels as in the Alleluia, ranging from five or six notes per syllable to over sixty in the more prolix melismata.
Gregorian chants fall into two broad categories of melody: recitatives and free melodies. The simplest kind of melody is the liturgical recitative. Recitative melodies are dominated by a single pitch, called the &quot;reciting tone&quot;. Other pitches appear in melodic formulae for incipits, partial cadences, and full cadences. These chants are primarily syllabic. For example, the Collect for Easter consists of 127 syllables sung to 131 pitches, with 108 of these pitches being the reciting note A and the other 23 pitches flexing down to G. Liturgical recitatives are commonly found in the accentus chants of the liturgy, such as the intonations of the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel during the Mass, and in the direct psalmody of the Office.

Psalmodic chants, which intone psalms, include both recitatives and free melodies. Psalmodic chants include &quot;direct psalmody&quot;, &quot;antiphonal chants&quot;, and &quot;responsorial chants&quot;. In direct psalmody, psalm verses are sung without refrains to simple, formulaic tones. Most psalmodic chants are antiphonal and responsorial, sung to free melodies of varying complexity.

Antiphonal chants such as the Introit, and Communion originally referred to chants in which two choirs sang in alternation, one choir singing verses of a psalm, the other singing a refrain called an &quot;antiphon&quot;. Over time, the verses were reduced in number, usually to just one psalm verse and the doxology, or even omitted entirely. Antiphonal chants reflect their ancient origins as elaborate recitatives through the reciting tones in their melodies. Ordinary chants, such as the Kyrie and Gloria, are not considered antiphonal chants, although they are often performed in antiphonal style.

Responsorial chants such as the Gradual, Alleluia, Offertory, and the Office Responsories originally consisted of a refrain called a &quot;respond&quot; sung by a choir, alternating with psalm verses sung by a soloist. Responsorial chants are often composed of an amalgamation of various stock musical phrases, pieced together in a practice called &quot;centonization&quot;. Tracts are melismatic settings of psalm verses and use frequent recurring cadences and they are strongly centonized.

Gregorian chant evolved to fulfill various functions in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Broadly speaking, liturgical recitatives are used for texts intoned by deacons or priests. Antiphonal chants accompany liturgical actions: the entrance of the officiant, the collection of offerings, and the distribution of the Eucharist. Responsorial chants expand on readings and lessons.

The non-psalmodic chants, including the Ordinary of the Mass, sequences, and hymns, were originally intended for congregational singing. The structure of their texts largely defines their musical style. In sequences, the same melodic phrase is repeated in each couplet. The strophic texts of hymns use the same syllabic melody for each stanza.

===Modality===

Early plainchant, like much of Western music, is believed to have been distinguished by the use of the diatonic scale. Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the Enchiriadis group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the diatonic framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A diatonic scale with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by Hucbald, who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant.

Around 1025, Guido d&#x27;Arezzo revolutionized Western music with the development of the &quot;gamut&quot;, in which pitches in the singing range were organized into overlapping hexachords. Hexachords could be built on C (the natural hexachord, C-D-E^F-G-A), F (the soft hexachord, using a B-flat, F-G-A^B-C-D), or G (the hard hexachord, using a B-natural, G-A-B^C-D-E). The B-flat was an integral part of the system of hexachords rather than an accidental. The use of notes outside of this collection was described as musica ficta.

Gregorian chant was categorized into eight modes, influenced by the eightfold division of Byzantine chants called the &quot;oktoechos&quot;. Each mode is distinguished by its &quot;final&quot;, &quot;dominant&quot;, and &quot;ambitus&quot;. The &quot;final&quot; is the ending note, which is usually an important note in the overall structure of the melody. The &quot;dominant&quot; is a secondary pitch that usually serves as a reciting tone in the melody. &quot;Ambitus&quot; refers to the range of pitches used in the melody. Melodies whose final is in the middle of the ambitus, or which have only a limited ambitus, are categorized as &quot;plagal&quot;, while melodies whose final is in the lower end of the ambitus and have a range of over five or six notes are categorized as &quot;authentic&quot;. Although corresponding plagal and authentic modes have the same final, they have different dominants. The existent pseudo-Greek names of the modes, rarely used in medieval times, derive from a misunderstanding of the Ancient Greek modes; the prefix &quot;&quot; (under, Gr.) indicates a plagal mode, where the melody moves below the final. In contemporary Latin manuscripts the modes are simply called Protus authentus /plagalis, Deuterus, Tritus and Tetrardus: the 1st mode, authentic or plagal, the 2nd mode etc. In the Roman Chantbooks the modes are indicated by Roman numerals.

:Modes 1 and 2 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on D, sometimes called Dorian and Hypodorian.
:Modes 3 and 4 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on E, sometimes called Phrygian and Hypophrygian.
:Modes 5 and 6 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on F, sometimes called Lydian and Hypolydian.
:Modes 7 and 8 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on G, sometimes called Mixolydian and Hypomixolydian.

Although the modes with melodies ending on A, B, and C are sometimes referred to as Aeolian, Locrian, and Ionian, these are not considered distinct modes and are treated as transpositions of whichever mode uses the same set of hexachords. The actual pitch of the Gregorian chant is not fixed, so the piece can be sung in whichever range is most comfortable.

Certain classes of Gregorian chant have a separate musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of the chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the psalm verses that are sung between the repetition of antiphons, or the Gloria Patri. Thus we find models for the recitation of psalmverses, Alleluia and Gloria Patri for all eight modes.

Not every Gregorian chant fits neatly into Guido&#x27;s hexachords or into the system of eight modes. For example, there are chants – especially from German sources – whose neumes suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system, or in other words, employing a form of chromaticism. Early Gregorian chant, like Ambrosian and Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, did not use the modal system. The great need for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office. Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century Cistercian reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismata trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed. Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants – notably Communions – defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion &quot;Circuibo&quot; was transcribed using a different mode in each.

===Musical idiom===
Several features besides modality contribute to the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily stepwise. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as Ambrosian chant or Beneventan chant. Gregorian melodies are more likely to traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C.&gt; Gregorian melodies often explore chains of pitches, such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate. Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the Offertories; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the Kyrie and Agnus Dei; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the Gloria, and the Credo.

Chants sometimes fall into melodically related groups. The musical phrases centonized to create Graduals and Tracts follow a musical &quot;grammar&quot; of sorts. Certain phrases are used only at the beginnings of chants, or only at the end, or only in certain combinations, creating musical families of chants such as the &quot;Iustus ut palma&quot; family of Graduals. Several Introits in mode 3, including &quot;Loquetur Dominus&quot; above, exhibit melodic similarities. Mode III (E authentic) chants have C as a dominant, so C is the expected reciting tone. These mode III Introits, however, use both G and C as reciting tones, and often begin with a decorated leap from G to C to establish this tonality. Similar examples exist throughout the repertory.

===Notation===

The earliest notated sources of Gregorian chant (written ) used symbols called &quot;neumes&quot; (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography that seems to focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.
Scholars postulate that this practice may have been derived from cheironomic hand-gestures, the ekphonetic notation of Byzantine chant, punctuation marks, or diacritical accents. Later adaptations and innovations included the use of a dry-scratched line or an inked line or two lines, marked C or F showing the relative pitches between neumes. Consistent relative heightening first developed in the Aquitaine region, particularly at St. Martial de Limoges, in the first half of the eleventh century. Many German-speaking areas, however, continued to use unpitched neumes into the twelfth century. Additional symbols developed, such as the &quot;custos&quot;, placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter &quot;t&quot; to indicate a tenuto. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as Shaker music is notated.
By the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in &quot;square notation&quot; on a four-line staff with a clef, as in the &quot;Graduale Aboense&quot; pictured above. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. When a syllable has a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. The oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes indicate special vocal treatments, that have been largely neglected due to uncertainty as to how to sing them. Since the 1970s, with the influential insights of Dom (see below under &#x27;rhythm&#x27;), ornamental neumes have received more attention from both researchers and performers.
B-flat is indicated by a &quot;b-mollum&quot; (Lat. soft), a rounded undercaste &#x27;b&#x27; placed to the left of the entire neume in which the note occurs, as shown in the &quot;Kyrie&quot; to the right. When necessary, a &quot;b-durum&quot; (Lat. hard), written squarely, indicates B-natural and serves to cancel the b-mollum. This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.

==Performance==

===Texture===
Gregorian chant was originally used for singing the Office (by male and female religious) and for singing the parts of the Mass pertaining to the lay faithful (male and female), the celebrant (priest, always male) and the choir (composed of male ordained clergy, except in convents). Outside the larger cities, the number of available clergy dropped, and lay men started singing these parts. The choir was considered an official liturgical duty reserved to clergy, so women were not allowed to sing in the &quot;Schola Cantorum&quot; or other choirs except in convents where women were permitted to sing the Office and the parts of the Mass pertaining to the choir as a function of their consecrated life.

Chant was normally sung in unison. Later innovations included &quot;tropes&quot;, which is a new text sung to the same melodic phrases in a melismatic chant (repeating an entire Alleluia-melody on a new text for instance, or repeating a full phrase with a new text that comments on the previously sung text) and various forms of &quot;organum&quot;, (improvised) harmonic embellishment of chant melodies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor organum, however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended melisma of Alleluia chants known as the jubilus, but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The Council of Trent struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi and All Souls&#x27; Day.

Not much is known about the particular vocal stylings or performance practices used for Gregorian chant in the Middle Ages. On occasion, the clergy was urged to have their singers perform with more restraint and piety. This suggests that virtuosic performances occurred, contrary to the modern stereotype of Gregorian chant as slow-moving mood music. This tension between musicality and piety goes far back; Gregory the Great himself criticized the practice of promoting clerics based on their charming singing rather than their preaching. However, Odo of Cluny, a renowned monastic reformer, praised the intellectual and musical virtuosity to be found in chant:

True antiphonal performance by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice appears to have begun in the Middle Ages. Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing the end of the opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of the chant for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.

===Rhythm===
Given the oral teaching tradition of Gregorian chant, modern reconstruction of intended rhythm from the written notation of Gregorian chant has always been a source of debate among modern scholars. To complicate matters further, many ornamental neumes used in the earliest manuscripts pose difficulties on the interpretation of rhythm. Certain neumes such as the &quot;pressus&quot;, pes quassus, strophic neumes may indicate repeated notes, lengthening by repercussion, in some cases with added ornaments. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.

While the standard repertory of Gregorian Chant was partly being supplanted by new forms of polyphony, the earlier melo-rhythmic refinements of monophonic chant seem to have fallen into disuse. Later redactions such as the &quot;Editio medicaea&quot; of 1614 rewrote chant so that melismata, with their melodic accent, fell on accented syllables. This aesthetic held sway until the re-examination of chant in the late 19th century by such scholars as , Pothier, and Mocquereau, who fell into two camps.

One school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, advocated imposing rhythmic meters on chants, although they disagreed on how that should be done. An opposing interpretation, represented by Pothier and Mocquereau, supported a free rhythm of equal note values, although some notes are lengthened for textual emphasis or musical effect. The modern Solesmes editions of Gregorian chant follow this interpretation. Mocquereau divided melodies into two- and three-note phrases, each beginning with an &quot;ictus&quot;, akin to a beat, notated in chantbooks as a small vertical mark. These basic melodic units combined into larger phrases through a complex system expressed by cheironomic hand-gestures. This approach prevailed during the twentieth century, propagated by Justine Ward&#x27;s program of music education for children, until the liturgical role of chant was diminished after the liturgical reforms of Pope Paul VI, and new scholarship &quot;essentially discredited&quot; Mocquereau&#x27;s rhythmic theories.

Common modern practice favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons. The text determines the accent while the melodic contour determines the phrasing. The note lengthenings recommended by the Solesmes school remain influential, though not prescriptive.

Dom (1905–1988), a monk from Solesmes, published his &#x27;Semiologie Gregorienne&#x27; in 1970 in which he clearly explains the musical significance of the neumes of the early chant manuscripts. Cardine shows the great diversity of neumes and graphic variations of the basic shape of a particular neume, which can not be expressed in the square notation. This variety in notation must have served a practical purpose and therefore a musical significance. Nine years later, the &quot;Graduale Triplex&quot; was published, in which the Roman Gradual, containing all the chants for Mass in a Year&#x27;s cycle, appeared with the neumes of the two most important manuscripts copied under and over the 4-line staff of the square notation. The &quot;Graduale Triplex&quot; made widely accessible the original notation of Sankt Gallen and Laon (compiled after 930 AD) in a single chantbook and was a huge step forward. Dom Cardine had many students who have each in their own way continued their semiological studies, some of whom also started experimenting in applying the newly understood principles in performance practice.

The studies of Cardine and his students (Godehard Joppich, Luigi Augustoni, Johannes B. Göschl, Marie-Noël Colette, Rupert Fischer, Marie-Claire Billecocq, Alexander M. Schweitzer to name a few) have clearly demonstrated that rhythm in Gregorian chant as notated in the 10th century rhythmic manuscripts (notably Sankt Gallen and Laon) manifest such rhythmic diversity and melodic – rhythmic ornamentations for which there is hardly a living performance tradition in the Western world. Contemporary groups that endeavour to sing according to the manuscript traditions have evolved after 1975. Some practising researchers favour a closer look at non-Western (liturgical) traditions, in such cultures where the tradition of modal monophony was never abandoned.

Another group with different views are the mensuralists or the proportionalists, who maintain that rhythm has to be interpreted proportionately, where shorts are exactly half the longs. This school of interpretation claims the support of historical authorities such as St Augustine, Remigius, Guido and Aribo. This view is advocated by John Blackley and his &#x27;Schola Antiqua New York&#x27;.

Recent research in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology. Starting with the expectation that the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the expressivity of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis.

Beside the length of the syllables (measured in tenths of seconds), each text syllable was evaluated in terms of its position within the word to which it belongs, defining such variables as &quot;the syllable has or has not the main accent&quot;, &quot;the syllable is or is not at the end of a word&quot;, etc., and in terms of the particular sounds produced (for instance, the syllable contains the vowel &quot;i&quot;). The various neume elements were evaluated by attaching different duration values to them, both in terms of semiological propositions (nuanced durations according to the manner of neume writing in Chris Hakkennes&#x27; &quot;Graduale Lagal&quot;), and in terms of fixed duration values that were based on mensuralistic notions, however with ratios between short and long notes ranging from 1 : 1, via 1 : 1.2, 1 : 1.4, etc. to 1 : 3. To distinguish short and long notes, tables were consulted that were established by Van Kampen in an unpublished comparative study regarding the neume notations according to Sankt Gallen and Laon codices. With some exceptions, these tables confirm the short vs. long distinctions in Cardine&#x27;s &#x27;Semiologie Gregorienne&#x27;.

The lengths of the neumes were given values by adding up the duration values for the separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed in relation to the total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables &#x27;accented syllable&#x27; and &#x27;contextual syllable duration&#x27;. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (&quot;R&quot;) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (&quot;R&quot; is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.

The distinction between the first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms &quot;metrum&quot; and &quot;rhythmus&quot;. As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the word accent (see also), the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).

During the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in France, the system of rhythmic notation became standardized, with printers and editors of chant books employing only four rhythmic values. Recent research by Christopher Holman indicates that chants whose texts are in a regular meter could even be altered to be performed in time signatures.

===Melodic restitution===

Recent developments involve an intensifying of the semiological approach according to Dom Cardine, which also gave a new impetus to the research into melodic variants in various manuscripts of chant. On the basis of this ongoing research it has become obvious that the Graduale and other chantbooks contain many melodic errors, some very consistently, (the mis-interpretation of third and eighth mode) necessitating a new edition of the Graduale according to state-of-the-art melodic restitutions. Since the 1970 a melodic restitution group of AISCGre (International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant) has worked on an &quot;editio magis critica&quot; as requested by the 2. Vatican Council Constitution &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;. As a response to this need and following the Holy See&#x27;s invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011 the first volume &quot;De Dominicis et Festis&quot; of the &quot;Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117&quot; was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg.

In this approach the so-called earlier &#x27;rhythmic&#x27; manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry a wealth of melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later &#x27;melodic&#x27; manuscripts&#x27; that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison between the two groups has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the &quot;Graduale Triplex&quot;. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation &#x27;simplex&#x27; in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Sankt Gallen.

Referring to these manuscripts, he called his own transcription Gradual Lagal. Furthermore, while making the transcription, he cross-checked with the melodic manuscripts to correct modal errors or other melodic errors found in the Graduale Romanum. His intention was to provide a corrected melody in rhythmic notation but above all – he was also a choirmaster – suited for practical use, therefore a simplex, integrated notation. Although fully admitting the importance of Hakkennes&#x27; melodic revisions, the rhythmical solution suggested in the &quot;Graduale Lagal&quot; was actually found by Van Kampen (see above) to be rather modestly related to the text of the chant.

==Liturgical functions==
Gregorian chant is sung in the Office during the canonical hours and in the liturgy of the Mass. Texts known as &quot;accentus&quot; are intoned by bishops, priests, and deacons, mostly on a single reciting tone with simple melodic formulae at certain places in each sentence. More complex chants are sung by trained soloists and choirs. The Graduale Romanum contains the proper chants of the Mass (i.e., Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Offertory, Communion) and the complete Kyriale (the collection of Mass Ordinary settings). The &quot;Liber usualis&quot; contains the chants for the Graduale Romanum and the most commonly used Office chants.

===Proper chants of the Mass===
The Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Sequence, Offertory and Communion chants are part of the Proper of the Mass. &quot;Proprium Missae&quot; in Latin refers to the chants of the Mass that have their proper individual texts for each Sunday throughout the annual cycle, as opposed to &#x27;Ordinarium Missae&#x27; which have fixed texts (but various melodies) (Kyrie, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei).

Introits cover the procession of the officiants. Introits are antiphonal chants, typically consisting of an antiphon, a psalm verse, a repeat of the antiphon, an intonation of the Gloria Patri Doxology, and a final repeat of the antiphon. Reciting tones often dominate their melodic structures.

Graduals are responsorial chants that follow the reading of the Epistle. Graduals usually result from &quot;centonization&quot;; stock musical phrases are assembled like a patchwork to create the full melody of the chant, creating families of musically related melodies. Graduals are accompanied by an elaborate Verse, so that it actually consists in two different parts, A B. Often the first part is sung again, creating a &#x27;rondeau&#x27; A B A. At least the verse, if not the complete gradual, is for the solo cantor and are in elaborate, ornate style with long, wide-ranged melismata.

The Alleluia is known for the &quot;jubilus&quot;, an extended joyful melisma on the last vowel of &#x27;Alleluia&#x27;. The Alleluia is also in two parts, the alleluia proper and the psalmverse, by which the Alleluia is identified (Alleluia V. Pascha nostrum). The last melisma of the verse is the same as the jubilus attached to the Alleluia. Alleluias are not sung during penitential times, such as Lent. Instead, a Tract is chanted, usually with texts from the Psalms.

Sequences are sung poems based on couplets. Although many sequences are not part of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as &quot;Victimae paschali laudes&quot; and &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot;. According to Notker Balbulus, an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of words to the long melismata of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.

===Ordinary chants of the Mass===
The Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei use the same text in every service of the Mass. Because they follow the regular invariable &quot;order&quot; of the Mass, these chants are called &quot;Ordinary&quot;.

The Kyrie consists of a threefold repetition of &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (&quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;), a threefold repetition of &quot;Christe eleison&quot; (&quot;Christ have mercy&quot;), followed by another threefold repetition of &quot;Kyrie eleison.&quot; In older chants, &quot;Kyrie eleison imas&quot; (&quot;Lord, have mercy on us&quot;) can be found. The Kyrie is distinguished by its use of the Greek language instead of Latin. Because of the textual repetition, various musical repeat structures occur in these chants. The following, Kyrie ad. lib. VI as transmitted in a Cambrai manuscript, uses the form ABA CDC EFE&#x27;, with shifts in tessitura between sections. The E&#x27; section, on the final &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot;, itself has an aa&#x27;b structure, contributing to the sense of climax.
The Gloria recites the Greater Doxology, and the Credo intones the Nicene Creed. Because of the length of these texts, these chants often break into musical subsections corresponding with textual breaks. Because the Credo was the last Ordinary chant to be added to the Mass, there are relatively few Credo melodies in the Gregorian corpus.

The Sanctus and the Agnus Dei, like the Kyrie, also contain repeated texts, which their musical structures often exploit.

Technically, the Ite missa est and the Benedicamus Domino, which conclude the Mass, belong to the Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, but because they are short and simple, and have rarely been the subject of later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.

===Chants of the Office===
Gregorian chant is sung in the canonical hours of the monastic Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the Psalms, in the Great Responsories of Matins, and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and Compline. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories.

At the close of the Office, one of four &quot;Marian antiphons&quot; is sung. These songs, &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot; (see top of article), &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot;, &quot;Regina caeli laetare&quot;, and &quot;Salve, Regina&quot;, are relatively late chants, dating to the 11th century, and considerably more complex than most Office antiphons. Willi Apel has described these four songs as &quot;among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages&quot;.

==Influence==

===Medieval and Renaissance music===
Gregorian chant had a significant impact on the development of medieval and Renaissance music. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other kinds of music. Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called rhythmic modes. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the musical staff had become standard. The bass clef and the flat, natural, and sharp accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.

Gregorian melodies provided musical material and served as models for tropes and liturgical dramas. Vernacular hymns such as &quot;Christ ist erstanden&quot; and &quot;Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist&quot; adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance &quot;In Nomine&quot; were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as organum, Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance polyphony. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would be used as a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot;, were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the Baroque period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.

The Catholic Church later allowed polyphonic arrangements to replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like Palestrina or Mozart, features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of the Propers were William Byrd and Tomás Luis de Victoria. These polyphonic arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.

<text>Abingdon-on-Thames ( ), commonly known as Abingdon, is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Thames in the Vale of the White Horse district of Oxfordshire, England. The historic county town of Berkshire, the area was occupied from the early to middle Iron Age and the remains of a late Iron Age and Roman defensive enclosure lies below the town centre. Abingdon Abbey was founded around 676, giving its name to the emerging town. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Abingdon was an agricultural centre with an extensive trade in wool, alongside weaving and the manufacture of clothing. Charters for the holding of markets and fairs were granted by various monarchs, from Edward I to George II.

The town survived the dissolution of the abbey in 1538, and by the 18th and 19th centuries, with the building of Abingdon Lock in 1790 and the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal in 1810, Abingdon was on important routes for goods transport. In 1856 the Abingdon Railway opened, linking the town with the Great Western Railway. The canal was abandoned in 1906 but a voluntary trust is now working to restore and re-open it. Abingdon railway station was closed to passengers in September 1963. The line remained open for goods until 1984, its role including serving the MG car factory, which operated from 1929 to 1980.

Abingdon&#x27;s brewery, Morland, makers of Old Speckled Hen ale, was taken over and closed in 1999; the site of the brewery has been redeveloped into housing. The rock band Radiohead formed in 1985 when its members were studying at Abingdon School, a day and boarding independent secondary school. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 33,130. This was 2,504 more than in the 2001 Census total of 30,626, and represented just over 8% growth in the population.

==History==

A Neolithic stone hand axe was found at Abingdon. Petrological analysis in 1940 identified the stone as epidotised tuff from Stake Pass in the Lake District, to the north. Stone axes from the same source have been found at Sutton Courtenay, Alvescot, Kencot and Minster Lovell. Abingdon has been occupied from the early to middle Iron Age and the remains of a late Iron Age defensive enclosure (or oppidum) lies below the town centre. The oppidum was in use throughout the Roman occupation. A Neolithic causewayed enclosure was found in Abingdon in 1926, dating to the 36th or 37th century BC. A Roman villa and subsequent Saxon farmstead buildings have been excavated at Barton Court Farm.

Abingdon Abbey was founded in Saxon times, possibly around 676, but its early history is confused by numerous legends, invented to raise its status and explain the place name. The name seems to mean &#x27;Hill of a man named Æbba, or a woman named Æbbe&#x27;, possibly the saint to whom St Ebbe&#x27;s Church in Oxford was dedicated (Æbbe of Coldingham or a different Æbbe of Oxford). However, Abingdon stands in a valley and not on a hill. It is thought that the name was first given to a place on Boars Hill above Chilswell, and the name was transferred to its present site when the Abbey was moved. In 1084, William the Conqueror celebrated Easter at the Abbey and it is possible that his son Henry I received some schooling at the abbey.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, Abingdon was a flourishing agricultural centre with an extensive trade in wool and a famous weaving and clothing manufacturing industry. The abbot seems to have held a market from very early times and charters for the holding of markets and fairs were granted by various sovereigns, from Edward I to George II. In 1337 there was a famous riot in protest at the Abbot&#x27;s control of this market in which several of the monks were killed. After the abbey&#x27;s dissolution in 1538, the town sank into decay.

In 1556, upon receiving a representation of its pitiable condition, Mary I granted a charter incorporating the town as a borough, governed by a mayor, two bailiffs, twelve chief burgesses and sixteen secondary burgesses, the mayor to be clerk of the market, coroner and a JP. The present Christ&#x27;s Hospital originally belonged to the Guild of the Holy Cross, on the dissolution of which Edward VI founded the almshouses instead, under its present name.

The borough elected one member of parliament; this right would continue until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. The 1556 charter also catered for the appointment of a town clerk and other officers, and the borough boundaries were described in detail. Later charters, from Elizabeth I, James I, James II, George II and George III, made no considerable change. James II changed the style of the corporation to that of a mayor, twelve aldermen and twelve burgesses.
Abingdon became the county town of Berkshire sometime after receiving its charter in 1556. Assize courts were held in Abingdon from 1570, but in the 17th century it was vying with Reading for county town status. The county hall and court house were built between 1678 and 1682, to assert this status. The building, now the Abingdon County Hall Museum, was reputedly designed by Christopher Kempster, who worked with Sir Christopher Wren.

Abingdon borough police was the police force responsible for policing the Borough until 1889. It was formed as a result of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The force was amalgamated into the Berkshire Constabulary following the Local Government Act 1888, which required all boroughs with populations of less than 10,000 to amalgamate their police forces with their adjoining county constabulary. Today, the area is policed by the successor to Berkshire Constabulary, Thames Valley Police.

In 1790 Abingdon Lock was built, replacing navigation via the Swift Ditch. In 1810, the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal opened, linking Abingdon with Semington on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Abingdon became a key link between major industrial centres such as Bristol, London, Birmingham and the Black Country. In 1856 the Abingdon Railway opened, linking the town with the Great Western Railway at . However, Abingdon&#x27;s failure to engage fully with the railway revolution, accepting only a branch line, sidelined the town in favour of Reading which became the County Town in 1869.

The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal was abandoned in 1906 but a voluntary trust is now working to restore and re-open it. Abingdon railway station was closed to passengers in September 1963. The line remained open for goods until 1984, including serving the MG car factory, which opened in 1929 and closed in October 1980 as part of a British Leyland rationalisation plan. The nearest railway station is , away. Much of the original Abingdon branch line is now a cyclepath, whilst the land on which the station stood has been extensively redeveloped, and is now the site of a large Waitrose store and surrounded by a large number of new flats and houses.

The corporation was reformed, under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, but was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, which enacted extensive local government reorganisation across England and Wales with effect from 1 April 1974. As a result of this reorganisation, Berkshire County Council&#x27;s northern boundary was much reduced and Abingdon&#x27;s governance was transferred to Oxfordshire, with the town becoming the seat of the new Vale of White Horse District Council, and Abingdon becoming a civil parish with a town council. Since the 1980s, Abingdon has played host to a number of information communication companies, with many based in the town&#x27;s respective business and science parks. As a consequence, and owing to Abingdon&#x27;s proximity to academic and scientific institutions in Oxford, the town has seen an influx of young professionals taking residence in the town&#x27;s many residential areas such as Peachcroft.

The town was sometimes historically called &quot;Abingdon-on-Thames&quot;, but the official name of the borough (as given in statutes from the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to the Local Government Act 1972 and all intervening Ordnance Survey maps) was simply &quot;Abingdon&quot;. Local councillors voted in November 2011 to change the official name of the town to &quot;Abingdon-on-Thames&quot;, and the change took effect on 23 February 2012.

==Leisure and media==
Sport and recreation facilities include the White Horse Leisure and Tennis Centre, Tilsley Park and the Southern Town Park. Abingdon had four cinemas but all have closed. The last was the Regal, which closed in 1989. It stood derelict for 24 years until it was demolished in 2003 and replaced by housing development, Regal Close. The Unicorn theatre was built in an area called The Checkers Hall in the ruins of the Abbey buildings and shows plays and films on an irregular basis. In addition, a new cinema, called the Abbey Cinema has been built in one of the Town Council buildings and operates in conjunction with the Regal in Evesham.

The local newspapers are &quot;The Oxford Times&quot;, &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; and &quot;Abingdon Herald&quot;. The &quot;Oxfordshire Guardian&quot;, a free newspaper, was based in Abingdon for many years and was founded as the &quot;South Oxfordshire Courier&quot; until its closure in 2018. Local radio and television stations are shared with Oxford, although ITV retains a news gathering centre in nearby Milton Park (formerly having a broadcasting studio in the town) for ITV Meridian. Historically the ITV franchise was ITV Central. Local analogue radio is provided by BBC Radio Oxford, Greatest Hits Radio and Heart South (historically &#x27;Fox FM&#x27; and later &#x27;Heart Thames Valley&#x27;), while the town is also covered by the Oxfordshire DAB multiplex. There was a Six TV local TV channel until 2009 and the town&#x27;s further education college was the home to That&#x27;s TV studios for Oxfordshire until it relocated to Oxford Science Park.

The Tesco Extra store west of the town is the largest supermarket in Abingdon and has historically been one of the most profitable Tesco stores in the country. Nearby is the Fairacres Retail Park, thought to be the first retail park in the UK and recently redeveloped, which includes Argos, Subway, B &amp; M, Dreams and Pets at Home stores. It originally had two long established Abingdon retailers—Vineys Home Furnishings (now part of the Lee Longlands chain but retains its name) and Mays Carpets (now part of the Carpetright chain and has re-branded accordingly). In the town centre, many independent stores, estate agents and charity shops make up the Bury Street shopping centre as major high street names have chosen to go to other towns. However, a recent renovation has attracted stores such as New Look, Peacocks and WHSmith to open branches.

The town centre of Abingdon was renovated in 2012 as part of the council&#x27;s redevelopment plan, with the 1970s shopping precinct converted to look more modern. The roads around the area have been changed: notably the one-way system around the centre has been partially changed to two-way. While this has slightly reduced traffic within the historic town centre, congestion has greatly increased elsewhere. Local businesses have also complained that the increased traffic has driven shoppers away. Redevelopment of the Old Gaol site, most recently a leisure centre, began in 2010. The first stage was demolishing the 1970s additions and swimming pool extension. The Gaol has been converted into luxury flats, shops and restaurants, with access to the riverside.

==Sport==
Abingdon has two non-League football teams: Abingdon United F.C., who compete in the and play at The Armadillo Energy Stadium, and Abingdon Town F.C., who play at Culham Road. Abingdon Golf Club/North Berks Golf Club (now defunct) was first mentioned in 1876. The club disappeared at the time of the Second World War The Oxford Saints American Football Club play their games in Abingdon at Tilsley Park and are one of the longest-running American Football clubs in the UK, founded in 1983. Abingdon is home to Abingdon Rowing Club, with members from 13 to 80 years old. It has had many successes at local and national races, and also holds its own Abingdon Head race in April, one of the main events in the Abingdon Calendar. Its boathouse is on Wilsham Road. Abingdon Amblers changed its name to Abingdon Athletics Club. They train at Tilsley Park and take part in county cross-country leagues.

Abingdon RUFC was formed at the Queens Hotel on 27 February 1931. During the 1930s the club was based at the Queens Hotel and games were played on the Council owned recreation ground at Caldecott Road. Immediately after the Second World War the club moved to outside the RAF camp (now Dalton Barracks) which offered on-site changing facilities and later a pitch inside the camp. At the start of the Suez Crisis in 1956 play temporarily returned to the Caldecott Road site because of security risks. This period saw the formation of the ill-fated Abingdon Sports Club; an amalgamation of the town&#x27;s rugby, cricket and hockey clubs and the bid to establish a sporting centre at Hales Meadow. In a short time the ground was developed and a pavilion erected but the organisation was plagued with financial difficulties and very soon dissolved with hockey disbanding and Abingdon Rugby remaining at the site as tenants to the cricket club. In the mid-1980s a determined effort was made to acquire grounds and a clubhouse dedicated to rugby. In 2022 Abingdon Womens Rugby Club known as “The Albatrosses” was formed and they currently play in the Inner Warrior League.

The current base at the town&#x27;s Southern Sports Park was opened by former Abingdon MP John Patten in 1989. Abingdon has had members representing the county, progressing to first-class level and on to international status in the Six Nations Tournament. The Abingdon Sevens traditionally opens the Home Counties&#x27; playing season and has attracted sides from throughout the country and beyond. Initiated in 1956 as a one-off tournament to celebrate the town&#x27;s 400th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, it proved so successful that the competition has been held on an annual basis ever since. Several years ago it was decided to introduce the youngsters of Abingdon to Club Rugby. The Youth Section has 200 playing members from the ages of 6 to 18. In 2013–14 Abingdon RFC&#x27;s President, Paul Murphy MBE, was also the President of the RFU. Since 2016, Oxford Rugby League have played in Abingdon at Abingdon School&#x27;s Tilsley Park.

==Economy==
The Pavlova and Gloria leather works were major employers but both are now closed. Alfred Booth and Company of Liverpool traded with the Pavlova Leather Syndicate from 1860, bought a share in it in 1917–18 and took it over in 1921. In May 1947 at the annual British Industries Fair in Birmingham, Pavlova advertised doe skins, chamois, lambskins and goatskins, much of it as suede, for uses including shoes, gloves and belts. In 1958 Pavlova&#x27;s site covered , employed neary 200 people and included a staff sports field. At that time its factory still processed imported skins of sheep, lamb and goat, mainly to make suede. Garner Group took over the Booth Group in 1979 and became Garner Booth. Pittards plc took over Garner Booth in 1987 and became Pittard Garner. It closed the Pavlova works in 1993.

Abingdon was originally home to the Morland Brewery, whose most famous ale was Old Speckled Hen, named after an early MG car. Greene King Brewery bought Morland for £182 million in 1999, closed the brewery and moved production to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. The site of the brewery has been redeveloped into housing. The Maltings was demolished and is now a mixed residential area and council offices. In 2010, a craft brewery, Loose Cannon, reinstated brewing in the town at the Drayton Road Industrial Estate and sells its beers locally, including on draught at some local pubs. Abingdon is near several major scientific employers: the UKAEA at Culham (including the Joint European Torus (JET) fusion research project), Harwell Laboratory, the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the new Diamond Light Source synchrotron, which is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built for over 40 years. Many inhabitants work in Oxford or commute by rail to London, from nearby Didcot. The Army now occupies Dalton Barracks, which, prior to 1993, was the Royal Air Force station RAF Abingdon.

Abingdon has a business park which has offices for several local, national and international companies including, until recently, Vodafone (acquired as part of its takeover of Mannesmann in 2000) and Northern Rock bank. The Science Park includes the global headquarters of Sophos, an anti-virus company. RM, an educational computing supplier, commonly refer to themselves as being Abingdon-based, which is technically true—even though their HQ is actually in nearby Milton Park, Milton, they have an Abingdon post code (as does the rest of Milton Park). Penlon Ltd, a medical equipment company, have their premises on the outskirts of Abingdon (their previous site, near the former railway station, has been redeveloped as residential housing). Another major employer is the British head office of the German appliance company Miele.

Industrially, Abingdon was best known for the MG car factory, which opened in 1929. 1,155,032 cars were made at the plant over the next 51 years until British Leyland closed it on 24 October 1980. Subsequent cars sold under the MG brand have since been produced either at Longbridge in Birmingham or at SAIC&#x27;s factories in China. The company was founded in 1924 and moved its business alongside the Pavlova Leather Factory in 1929. By the outbreak of the Second World War, MG was established as one of the most popular brands of sports car in Britain. After the war, the MG factory continued to churn out increasing volumes of popular sports car which were available at competitive prices but the factory closed in October 1980 on the demise of the ageing but still popular MG MGB range, and was demolished within months. The headquarters of the MG Car Club, founded in 1930, is at 11 &amp; 12 Cemetery Road, next to the old factory offices. A police station was built in its place, which was later extended with the addition of more cells, as Oxford&#x27;s police station could not be extended further.

==Geography and transport==

Abingdon is south of Oxford, south-east of Witney and north of Newbury in the flat valley of the Thames on its west (right) bank, where the small river Ock flows in from the Vale of White Horse. It is on the A415 between Witney and Dorchester, adjacent to the A34 trunk road, linking it with the M4 and M40 motorways. The B4017 and A4183 also link the town, both being part of the old A34 and often heavily congested. Local bus services to Oxford and the surrounding areas are run by the Oxford Bus Company, its sister company Thames Travel and smaller independent companies.

Abingdon no longer has a rail service. However, in recent years, urban expansion has brought Radley railway station close to the town&#x27;s northeastern limits. The small, primarily stopping-service, railway stations at and Radley are both just over from the town centre. Abingdon&#x27;s eastern ring-road and newest suburbs are connected by footpath and cycleway from Radley.

Culham station was called &quot;Abingdon Road&quot; when it first opened in 1844, being the nearest station to the town at that time. It was renamed &quot;Culham&quot; when the Abingdon Railway branch line to Abingdon railway station was opened in 1856. That branch line initially connected to the main line at Abingdon Junction, before being extended to Radley station when that opened in 1873. The branch line from Radley to Abingdon closed to passengers in 1963. The nearest major stations with taxi ranks are () and (). All are managed by Great Western Railway. Frequent express buses operate between the local railway stations and Abingdon, run by Oxford Bus Company and its sister company Thames Travel.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Abingdon, at parish (town), district and county level: Abingdon-on-Thames Town Council, Vale of White Horse District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council meets at the Guildhall on Bridge Street and has its offices in the adjoining Roysse Court. Parts of the Guildhall date back to the 15th century, having been originally part of the Abbey complex.
Control of the town council has passed between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in recent years. Elections take place every four years. After the 2023 local elections, the political composition of the council was:

The incumbent Member of Parliament for Oxford West and Abingdon is Layla Moran (Liberal Democrat).

===Administrative history===
Abingdon was first incorporated as a borough in 1556. The borough covered parts of the parishes of St Helen and St Nicolas; both parishes also included rural areas beyond the borough boundary. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.

The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so a parish called Abingdon was created covering the same area as the borough, and the parts of the parishes of St Helen and St Nicolas outside the borough boundary were combined into a separate parish called St. Helen Without.

The municipal borough was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which also transferred the town from Berkshire to Oxfordshire. District-level functions passed to the Vale of White Horse District Council. A successor parish covering the area of the former borough was created called Abingdon, with its council taking the name Abingdon Town Council. The parish was formally renamed to Abingdon-on-Thames in 2012.

==Places of interest==
Of the Benedictine Abingdon Abbey there remains a Perpendicular gateway and ruins of the mainly Early English prior&#x27;s house, the guest house and other fragments. Other remains from the former abbey include the Unicorn Theatre and the Long Gallery, which are still used for plays and functions including an annual craft fair. St. Nicolas&#x27; Church, parts of which were built in 1180, is near the museum. Abingdon Bridge over the Thames, near St Helen&#x27;s Church, was built in 1416 and was widened or altered in 1790, 1828, 1927 and 1929. Abbey Gateway between the Abingdon County Hall Museum and the Guildhall remains a point of local importance.

Abingdon has the remains of a motte-and-bailey castle, which can be found to the north of the town centre surrounded by trees within a housing estate. Originally built of wood or stone, it was a fortification on a raised earthwork called a motte surrounded by a protective ditch. There is a Second World War FW3/28A pillbox by the River Ock near Marcham Road. A gaol, built by prisoners of the Napoleonic Wars in 1811, is on the south edge of town next to the Thames. In the 1970s the gaol was converted into a leisure centre. In 2011 the site was developed into residential and commercial premises. According to local legend, prior to its conversion in the 1970s, the gaol was haunted by the ghost of an eight-year-old boy who, after being convicted for arson in the mid-19th century, became the youngest person in the UK to be executed by hanging.

The Roysse Room was the site of Abingdon School (then &#x27;Roysse&#x27;s School&#x27;) from 1563 until it moved to its current site after an indenture by John Roysse, who had been born and educated in Abingdon before he moved to London. The room is now part of the civic offices. St. Helen&#x27;s Church dates from around 1100 and is the second-widest church in England, having five aisles and being wider than it is long. The tower of St Helen&#x27;s Church has a modern ring of ten bells, cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 2005 and hung in a new frame with new fittings by White&#x27;s of Appleton in 2006. Abingdon&#x27;s county hall by the main market square, built in 1677–1680 reputedly by Christopher Kempster, stands on columns, leaving the ground floor open for a market and other functions. It was once hailed by Nikolaus Pevsner with the comment &quot;Of the free-standing town halls of England with open ground floors this is the grandest&quot;. It now houses the Abingdon County Hall Museum and is run by Historic England.

==Culture and folklore==
Bun-throwing is an Abingdon tradition that began with the 1761 Coronation of King George III. This longstanding tradition of the town has local dignitaries throwing buns (5,000 buns in 2018) from the roof of the Abingdon County Hall Museum into crowds assembled in the market square below on specific days of celebration (such as royal marriages, coronations and jubilees). The museum has a collection of the buns, dried and varnished, dating back to bun-throwings of the 19th century. To date there have been 35 bun-throwing events. Since 2000, there have been bun-throwing ceremonies to commemorate the Millennium, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2002, the 450th anniversary of the town&#x27;s being granted a royal charter in 2006, the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012, the centenary of the end of the World War I in November 2018 and the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2022.

Every October, the Abingdon Michaelmas Fair is run. Extending to the length of a mile, the fair is thought to be the longest and oldest street fair in Europe. It runs through the Market Place, High Street, and Ock Street. The fair was originally a hiring fair, designed to allow farmworkers from rural areas to find work in the town following the Black Death in 1348/9. The fair, previously run on the first Monday and Tuesday before 11 October each year, had its dates extended in 2024 to also run one day earlier, from the Sunday to the Tuesday. The much smaller Runaway Fair is run the Monday following the Michaelmas Fair, and was traditionally for workers who were unsatisfied with their employment after the first week, and sought to &quot;run away&quot; and return to the town to find better job opportunities. Abingdon has a very old and still active Morris dancing tradition, passed on since before the folk dance and song revivals in the 19th century. Every year a Mayor of Ock Street is elected by the inhabitants of Ock Street; he then parades through the town preceded by the famous Horns of Ock Street, a symbol of Abingdon&#x27;s Morris Dance troupe.

The Friends of Abingdon&#x27;s Unicorn Theatre, housed in the old Abbey buildings, is the site of first productions of many stage adaptations of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novels by Stephen Briggs. Old Speckled Hen ale was originally brewed by Morland&#x27;s of Abingdon to commemorate the MG factory in the town. It continues to be brewed by Greene King along with several complementary beers. The rock band Radiohead formed at Abingdon School in 1985.

<text>Jacobo Morales (born 12 November 1934) is a Puerto Rican actor, poet, writer, playwright, filmmaker, and author born in Puerto Rico. Many consider him the most influential film director in Puerto Rico&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
Morales was born in the town of Lajas, Puerto Rico, to parents of Sephardic roots.

==Career==
He started acting in radio and theater when he was only 14 years old. He began working in television at its inception in 1954, working as an actor, writer and director. Some of his works include &quot;Desafiando a los Genios&quot;, &quot;Esto no tiene Nombre&quot;, &quot;La Tiendita de la Esquina&quot;, among many others.

During this time, he also started working with the political satire and comedy group Los Rayos Gamma, together with journalist Eddie López. The group still performs at theaters occasionally, and in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s had several shows on television. In theatre, he has starred in over 30 plays, and he has written and directed five.

In the 1970s, he performed in Hollywood productions such as Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bananas&quot; and &quot;Up the Sandbox&quot; with Barbra Streisand.

His first directing work was the film &quot;Dios los cría...&quot; in 1980. The film was an important event in the Puerto Rican film history and received several awards. It was also selected as one of the 25 most significant films of Latin America. He followed it with &quot;Nicolás y los demás&quot; in which he also had the starring role. For this performance he received the Best Actor Award at the Cartagena de Indias Festival in Colombia, 1986. His third film, &quot;Lo que le pasó a Santiago&quot;, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1990. In 1994, he followed it with &quot;Linda Sara&quot; which starred singer Chayanne and former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres. The film received the Award for Best Artistic Contribution at the Latin American Film Festival from Trieste, Italy; the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the Mar del Plata Festival in Argentina; and the Best Script and Best Music Award at the Latin American Film Festival in New York City.

In 2004, Morales directed &quot;Dios los cría II&quot;, the sequel to his first film, broadcast by WIPR-TV in Puerto Rico. In 2007, his &quot;Angel&quot;, a full-length feature film, was released to much critical praise. It was considered for submission for the 80th Academy Awards but it lost to &quot;Maldeamores&quot; in a voting of the Puerto Rico Film Corporation.

<text>Carlos Edwin Colón González Sr. (born July 18, 1948) is a Puerto Rican wrestling promoter and retired professional wrestler, better known as Carlitos Colón or simply Carlos Colón. He is, along with Victor Jovica, an owner of the Puerto Rican wrestling promotion World Wrestling Council (WWC), where he has held the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship a record 26 times. He is the patriarch of the Colón wrestling family, composed of his sons Carlos and Eddie, daughter Stacy and nephew Orlando. In 2014, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and the following year into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== Early years (1966-1973) ===
Due to his admiration for wrestlers Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez, Colón became a member at the gym they trained at in New York, practicing wrestling moves and cleaning the place occasionally to pay his dues. His dedication and affability helped him gain the respect of his peers, as well as the occasional wrestling match. His first bout occurred in Boston, Massachusetts, on February 16, 1966, when he wrestled Hobo Brazil. Colon was paid US$15.00 for his participation in his first match. He eventually became an itinerant wrestler in the eastern states of the United States and in Canada, including 1 match in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in December 1967, and several in 1968. Over the following three years, with Montreal as his place of residence.

===Capitol Sport Promotions/World Wrestling Council (1973-1993)===
Feeling homesick and noticing a void in the Puerto Rican wrestling scene, Colón returned to Puerto Rico in 1973. Colón and Croatian-born wrestler Victor Jovica founded a promotional company, Capitol Sports Promotions, which aired wrestling television shows each Saturday and Sunday on WAPA-TV. He wrestled during a time where local stars such as Barrabas, Black Georgie, and Miguel Pérez Sr. shared the spotlight with international wrestlers such as Argentine-born Rocca, Cuban-born Huracán Castillo and others. He set the stage for local stars such as Los Super Médicos, Los Invaders and Chicky Starr to develop. His wrestling company was also responsible for inviting major American wrestling stars such as Randy Savage, Ric Flair, Bruiser Brody, Stan Hansen and others to wrestle in Puerto Rico. The nemesis of Colón&#x27;s character was Abdullah the Butcher, with whom he staged a long-standing feud which lasted almost two decades. Colón is quoted as saying: &quot;Eighty percent of the blood I&#x27;ve shed in the ring I&#x27;ve shed because of Abdullah.&quot;
On January 6, 1983, Colón defeated Ric Flair in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. However, the outcome of this match was not made official or aired on NWA television. Flair received the belt back in a phantom title change that took place on January 23, 1983. Later that year, Colón required hospitalization due to injury following a match against Bruiser Brody. This loss was publicized and made the covers of &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; and &quot;El Vocero&quot;, both of which are mainstream newspapers. Two weeks later, Colón defeated Brody in a rematch. In December 1983, Capitol Sports Promotions began a feud between Colón and Flair, which included a skit where the NWA champion criticized Capitol&#x27;s title claiming that he was the only &quot;real world champion&quot;, leading to a steel cage match to determine the &quot;undisputed champion of the Universe&quot;. The encounter headlined an event held in Bayamón on December 18, 1983. Colón won cleanly, and the WWC World Heavyweight Championship was renamed to Universal Heavyweight Championship as a result. In subsequent interviews, Flair has stated that the NWA title was not on the line for this match because an official unification was proposed, but he vetoed it.

On January 24, 1993, Colón made a one-night return to the WWF, then known by the abbreviated name World Wrestling Federation, making an appearance in the Royal Rumble. After this, he decided to temporarily retire from professional wrestling, choosing to help train his sons, Carly, and Eddie, who have followed Colón into the sport.

===Later years and retirement (1993-present)===
Carlos Colón appeared on the September 11, 2006, episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; from Madison Square Garden in the audience cheering his son Carly, known as Carlito in WWE. He also negotiated a deal for his other son Eddie Colón to work for World Wrestling Entertainment.

Colón held a retirement ceremony at &quot;Aniversario 2008&quot;, which was organized in the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum on July 19, 2008.

However, Colón left this retirement on September 8, 2012, defeating Félix &quot;Barrabás&quot; López in his return. After Carly Colón turned on him and gained control of the heel faction, Colón joined Gilbert Cruz and Ray González in a three-on-three match against his son, López and Germán Figueroa, but his team lost. On February 9, 2013, he lost to Savio Vega in a match for WWC&#x27;s ownership. This evolved into a feud with the heel faction, while a secondary storyline involved a legal battle over the promotion. Colón defeated José Huertas González to recover ownership of WWC, but lost a rematch the following month. At Aniversario 2013 he teamed with Stacy Colón and defeated José Huertas González and &quot;La Tigresa&quot; Soldelina Vargas. Colón announced another short-lived retirement. He returned at Lockout 2013, resuming this feud by losing to Huertas González in an ambulance match, with both wrestling a no contest at Euphoria 2014.

Colón&#x27;s name began being rumored as a possible inductee to the WWE Hall of Fame in late 2011. Despite expressing joy at the idea of accompanying Pedro Morales, he dismissed this as a rumor and noted that WWE personnel had not formally contacted him. Ultimately, the 2012 Class did not include him. The following year, Eddie and Orlando Colón noted that they supported a potential induction. On March 11, 2014, Colón was officially announced as part of that year&#x27;s class. He considered it the &quot;realization of a dream&quot; and admitted that at one point, he began to doubt that he was ever being inducted. This class was completed by The Ultimate Warrior, Jake Roberts, Lita, Paul Bearer, and Mr. T. He was inducted by his sons Eddie and Carly, and nephew, Orlando in the official ceremony held at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. Colón became the third Puerto Rican inducted, the first being Morales and the second being New York-born Johnny Rodz. WWC held a series of homages, the first of which was held by his immediate family. A more formal ceremony was held on March 30, 2014, and included the participation of long-time rival Chicky Starr, who participated in a skit where he expressed his respect and ended their animosity. The promotion went on to announce a Puerto Rico-wide tour, &quot;La Despedida de Carlitos Colón&quot;, which would mark Colón&#x27;s final retirement.

==Personal life==
Colón was born in the Jauca Ward of Santa Isabel an agricultural community in southern Puerto Rico. One of seven children, he emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in 1961 along with the rest of the family led there by his mother, Esther González. Colón is married to a Canadian national named Nancy, who is the mother of his children, Carly, Eddie, Stacy, and Melissa. He is the brother of accountant José Colón, who has made several non-wrestling appearances in WWC and is also the father of his nephew and fellow wrestler, Orlando Colón, known by the ring name of Epico. Colón&#x27;s career has left him with over 70 scars on his forehead. He has publicly stated that he exhibits them with pride, considering them the proof that reflects the arduous work done during all of the bloody bouts in which he has been involved.

Colón is WWE&#x27;s representative in Puerto Rico, promoting the house shows held by the company there. He has appeared on WWE programming, including the December 24, 2009, episode of &quot;WWE Superstars&quot; where he supported Eddie, known as Primo in WWE. Afterward, Colón made another appearance for WWE, attending its 2012 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony. He attended as a guest of his son and nephew, who held the WWE Tag Team Championship at that time. Colón&#x27;s main interest was to see the inductions of Yokozuna and Mil Máscaras, both of whom worked for him in Capitol Sports Promotions.

Colón was in the building the night that Bruiser Brody was killed. Colón testified on behalf of José González, who had killed Brody during a dressing-room altercation, and continued to employ him for many years after the event.

==Legacy==
When Colón was first nominated for induction into the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame (Spanish: Pabellón de la Fama del Deporte Puertorriqueño) in 2023, a number of athletes from other sports supported his inclusion, including baseball player Yadier Molina, judo Panamerican champion Luis Martínez, basketball players Julio Toro and Ricardo Dalmau and Olympic medalist Jaime Espinal. All of them justified his inclusion by suggesting that while the outcomes of professional wrestling matches is predetermined, it still requires physical exertion and conditioning, general athleticism and at least a basic knowledge of actual grappling. Basketball coach Wilhelmus Caanen considered Colón “Tito Trinidad before Tito Trinidad”, in reference to former boxing world champion Félix Trinidad, whose wins would often gather impromptu celebrations on a massive scale during the 1990s and early 2000s. Fellow coach Allans Colón called him “an institution in [Puerto Rico]” and the local reference for anything involving professional wrestling.

<text>Bauerfield International Airport () is an airport located in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The airport is relatively small in size, but its runway has the capability and length to accept jets up to the Airbus A330. It served as the hub for Vanuatu&#x27;s flag carrier airline, Air Vanuatu.

==History==


===During World War II===
With Japanese forces establishing bases on Guadalcanal which threatened the sea route between the U.S. and Australia, Admiral King distributed the joint basic plan for the occupation and defense of Efate (the island containing Port Vila) on 20 March 1942. Under its terms the US Army was to defend Efate and support the defense of ships and positions. The US Navy&#x27;s task was: (1) to construct, administer and operate a naval advance base, seaplane base, and harbor facilities; (2) to support Army forces in the defense of the island; (3) to construct an airfield and at least two outlying dispersal fields; (4) to provide facilities for the operation of seaplane-bombers.

On 25 March 1942, the Army sent about 500 men to Efate from Nouméa, and the 4th Defense Battalion, 45th Marines, arrived on 8 April. Elements of the Seabees 1st Naval Construction Battalion arrived on Efate on 4 May 1942. The Marines had already cleared a coral by runway near Port Vila on part of a plantation owned by Henri Russet. The Seabees expanded this to by .

The airfield was originally named &quot;Efate Field&quot;, &quot;Vila Field&quot; or &quot;McDonald Field&quot; but was later officially named &quot;Bauer Field&quot; after Lt-Col. Harold W. Bauer, a fighter pilot in the US Marine Corps who was lost at sea on 14 November 1942 after being shot down during the Battle of Guadalcanal.

USAAF units stationed at Efate Field included:
*12th Fighter Squadron 1942-3
*44th Fighter Squadron 7 November 1942 – 25 October 1943
*26th Bombardment Squadron 25 July-22 December 1942

The base was disestablished and abandoned in February 1946.

===Development since the 2000s===
The airport runway was rebuilt in 2019 after a 3-year construction project funded by the World Bank. It was damaged in the 2024 Port Vila earthquake on 17 December, causing its closure to non-humanitarian flights for 72 hours. Commercial operations resumed on 22 December following repairs.

<text>Waylander are an Irish folk metal band influential in the realms of Celtic metal. Formed in 1993, the band blends traditional Irish folk with 1990s heavy metal.

==History==
Formed in 1993, Waylander released their debut demo, &quot;Once Upon an Era&quot;, in early 1995, mixing Irish folk music with extreme metal. Waylander were soon dubbed folk, Celtic and pagan metal. In 1996, with the addition of a full-time tin whistle player, Waylander released their second demo, &quot;Dawning of a New Age&quot;, which soon gained the band a prominent position in the folk metal scene. This was cemented when Waylander signed to Century Media Records, and in 1998 their debut album was released, entitled &quot;Reawakening Pride Once Lost&quot;. A handful of gigs were undertaken to promote this album but label problems and internal strife blunted the potential somewhat. After overcoming some line-up changes, Waylander signed with Blackend Records and released their &quot;The Light, the Dark and the Endless Knot&quot; album in early 2001. Again internal strife reared up, culminating in numerous line-up changes for several years. Despite this Waylander managed to perform some notable gigs, including the Bloodstock and Day of Darkness festivals, as well as gigs with Ancient Rites, Cathedral, Sabbat and Skyforger. In 2005, joining original members ArdChieftain O&#x27; Hagan, Michael Proctor, and Den Ferran were Saul McMichael and Gareth Murdock on guitars.

Waylander have signed a deal with Listenable Records and Waylander&#x27;s new third album, entitled &quot;Honour Amongst Chaos&quot;, is &quot;more powerful and beautiful than ever, using a vast array of Irish folk instruments and armed with their passion for metal in its truest form&quot;, according to a press release. &quot;Blending epic atmospheres and relentless brutality, &quot;Honour Amongst Chaos&quot; reflects the heart and soul of pagan warriors worldwide.&quot; Waylander&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Reawakening Pride Once Lost&quot;, has been re-released by Midhir Records on CD and vinyl.

In 2009, Gareth Murdock left the band to be the new bassist for Alestorm.

<doc id="155505" wikidata="Q3819831" url="?curid=155505" title="On the Beach (novel)">
<text>On the Beach is an apocalyptic novel published in 1957, written by British author Nevil Shute after he emigrated to Australia. The novel details the experiences of a mixed group of people in Melbourne as they await the arrival of deadly radiation spreading towards them from the Northern Hemisphere, following a nuclear war some years previous. As the radiation approaches, each person deals with impending death differently.

Shute&#x27;s initial story was published as a four-part series, &quot;The Last Days on Earth&quot;, in the London weekly periodical &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot;, in April 1957. For the novel, Shute expanded the storyline. The story has been adapted twice as a film (in 1959 and 2000) and once as a BBC radio broadcast in 2008.

==Title==
The phrase &quot;on the beach&quot; is a Royal Navy term that indicates retirement from service. The title also refers to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hollow Men,&quot; which includes the lines:

Printings of the novel, including the first 1957 edition by William Morrow and Company, New York, contain extracts from Eliot&#x27;s poem on the title page, under Shute&#x27;s name, including the above quotation and the concluding lines:
==Plot==
In 1963, World War III has devastated most of the populated world, polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout, and killing all human and animal life in the Northern Hemisphere. The war began with a nuclear attack by Albania on Italy, and then escalated with the bombing of the United States and the United Kingdom by Egypt. Because the aircraft used in these attacks were obtained from the Soviet Union, the Soviets were mistakenly blamed, triggering a retaliatory strike on the Soviet Union by NATO. The Soviets also attack the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which may have been a response to a Chinese attack aimed at occupying Soviet industrial areas near the Chinese border. Most, if not all, of the bombs included cobalt to enhance their radioactive properties.

Global air currents are slowly carrying the lethal nuclear fallout across the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the Southern Hemisphere. The only parts of the planet still habitable are Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the southern parts of South America, although they are slowly succumbing to radiation poisoning as well.

People in Australia detect a mysterious and incomprehensible Morse code-like radio signal originating from the American city of Seattle, Washington. With hope that someone has survived in the contaminated regions, one of the last American nuclear submarines, USS &quot;Scorpion&quot;, placed by its captain, Commander Dwight Towers, under Australian naval command, is ordered to sail north from its port of refuge in Melbourne (Australia&#x27;s southernmost major mainland city) to contact whoever is sending the signal. In preparation for this journey, the submarine makes a shorter trip to port cities in northern Australia, including Cairns, Queensland, Port Moresby, in Papua New Guinea, and Darwin, Northern Territory; no survivors are found. Two Australians sail with the American crew: Lieutenant Peter Holmes, naval liaison officer to the Americans, and a scientist, Professor John Osborne.

Commander Towers has become attached to Moira Davidson, a young Australian woman distantly related to Osborne who tries to cope with the impending end of human life through heavy drinking. Despite his attraction to Davidson, Towers remains loyal to his wife and children in the United States. He buys his children gifts and imagines them growing older. At one point, however, he makes it clear to Moira that he knows his family is almost certainly dead, and asks if she thinks he is insane for acting as if they were still alive. She replies that she does not think he is crazy.

The Australian government provides citizens with free suicide pills and injections to avoid prolonged suffering from radiation poisoning. Periodic reports show the steady southward progression of the deadly radiation. As communications are lost with a city, it is referred to as being &quot;out.&quot;

Peter Holmes has a baby daughter and a wife, Mary. Mary is in denial about the impending disaster. Because he has been assigned to travel north with the Americans, Peter tries to explain, to Mary&#x27;s fury and disbelief, how to kill their baby and herself, by taking the pill should he not return from his mission in time to help. The bachelor Osborne spends much of his time restoring and subsequently racing a Ferrari racing car that he had purchased (along with a fuel supply) for a nominal amount following the war&#x27;s outbreak.

USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; travels to the Gulf of Alaska in the northern Pacific Ocean, where the crew determines that radiation levels are not decreasing. This finding discredits the &quot;Jorgensen Effect&quot;, a scientific theory positing that radiation levels will decrease at a greater rate than previously thought, aided by the weather effects, and potentially allow for human life to continue in southern Australia or Antarctica. The submarine approaches San Francisco, observing through the periscope that the city had been devastated and the Golden Gate Bridge has fallen. In contrast, the Puget Sound area, from which the radio signals are emanating, is found to have avoided destruction because of missile defences. One crew member, who is from Edmonds, Washington, which the expedition visits, jumps ship to spend his last days in his home town.

The expedition members then sail to an abandoned navy communications school south of Seattle. A crewman sent ashore with oxygen tanks and protective gear discovers that although the city&#x27;s residents have long since perished, some of the region&#x27;s hydroelectric power is still working due to primitive automation technology. He finds that the mysterious radio signal is the result of a broken window sash swinging in the breeze and occasionally hitting a telegraph key. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, the remaining submariners return to Australia to live out what little time they have left.

Osborne takes his suicide pill while sitting in his Ferrari. When Mary becomes very ill, Peter administers a lethal injection to their daughter. Despite Peter feeling relatively well, he and Mary take their pills simultaneously to die as a family. Towers and his remaining crew choose to scuttle the &quot;Scorpion&quot; in the open ocean, fulfilling a naval duty to not leave the unmanned vessel &quot;floating about in a foreign port&quot;, after her crew succumbs to suicide or radiation poisoning. Moira watches the submarine&#x27;s departure in her car, parked atop an adjacent hilltop, as she takes her pill, imagining herself together with Towers as she dies.

==Characterisation==
The characters make their best efforts to enjoy what time remains to them, speaking of small pleasures and continuing their customary activities. The Holmeses plant a garden that they will never see; Moira initially acts as a socialite – drinking and partying excessively – but upon meeting Towers takes classes in typing and shorthand; Osborne and others organize a dangerous motor race that results in the violent deaths of several participants; elderly members of a gentlemen&#x27;s club drink up the wine in the club&#x27;s cellar, debate over whether to move the fishing season up, and fret about whether agriculturally destructive rabbits will survive human beings. Towers goes on a fishing trip with Moira Davidson but they do not become intimate, as he chooses to remain loyal to his dead wife, a decision Moira accepts.

Government services and the economy gradually grind to a halt, albeit the societal breakdown depicted is generally amiable. In the end, Towers chooses not to remain and die with Moira, but rather to lead his crew on a final mission to scuttle the submarine outside of Australian territorial waters. He refuses to allow his imminent demise to turn him aside from his duty to the US Navy, and he acts as a pillar of strength to his crew.

Typically for a Shute novel, the characters avoid expressing intense emotions and do not indulge in self-pity. The Australians do not, for the most part, flee southward as refugees but rather accept their fate once the lethal radiation levels reach the latitudes at which they live; most of them opt for the government-promoted alternative of suicide when the symptoms of radiation sickness appear. In any case, as is made clear within the text, radiation poisoning is also starting to appear as far south as Christchurch, New Zealand, so any such flight would ultimately have been pointless.

==Reception==
Historian David McCullough, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called &quot;On the Beach&quot; &quot;the most haunting evocation we have of a world dying of radiation after an atomic war.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;the most shocking fiction I have read in years. What is shocking about it is both the idea and the sheer imaginative brilliance with which Mr. Shute brings it off.&quot; &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;Shute&#x27;s most considerable achievement&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot; stated that it is &quot;the most evocative novel on the aftermath of a nuclear war.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;fictions such as &quot;On the Beach&quot; played an important role in raising awareness about the threat of nuclear war. We stared into the abyss and then stepped back from the brink.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the novel as &quot;timely and ironic... an indelibly sad ending that leaves you tearful and disturbed&quot;, and &quot;The Economist&quot; called it &quot;still incredibly moving after nearly half a century.&quot;

Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; called the book &quot;an emotional wallop. It should be made mandatory reading for all professional diplomats and politicians.&quot; Isaac Asimov said, &quot;Surely to the science fiction fan—as opposed to the general public—this must seem very milk-and-watery. So there&#x27;s a nuclear war to start the story with—and what else is new?&quot; He described the novel as an example of what he called &quot;&#x27;tomorrow fiction&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;there can be nothing duller than tomorrow&#x27;s headlines in science fiction&quot;.

The novel does not realistically describe the effects of a global nuclear war, which were poorly understood at the time. It does not portray any form of nuclear winter. In the survival manual &quot;Nuclear War Survival Skills&quot;, Cresson Kearney describes the novel as &quot;pseudoscientific&quot; and &quot;demoralising&quot;, arguing that it and similar works perpetuate the myth that any large-scale nuclear war would inevitably wipe out all human life. This myth, argues Kearney, is dangerous as it discourages people from taking precautionary measures that could save lives in the event of a nuclear attack, in the mistaken belief that any precaution is futile.

<text>The Van Gogh Museum () is a Dutch art museum dedicated to the works of Vincent van Gogh and his contemporaries in the Museum Square in Amsterdam South, close to the Stedelijk Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Concertgebouw. The museum opened on 2 June 1973, and its buildings were designed by Gerrit Rietveld and Kisho Kurokawa.

The museum contains the largest collection of Van Gogh&#x27;s paintings and drawings in the world. In 2017, the museum had 2.3 million visitors and was the most-visited museum in the Netherlands, and the 23rd-most-visited art museum in the world. In 2019, the Van Gogh Museum launched the &quot;Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience&quot;, a technology-driven &quot;immersive exhibition&quot; on Van Gogh&#x27;s life and works, which has toured globally.

==History==
=== Unsold works ===
Upon Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s death in 1890, his work not sold fell into the possession of his brother Theo. Theo died six months after Vincent, leaving the work in the possession of his widow, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. Selling many of Vincent&#x27;s paintings with the ambition of spreading knowledge of his artwork, Johanna maintained a private collection of his works. The collection was inherited by her son Vincent Willem van Gogh in 1925, eventually loaned to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where it was displayed for many years, and was transferred to the state-initiated Vincent van Gogh Foundation in 1962.

=== Dedicated museum ===
Design for a Van Gogh Museum was commissioned by the Dutch government in 1963 to Dutch architect and furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld. Rietveld died a year later, and the building was not completed until 1973, when the museum opened its doors. In 1998 and 1999, the building was renovated by the Dutch architect Martien van Goor, and an exhibition wing by the Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa was added. In late 2012, the museum was closed for renovations for six months. During this period, 75 works from the collection were shown in the H&#x27;ART Museum.

On 9 September 2013, the museum unveiled a long-lost Van Gogh painting that spent years in a Norwegian attic believed to be by another painter. It is the first full-size canvas by him discovered since 1928. &quot;Sunset at Montmajour&quot; depicts trees, bushes and sky, painted with Van Gogh&#x27;s familiar thick brush strokes. It can be dated to the exact day it was painted because he described it in a letter to his brother, Theo, and said he painted it the previous day 4 July 1888.

===Art thefts===
In 1991, twenty paintings were stolen from the museum, among them Van Gogh&#x27;s early painting &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot;. Although the thieves escaped from the building, 35 minutes later all stolen paintings were recovered from an abandoned car. Three paintings – &quot;Wheatfield with Crows&quot;, &quot;Still Life with Bible&quot;, and &quot;Still Life with Fruit&quot; – were severely torn during the theft. Four men, including two museum guards, were convicted for the theft and given six or seven-year sentences. It is considered to be the largest art theft in the Netherlands since the Second World War.

In 2002, two paintings were stolen from the museum, &quot;Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen&quot; and &quot;View of the Sea at Scheveningen&quot;. Two Dutchmen were convicted for the theft to four-and-a-half-year sentences, but the paintings were not immediately recovered. The museum offered a reward of €100,000 for information leading to the recovery of the paintings. The FBI Art Crime Team listed the robbery on their &quot;Top Ten Art Crimes&quot; list, and estimates the combined value of the paintings at US$30million. In September 2016, both paintings were discovered by the Guardia di Finanza in Castellammare di Stabia, Italy in a villa belonging to the Camorra drug trafficker Raffaele Imperiale. The two artworks were found in a &quot;relatively good state&quot;, according to the Van Gogh Museum.

== Buildings ==

The museum is situated at the Museumplein in Amsterdam-Zuid, on the Paulus Potterstraat 7, between the Stedelijk Museum and the Rijksmuseum, and consists of two buildings, the Rietveld building, designed by Gerrit Rietveld, and the Kurokawa wing, designed by Kisho Kurokawa. Museum offices are housed on Stadhouderskade 55 in Amsterdam-Zuid. Depending on the season, sunflowers are displayed outside the entrance to the museum.

=== Rietveld building ===
The Rietveld building is the main structure and houses the permanent collection. It has a rectangular floor plan and is four stories high. On the ground floor are a shop, a café, and an introductory exhibition. The first floor shows the works of Van Gogh grouped chronologically. The second floor gives information about the restoration of paintings and has a space for minor temporary exhibitions. The third floor shows paintings of Van Gogh&#x27;s contemporaries in relationship to the work of Van Gogh himself.

=== Kurokawa wing ===
The Kurokawa wing is used for major temporary exhibitions. It has an oval floor plan and is three stories high. The entrance to the Kurokawa wing is via a tunnel from the Rietveld building.

==Collection==

===Works by Vincent van Gogh===

The museum houses the largest Van Gogh collection in the world, with 200 paintings, 400 drawings, and 700 letters by the artist.

The main exhibition chronicles the various phases of Van Gogh&#x27;s artistic life.

* His selected works from Nuenen (1880–1885):
:: &quot;Avenue of Poplars in Autumn&quot; (1884)
:: &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; (1885)

* His selected works from Antwerp (1886):
:: &quot;Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette&quot; (1886)

* His selected works from Paris (1886–1888):
:: &quot;Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin&quot; (1887)
:: &quot;Wheat Field with a Lark&quot; (1887)
:: &quot;View of Paris from Vincent&#x27;s Room in the Rue Lepic&quot; (1887)

* His selected works from Arles (1888–1889):
:: &quot;The Zouave&quot; (1888)
:: &quot;Bedroom in Arles&quot; (1888)
:: &quot;The Yellow House&quot; (1888)
:: &quot;Sunflowers&quot; (1889)

* His selected works from Saint-Rémy (1889–1890):
:: &quot;Almond Blossoms&quot; (1890)
* And his selected works from Auvers-sur-Oise (1890):
:: &quot;Wheatfield with Crows&quot; (1890)

The permanent collection also includes nine of the artist&#x27;s self-portraits and some of his earliest paintings dating back to 1882.

A newly discovered work has temporarily gone on display. Van Gogh created three unknown sketches of peasants, which were then used as a single bookmark. Stylistically, they can be dated to autumn 1881.

===Works by contemporaries===
The museum also features notable artworks by Van Gogh&#x27;s contemporaries in the Impressionist and post-Impressionist movements and holds extensive exhibitions on various subjects from 19th Century art history.

The museum has sculptures by Auguste Rodin and Jules Dalou, and paintings by John Russell, Émile Bernard, Maurice Denis, Kees van Dongen, Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

==Gallery==
==&quot;Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience&quot;==
The Van Gogh Museum manages an official &quot;Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience&quot;, described as a travelling &quot;3D immersive exhibition&quot; using technology and computer audio-visual techniques to cover the story of Van Gogh&#x27;s life through images of his works. The first &quot;experience&quot; was in 2016 in Beijing, and it has since been toured globally to Europe, Asia and North America.

The &quot;Meet Van Gogh Experience&quot; does not present original artworks, as they are too fragile to travel. The &quot;experience&quot; was designed in collaboration with the London-based museum design consultancy, Event Communications (who designed Titanic Belfast), and it won a 2017 THEA award in the category of &quot;Immersive Museum Exhibit: Touring&quot;.

== Visitors ==
The Van Gogh Museum, which is a national museum (), is a foundation ().

Axel Rüger, who had been the museum director since 2006, left the museum in 2019 to become secretary and chief executive of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The Van Gogh Museum announced that Managing Director Adriaan Dönszelmann would act as general director until a new director is appointed.

Since 2000, the museum had between 1.2 and 1.9 million visitors per year. From 2010 to 2012, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands. In 2015, the museum had 1.9 million visitors, it was the 2nd most visited museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum, and the 31st most visited art museum in the world.

The Van Gogh Museum is a member of the national Museumvereniging (Museum Association).

<text>Museon is a museum for science and culture in The Hague, Netherlands, with a strong focus on education. It regularly presents exhibitions on a range of topics related to the environment, geography or cultural identity. It has an extensive collections in the domains of geology, biology, archaeology, history, science and ethnology. The name Museon is a shortening of the museum&#x27;s original extended Dutch name - &quot;Museum ten bate van het Onderwijs.&quot; Since 2022, the museum has been merged with the nearby cinema &quot;Omniversum&quot;, and goes by the name &quot;Museon-Omniversum: One Planet&quot;

==Origin==

The museum was initiated in 1904 by the newspaper director Frits van Paasschen, who wanted to establish a museum where children could learn about industry. Although science and technology became important domains for the museum, the original idea has never been realized. Under the museum&#x27;s first director, the geologist Herman van Cappelle, the collection policy moved towards natural history and ethnology. However, Van Paasschen&#x27;s concept of a museum with a strong educational mission was implemented from the very beginning. From its start the museum organised lessons for school classes, based on the items that form part the museum&#x27;s collection. Around 1910 the museum was also the first organisation in The Netherlands that programmed educational movies, an initiative that led to the foundation of the first school cinema in the country.

==Municipal museum==
Starting as a private museum the ‘Museum for Education’ was taken over by the municipality of The Hague in 1920. In 1933, biologist Niko Tinbergen, provided the museum with a collection of objects from the Inuit in Greenland. The museum moved several times, until the municipality had its present building built in 1985, by the design by architect WG Quist. The name Museon also dates from 1985. In 1997 the museum was set up as a private body, although its principal funder remains the council of Den Haag.

==Mission==
Museon hosts educational exhibitions and programmes to communicate with a broad audience. A large part of all visitors are school children. Museon aims at transferring knowledge about man and his relation with nature and culture and provides easily accessible information about topical themes and developments in science and society. Currently the collection counts around 273,000 objects.

==2002 Portuguese Crown Jewels theft==
In 2002 a large part of the Portuguese Crown Jewels were stolen from the Museon. They were on loan for an exhibition on European Crown Jewels. Following an investigation by the museum and Dutch authorities, the Dutch government paid a sum of six million euros to the Portuguese government for reparation.
