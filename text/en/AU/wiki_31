==History==

=== Coronado ===
Spanish explorer Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado spent the winter of 1541-1542 at what is now the area of Bonner Springs. The diary of Father Juan Padilla records that the expedition reached the 40th degree (Kansas northern border) and came to a great river (the Missouri). An inscription found on a stone near Atchison has been translated as, &quot;Thus far came Francisco de Coronado, General of an Expedition.&quot; The explorers traveled downstream to the mouth of another great river, the Kansas, and preceded upstream 16 leagues to camp in what is now Bonner Springs before returning to Mexico. Due to the mineral springs, this legend gave the area its first recorded name, &quot;Coronado Springs&quot;.

=== Early settlers ===
The Kanza people had settled the area because of the mineral springs and abundant fish and game when, in 1812, two French fur traders, the Chouteau brothers, made their way from St. Louis and temporally settled in the area that would eventually become Bonner Springs, starting a trading post named &quot;Four Houses&quot;. The location allowed easy access to trade items, and a ferry to cross the Kansas River was added. With a date of 1812, it is reputed to be the first commercial center and permanent settlement in Kansas. In 1830, Henry Tiblow, a Delaware Indian, took charge of the ferry. Tiblow was a Delaware Indian who worked as an interpreter for the government. He lived in a small cabin on the west side of the city.

The location became known as &quot;Tiblow Settlement&quot;, and the ferry continued working for years. John McDanield, or &quot;Red John&quot; due to hair color, is known as the founder of Bonner Springs - as we know it today. As the owner of a vast majority of land that is now Bonner Springs, McDaniel named the town &quot;Tiblow&quot;, after his friend Henry.

=== Mineral springs ===
Several of the springs in the area were analysed for their mineral content, and the results indicated benefits that would attract visitors. The Bonner Springs Improvement Club, in 1907, created a promotional brochure touting the city as the &quot;Kansas Karlsbad&quot; and listing the contents of five springs near Lake of the Woods: Big Chief, Little Chief, Papoose, Old Squaw and Minnehaha. They listed &quot;grains per gallon&quot; of things like potassium sulphate, carbonate of iron, and chloride of sodium for each.

Big Chief was noted to be &quot;splendid water for anemics, supplying the necessary properties for good red blood and driving out the dead and impure corpuscles.&quot;

Old Squaw was reportedly so named because &quot;the old women of Indian tribes once living in Kansas found relief from their intense dyspepsia caused by their heavy meat diet and little or no exercise.&quot;

To promote the springs, a special train brought investors to the area and cited its proximity to Kansas City, the springs themselves, the fine parks and native trees, the site of a racetrack, and the beautiful residential sites as advantages that would assure the success of the mineral spring venture. In 1885, Philo Clark purchased from McDanield, with plans to capitalize on the mineral springs, then changed the name of the town to &quot;Bonner Springs&quot;. The latter portion of the name comes from a mineral spring in the area said to have medicinal qualities. The town was named after Robert E. Bonner, a publisher of the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;, who was a trotting-horse breeder of note, and Clark believed would help fund the proposed racetrack. However, there is no record this occurred.

=== Fire of 1908 ===

Bonner Springs continued to be prosperous, with a growing population and new businesses. In 1908, a fire caused over $70,000 worth of damage ($ in dollars) and destroyed between 19 and 21 local businesses. There were no water mains at the time, even though the city council had debated the issue for some time.

Many locals came to the rescue, forming a water bucket chain to help put out the fire, while they waited for a fire truck from Kansas City to arrive. An investigation indicated that materials behind Kelly &amp; Pettit&#x27;s Drug Store had caught on fire, and the winds carried the flames, making the fire difficult to control. Residents of Bonner Springs undertook thousands of dollars worth of repairs.

<doc id="150444" wikidata="Q856841" url="?curid=150444" title="Manhattan, Kansas">
<text>Manhattan is a city in and the county seat of Riley County, Kansas, United States, although the city extends into Pottawatomie County. It is located in northeastern Kansas at the junction of the Kansas River and Big Blue River. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 54,100.

The city was founded by settlers from the New England Emigrant Aid Company as a Free-State town in the 1850s, during the Bleeding Kansas era. Nicknamed &quot;the Little Apple&quot; as a play on New York City&#x27;s moniker of the &quot;Big Apple&quot;, Manhattan is the home of Kansas State University and has a distinct college town atmosphere.

==History==

===Indigenous tribes settlement===

Before settlement by European-Americans in the 1850s, the land around Manhattan was home to Native tribes. From 1780 to 1830, it was home to the Kaw people, also known as the Kansa. The Kaw settlement was called Blue Earth Village (Manyinkatuhuudje), named after the river which the tribe had named the Great Blue Earth River, today known as the Big Blue River, which intersected with the Kansas River near their village. Blue Earth Village was the site of a large battle between the Kaw and the Pawnee in 1812.

The Kaw tribe ceded ownership of this land in a treaty signed at the Shawnee Methodist Mission on January 14, 1846.

===1854: Polistra and Canton===
The KansasâNebraska Act opened the territory to settlement by U.S. citizens in 1854. That fall, George S. Park founded the first Euro-American settlement within the borders of the current Manhattan. Park named it Polistra (some histories refer to it as Poliska or Poleska).

Later that year, Samuel D. Houston and three other pioneers founded Canton, a neighboring community near the mouth of the Big Blue River. Neither Canton nor Polistra ever grew beyond their original founders.

===1855: Free-Staters===
In March 1855, a group of New England Free-Staters traveled to Kansas Territory under the auspices of the New England Emigrant Aid Company to found a Free-State town. Led by Isaac Goodnow, the first members of the group (with the help of Samuel C. Pomeroy) selected the location of the Polistra and Canton claims for the Aid Company&#x27;s new settlement. Soon after the New Englanders arrived at the site, in April 1855, they agreed to join Canton and Polistra to make one settlement named Boston. They were soon joined by dozens more New Englanders, including Goodnow&#x27;s brother-in-law Joseph Denison.

In June 1855, the paddle steamer &quot;Hartford&quot;, carrying 75 settlers from Ohio, ran aground in the Kansas River near the settlement. The Ohio settlers, who were members of the Cincinnati-Manhattan Company, had been headed farther upstream to the headwaters of the Kansas River, the location today of Junction City. After realizing they were stranded, the &quot;Hartford&quot; passengers accepted an invitation to join the new town, but insisted that it be renamed Manhattan, which was done on June 29, 1855. Manhattan was incorporated on May 30, 1857.

===Early events===

Early Manhattan settlers sometimes conflicted with Native tribes, and the town was threatened by pro-enslavement Southerners. Manhattan was staunchly Free-State, and it elected the only two Free-State legislators to the first Territorial Legislature, commonly called the &quot;Bogus Legislature&quot;. However, nearby Fort Riley protected the settlement from the major violence visited upon other Free-State towns during the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; era. This allowed the town to develop relatively quickly. On January 30, 1858, Territorial Governor James W. Denver signed an act naming Manhattan as county seat for Riley County. Ten days later, on February 9, 1858, Governor Denver chartered a Methodist college in Manhattan, named Blue Mont Central College.

The young city received another boost when gold was discovered in the Rocky Mountains in 1859 and Fifty-Niners began to stream through Manhattan on their way to prospect in the mountains. Manhattan was one of the last significant settlements on the route west, and the village&#x27;s merchants did a brisk business selling supplies to miners. Manhattan&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Kansas Express&quot;, began publishing on May 21, 1859.

In 1861, when the State of Kansas entered the Union, Isaac Goodnow, who had been a teacher in Rhode Island, began lobbying the legislature to convert Manhattan&#x27;s Blue Mont Central College into the state university. The culmination of these efforts came on February 16, 1863, when the Kansas legislature established Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in Manhattan. When the college began its first session on September 2, 1863, it was the first public college in Kansas, the nation&#x27;s first land-grant institution created under the Morrill Act, and only the second public institution of higher learning to admit women and men equally in the United States.

By the time the Kansas Pacific Railroad laid its tracks west through Manhattan in 1866, the 11-year-old settlement was permanently ensconced in the tallgrass prairie. Manhattan&#x27;s population has grown every decade since its founding.

===20th century===
The town received the All-America City Award in 1952, the first in Kansas.

==Geography==
Manhattan is located at coordinates 39.1836082, -96.5716694 in the scenic Flint Hills and Great Plains of the state of Kansas, or about west of Topeka on the Kansas River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

===Geographic features===
Manhattan is in the Flint Hills region of Kansas, which consists of continuous rolling hills covered in tall grasses. However, the downtown area â Manhattan&#x27;s original site â was built on a broad, flat floodplain at the junction of the Kansas and Big Blue rivers. Manhattan is the largest town in the Flint Hills, and is home to the Flint Hills Discovery Center.

Tuttle Creek Reservoir is north of Manhattan. The lake was formed when the Big Blue River was dammed for flood control in the 1960s, and it is now a state park that offers many recreational opportunities. South of the city is the Konza Prairie, a tallgrass prairie preserve owned by The Nature Conservancy and Kansas State University.

====Earthquakes====
Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, but Manhattan is near the Nemaha Ridge, a long structure bounded by several faults, and which is still active. In particular, the Humboldt Fault Zone lies just eastward of Tuttle Creek Reservoir.

On April 24, 1867, the 1867 Manhattan earthquake struck Riley County. Measuring 5.1 on the Richter magnitude scale, the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter was by Manhattan. It remains the strongest earthquake to originate in Kansas, at an intensity of VII (&quot;Very strong&quot;) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and felt across roughly . It caused largely minor damage, reports of which were confined to Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri, according to the United States Geological Survey.

Although Kansas is not seismically active, a strong earthquake could pose significant threats to the state. If an earthquake had occurred along the Nemaha Ridge prior to 2010, it could have destroyed the dam on Tuttle Creek Reservoir, releasing of water per second and flooding the nearby area, threatening roughly 13,000 people and 5,900 homes. A study in the 1980s found a moderate earthquake &quot;between 5.7 to 6.6 would cause sand underneath the dam to liquefy into quicksand, causing the dam to spread out and the top to drop up to three feet.&quot; To address this threat, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a project in July 2010 that replaced the sand with more than 350 concrete walls and equipped the dam with sensors. Alarms are connected to these sensors, which would alert nearby citizens to the earthquake.

===Climate===
Manhattan has a humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds an average of 58.9 days a year and an average of 9.6 days. The minimum temperature falls to or below on an average 4.1 days a year. Extreme temperatures range from on August 13, 1936, down to on February 12, 1899.

On average, Manhattan receives of precipitation annually, a majority of which occurs from May to August, and records 102 days of measurable precipitation. Measurable snowfall occurs an average of 8.8 days per year with 5.6 days receiving at least . Snow depth of at least one inch occurs an average of 20.3 days a year. Typically, the average window for freezing temperatures is October 16 through April 20.

====Tornadoes====
The state of Kansas falls within an area sometimes called Tornado Alley. The most destructive tornado in Manhattan touched down at approximately 10:30Â pm on June 11, 2008. Thirty-one homes and several businesses were destroyed by the EF4 tornado. Kansas State University&#x27;s campus incurred about $20Â million in damage â a number of university buildings sustained significant damage and the tornado&#x27;s winds destroyed the Wind Erosion Laboratory&#x27;s garage. No one was killed.

Previously, the most destructive tornado to hit Manhattan was on June 8, 1966. The 1966 tornado caused $5Â million in damage and injured at least 65 people in Manhattan.

====Flooding====

Manhattan was built on a floodplain at the junction of the Kansas and Big Blue rivers, and it has faced recurring problems with flooding from heavy precipitation. The worst floods were the 1903 and 1908 floods, the Great Flood of 1951, and the Great Flood of 1993. In 2019, record amounts of rainfall in Kansas brought water levels up massive amounts and flood records were broken that had not been seen since 1993. Tuttle Creek Reservoir recorded its second highest flood level ever on May 31 at 1,135.80 feet above sea-level. The only level higher came from The Great Flood of 1993, which recorded an astounding 1,138 feet above sea-level on July 23. The top of the emergency Spillway gates measures at 1,136 feet, only 0.2 feet above the 2019 record lake level. The only time that the emergency Spillway gates have ever been opened was on July 19, 1993, at 3:15 PM. The gates were opened 0.8 feet which allowed 10,000 cubic feet per second of water to move through the downstream channel. The gates were slowly opened more each day until July 23 at a peak 60,000 cubic feet per second (450,000 gallons per second). The gates remained open until August 9, 1993.

Historically, Manhattan was located on the national Victory Highway, one of the original 1920s auto trails. With the creation of the numbered federal highway system in 1926, the highway became U.S. Route 40. From 1926 to 1935, Route 40 diverged west out of Manhattan into &quot;40N&quot; and &quot;40S&quot; routes; the two routes met again in Limon, Colorado.

In the 1950s, Route 40 was rerouted nine miles south of Manhattan, due to security concerns that originally arose during World War II about the highway passing through neighboring Fort Riley. The new route followed a more direct line between Topeka and Junction City, and in 1956 it was designated as Interstate 70.

<text>St. Marys or Saint Marys is a city in Pottawatomie and Wabaunsee counties in Kansas of the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,759. It is a population center of Traditionalist Catholicism and the home of Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy and College.

==History==

St. Marys was laid out as a community in 1866. It was named after the St. Mary&#x27;s Mission.

The oldest surviving mission building is the Pottawatomie Indian Pay Station which was built in 1855 and was used by government agents to pay an annuity to the Pottawatomie Indians who relocated to the area from the Great Lakes region.

==History==
Before 1883, Willard was a tiny community but when the Rock Island Railroad laid tracks through it, Willard became a typical railroad town.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Topeka through Willard to Herington. The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

In the early 1920s, Willard boasted a population of over 300 and was a major cattle shipping point for this region. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many businesses closed and the railroad declined in importance. The Great Flood of 1951 destroyed much of the community and caused the roadway bridge over the Kansas River to collapse, isolating it from Rossville until a new roadway bridge was built in 1955.

<doc id="150448" wikidata="Q503991" url="?curid=150448" title="Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin">
<text>Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (; ; 19 April 1876 â 3 July 1934) was Prince of the Netherlands from 7 February 1901 until his death in 1934 as the husband of Queen Wilhelmina. He remains the longest-serving Dutch consort.

==Biography==

Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was born on 19 April 1876 in Schwerin. He was the youngest son of Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his third wife, Princess Marie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.

On 6 February 1901, Henry was created a Prince of the Netherlands and the next day, 7 February, married Queen Wilhelmina in The Hague. Their only child together, Princess Juliana, was born in 1909. On 4 September 1948, Wilhelmina abdicated as queen of the Netherlands and was succeeded by Juliana.

Henry also fathered at least one illegitimate child, Pim Lier by his mistress Willemina Martina Wenneker (1887-1973). Born in 1918, Lier eventually rose to prominence in post-war Dutch politics as chairman of the extreme-right Centre Party. The birth of a son out of wedlock was likely symptomatic of the duke&#x27;s increasingly strained relationship with his wife. That became all the more clear at the time of the opening ceremony of the Amsterdam Summer Olympics in 1928. Henry attended and even presided over the festivities, but Wilhelmina stayed away and stated that she was prevented from attending by her personal religious conviction that the type of event should not take place on a Sunday.

Henry became the 279th Knight Grand Cross of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword, and in 1924, he was appointed as the 1,157th Knight of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece.

He died in The Hague, Netherlands, on 3 July 1934, aged 58.

==Scouting==
Henry successfully merged the two Dutch Boy Scout organisations Nederlandse Padvinders Organisatie (NPO, Netherlands Pathfinder Organisation) and the Nederlandse Padvinders Bond (NPB, Netherlands Pathfinder Federation) on 11 December 1915 to form De Nederlandse Padvinders (NPV, The Netherlands Pathfinders). He became the Royal Commissioner of that organisation and he asked Jean Jacques Rambonnet to become chairman in 1920.

==Extramarital relationships==

Prince Henry was known to have had numerous extra-marital affairs. It is rumored that he fathered between three and ten illegitimate children; howevere firm proof remains elusive, except for Albrecht Willem Lier, known as the above-noted Pim Lier (22 July 1918 â 9 April 2015). During her widowhood, Queen Wilhelmina paid monthly allowances to three known ex-mistresses: Julia Cervey in Geneva (two hundred guilders per month); Wilhelmine Steiner in Zurich (five hundred guilders per month); and Mien Lier-Wenneker (1887-1973), in The Hague (five hundred guilders per month). Mien Abbo-Wenneker (later Lier-Wenneker, 1887â1973), gave birth to a total of six children; the older two, sisters Christina Margaretha Abbo &amp; Edith Abbo (later Sheep-Abbo) were ostensibly the daughters of Mien&#x27;s first husband, Dhr. Abbo, but strongly rumored to have been fathered by Prince Henry. In 1919, Mien married Lieutenant Jan Derk Lier, a former aide-de-camp to Prince Henry. A grant of one hundred thousand guilders was arranged for Lt. Lier from the State by police chief FranÃ§ois van &#x27;t Sant, whom Queen Wilhelmina engaged to verify the facts of her husband&#x27;s extramarital relationships and children. This, plus a monthly allowance to the Lt from the state of one thousand guilders, was in return for his commitment to &quot;the three children of HRH&quot;.

The male parent of the remaining three children was not verified as being either Prince Henry or Lt. Lier. Subsequent to their birth, no additional allowance was settled on the family; in fact, the monthly allowance of one thousand guilders to Lt. Jan Derk Lier was halved by van&#x27;t Sant after a short period, although the allowance to his wife continued.

<text>Junction City is a home rule-class city in Boyle County on its border with Lincoln County in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Junction City&#x27;s population was 2,241 at the 2010 U.S. census. It is part of the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Junction City began when the Louisville and Nashville Railroad reached the area. It was originally known as &quot;Goresburg&quot; for the proprietors of the Gore Hotel. The Gore post office opened in 1880, and was renamed Goresburg in 1882. The town was renamed &quot;Junction City&quot; when the Cincinnati Southern Railway reached town later that year, its tracks intersecting those of the L&amp;N. The city was formally incorporated April 8, 1882, by the state assembly. The L&amp;N station there was known as &quot;Danville Junction&quot; for its proximity to the larger city of Danville.

The southeastern part of Junction City was once the separate town of Shelby City, incorporated in 1867, and named for Kentucky&#x27;s first governor Isaac Shelby, who lived and was buried nearby. This community&#x27;s separate post office was known as &quot;South Danville&quot; when it was established April 26, 1866, renamed Shelby City the next year (the eastern portion of Junction City is still known as Shelby City), and closed in 1926. It was also known as &quot;Briartown&quot; and its L&amp;N station was called &quot;Danville Station&quot;. The tomb of Kentucky&#x27;s first governor, Isaac Shelby, and his homestead Traveler&#x27;s Rest, is located across the Lincoln County line, just south of this part of town.

==Geography==

The city lies in a broad valley south of Danville, and just north of the border between Boyle and Lincoln counties. Much of Junction City is concentrated along Shelby Street between the Cincinnati Southern tracks on the west and U.S. Route 127 on the east. The part of town east of US 127 is known as &quot;Shelby City.&quot; Kentucky Route 37 and Kentucky Route 300 intersect in northwestern Junction City.

<doc id="150452" wikidata="Q2802947" url="?curid=150452" title="Dawson Springs, Kentucky">
<text>Dawson Springs is a home rule-class city in Hopkins and Caldwell counties in the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,452.

==History==
Originally known as Tradewater Bend, the city was incorporated in 1832 under the name Dawson City by two Menser brothers.

From the late 1800s to the 1930s, Dawson Springs was well known as a spa and resort town. Visitors largely came in spring from Chicago, Louisville and points east for the curative waters, and several major hotels and boarding houses were constructed. Tourism peaked in 1901 when over 50,000 visitors came to the town of a few thousand people. The Pittsburgh Pirates held spring training there in the 1910s before being lured to St. Petersburg, Florida when the Grapefruit League formed. The advent of car travel ended the spa era as travelers began to drive to more southerly vacation spots.

Outwood Veterans Hospital was constructed here in 1922, and the economy strengthened with the onset of coal mining at Dawson Daylight Mine. The town diversified with light manufacturing in the mid-20th century, but was devastated by the outflow of those industrial jobs when NAFTA was passed in the 1990s and those manufacturing jobs moved to Mexico.

Dawson Springs is still a regional tourist destination because of the Pennyrile Forest State Resort Park, which began construction where a local river was dammed and a lake formed in the 1930s. The town was named Kentucky&#x27;s first Trail Town due to hiking and horse riding trails in the area.

===2021 tornado===

In the late evening of December 10, 2021, a large swath of the city was destroyed by an EF4 tornado, and a tornado emergency was issued for Dawson Springs and the surrounding St. Charles as the storm moved through the area. As a result, 19 people died.

<text>Corinth is a home rule-class city mostly in Grant County with a small portion of land in Scott County in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The population was 232 as of the 2010 census, up from 181 at the 2000 census.

The Grant County portion of Corinth is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, OHâKYâIN Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Scott County portion is part of the Lexington-Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Corinth community began in the late 1820s with the founding of Corinth Christian Church, but the post office was not established until 1868. The town most likely got its name from the church. In 1871, the church relocated to a new site, and in 1873-74 and new church was built, replacing the log church. Until 1876, much of Corinth was in Owen County. In 1876, it was transferred to Grant County. In 1878, Corinth was incorporated by the Kentucky State Legislature, which, in the same year, chartered the Corinth Academy. In 1890, the first of four fires occurred. The salvage of the train depot and three residences is credited to a passing train&#x27;s boiler water. The fires of 1904 and 1914 were on a similar scale. The Corinth basketball team won the 1930 state and national championships. In 1933, another fire destroyed much of the central business district, but help from other fire departments contained the fire. Much of the destruction was caused by lack of water. Steps to minimize this were taken in 1986 with the creation of the Corinth Water District. In 1995, the city obtained a grant/loan package to establish a water treatment plant in Corinth.

==Geography==
Corinth is located in southern Grant County. U.S. Route 25 passes through the center of town, leading north to Williamstown, the Grant County seat, and south to Georgetown, the Scott County seat.

<text>Astrid of Sweden (Astrid Sofia Lovisa Thyra; 17 November 1905 â 29 August 1935) was a member of the Swedish House of Bernadotte and later became Queen of the Belgians as the first wife of King Leopold III. Following her marriage to Leopold in November 1926, she assumed the title of Duchess of Brabant. Astrid held the position of Queen of the Belgians from 23 February 1934 until her death in 1935. Known for her charitable efforts, she focused particularly on causes related to women and children.

Astrid and Leopold had three children. Their daughter, JosÃ©phine-Charlotte, later became the Grand Duchess Consort of Luxembourg, while their sons both ascended the throne as King of the Belgians. Their son King Albert II named his first daughter, Princess Astrid of Belgium, after his mother. Queen Astrid was the sister of Crown Princess MÃ¤rtha of Norway (the wife of the future King Olav V).

==Early life==
Princess Astrid was born on 17 November 1905 at her parentsâ then-residence, the &quot;Arvfurstens Palats&quot; at Gustav Adolfs Torg in central Stockholm. She was the third child and youngest daughter of Prince Carl, Duke of VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland, and his wife, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the third son of Oscar II, King of Sweden and Norway, by his wife, Sophia of Nassau, and was a younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden. Astridâs mother was a daughter of King Frederik VIII of Denmark by his wife, Louise of Sweden, and the younger sister of kings Christian X of Denmark and Haakon VII of Norway.

Astrid had two elder sisters, Margaretha, Princess Axel of Denmark, and MÃ¤rtha, Crown Princess of Norway, as well as a younger brother, Prince Carl Bernadotte (prev. Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of ÃstergÃ¶tland).

Astrid grew up with her sisters and younger brother at &quot;BystrÃ¶m&#x27;s Villa&quot; (also known as Prince Carl&#x27;s Palace) on the island DjurgÃ¥rden in central Stockholm until 1923, when the family had to leave the house for financial reasons. After 1909, holidays were spent at the family&#x27;s summer residence &quot;Villa Fridhem&quot;&#x27; by BrÃ¥viken, a bay of the Baltic Sea near NorrkÃ¶ping. Astrid was raised with a strict education and little luxury. She attended the Sint Botvid boarding school, where lessons were taught in French, then went on to the Akerstrom-Soderstrom finishing school, where she studied sewing, piano, ballet and childcare. After she finished school, Astrid worked at a Stockholm orphanage where she cared for children.

==Engagement and wedding==
Due to her royal status, Astrid was named as a potential bride for a number of princes, including the future Edward VIII of the United Kingdom and the future Olav V of Norway. 

In September 1926, her engagement with Prince Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant was announced. The King said: &quot;The Queen and I would like to announce to you the impending marriage between Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, and Princess Astrid of Sweden. We are convinced that the princess will bring joy and happiness to our son. Leopold and Astrid have decided to join their lives without any pressures or reasons of state. Theirs is a true union among people with the same inclinations.&quot; Queen Elizabeth said: &quot;It is a marriage of love... tell it to our people. Nothing was arranged. Not a single political consideration prevailed in our son&#x27;s decision.&quot;

Princess Astrid entered into a civil marriage with Prince Leopold in Stockholm on 4 November 1926, and the pair were married religiously in Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, Brussels on 10 November 1926. The couple travelled separately to Antwerp after their civil marriage and reunited in Belgium. The religious marriage was attended by a large wedding party of young friends and relatives: Princess Feodora of Denmark, Princess Marie-JosÃ© of Belgium, Princess MÃ¤rtha of Sweden, Princess Ingrid of Sweden, Alfhild Ekelund, Prince Carl of Sweden, Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden, Crown Prince Olav of Norway, Margareta StÃ¤hl, Count Claes Sparre, Anna AdelswÃ¤rd, Prince Charles of Belgium, Count Folke Bernadotte, Baron Sigvard Beck-Friis, Anne Marie von Essen, and Baron Carl StrÃ¶mfelt.

Princess Astrid was given a tiara created by Belgian jeweler Van Bever as a wedding gift from the Belgian government. The original version of the diadem is a flexible diamond bandeau in a stylized Greek key motif topped with 11 large diamonds on spikes. These large stones, totaling around 100 carats on their own, symbolized the nine provinces of Belgium and the now former Belgian colony of the Congo. She later added a set of diamond arches to enclose each of the 11 independent stones. After Astrid&#x27;s death, the tiara was in King Leopold&#x27;s possession, and his second wife Lilian, Princess of RÃ©thy wore parts of the tiara, but not the full set of gems, as Lilian never held the title of Queen. Leopold abdicated the throne in favor of his son Baudouin; when Baudouin married, Leopold gave the tiara to the new queen, Fabiola, who wore it on her wedding day. She handed the jewel over after Baudouin&#x27;s death to be worn by Queen Paola who, after the abdication of her husband Albert, gave it to Mathilde, the new Queen of the Belgians.

==Duchess of Brabant==
The Duke and Duchess of Brabant spent their honeymoon in the south of France before moving into a wing of the Royal Palace of Brussels. After the honeymoon period, Princess Astrid began learning French and Dutch. Astrid was enthusiastically adopted by the Belgians for her beauty, charm and simplicity. As the Duchess of Brabant, she worked to alleviate various forms of adversity.
In October 1927, Leopold and Astrid had a daughter, Princess JosÃ©phine-Charlotte, later Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and mother of Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. The birth of JosÃ©phine-Charlotte was a difficult period for Astrid, as women were barred from the line of succession to the throne. One year later, she and her husband visited the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. They arrived on the ship &quot;Insulinde&quot;. When the couple visited Surakarta, Astrid and her husband received a box with a golden kris inside as a present from the Dutch East Indies government. Princess Astrid received a box with a fan inlaid with gold inside as a gift. Local people admired Princess Astrid&#x27;s warm, enthusiastic, and less formal attitude. The couple visited Radio Poestoko Museum and Societet Habiprojo, where they watched a wayang show. They also visited Surabaya and Bali. After having spent five months in the Dutch East Indies, the couple travelled back to Belgium on the ship &quot;Tjerimai&quot;. Upon their return, the couple moved into Stuyvenberg Castle. In September 1930, Astrid gave birth to Prince Baudouin, who eventually became King of the Belgians.

Raised as a Lutheran, Astrid converted to Catholicism after marrying Leopold. She had considered converting to Catholicism earlier, as it was the official religion of Belgium, but delayed her conversion after consulting with Fr William Hemmick, who told her to wait until she genuinely believed it was the true religion. Astrid converted to Catholicism in 1930, confiding to a close childhood friend: &quot;My soul has found peace.&quot; On the day of Astrid&#x27;s conversion, her father-in-law King Albert I said: &quot;I am glad, very glad. Now all the family is united in the same religion.&quot;

In 1932, Astrid and her husband traveled to Asia and the Congo. According to a May 1933 print of &quot;De Locomotief&quot;, the photographs of their visit to the Dutch East Indies were published as a collection in a book titled &quot;De Reis van Prins Leopold door Ned-Indie&quot;. After their visit to the Congo, Astrid wrote to her friend Countess Anna Sparre (nÃ©e Baroness Anna AdelswÃ¤rd) about the majestic landscapes of Congo land and her concerns about suffering, poverty and infant mortality that the Congolese faced.

The Duchess of Brabant became a godmother to Anna Sparre&#x27;s daughter, Christina, and her sister Crown Princess MÃ¤rtha&#x27;s second daughter, Princess Astrid.

== Queen ==
On 17 February 1934, King Albert I died in a mountain-climbing accident in Marche-les-Dames, Belgium. Leopold and Astrid became the new King and Queen of the Belgians. Later that year, the third child of Leopold and Astrid was born. He was named &quot;Albert&quot; after his grandfather, and would eventually succeed his brother Baudouin as King of the Belgians. The present King of the Belgians, Philippe, is Albert&#x27;s son.

As Queen of the Belgians, Astrid dedicated her time to raising her children and promoting social causes that brought her into contact with the Belgians. She was concerned by the situations of women, children, and disadvantaged people. During an economic crisis in Belgium in 1935 she organized the collection of clothing, money and food for the poor through an open letter, published as the &quot;Queenâs Appeal.&quot; Queen Astrid also visited poor settlements in Belgium.

Queen Astrid was particularly interested in training women formally in childcare and healthcare. She also supported the training of young girls as dressmakers to better their career opportunities. She supported Catholic charitable institutions, such as the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul, and liberal organizations, such as the &quot;FÃ©dÃ©ration des Foyers Belges&quot;. She also gave audiences to advocates of women&#x27;s rights such as Baroness Marthe BoÃ«l, president of the National Council of Belgian Women.

In May 1935, Queen Astrid patronized Milk Week, an effort to encourage Belgians to drink healthy beverages. She charged Gatien du Parc, one of her courtiers, with the task of preparing a detailed report on milk regulations in foreign countries after a strict investigation. Queen Astrid often did charitable works as part of a Relief Committee.

== Hobbies and personality ==
Queen Astrid had a warm, friendly, social, and charming personality. According to her friend Countess Anna Sparre, Astrid was a shy and insecure womanâa disposition she believes may have been influenced by Astrid&#x27;s mother favoring her elder sister MÃ¤rtha. Apparently a timid and fragile woman, Astrid could be fierce and stern when she had to defend a wronged loved one.

She collected Swedish folk art and enjoyed sports such as swimming, skiing, climbing, horseback riding and golf.

==Death==
In August 1935, the King and Queen went incognito to their holiday home, &quot;Villa Haslihorn&quot; in Horw, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, Switzerland. JosÃ©phine-Charlotte and Baudouin travelled with their parents, while the one-year-old Prince Albert remained in Brussels.

On 29 August 1935, the King and Queen went for a last hike in the mountains before returning home. Their chauffeur was sitting in the back of the Packard One-Twenty convertible; the King was driving and the Queen looking at a map. At approximately 9:30 am the Queen pointed out something to her husband, who looked away from the road. The car left the road, travelled down a steep slope, and collided with a pear tree. Queen Astrid had opened her door in an attempt to jump off but was thrown out upon impact, dying instantly after striking her head on the trunk of the tree while the car hit a second tree. She was only 29 years old.

Queen Astrid is interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken, Brussels, beside her husband, King Leopold III, and his second wife, Lilian, Princess of RÃ©thy.

==Legacy==
=== Folklore ===
, a Swiss historian, describes how Queen Astrid entered folklore in Belgium and Switzerland. Months after her death, newlyweds brought flowers to the place where the Queen died. The chapel visitors would also bring wreaths and candles. The visits peaked on feasts of All Saints and All Souls. The Queen was described as an icon of beauty, kindness, romance, marriage, and as a model Catholic. The Mayor of KÃ¼ssnacht told the Belgian Ambassador to Switzerland: &quot;It is on pilgrimage that these couples arrive here from all over the canton. These young newlyweds, in bridal dress, whom you saw visiting the place where Queen Astrid passed away, are imploring her protection. Your young Queen has become part of Swiss legend; she is, for our people, who have beatified her in their hearts, the symbol of maternal love and conjugal fidelity.&quot;

===Memorials===
In 1935, the Belgian postal authorities issued a postage stamp showing her portrait outlined in black. This is known as the &quot;Astrid Mourning&quot; issue. Later that same year, it released a series of anti-tuberculosis fund stamps with the same design. in 8th arrondissement of Paris was named in her memory.

A commemorative chapel named &quot;Astrid Chapel&quot; was built in Switzerland at the site of the crash. The Swiss government gave the land to Belgium a year after Astrid&#x27;s death and the chapel was built in the style of a Walloon country church. The chapel has become a destination for Swedish and Belgian tourists. &quot;The King&#x27;s Cross&quot;, built where the Queen died in her husband&#x27;s arms, is made from Swedish granite. A museum nearby holds images and memorabilia of the event, including a shard from the windshield and the trunk of the pear tree. The tree itself fell after a storm in 1992. The car was sunk at a deep part of the VierwaldstÃ¤ttersee at the request of the king.

A memorial was built by the architect Paul Bonduelle in Laeken, Belgium, and inaugurated on 21 July 1938. The building, which is in the late neo-classical style, faces the Church of Our Lady of Laeken and backs onto the Palace of Laeken. The same year, on the initiative of the local Veterans&#x27; Front, a bronze bust of the Queen was erected in WisterzÃ©e Park in Court-Saint-Ãtienne, Belgium, by sculptor Victor Rousseau.

Astrid Avenue in Bogor Botanical Garden in Indonesia was named after her while she was honeymooning there with her spouse in 1928. The avenue is decorated with spectacular displays of canna lilies of various colors. The Swedish layer cake Princess cake was named after Astrid and her two sisters when they were children.

=== Names ===
Four of her descendants were named Astrid to honour her: her granddaughters Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg, Princess Astrid of Belgium, her great-granddaughter Princess Marie-Astrid of Liechtenstein and her great-great-granddaughter Archduchess Anna Astrid of Austria-Este. Her niece Princess Astrid of Norway (later Mrs. Ferner) was also named in her honour. Her husband King Leopold III&#x27;s first daughter with his second wife Lilian Baels, Princess Marie-Christine DaphnÃ© Astrid Ãlisabeth LÃ©opoldine of Belgium (b. 1951), was named after her.

Their land was held and cultivated in common, but managed by Abraham Banta. It was variously known as &quot;The Dutch Tract&quot;, the &quot;Low Dutch Settlement&quot; or &quot;Station&quot;, and &quot;Bantatown&quot;, but the post office was established as &quot;Pleasureville&quot; , and the city was incorporated under that name in 1842.

Rennick relates the local story that it derived from a visitor expressing what a pleasure it was to stay among such pleasant people. This story was also detailed in an autobiography of Isaac Newton LeCompte in 1919, where he noted, &quot;My Great Uncle, Major Joe LeCompte, who was a politician as well as a soldier, upon his rounds as a candidate for Congress (he was elected four terms) frequently passed through this village and upon one occasion he remarked that every time he passed through he heard the men whistling and the woman singing and suggested that the town should be named Pleasureville, and so it was.&quot; Others say the area of the post office housed a bordello (at the site of the later Pleasureville Hotel and a present-day apartment building).

In 1858, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad arrived, but its course ran about a mile south of the former community. The post office relocated to the new settlement around the depot in 1874, which received the name &quot;Pleasureville&quot;, and the former city became known as &quot;North Pleasureville&quot;. It received a separate post office under that name in 1879. The town and city merged in 1962, although the two halves are still sometimes called &quot;North Town&quot; and &quot;South Town&quot; by locals.

<text>A parable is a succinct, didactic story, in prose or verse, that illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters. A parable is a type of metaphorical analogy.

Some scholars of the canonical gospels and the New Testament apply the term &quot;parable&quot; only to the parables of Jesus, although that is not a common restriction of the term.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;parable&quot; comes from the Greek ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î²Î¿Î»Î® (&quot;parabolÄ&quot;), literally &quot;throwing&quot; (&quot;bolÄ&quot;) &quot;alongside&quot; (&quot;para-&quot;), by extension meaning &quot;comparison, illustration, analogy.&quot; It was the name given by Greek rhetoricians to an illustration in the form of a brief fictional narrative.

==History==
The Bible contains numerous parables in the Gospels of the New Testament (Jesus&#x27; parables). These are believed by some scholars (such as John P. Meier) to have been inspired by &quot;mashalim&quot;, a form of Hebrew comparison prominent in the Talmudic period (c. 2nd-6th centuries CE). Examples of Jesus&#x27; parables include the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. Mashalim from the Old Testament include the parable of the ewe-lamb (told by Nathan in 2 Samuel 12:1-9) and the parable of the woman of Tekoah (in 2 Samuel 14:1-13 ).

Parables also appear in Islam. In Sufi tradition, parables are used for imparting lessons and values. Recent authors such as Idries Shah and Anthony de Mello have helped popularize these stories beyond Sufi circles.

Modern parables also exist. A mid-19th-century example, the parable of the broken window, criticizes a part of economic thinking.

==Characteristics==

A parable is a short tale that illustrates a universal truth; it is a simple narrative. It sketches a setting, describes an action, and shows the results. It may sometimes be distinguished from similar narrative types, such as the allegory and the apologue.

A parable often involves a character who faces a moral dilemma or one who makes a bad decision and then suffers the unintended consequences. Although the meaning of a parable is often not explicitly stated, it is not intended to be hidden or secret but to be quite straightforward and obvious.

The defining characteristic of the parable is the presence of a subtext suggesting how a person should behave or what he should believe. Aside from providing guidance and suggestions for proper conduct in one&#x27;s life, parables frequently use metaphorical language which allows people to more easily discuss difficult or complex ideas. Parables express an abstract argument by means of using a concrete narrative which is easily understood.

The allegory is a more general narrative type; it also employs metaphor. An allegory may have multiple noncontradictory interpretations and may also have implications that are ambiguous or hard to interpret. As H.W. Fowler put it, the object of both parable and allegory &quot;is to enlighten the hearer by submitting to him a case in which he has apparently no direct concern, and upon which therefore a disinterested judgment may be elicited from him, ...&quot; The parable is more condensed than the allegory: it rests upon a single principle and a single moral, and it is intended that the reader or listener shall conclude that the moral applies equally well to his own concerns.
==Parables of Jesus==

Medieval interpreters of the Bible often treated Jesus&#x27; parables as allegories, with symbolic correspondences found for every element in his parables. But modern scholars, beginning with Adolf JÃ¼licher, regard their interpretations as incorrect. JÃ¼licher viewed some of Jesus&#x27; parables as similitudes (extended similes or metaphors) with three parts: a picture part (&quot;BildhÃ¤lfte&quot;), a reality part (&quot;SachhÃ¤lfte&quot;), and a &quot;tertium comparationis&quot;. JÃ¼licher held that Jesus&#x27; parables are intended to make a single important point.

Gnostics suggested that Jesus kept some of his teachings secret within the circle of his disciples and that he deliberately obscured their meaning by using parables. For example, in Mark 4:11â12:

The idea that coded meanings in parables would only become apparent when a listener had been given additional information or initiated into a higher set of teachings is supported by &quot;The Epistle of Barnabas,&quot; reliably dated between AD 70 to 132: For if I should write to you concerning things immediate or future, ye would not understand them, because they are put in parables. So much then for this. 
Another important component of the parables of Jesus is their participatory and spontaneous quality. Often, but not always, Jesus creates a parable in response to a question from his listeners or an argument between two opposing views. 

To the educated Greco-Roman audience, Jesusâ use of parables was reminiscent of many famous oratory styles like the Socratic method. As a literary work, the Gospel authorship depict the various groups that question Jesus about his teachings, to the role an interlocutor has in the Socratic Dialogues of Plato.

Similarly, the rhetorical style of the Roman Senator and lawyer Cicero (which remained highly regarded after his death by many famous orators) was known for its use of a seemingly unrelated anecdote that demonstrates in its conclusion some insight pertaining to the current topic of the discussion.

==Quranic parables==

The Quran&#x27;s Q39:28-30 boasts &quot;every kind of parable in the Quran&quot;. The Quranic verses include parables of the good and evil tree (Q14:32-45), of the two men, and of the spider&#x27;s house. Q16:77 contains the parable of the slave and his master, followed by the parable of the blind man and the sighted.

==Other figures of speech==
The parable is related to figures of speech such as metaphor and simile. A parable is like a metaphor in that it uses concrete, perceptible phenomena to illustrate abstract ideas. It may be said that a parable is a metaphor that has been extended to form a brief, coherent narrative. A parable also resembles a simile, i.e., a metaphorical construction in which something is said to be &quot;like&quot; something else (e.g., &quot;The just man is like a tree planted by streams of water&quot;). However, unlike the meaning of a simile, a parable&#x27;s meaning is implicit (although not secret).

<doc id="150464" wikidata="Q2688891" url="?curid=150464" title="Prospect, Kentucky">
<text>Prospect is a home rule-class city in Jefferson and Oldham counties in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The Jefferson County portion is a part of the Louisville Metro government. The population was 4,592 as of the 2020 census, down from 4,698 at the time of the 2010 census. It is one of the wealthiest communities in Kentucky.

==History==

The area was first known as &quot;Sand Hill&quot; when it was settled by farmers in the late 18th century. The present community grew up around the &quot;Prospect&quot; railroad station erected by the Louisville, Harrods Creek and Westport Railway . The name referred either to the view from the top of the hill or the expected completion of the line (which owing to the Long Depression never did reach Westport and collapsed into bankruptcy in 1879). When the post office was established in 1886, the local postmaster named it &quot;Wilhoyte&quot; in his own honor, but the community corrected this within the month.

Although a few luxury residences existed in the area from the late 19th century and the Louisville Railway Company offered hourly electrified-rail trolleys along the former LHC&amp;W line after 1904, it was largely agricultural until the mid-1960s when large, high-end subdivisions were built in the area, most notably Hunting Creek, which included a golf course.

<doc id="150465" wikidata="Q2941325" url="?curid=150465" title="Corbin, Kentucky">
<text>Corbin is a home rule-class city in Whitley, Knox and Laurel counties in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 7,856.

Corbin is on Interstate 75 and US Route 25W, about halfway between Knoxville, Tennessee, and Lexington, Kentucky.

==History==

The first settlement in the Corbin area was known as Lynn Camp Station. The first post office was called Cummins, for community founder Nelson Cummins. It was discovered in 1885 that both Cummins and Lynn Camp were already in use as names for Kentucky post offices, and postmaster James Eaton was asked to select another name. He chose Corbin for the Rev. James Corbin Floyd, a local minister. The town was incorporated under that name in 1905.

Corbin has a troubled racial past, including a race riot in late October 1919 in which a white mob forced nearly all the town&#x27;s 200 black residents onto a freight train out of town and a sundown town policy until the late 20th century. The event is the subject of a 1991 documentary, &quot;Trouble Behind&quot;. In October 2019, city leaders marked the riot&#x27;s centennial with a proclamation acknowledging the riot and former sundown town policy.

For most of its history, the urbanized areas of Corbin in Laurel County were not incorporated into the city limits due to a state law prohibiting cities from being in more than two counties. However, a 2021 change to state law allowed cities to voluntarily annex property in a third county if the city already provides public infrastructure to that property. In March 2022, the Corbin City Commission approved an annexation request for a property in Laurel County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Corbin has a total area of , with only a tiny fraction of , or 0.56%, consisting of water.

Corbin lies in the Cumberland Plateau region of Appalachia in southeastern Kentucky, along Interstate 75 and U.S. Route 25W. I-75 provides access to the city from exit 25, leading north to Lexington and south to Knoxville, Tennessee. U.S. 25W runs through the center of town, leading north to London (via U.S. Route 25) and south to Williamsburg.

The Pine Mountain Overthrust Fault, a geologic fault system several miles to the east, produces occasional tremors, the most recent in 2008.

===Climate===
Corbin exhibits a humid subtropical climate, typical of southeastern Kentucky. The region experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with mild periods. Summers are generally hot and humid, with variable spring and fall seasons. Precipitation is common year-round but more prevalent in the summer monthsâthe surrounding mountains somewhat moderate Corbin&#x27;s climate. 


==Demographics==
Corbin is near the center of the Corbin, Kentucky micropolitan area, whose current boundaries were established in 2023 by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in coordination with the United States Census Bureau. Previously, the London micropolitan area had consisted solely of Laurel County, while the Whitley County portion of Corbin was the principal city of its own micropolitan area that consisted solely of that county. Both entities were in turn the components of a statistical entity officially known as the &quot;CorbinâLondon, KY Combined Statistical Area&quot;. The CSA had a combined population of 94,486 at the 2010 census. The Knox County portion of Corbin was outside the former CorbinâLondon statistical area but is now included in the redefined London micropolitan area.

As of the 2010 census there were 7,304 people, 3,093 households, and 1,903 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,507 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 97.41% White (96.69% non-Hispanic), 0.26% African American, 0.31% Native American or Alaska Native, 0.64% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 1.11% from two or more races. No Pacific Islanders lived in the city in 2010. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1.19% of the population.

There were 3,093 households, out of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.3% were married couples living together, 16.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 38.5% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27, and the average family size was 2.91.

The age distribution was 22.5% under 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 22.9% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 20.8% who were 65 or older. The median age was 41.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.8 males.

Income data from the 2010 Census for Kentucky locations have not yet been released. As of the 2000 Census, the median income for a household in the city was $22,203. The median income for a family was $32,784. Males had a median income of $27,323 versus $17,568 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,200. About 15.5% of families and 21.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.0% of those under age 18 and 16.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Initially provided by L&amp;N Railroad, rail transport was the backbone of the local economy in the first half of the 20th century. While the railroad (presently CSX) continues to play an important role, the decline of the rail industry in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as the loss of some manufacturing jobs, has prompted the community to begin diversifying its economy.

==Culture==
Each year in early August, Corbin hosts a festival called NIBROC (&quot;Corbin&quot; spelled backward) featuring open-air concerts, carnival attractions, a beauty pageant, parade, and other events. The festival is featured, if anachronistically, in the play &quot;Last Train to Nibroc&quot; by Arlene Hutton. (Though the play is set in the 1940s, the festival itself only dates to 1952.) NIBROC often features free performances by popular musical acts such as 38 Special, Foghat, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Kansas, The Marshall Tucker Band, Percy Sledge, Rick Springfield, Starship, Styx and The Turtles. In episode 10 of the American reality-documentary television series &quot;On the Road with Austin &amp; Santino&quot; on Lifetime entitled &quot;We Love a Parade&quot;, the fashion designers visit Corbin to custom-design a dress for a local woman participating in the NIBROC parade.

Despite being in dry counties (Knox and Whitley), like many southern cities, the city of Corbin allows full retail alcohol sales, following a successful local option election on February 14, 2012. The city had previously voted in 2004 to allow sales of alcohol by the drink in larger restaurants.

Corbin has an association with Kentucky Fried Chicken, having been the location of the chain&#x27;s first restaurant, opened in 1930. Corbin appears in the animated cartoon &quot;South Park&quot;â³s episode &quot;Medicinal Fried Chicken&quot;, wherein Eric Cartman visits the town to meet with Harland Sanders. Corbin is depicted as located in a lush rain forest in a parody of the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;, wherein Tony Montana and Omar Suarez visit Bolivia to meet with a drug kingpin.

==Government==
Corbin is governed by a mayor and city commission and a city manager who runs the departments&#x27; day-to-day operations. Currently, Marlon Sams is the city manager. Since it does not have a mayor/alderman form of government, Corbin is considered home rule-class under Kentucky&#x27;s city classification system that took effect in 2015. Susie Razmus is the current mayor. Trent Knuckles, David Grigsby Hart, Ed Tye, and Andrew Pennington are its four current commissioners.

Corbin is one of the few cities in Kentucky that lie in two countiesâWhitley and Knox. Many built-up areas in neighboring Laurel County have a Corbin postal address but lie outside the city limits. This arrangement has created some problems with taxes and census records. The city receives a portion of the occupational tax collected in Whitley County. However, Knox County has refused to give Corbin any tax collected there. On March 10, 2008, the City Commission voted to file a lawsuit against Knox County to receive a portion of the tax collected within city limits. On May 23, 2014, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that the &quot;Stivers amendment&quot;, passed as part of KY HB 499 &quot;Tax Amnesty&quot; legislation in 2012, did not violate the state&#x27;s constitution. The measure essentially canceled the effect of court rulings that would have enabled Corbin to keep all the revenue from the tax generated inside the city limits. Corbin&#x27;s mayor, Willard McBurney, vowed to carry the fight to the state Supreme Court.

Corbin is in Kentucky&#x27;s 5th congressional district.

==Education==
Corbin, like many communities of its size in southeastern Kentucky, has an independent school system (in Kentucky, a public school system not affiliated with a county; most such districts are associated with individual cities). The district was officially established in 1916, and the 100th class graduated in 2017. The Corbin Independent School District includes:
* Corbin Preschool Center
* Corbin Primary (grades K-3)
* Corbin Elementary (grades 4â5) (Currently housed by the newest building in the district after a complete remodeling of the former Middle School.
* Corbin Middle (grades 6â8)
* Corbin High (grades 9â12) (Currently housed by the oldest building in the district)
* Corbin School Of Innovation

The community and school system place considerable emphasis on the success of academics and high school athletic teams. Corbin &quot;Redhound&quot; sports are important social events within the community.

In 2004, Eastern Kentucky University opened an extension campus in Corbin.

The annual &quot;Battle for the Brass Lantern&quot;, a college football rivalry game between the University of the Cumberlands and Union Commonwealth University (formerly Union College), was played at Corbin High School&#x27;s stadium in 2006 and 2007, as a neutral field roughly equidistant from the two campuses. The rivalry dates to 1905.

Corbin was formerly home to Saint Camillus Academy, a private pre-K-8 Catholic school affiliated with the Diocese of Lexington. Established in 1908 by the Sisters of Divine Providence, the school has been successful as both a boarding school for national and international students and as a Montessori school. Its original schoolhouse, built in 1913, was demolished in summer 2008. The new school building is still situated atop a prominent hill overlooking the town, providing a striking backdrop to the streets of downtown Corbin. The school closed in 2012 after 99 years of service. The property and grounds of the school were sold to the Corbin School System to house a new Corbin Middle School due to the rapidly increasing student population and age of the current building.

Corbin has a lending library, the Corbin Public Library.

==Transportation==
Corbin straddles Interstate 75 and U.S. Highway 25 (which splits into US 25E and US 25W in North Corbin). The town is served by the CSX rail line.

<text>LiÃ¨ge ( ; ; ; ; ) is the easternmost province of the Wallonia region of Belgium.

LiÃ¨ge Province is the only Belgian province that has borders with three countries. It borders (clockwise from the north) the Dutch province of Limburg, the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, the Luxembourgish canton of Clervaux, the Belgian Walloon (French-speaking) provinces of Luxembourg, Namur and Walloon Brabant and the Belgian Flemish (Dutch-speaking) provinces of Flemish Brabant and Limburg.

Part of the eastern-most area of the province, bordering Germany, is the German-speaking region of Eupen-Malmedy, which became part of Belgium in the aftermath of World War I.

The capital and the largest city of the province is the city of the same name, LiÃ¨ge. The province has an area of , and a population of 1.12 million as of January 2024.

== History ==

The modern borders of the province of LiÃ¨ge date from 1795, which saw the unification of the Principality of the Prince-Bishopric of LiÃ¨ge with the revolutionary French Department of the Ourthe (sometimes spelled Ourte). (Parts of the old Principality of LiÃ¨ge also went into new French dÃ©partements Meuse-InfÃ©rieure, and Sambre-et-Meuse.)

The province of Ourthe, as it was known then, was under French control during the reign of Napoleon, who visited the city during one of his campaigns. Napoleon ordered the destruction of its vineyards in order to prevent the LiÃ¨ge wine industry from competing with those elsewhere in France. 

Following Napoleon&#x27;s fall from power in 1815, LiÃ¨ge became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while eastern half of modern Verviers became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. LiÃ¨ge University scholars helped to write the new Dutch constitution after the Napoleonic Wars. Despite these contributions there was a widespread perception among the people of LiÃ¨ge that they were discriminated against by the Dutch government due to religious and language differences.

In September 1830, rumors spread of a revolt in Brussels to expel the Dutch. LiÃ¨ge intellectuals responded to these events by contacting Walloon scholars living in Paris to discuss Belgian independence. A militia was formed to press these demands led by Charlier &quot;Wooden Leg&quot; leading (eventually) to the formation of an independent Kingdom of Belgium.

In the 19th century, the province was an early center of the Industrial Revolution. Its rich coal deposits and steel factories helped Belgium to form the basis of the region&#x27;s increasing economic power.

During the 20th century, due to LiÃ¨ge&#x27;s borders with Germany, it saw fierce fighting in both World Wars. In World War I, LiÃ¨ge&#x27;s strong line of reinforced concrete military forts temporarily halted the German advance through Belgium, giving time to construct trenches in Flanders which subsequently saw some of the worst fighting of that war. It also saw some of the war&#x27;s worst civilian casualties as the Imperial German Army performed collective punishments against local villagers for acts of resistance. In 1925 the East Cantons and Neutral Moresnet, that had become part of Belgium as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, were absorbed into the province of LiÃ¨ge.

In World War II, LiÃ¨ge was the site of major fighting during the Battle of the Bulge. There, the Germans orchestrated their final offensive move against the combined Allied armies. Malmedy and Saint-Vith in particular saw intense battles against the Nazis. Malmedy was the site of a Waffen-SS massacre of U.S. Army prisoners of war. 

LiÃ¨ge&#x27;s heavy industry thrived in the 1950s and 1960sbut has been in decline since that time. Nevertheless, LiÃ¨ge remains the last city of Wallonia to maintain a functioning steel industry.

LiÃ¨ge continues to be the economic and cultural capital of Wallonia, with its university, medieval heritage and heavy industry.

<text>Eunice is a city in Acadia and St. Landry parishes in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The 2010 census placed the population at 10,398, a decrease of 1,101, or 9.5 percent, from the 2000 tabulation of 11,499.

The St. Landry Parish portion of Eunice is part of the OpelousasâEunice Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the Acadia Parish portion is part of the Crowley Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

One-time lawman and pioneer land developer C.C. Duson is credited with founding Eunice, which was named for his second wife, Eunice Pharr Duson. He and his brother, W.W. Duson, had already founded Crowley, Louisiana in 1887, and he looked to the north of the parish for future development. Duson bought of land from Willie Humble of Prairie FaquetaÃ¯que and mapped out a town site, laid out in lots 50-by-140 feet, 12 lots to the block. Next, he persuaded the Southern Pacific Railroad to extend a branch line from Crowley to his new town. Then he began what he and his brother had learned how to do as well as anyone: promote land sales. It was chartered as a village on September 12, 1894, and incorporated as a town on June 4, 1895.

Evangeline Parish was created with the passage of a bill in June 1908. Eunice and Ville Platte were in competition for the parish seat, and Ville Platte was selected by voters on April 12, 1909. After the election, Eunice declared it would remain in St. Landry Parish.

In May 2000 a chemical freight train derailed in Eunice, spilling numerous hazardous chemicals and causing about 15 tank cars to explode and burn; approximately 3,500 residents of the town were evacuated for as many as five days. Over 10,000 residents settled in May 2004 for $65 million with the Union Pacific Corporation in a class action suit, claiming that the corporation had failed to repair a defective section of track.

<text>DeRidder is a city in, and the parish seat of, Beauregard Parish, Louisiana, United States. A small portion of the city extends into Vernon Parish. As of the 2010 census DeRidder had a population of 10,578. It is the smaller principal city of the DeRidder-Fort Johnson South CSA, a Combined Statistical Area that includes the Fort Johnson South (Vernon Parish) and DeRidder (Beauregard Parish) micropolitan areas, which had a combined population of 87,988 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
DeRidder was named for Ella de Ridder, the sister-in-law of a Dutch railroad financier, Jan de Goeijen (cf. De Queen, Arkansas). Her family originally came from the small town of Geldermalsen in the Netherlands, where she was one of 13 children. She ran away from home at an early age and was presumed dead by her family, who only later discovered that she had traveled to the United States. The town was named for her by her brother-in-law, who brought the first railroad to that area of Louisiana. Prior to that, the little town was known as Schovall. The first train line to serve DeRidder came in 1897. It was the Pittsburgh &amp; Gulf Railroad, later called the Kansas City Southern.

The July 26, 1924, the &quot;DeRidder Enterprise&quot; stated: &quot;The first house in DeRidder was made of logs and covered with board shingles, split by hand from the logs of the forest. It was constructed in 1893 and was the old homestead house of Calvin Shirley, who was the original owner of the land upon which the first business house and residence of DeRidder were built. Mr. Shirley homesteaded the which was later platted and became the original townsite of DeRidder.&quot;

According to Eva Stewart Frazar, whose family came to DeRidder near the turn of the century, &quot;The largest pine in the world grew where DeRidder now stands - or so it is claimed by timber men who knew.&quot;

About the origin of the town, she says, &quot;the Kansas City railroad was built from Kansas City to Port Arthur - and came right through here about 1896. By 1898 the trains were running. The post-office was named Miersburg for the postmaster whose name was Miers. The railroad workers had used this spot for a camping place for the workmen - and people wanted to get near the railroad - so of land was bought for the town site.&quot;

&quot;Immediately following the purchase of the town site, a ramble of rough houses were hurriedly built out of rough lumber... By 1898 the town consisted of nearly 300 people and a number of shack homes and a sawmill. C. Landry and Mr. George Heard had a hotel. There were about 5 small stores, besides. West Brothers had a Rous Racket store on the east side of the track.&quot;

By this time DeRidder had a sawmill, and timber was the prime industry of the area. The longleaf pine was the primary tree used in the industry. In 1903, DeRidder was finally incorporated as a town.

In April 1904, a large portion of the business section of DeRidder was destroyed by fire. The cause was apparently arson. A grand jury collected enough evidence for this to indict George Smith, a gambler, with setting the fire. The man reportedly left town.

DeRidder&#x27;s first bank opened in 1906. On October 15, 1912, DeRidder was voted the parish seat of Beauregard Parish. The Beauregard Parish Court House and the Beauregard Parish Jail (see below) were built in 1914.

In July 27, 2024, recent DeRidder mayor Misty Dawn Roberts Clanton, an independent who was first elected in 2018, resigned after being investigated for rape of a juvenile and would then be arrested five days later after turning herself in. The local fire chief was named to be the city&#x27;s acting mayor.

==Culture==
The building known as the &quot;Old Beauregard Parish Jail&quot; is a structure built in 1914 that is considered one of the most distinctive of its type in the US. The structure has the characteristics of the collegiate Gothic Revival architectural style, with shallow arches, dormer windows, and a central tower. This style was popular with colleges, universities, and churches. The iron bars in most of the windows give the structure an eerie appearance. Inside, there is a spiral staircase that leads up to three floors of jail cells. Another history-making fact is that each cell had a toilet, shower, lavatory and window. When the jail was in use, prisoners could often be seen waving from the barred windows.

It was built to house 50 or so prisoners, but held 13 in comfort. The walls are thick, made of reinforced concrete with a blasted finish. The first floor has quarters for the jailer and his family. In the jail&#x27;s basement, a long corridor leads to the courthouse next door.

In 1928, there was a famous double execution by hanging in the jail for two murderers. These were the only recorded hangings in the jail. The prisoners were hanged by an apparatus at the top of the spiral staircase. After this the jail became known as &quot;the hanging jail&quot;.

The jail was used until 1982, when a court action forced it to close. On October 4, 1981, it was put on the National Register of Historic Places, along with several other buildings in DeRidder.

==Historic District==
In 1983 Washington, Second, Stewart, and Port streets were added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Beauregard Parish as the DeRidder Commercial Historic District.

<doc id="150473" wikidata="Q80517" url="?curid=150473" title="Shreveport, Louisiana">
<text>Shreveport ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Louisiana. It is the third-most populous city in Louisiana after New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The bulk of Shreveport is in Caddo Parish, of which it is the parish seat. It extends along the west bank of the Red River into neighboring Bossier Parish. The 2020 census tabulation for the city&#x27;s population was 201,573, while the ShreveportâBossier City metropolitan area had a population of 393,406.

Shreveport was founded in 1836 by the Shreve Town Company, a corporation established to develop a town at the juncture of the newly navigable Red River and the Texas Trail, an overland route into the newly independent Republic of Texas. It grew throughout the 20th century and, after the discovery of oil in Louisiana, became a national center for the oil industry. Standard Oil of Louisiana and United Gas Corporation were headquartered in the city until the 1960s and 1980s, respectively. After the loss of jobs in the oil industry, the closure of General Motors&#x27; Shreveport Operations, and other economic problems, it struggled with a declining population, poverty, drugs, and violent crime. However, the city continues in its efforts to revitalize its infrastructure, revive the economy through diversification, and lower crime. Despite these efforts, the city witnessed the largest number of homicides in its recorded history in 2021, eclipsing the previous record set in 1993.

Shreveport is the educational, commercial and cultural center of the Ark-La-Tex region, where Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas meet. It is the location of Centenary College of Louisiana, Louisiana State University Shreveport, Louisiana Tech University Shreveport, Southern University at Shreveport, and Louisiana Baptist University. It forms part of the I-20 Cyber Corridor linking Shreveport to Dallas and Atlanta. Companies with significant operations or headquarters in Shreveport are Amazon, Regions Financial Corporation, JPMorgan Chase, Sam&#x27;s Town Hotel and Gambling Hall, AT&amp;T Mobility, United Parcel Service, Walmart, SWEPCO, General Electric, UOP LLC, Calumet Specialty Products Partners, and APS Payroll.

==History==
===Early settlers===
Shreveport was established to create a town at the meeting point of the Brown Bricks and the Texas Trail. The Red River was made navigable by Captain Henry Miller Shreve, who led the United States Army Corps of Engineers efforts to clear the Red River. A natural log jam, the Great Raft, had previously obstructed passage to shipping. Shreve used a specially modified riverboat, the &quot;Heliopolis&quot;, to remove the log jam. The company and the village of Shreve Town were named in Shreve&#x27;s honor.

Shreve Town was originally contained within the boundaries of a piece of land sold to the company in 1835 by the indigenous Caddo Indians. In 1838 Caddo Parish was created from the large Natchitoches Parish, and Shreve Town became its parish seat. On March 20, 1839, the town was incorporated as Shreveport. Originally, the town consisted of 64 city blocks, created by eight streets running west from the Red River and eight streets running south from Cross Bayou, one of its tributaries.

Shreveport soon became a center of steamboat commerce, carrying mostly cotton and agricultural crops from the plantations of Caddo Parish. Shreveport also had a slave market, though slave trading was not as widespread as in other parts of the state. Steamboats plied the Red River, and stevedores loaded and unloaded cargo. By 1860, Shreveport had a population of 2,200 free people and 1,300 slaves within the city limits.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
During the American Civil War, Shreveport was the capital of Louisiana from 1863 to 1865, having succeeded Baton Rouge and Opelousas after each fell under Union control. The city was a Confederate stronghold throughout the war and was the site of the headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederate Army. Fort Albert Sidney Johnston was built on a ridge northwest of the city. Because of limited development in that area, the site is relatively undisturbed in the 21st century.

Isolated from events in the east, the Civil War continued in the Trans-Mississippi theater for several weeks after Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender in April 1865, and the Trans-Mississippi was the last Confederate command to surrender, on May 26, 1865. &quot;The period May 13â21, 1865, was filled with great uncertainly after soldiers learned of the surrenders of Lee and Johnston, the Good Friday assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and the rapid departure of their own generals.&quot; In the confusion there was a breakdown of military discipline and rioting by soldiers. They destroyed buildings containing service records, a loss that later made it difficult for many to gain Confederate pensions from state governments.

The Red River, opened by Shreve in the 1830s, remained navigable throughout the Civil War. But seasonal water levels got so low at one point that Union Admiral David Dixon Porter was trapped with his gunboats north of Alexandria. His engineers quickly constructed a temporary dam to raise the water level and free his fleet.

In 1873, Shreveport lost 759 citizens in an 80-day period to a yellow fever epidemic, with over 400 additional victims eventually succumbing. The total death toll from August through November was approximately 1,200. Five Roman Catholic priests in the city and two religious sisters died while caring for yellow fever victims in the city.

===20th century to present===
Greenwood Cemetery was established in 1893. A number of local African American musicians became nationally famous. By the 1910s, Huddie William Ledbetterâalso known as &quot;Lead Belly&quot;, a blues singer and guitaristâwas performing for Shreveport audiences in St. Paul&#x27;s Bottoms, the notable red-light district of Shreveport that operated legally from 1903 to 1917. Ledbetter began to develop his own style of music after exposure to a variety of musical influences on Fannin Street, a row of saloons, brothels, and dance halls in the Bottoms. Bluesmen Jesse Thomas, Dave Alexander, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and the early jazz and ragtime composers Bill Wray and Willian Christopher O&#x27;Hare were all from Shreveport. Lead Belly achieved international fame.

By 1914, neglect and lack of use, due to diversion of freight traffic to railroad lines, resulted in the Red River becoming unnavigable. In projects accomplished over decades, in 1994, the United States Army Corps of Engineers restored navigability by completion of a series of federally funded lock-and-dam structures and a navigation channel.

As early as 1924, the citizens of Shreveport became interested in hosting a military flying field. In 1926, Shreveport citizens learned that the 3rd Attack Wing stationed at Fort Crockett, Texas, would be enlarged by 500 percent and would require at least 20,000 acres (81Â km2) to support aerial gunnery and a bombing range. The efforts to procure the government&#x27;s commitment to build the facility in the Greater Shreveport metropolitan area were spearheaded by a committee co-chaired by local civic leaders Andrew Querbes and John D. Ewing, beginning in 1927. It took a great deal of correspondence between the interested parties and the original proposal was rejected. However, in February 1928, a young crop duster, an Air Corps captain named Harold Ross Harris, was hired to fly over the local area in order to find a suitable site for the airfield.

Captain Harris selected what he felt was an adequate location for a military airfield. It was a sprawling section of cotton plantation near Bossier City. The site selection committee, representing the wealthiest taxpayers in the city, unanimously agreed upon the Barksdale Field location. A delegation of citizens traveled to Washington, D.C., to personally present the advantages of the proposed site to the War Department. Following the return of this delegation, a special army board visited Shreveport and reported the location met all requirements of the Air Corps.

The site was selected December 5, 1928, as the location of the airfield. The land in Bossier Parish on which the airfield was built was unincorporated land near Bossier City that was annexed by the city of Shreveport once the site had been selected among 80 candidates. The real estate was purchased from over 800 property owners via a $1,500,000 municipal bond issue approved by Shreveport voters in 1929 in fulfillment of the pledge that the citizens of Shreveport made to the U.S. government. The last of these bonds matured on December 31, 1959. After acquisition, Shreveport then donated the land to the federal government per their agreement, while the federal government assumed all the costs of building construction and equipment installation. Shreveport had originally proposed a site adjacent to Cross Lake, but the United States Department of War deemed this location inappropriate due to the lack of suitable terrain for the facility&#x27;s future expansion. Subsequent to the establishment of the military installation, Bossier City grew and expanded southward and eastward, eventually enveloping the area surrounding the base. Technically, Barksdale AFB is neither in Bossier City nor Shreveport but, like all military bases, is an autonomous community with its own infrastructure.
In September, 1941, the capture of the city of Shreveport was the objective of a U.S. Army war game, or military exercise, known as the Louisiana Maneuvers. The field exercise&#x27;s mission was accomplished largely due to General George S. Patton, who commanded the mock &quot;Blue&quot; army&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division.

Shreveport was home to the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; radio program, broadcast weekly from the Shreveport Municipal Memorial Auditorium. During its heyday from 1948 to 1960, this program stimulated the careers of some of the greatest figures in American music. The &quot;Hayride&quot; featured musicians including Hank Williams and Elvis Presley, who made his broadcasting debut at this venue. In the mid-1950s, KWKH was the first major radio station to feature the music of Presley on its long-running &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; program at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. Horace Logan, long-term KWKH program manager and originator of the &quot;Hayride&quot;, and Frank Page introduced Presley on the &quot;Hayride&quot;.

African American veterans of World War II were among activists in Shreveport through the 1960s who worked in the civil rights movement to correct injustices under Jim Crow and disenfranchisement of blacks. While activism gradually increased, 1963 was a particularly violent year in Shreveport because of white resistance. The Shreveport home of Dr. C. O. Simpkins was bombed in retaliation for his work with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

In September 1963 George W. D&#x27;Artois, Public Service Commissioner, refused a permit for a march to the Little Union Baptist Church in Shreveport, where mourners gathered to honor and commemorate four black girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing on September 15 in Birmingham, Alabama. D&#x27;Artois and other officers entered the church on horseback and took out the pastor, Dr. Harry Blake, beating him severely.

Also in 1963, headlines across the country reported that African American musician Sam Cooke was arrested in Shreveport after his band tried to register at a &quot;whites-only&quot; Holiday Inn, where they planned to stay before performing in the city. Public facilities in Louisiana were still segregated. In the months following, Cooke recorded the civil rights era song, &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;. In 1964 Congress passed the Civil Rights Act to end segregation of public facilities.

In the mid-1990s, the coming of riverboat gambling to Shreveport attracted numerous new patrons to the downtown and spurred a revitalization of the adjacent riverfront areas. Many downtown streets were given a facelift through the &quot;Streetscape&quot; project. Traditional brick sidewalks and crosswalks were built, and statues, sculptures, and mosaics were added to create a better pedestrian environment. The O.K. Allen Bridge, commonly known as the Texas Street bridge, was lit with neon lights. Residents predictably had a variety of reactions to these changes. Shreveport was named an All-American City in 1953, 1979, and 1999.

In the 1990s, Shreveport became known for its rap music scene, and acquired its famous aka name, &quot;Ratchet City&quot;. The term was first used by the group Lava House in its 1999 single &quot;Ratchet&quot;.

During the September 11, 2001 attacks, President George W. Bush was taken to the nearby Barksdale Air Force Base. He also made a visit to speak in the city on March 11, 2005.

Since the downturn in the oil industry and other economic problems, the city has struggled with a declining population, unemployment, poverty, drugs and violent crime. City data from 2017 showed a dramatic increase in certain violent crimes from the previous year, including a 138 percent increase in homicides, a 21 percent increase in forcible rapes and more than 130 percent increases in both business armed robberies and business burglaries. In 2018 the local government and police authorities reported a crime drop in most categories; it was part of an overall reduction in crime since the late 20th century. As Shreveport continued its economic resurgence, the Adrian Perkins administration saw the coming of Advanced Aero Services, Tomakk Glass Partners, and the revitalization plan of the Shreveport Economic Recovery Task Force after the Cross Bayou redevelopment plan was rejected.

In June 2020, rapper Hurricane Chris was arrested in Shreveport for second-degree murder. Following the George Floyd killing in Minnesota, multiple protests were held in the city.

==Geography==
Shreveport is located in Northwest Louisiana. It is the center of the Ark-La-Tex region where Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas meet. It is also part of the I-20 Cyber Corridor linking the tech-centered DallasâFort Worth, ShreveportâBossier, Greater Monroe, and Greater Atlanta metropolitan areas together. The city of Shreveport is from Dallas, from Tyler, and from Marshall, Texas; from Little Rock and from Texarkana, Arkansas; and from the state capital of Baton Rouge, from Monroe, from Ruston, and from Minden, Louisiana. The city&#x27;s proximity to the nearby cities makes it North Louisiana and the Ark-La-Tex&#x27;s transportation hub.

Shreveport is the parish seat of Caddo Parish. Portions of the city extend into neighboring Bossier Parish, bordering Bossier City. Shreveport sits on a low elevation overlooking the Red River. Western and northern portions of Shreveport have an elevation over above sea level. Pine forests, cotton fields, wetlands, and waterways mark the outskirts of the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Cityscape===

Shreveportâsince the mid-1990sâhas been a major gambling center with a modest downtown skyline. The &quot;Streetscape&quot; project, inspired by the coming of riverboat gaming, gave Shreveport&#x27;s downtown traditional brick sidewalks, statues, sculptures, and mosaics. The O.K. Allen Bridge (Texas Street bridge) was lit with neon lights. Since then, Downtown Shreveport has seen minor changes until the 2010s; the whole of Shreveport has been improving roads since the mid-2010s, with continued road projects in 2018. In 2018, buildings in Shreveport&#x27;s downtown and nearby districts were revitalized due to re-investment in the area. In 2020, plans were unveiled for the I-49 Connector and further redevelopment of the city.

==Demographics==
Shreveport&#x27;s population was initially 1,728 at the 1850 U.S. census, and has experienced growth to a historic high of 206,989 at the 1980 census. According to the 2020 United States census, there were 187,593 people, 73,114 households, and 42,775 families residing in the city; the 2020 American Community Survey determined an estimated 189,890 people resided in the city, purporting a slight population rebound. The 2020 census estimates showed Shreveport had 75,680 households with an average of 2.4 people per household. Of the households, 39% were married-couple households, though 44% of its male population and 40% of its female population have never married.

Throughout the city, there were 89,523 housing units, with an 85% occupancy rate; among them, 54% were owner-occupied. Among its units, 73% were single-unit detached homes and 31% of its population moved into those homes from 2015 to 2016. The median value of its owner-occupied housing units were $151,700, and 30% of its units were estimated to be under $100,000; 38% of its units were estimated to cost from $100,000 to $200,000. From 2014 to 2018, the median value of an owner-occupied housing unit was $144,800. The median monthly cost with a mortgage was $1,178 and the median monthly cost without a mortgage was $364; the city of Shreveport had a median gross rent of $810.

The median income from 2014 to 2018 was $36,338, and the mean income was $55,582. The per capita income was $25,022. By the 2020 American Community Survey, its median household income increased to $40,809. The median income for families grew to $54,023 with a mean income of $82,854; married-couple families $84,282 with a mean of $112,363; and non-family households $26,628 with a mean of $41,090. According to census estimates, 25% of its population earned from $50,000 to $100,000 annually; 13% $100,000 to $200,000; and 5% over $200,000. Approximately 24.9% of Shreveport lived at or below the poverty line, down from 2014 to 2018&#x27;s census estimates of 25.4%.

===Race and ethnicity===
In 2019, the racial and ethnic makeup of Shreveport was 56.9% Black and African American, 36.8% non-Hispanic white, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.7% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 0.1% some other race, 1.5% two or more races, and 2.6% Hispanic and Latino American of any race. At the 2010 U.S. census, the racial and ethnic composition of the population was 54.70% Black or African American, 41.16% White, 1.0% Native American, 2.0% Asian, 1.2% from some other race and 1.5% from two or more races. In 2010, about 6.5% of the population was Hispanic or Latino American of any race.

Reflecting the decline in North Louisiana&#x27;s population, the city of Shreveport&#x27;s racial and ethnic makeup among Hispanic and Latino Americans declined from 2010 yet rebounded from 2019&#x27;s census estimates. At the 2020 census, Shreveport remained a predominantly Black and African American city, with 55.77% of the population identifying as such; non-Hispanic whites slightly declined to 35.26% and multiracial or Americans of another race increased to 3.45% of the population. Data from the 2020 United States census reflected growing trends of Hispanic and Latino, and Asian American population growth nationwide.

===Religion===
Christianity is the city and metropolitan area&#x27;s dominant religion, being part of the Bible Belt. Its residents were predominantly Protestant through the nineteenth century, and today, Baptists form the majority of Christians in Shreveport, followed by Methodists and Roman Catholics. Many Baptist and Methodist churches are affiliated with evangelical Protestant denominations, though several are also affiliated with mainline Protestantism; among Baptists, the Southern Baptist Convention, National Baptist Convention (USA), National Baptist Convention of America, and Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship are the largest Baptist denominations in the city. The Progressive National Baptist Convention is the largest Progressive Baptist group in the area. Methodists are mainly affiliates of the African Methodist Episcopal Church or Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, though some also claimed affiliation to the mainline United Methodist Church. The Roman Catholic community is primarily served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shreveport.

Of note among its predominantly Baptist population, the First Baptist Church of Shreveport was once pastored by Monroe E. Dodd, founder of the former Dodd College for Girls. Former Governor Jimmie Davis, also a Shreveport city commissioner, taught history for a year under Dodd. Other historic large Baptist churches include Antioch Baptist, Galilee Missionary Baptist, Calvary Baptist, Broadmoor Baptist, Summer Grove Baptist, and Mount Canaan Missionary Baptist Church. Summer Grove Baptist Church was previously pastored by Wayne L. DuBose, a Baptist denominational officer. Mount Canaan was previously pastored by civil rights era icon Dr. Harry Blake, and Galilee was likewise pastored by Dr. E. Edward Jones, another civil rights icon.

Among its Methodist churches has been the large First Methodist Church, established in 1884. The current edifice dates to 1913. Among its former pastors were D. L. Dykes Jr. and John E. Fellers. During a severe thunderstorm in 2009, the fiberglass steeple of the church toppled and fell onto a passing car. It has since been replaced. A second prominent Methodist congregation is named for J. S. Noel Jr. The church was begun as a mission in 1906. In 2023, First United Methodist voted to leave the United Methodist Church.

The large Holy Trinity Catholic Church, located downtown, was founded in 1858; it served Irish and German immigrants as well as native-born residents. Five priests died of yellow fever in the 1873 epidemic. The current sanctuary in Romanesque revival style architecture dates to 1896. Particularly striking in size and architecture is St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral, an Episcopal Church congregation dating its establishment to the first religious service held in Shreveport in 1839. It became the see of the Episcopal Diocese of Western Louisiana in 1990.

In Shreveport&#x27;s interdenominational and Pentecostal population, Shreveport Community Church (an evangelical church affiliated with Assemblies of God USA) owns and operates Evangel Christian Academy, a preâK through 12th grade private school. The church has produced a biblical musical, &quot;Songs of the Season&quot;, during the Christmas holidays for over 20 years.

The Eastern Orthodox Church has maintained a presence in Shreveport since the early 1900s. The oldest Orthodox church in the city is St. George Greek Orthodox Church of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, followed by St. Nicholas Orthodox Church (Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America), and the Holy Nativity of the Lord Church of the Orthodox Church in America.

The Jewish community of Shreveport dates to the organization of Congregation Har El in 1859, made up primarily of German Jewish immigrants in its early years. It developed as B&#x27;nai Zion Temple, today the city&#x27;s Reform congregation, which built the city&#x27;s largest synagogue. Agudath Achim, founded in 1905 as an Orthodox congregation of immigrants from Eastern Europe, is today a traditional Jewish synagogue. Shreveport, historically, has had a large and civic-minded Jewish community and has elected three Jewish mayors.

The Islamic community in Shreveport-Bossier constituted approximately 14% of Louisiana&#x27;s total Muslim population in 2018. The majority of Shreveporter Muslims are Sunni, followed by the Nation of Islam and non-denominational Islam.

==Economy==

Shreveport was formerly a major player in United States oil business, and once hosted the Standard Oil of Louisiana offices, a branch of Standard Oil. The Louisiana branch was later absorbed by Standard Oil of New Jersey. Beginning in 1930, United Gas Corporation, the nation&#x27;s busiest pipeline operator and massive integrated oil company, was headquartered in Shreveport. Pennzoil performed a hostile takeover in 1968, and forced a merger. In the 1980s, the oil and gas industry suffered a large economic downturn. This severely affected the regional economy, and many companies cut back jobs or went out of business, including a large retail shopping mall (South Park Mall) which closed in the late 1990s. Shreveport&#x27;s economy entered a major economic recession, and many residents left the area.

At one time, Shreveport was home to numerous manufacturers, including Shreveport Operations, a General Motors plant that permanently closed in August 2012. The plant produced the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Hummer H3 series, and the Isuzu i-Series. In January 2013, the plant was leased from Caddo Parish by Elio Motors. However, Elio Motors never went into production at the Shreveport plant.

In addition to GM, other notable large companies that have had or still have Shreveport manufacturing/assembly or production facilities or operations include: General Electric (electric transformer production), Western Electric (payphone manufacturing, approximately 7,500 employees at its peak, changed ownership through the years but closed in 2001) Honeywell UOP, Libbey-Owens-Ford, Beaird-Poulan (the originator of and, for decades, the only manufacturer of the single-operator chainsaw in the world), Calumet Specialty Products Partners (originally United Gas Corporation&#x27;s Atlas Processing Unit and then Pennzoil), and Frymaster, LLC (a subsidiary of The Manitowoc Company). Today, only Calumet Packaging and Honeywell UOP survive as a large manufacturing employer in Shreveport.

By 2017, manufacturing and other goods-producing (e.g. petrochemical refining) jobs accounted for just 5% of Shreveport occupations, compared to 8% for the nationwide percentage of the workforce involved in manufacturing.

Shreveport has since largely transitioned to a service economy. In particular, there has been rapid growth in the gaming industry. The city hosts various riverboat gambling casinos, and, before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, was second only to New Orleans in Louisiana tourism. Nearby Bossier City is home to one of the three horse racetracks in the state, Louisiana Downs. Casinos in Shreveport-Bossier include Sam&#x27;s Town, Bally&#x27;s, Horseshoe, Boomtown, and Margaritaville. Diamond Jacks Casino (formerly Isle of Capri) closed in 2020. The Shreveport-Bossier Convention and Tourist Bureau is the official tourism information agency for the region. The bureau maintains a comprehensive database of restaurants, accommodations, attractions, and events.

In May 2005, the Louisiana Boardwalk, a shopping and entertainment complex, opened in Bossier City across from Shreveport&#x27;s downtown. It features outlet shopping, several restaurants, a 14âscreen movie theater, a bowling complex, and Bass Pro Shops.

A convention center was completed in the Shreveport Downtown Riverfront. Managed by SMG, it includes an 800-space parking garage. An adjoining Hilton Hotel opened in June 2007. It was constructed by and owned by the city, which has been a controversial issue, and the subject of discussions about use of public funds.

In November 2008, development of the Haynesville Shale area, with new jobs in the natural gas industry were expected to be created over the next few years. Residents in the region have been given large bonuses for signing mineral rights leases up to $25,000 per acre. However, economic downturn had resulted in a lower market price for natural gas and slower-than-expected drilling activity. The city expected to generate revenue by leasing the mineral rights on public lands in the near future as neighboring municipalities had already done. However, with advances in fracking methods in the Haynesville shale and starting in 2022 with the increase of natural gas prices after Covid to as high as $8/Mcf (thousand cubic feet), rig activity has greatly increased in the Haynesville to be the 2nd largest basin in the United States by number of active drilling rigs (2nd only to the Permian Basin - largest basin in the United States). It has since slowed to a degree since natural gas prices have decreased but is still the 3rd highest ranked basin in the US in terms of number of active drilling rigs.

Gambling and hotel industries in Shreveport, JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, and Regions Financial Corporation have regional offices in Shreveport&#x27;s downtown and surrounding districts and neighborhoods. AT&amp;T&#x27;s regional headquarters is located in Downtown Shreveport. Amazon and Governor Edwards announced plans to open a fulfillment center in 2021.

Amazon began construction on the $200 million fulfillment center in 2021 with completion expected by the end of 2022. The fulfillment center was expected to create 1,000 direct jobs. Additionally, other business investments alongside Amazon during the early 2020s contributed more than $750 million to revitalizing and expanding the municipal and metropolitan economy. By October 2023, Amazon planned to open a second facility in Shreveport.

In December 2023, the city council approved a lease of Millennium Studios to rapper 50 Cent&#x27;s new production company.

In 2014, the city government pumped $16.5 million into Mall St. Vincent in an attempt to attract new customers to the mall. However, by 2021, Auntie Anne&#x27;s, Gymboree, Grimaldi&#x27;s Pizzeria, and Sears had closed their Mall St. Vincent operations, leaving Dilliards as the only anchor store.

&quot;Fortune&quot; magazine ranked Shreveport the &quot;#1 place to start a business&quot; in 2015. In 2020, Advanced Aero Services planned to open a facility at Shreveport Regional Airport, while employer Libbey Glass closed its doors for good after 47 years of operation, resulting in the loss of 450 jobs. On July 31, 2020, the Shreveport Economic Recovery Task Force released a revitalization plan with a primary focus on the downtown area.

===Film industry===
Tax incentives offered by the state government have given Louisiana the third largest film industry in the country, behind California and New York. Louisiana is sometimes called &quot;Hollywood South&quot;. A number of films have been made in Shreveport. Facilities include sound stages, prop rental facilities, the Fairgrounds Complex, and the Louisiana Wave Studio, a computer-controlled outdoor wave pool.

The Louisiana Film Prize has spurred the creation of over 200 short films shot in Shreveport and Northwest Louisiana by filmmakers from around the world since its inception in 2012.

As of 2023, G-Unit Film and Television, which has recently undergone renovations, serves as the primary filming location for projects involving 50 Cent. Additionally, it also operates as the creative center for the entertainment and film industry within Northwest Louisiana and the Ark-La-Tex.

====Mardi Gras====
Mardi Gras celebrations in Shreveport date to the midâ19th century when krewes and parades were organized along the lines of those of New Orleans. Mardi Gras in Shreveport did not survive the cancellations caused by World War I. Attempts to revive it in the 1920s were unsuccessful, and the last Carnival celebrations in Shreveport for decades were held in 1927. Mardi Gras in Shreveport was revived beginning in 1984 with the organization of the Krewe of Apollo. The Krewes of Gemini, Centaur, Aesclepius, Highland, Sobek, Harambee, and others, followed during the next decade and a half. The first krewe to revive parading was Gemini in 1989. Today, Mardi Gras is again an important part of the cultural life of the Shreveport-Bossier metropolitan area.

==Sports==
Dating back to 1911, the state fairgrounds (and later Independence Stadium, formerly State Fair Stadium) has traditionally hosted a college football game or two during the State Fair of Louisiana, an event currently dubbed the Red River State Fair Classic. Since 1976, Independence Stadium has served as host of college football&#x27;s annual Independence Bowl. Also, the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team occasionally hosts games at Independence Stadium.

Shreveport has been home to several professional football teams. The Houston franchise of the professional World Football League relocated to Shreveport rebranded as the Shreveport Steamer midway through the 1974 season, but the franchise along with the WFL folded midway through the 1975 season. Another franchise named the Shreveport Steamers played as a member of the American Football Association from 1979 until folding in 1981. Shreveport&#x27;s Independence Stadium was also home to the Shreveport Pirates, an unsuccessful professional Canadian Football League franchise that opened play in 1994 but folded after the 1995 season.

Baseball in Shreveport has an extensive history. The city had affiliated Minor League Baseball teams from 1968 to 2002. The most memorable team was the Shreveport Captains of the Texas League. Baseball teams in Shreveport have gone through eight different name changes and seven different leagues all since 1895. Shreveport&#x27;s most recent independent minor league baseball team, the Shreveport-Bossier Captains, ceased operations in 2011 and moved to Laredo, Texas.

The city also has an extensive history in basketball and soccer. The Shreveport Crawdads and Shreveport Storm operated in 1994 and 1995 as members of the Continental Basketball Association. The Shreveport-Bossier Mavericks of the American Basketball Association played from 2013 to 2015 before relocating to Owensboro, Kentucky; since 2021, the Mavericks returned as the Shreveport Mavericks within The Basketball League.

Shreveport almost had a USL expansion team in 2020 before its rejection by the city council, though USL League Two announced the establishment of Blue Goose SC in 2022. The city was also considered as location for an NBA G League-affiliate of the New Orleans Pelicans. The city council unanimously rejected the proposal.

==Government==
Founded in 1836 and incorporated in 1839, Shreveport is the parish seat of Caddo Parish. It is part of the First Judicial District, housing the parish courthouse. It also houses the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal, which consists of nine elected judges representing twenty parishes in Northwest Louisiana. A portion of east Shreveport extends into Bossier Parish due to the changing course of the Red River.

The city of Shreveport has a mayor-council government. The elected municipal officials include the mayor, Tom Arceneaux, and seven members of the city council. Cedric Glover, a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, was the first African American to hold the mayoral position. Under the mayor-council government, the mayor serves as the executive officer of the city. As the city&#x27;s chief administrator and official representative, the mayor is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced.

==Crime==
According to the most recent FBI statistics, the total crime rate in Shreveport is 5,722.4 per 100,000 people, or 143.92% higher than the national rate of 2,346.0 per 100,000 people and 62.39% higher than the Louisiana total crime rate of 3,523.8 per 100,000 people. The violent crime rate in Shreveport is 923.0 per 100,000 people, or 138.01% higher than the national rate of 387.8 per 100,000 people, and 44.35% higher than the Louisiana violent crime rate of 639.4 per 100,000 people.

Shreveport has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes. One&#x27;s chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime is 1 in 15. Within Louisiana, more than 93% of the communities had a lower crime rate than Shreveport. NeighborhoodScout found Shreveport to be one of the top 100 most dangerous cities in the United States. In the late 1980s, authorities started to track local Los Angeles-based gangs that distributed cocaine out of low-income neighborhoods. The first and the biggest street gang was the 52nd Street Hoover Crips; shortly after LA gangs moved in, gang-related homicides began to rise. Shreveport was the first city in Louisiana to have Crips and Blood gangs. In 1993, Shreveport hit a peak in murders, with 86 killings. Most of the killings were drug- or gang-related homicides. In 2017, Shreveport was placed 18th on &quot;24/7 Wall St.&quot; list of &quot;America&#x27;s 25 Murder Capitals.&quot; Shreveport&#x27;s crime rate was 71% higher than the Louisiana average. The crime rate was also 149% higher than the national average.

The city had a so-called &quot;saggy pants&quot; law since 2007. The city ordinance was repealed by the city council in June 2019.

==Education==
Caddo Public Schools is a school district based in Shreveport. The district serves all of Caddo Parish, including the parish&#x27;s sections of Shreveport. Its founding superintendent was Clifton Ellis Byrd, a Virginia native, who assumed the chief administrative position in 1907 and continued until his death in 1926. C. E. Byrd High School, which was established in 1925 on Line Avenue at the intersection with Kings Highway, bears his name. There are a number of private schools in the city as well, including Loyola College Prep, a coeducational high school founded in 1902 as the all-male St. John&#x27;s High School.

Portions of Shreveport in Bossier Parish are instead within the Bossier Parish School District.

===Colleges and universities===

Shreveport has several colleges, including the Methodist-affiliated Centenary College (founded at Jackson, Louisiana, in 1825; relocated to Shreveport in 1908) and Louisiana State University in Shreveport, which opened as a two-year institution in 1967; it became a four-year institution in 1976. Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, the only medical school in Northern Louisiana, opened in 1969. Shreveport also has one of the largest nursing schools in northern Louisiana, the Northwestern State University College of Nursing.

Louisiana Tech University at Shreveport-Bossier City was launched in 2012 offering their Executive MBA and main campus undergraduate and graduate degree programs at the university&#x27;s Shreveport Center. Southern University at Shreveport (SUSLA) offers a two-year associate&#x27;s degree program. Founded in 1973, Louisiana Baptist University and Theological Seminary is also located in Shreveport, at 6301 Westport Avenue.

Both Caddo and Bossier parishes are in the areas of Bossier Parish Community College and Northwest Louisiana Technical Community College.

Ayers Career College is a Shreveport-based college that offers career training in the medical and HVAC fields. Since July 2007, Shreveport is home to a local Remington College campus.

==Media==
Shreveport and its surrounding area are served by a variety of local newspapers, magazines, television stations and radio stations. The major daily newspaper serving the area is &quot;The Shreveport Times&quot;, owned by &quot;USA Today&quot; parent Gannett. The newspaper&#x27;s former rival, the afternoon &quot;Shreveport Journal&quot;, ceased publication in 1991. Other major newspapers include &quot;The Shreveport Sun&quot;, &quot;Caddo Citizen&quot;, and &quot;SB Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Shreveport Sun&quot; is the area&#x27;s primary African American newspaper.

Across the Red River, Shreveport&#x27;s sister city of Bossier City is served by the daily &quot;Bossier Press-Tribune&quot;. &quot;The Barksdale Warrior&quot; is the weekly newspaper of record for the Barksdale Air Force Base. Alternative publications include &quot;The Forum Newsweekly&quot;, &quot;City Lights&quot;, &quot;The Inquisitor&quot; and &quot;The Shreveport Catalyst&quot;. Twice annually, &quot;North Louisiana History&quot;, the journal of the North Louisiana Historical Association, is published in Shreveport.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highways and roads====
Shreveport&#x27;s past reflects the need for mass transit and public roads. As far back as the 1870s, residents used mule-drawn street cars that were converted to electric motorized cars by 1890. Commuter rail systems in Shreveport flourished for many decades, and rail car lines extended out to rural areas. In 1930 trolleys and rail cars began to be replaced by buses, although motor buses did not finally replace all trolley service until the 1960s. In the 1960s, the Interstate Highway System came to the area with the construction of Interstate 20.

The local public transportation provider, SporTran, provides moderately extensive bus service throughout Shreveport and Bossier City. Sportran operates seven days a week on seventeen bus routes (five night routes) from 6:00Â a.m. to 1:00 am, with no night service on Sunday. The highway system has a cross-hair and loop freeway structure similar to that of Texas cities like Houston and Dallas. The loop consists of the Outer Loop Freeway Interstate 220 on the north and the Inner Loop Freeway, Louisiana Highway 3132, on the south, forming approximately an semi-loop around downtown. Another loop is formed by the Bert Kouns Industrial Loop (Louisiana Highway 526) and circles further south, crossing Interstate 49. I-49 now extends north to Interstate 30 in Arkansas, though there is a gap in I-49 within Shreveport.

Shreveport lies along the route of the proposed Interstate 69 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) superhighway that will link Canada, the U.S. industrial Midwest, Texas, and Mexico.

====Airports====
Shreveport is served by two airports. The larger is Shreveport Regional Airport (SHV), established in 1952, and is served by Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines (as United Express). The smaller airport, Shreveport Downtown Airport (DTN), was built in 1931 and is located north of the Downtown Business District along the Red River. It is currently a general aviation and reliever airport, but was originally Shreveport&#x27;s commercial airport.

====Railroads====
The Shreveport Waterworks Museum contains the Shreveport Railroad Museum, commemorating area railroad history.

The city had been served until the 1960s by several passenger railroads, at different stations.

*Central Station at 1025 Marshall Street served the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad
*Texas &amp; Pacific Station at 104 Market Street served the Texas and Pacific Railway. Its last trains were unnamed successors to the &quot;Louisiana Eagle&quot; (Fort Worth-New Orleans) and the &quot;Louisiana Daylight.&quot; (El Paso-New Orleans)
*Union Station on Louisiana Avenue at Lake Street had the Illinois Central (the &quot;Southwestern Limited&quot; / &quot;Northeastern Limited&quot; -Shreveport-Meridian, MS), Kansas City Southern Railway (the &quot;Southern Belle&quot; -Kansas City-New Orleans), St. Louis Southwestern Railway (the &quot;Lone Star&quot; -Dallas-Memphis) and the Southern Pacific.

===Military installations===

Barksdale Air Force Base is located in Bossier Parish across the river from Shreveport, which annexed and donated the land for its construction in the 1920s. Named for pioneer army aviator Lt. Eugene Hoy Barksdale and originally called Barksdale Army Air Field, it opened in 1933 and became Barksdale Air Force Base in 1947. Headquartered here are the Air Force Global Strike Command, 8th Air Force, 2d Bomb Wing, and 307th Wing. The primary aircraft housed here is the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. In earlier years, the base was the home to other famous aircraft, including the B-47 Stratojet.

Shreveport is home to the two 108th Cavalry Squadrons, the reconnaissance element of the 256th Infantry Brigade. Three of the squadron&#x27;s four cavalry troops are located at 400 East Stoner Avenue in a historic armory known as &quot;Fort Humbug&quot;. It got the name due to the Confederate Army burning logs to look like cannons and placing them along the Red River. This caused Union ironclad ships sailing north on the Red River to be tricked into turning back south.

On the original site of an Attakapas Indian village, Arnaudville is one of the oldest remaining towns in St. Landry Parish. First settled by the French in the late 18th century and called &quot;La MuriÃ¨re&quot;, it was later known as &quot;La Jonction&quot; which translates from French as &quot;The Junction,&quot; a tribute to the fact that the town is centered by the intersection of Bayou Teche and Bayou Fusilier. By the 19th century, the town was re-named once again, this time after the Arnaud family, which had donated a large amount of land to the town to establish a church for all (which still exists today).

Arnaudville was incorporated in 1870.

<doc id="150486" wikidata="Q153286" url="?curid=150486" title="Treaty of Nystad">
<text>The Treaty of Nystad (; ; ; ) was the last peace treaty of the Great Northern War of 1700â1721. It was concluded between the Tsardom of Russia and the Swedish Empire on in the then Swedish town of Nystad (, in the south-west of present-day Finland). Sweden had settled with the other parties in Stockholm (1719 and 1720) and in Frederiksborg (1720).

During the war Peter I of Russia had occupied all Swedish possessions on the eastern Baltic coast: Swedish Ingria (where he began to build the soon-to-be Russian capital of St. Petersburg in 1703), Swedish Estonia and Swedish Livonia (which had capitulated in 1710), and Finland.

In Nystad, King Frederick I of Sweden formally recognized the transfer of Estonia, Livonia, Ingria, and Southeast Finland (Kexholms lÃ¤n and part of Karelian Isthmus) to Russia in exchange for two million silver thaler, while Russia returned the bulk of Finland to Swedish rule.

The Treaty enshrined the rights of the German Baltic nobility within Estonia and Livonia to maintain their financial system, their existing customs border, their self-government, their Lutheran religion, and the German language; this special position in the Russian Empire was reconfirmed by all Russian Tsars from Peter the Great (reigned 1682-1725) to Alexander II (reigned 1855-1881).

Nystad manifested the decisive shift in the European balance of power which the war had brought about: the Swedish imperial era had ended; Sweden entered the Age of Liberty, while Russia had emerged as a new empire.

==Legacy==
In pre-1917 Saint Petersburg, in the Vyborgsky district (relatively nearest to Russo-Finnish border) one of the thoroughfares (now &quot;Lesnoy prospekt&quot;) was named after the Nystad treaty (Nystadt Street, Rus. ÐÐ¸ÑÑÐ°Ð´ÑÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ°). The district also houses a church commemorating the first Russian victory in the Great Northern war, the Battle of Poltava â St. Sampsonius&#x27; Cathedral.

<text>Criehaven is an alternative name for Ragged Island, an unorganized territory in Knox County, Maine, United States. Criehaven was formerly a plantation including Ragged Island just south of Matinicus Isle in outer Penobscot Bay, plus Matinicus Rock to its southeast, and Seal Island, the location of Seal Island National Wildlife Refuge, to its northeast. Criehaven surrendered its organization and reverted to an unorganized territory in 1925, but the name persists.

== History ==
Criehaven is pronounced &quot;cree-haven&quot;, after Robert Crie (1826â1901), an early landowner. He and his wife, Harriet Hall (1829â1919), moved in 1849 to Ragged Island, where Robert became successful in farming and lumbering. Island chronicler Charles McLane wrote that in 1879, Robert owned the whole island, and in 1896, all of their five children with their wives and husbands and children lived there, too. He incorporated Ragged Island as the plantation of Criehaven in that year, and for the next few decades it was a thriving small community. In addition to fishing, sheep raising, and farming, Mr. Crie for many years kept a general store at Criehaven. McLane asserts that after Crie&#x27;s death, the &quot;vigor of the community was gradually drained by natural disasters and changing times.&quot;

With its population dwindling, Criehaven plantation dissolved in 1925 to revert to a &#x27;wild land&#x27; obviating the need for town meetings and further taxation. The school continued to operate until 1941. After the school&#x27;s closing, the accelerating departure of year-round families cost the island its general store and post office as well. A &quot;lively summer community of fishermen and vacationers&quot; continues to occupy Ragged Island according to McLane, but there has &quot;rarely been year round habitation in recent years.&quot;

Ragged Island on early charts in 1754, 1776, and 1819 is shown as &quot;Ragged Arse Island&quot;. McLane asserts the name &quot;Ragged Arse Island&quot; might have been an attempt to render &quot;Racketash&quot;, Abnaki for &quot;island rocks&quot;. Charts in the mid-19th century began calling it Ragged Island but, McLane asserts, the Matinicus lobstermen continue calling the island Ragged Arse &quot;out of perversity&quot;. Ragged Island dubs itself the &quot;Island of Lobsters&quot;, and boasts of being the farthest offshore inhabited island on the East Coast.

The island is the former home of writer Elisabeth Ogilvie and the inspiration for her &quot;Tide Trilogy.&quot; Writer Dorothy Simpson lived on Criehaven for many years. A fictionalized version of Criehaven is the setting for the web series &quot;Ragged Isle.&quot;

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the location has a total area of 131.8Â square miles (341.3Â km2), of which 0.7Â square mile (1.9Â km2) is land and 131.1Â square miles (339.5Â km2) (99.46%) is water.

== Demographics ==

As of the 2010 Census, there was one person living in the location. There are people who have houses on Ragged Island and some stay all summer and some people stay just part of every week. Seasonally there are ten lobster-fishing families and ten non-fishing families.

<doc id="150497" wikidata="Q10981881" url="?curid=150497" title="Self-esteem">
<text>Self-esteem is confidence in one&#x27;s own worth, abilities, or morals. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself (for example, &quot;I am loved&quot;, &quot;I am worthy&quot;) as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. Smith and Mackie define it by saying &quot;The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it (see self).&quot;

The construct of self-esteem has been shown to be a desirable one in psychology, as it is associated with a variety of positive outcomes, such as academic achievement, relationship satisfaction, happiness, and lower rates of criminal behavior. The benefits of high self-esteem are thought to include improved mental and physical health, and less anti-social behavior while drawbacks of low self-esteem have been found to be anxiety, loneliness, and increased vulnerability to substance abuse.

Self-esteem can apply to a specific attribute or globally. Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic (&quot;trait self-esteem&quot;), though normal, short-term variations (&quot;state self-esteem&quot;) also exist. Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include: self-worth, self-regard, self-respect, and self-integrity.

==History==
The concept of self-esteem has its origins in the 18th century, first expressed in the writings of the Scottish enlightenment thinker David Hume. Hume posits that it is important to value and think well of oneself because it serves a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential.

The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, William James. James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the &quot;I-self&quot;) and the resulting knowledge about the self (the &quot;Me-self&quot;). The observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self creates three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self, according to James. These are the material self, social self, and spiritual self. The social self comes closest to self-esteem, comprising all characteristics recognized by others. The material self consists of representations of the body and possessions and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self. This view of self-esteem as the collection of an individual&#x27;s attitudes toward itself remains today.

In the mid-1960s, social psychologist Morris Rosenberg defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES), which became the most widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences.

In the early 20th century, the behaviorist movement shunned introspective study of mental processes, emotions, and feelings, replacing introspection with objective study through experiments on behaviors observed in relation with the environment. Behaviorism viewed the human being as an animal subject to reinforcements, and suggested making psychology an experimental science, similar to chemistry or biology. Consequently, clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked, since behaviorists considered the idea less amenable to rigorous measurement.

In the mid-20th century, the rise of phenomenology and humanistic psychology led to a renewed interest in self-esteem as a treatment for psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of people with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.

In 1992, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama associated self-esteem with what Plato called âthe &quot;spiritedness&quot; part of the Platonic soul.

From 1997, the core self-evaluations approach included self-esteem as one of four dimensions that comprise one&#x27;s fundamental appraisal of oneselfâalong with locus of control, neuroticism, and self-efficacy. The concept of core self-evaluations has since proven to have the ability to predict job satisfaction and job performance. Self-esteem may be essential to self-evaluation.

===In public policy===
The importance of self-esteem gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s, such that one can speak of a self-esteem movement. This movement provides evidence that psychological research can shape public policy. This has expanded to recent years, such as in 2023, when psychologists are planning to re-invent the approach to research, treatments, and therapy. The new approach emphasizes population health where psychological researchers have prioritized one-one therapy in regards to analyzing social emotional conflict like low self-esteem. The underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of problems for individuals, making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions. A leading figure of the movement, psychologist Nathaniel Branden, stated: &quot;[I] cannot think of a single psychological problem (from anxiety and depression to fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation) that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem&quot;.

It was once thought that self-esteem was primarily a feature of Western individualistic societies, as it was not observed in collectivist cultures such as Japan.
Concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led California assemblyman, John Vasconcellos to work to set up and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility, in California, in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state&#x27;s problems â from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution. He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by life&#x27;s challenges.

The task force set up committees in many California counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem. This committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences, ultimately showing that low self-esteem was not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought. However, the authors of the paper that summarized the review of the literature still believed that self-esteem is an independent variable that affects major social problems. The task force disbanded in 1995, and the National Council for Self-Esteem and later the National Association for Self-Esteem (NASE) was established, taking on the task force&#x27;s mission. Vasconcellos and Jack Canfield were members of its advisory board in 2003, and members of its masters&#x27; coalition included Anthony Robbins, Bernie Siegel, and Gloria Steinem.

== Theories ==
Many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation. American psychologist, Abraham Maslow included self-esteem in his hierarchy of human needs. He described two different forms of &quot;esteem&quot;: the need for respect from others in the form of recognition, success, and admiration, and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love, self-confidence, skill, or aptitude. Respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization. Maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem &quot;is the one which manifests in the respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame, and flattery&quot;. Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. Sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one&#x27;s level of status and acceptance in one&#x27;s social group. According to &quot;Terror Management Theory&quot;, self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death.

Carl Rogers (1902â1987), an advocate of humanistic psychology, theorized the origin of many people&#x27;s problems to be that they despise themselves and consider themselves worthless and incapable of being loved. This is why Rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client&#x27;s self-esteem. In his therapy sessions with clients, he offered positive regard no matter what. Indeed, the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person, summarized in the following sentence:

==Measurement==
Self-esteem is typically assessed using self-report inventories.

One of the most widely used instruments, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem scale score that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, the Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves. If a subject&#x27;s answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.

Implicit measures of self-esteem began to be used in the 1980s. 
These rely on indirect measures of cognitive processing thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem, including the &quot;name letter task&quot; (or &quot;initial preference task&quot;) and the Implicit Association Task.

Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of the process of assessment. When using them to assess implicit self-esteem, psychologists apply self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli. For example, if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother, psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word, evil, or the positive word, kind.

== Development across lifespan ==
Experiences in a person&#x27;s life are a major source of how self-esteem develops. In the early years of a child&#x27;s life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered the main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.

Although studies thus far have reported only a correlation of warm, supportive parenting styles (mainly authoritative and permissive) with children having high self-esteem, these parenting styles could easily be thought of as having some causal effect in self-esteem development. Childhood experiences that contribute to healthy self-esteem include being listened to, being spoken to respectfully, receiving appropriate attention and affection and having accomplishments recognized and mistakes or failures acknowledged and accepted. Experiences that contribute to low self-esteem include being harshly criticized, being physically, sexually or emotionally abused, being ignored, ridiculed or teased or being expected to be &quot;perfect&quot; all the time.

During school-aged years, academic achievement is a significant contributor to self-esteem development. Consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong effect on students&#x27; individual self-esteem. However, students can also experience low self-esteem while in school. For example, they may not have academic achievements, or they live in a troubled environment outside of school. Issues like the ones previously stated, can cause adolescents to doubt themselves. Social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem. As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons play an important role in shaping the child&#x27;s self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves. As children go through adolescence, peer influence becomes much more important. Adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends. Successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem, whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.

Self-esteem tends to increase during adolescence and young adulthood, reaching a peak in middle age. A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on whether it is a small or large decrease. Reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age. No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem. Multiple cohort studies show that there is not a difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of social media.

High levels of mastery, low risk taking, and better health are ways to predict higher self-esteem. In terms of personality, emotionally stable, extroverted, and conscientious individuals experience higher self-esteem. These predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence. However, this does not mean it can not be changed. Hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers, but then slightly higher levels by age 30. African Americans have a sharper increase in self-esteem in adolescence and young adulthood compared to Whites. However, during old age, they experience a more rapid decline in self-esteem.

=== Influencing factors of self-esteem in adolescence ===

Self-esteem during adolescence is a dynamic and critical aspect of psychological development, influenced by a variety of biological, psychological, and social factors. This stage of life, characterized by rapid physical changes and increased self-awareness, leaves adolescents particularly vulnerable to external influences. Peer relationships, academic performance, and societal beauty standards play pivotal roles in shaping self-esteem. Gender differences also contribute significantly to how adolescents perceive their self-worth. 
Recent research highlights how cultural and societal expectations can shape self-esteem, especially regarding self-perceptions of physical appearance. For instance, a 2023 study titled &quot;Exploring Teenagers&#x27; Perceptions of Personal Beauty: A Quantitative Survey Analysis&quot; examined how Italian teenagers rated their own appearance. The findings revealed notable gender disparities: male participants typically rated themselves conservatively, while females often assigned themselves higher scores, sometimes a perfect 10. These patterns underscore the influence of societal beauty standards on adolescents&#x27; self-perception and their broader self-esteem development.
The study emphasizes the critical interplay between physical self-perception and self-esteem in adolescence, shedding light on how societal norms and personal identity evolve during this pivotal life stage.

===Shame===
Shame can be a contributor to those with problems of low self-esteem. Feelings of shame usually occur because of a situation where the social self is devalued, such as a socially evaluated poor performance. Poor performance leads to a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame, indicating a threat to the social self. This increase in shame can be helped with self-compassion.

===Real self, ideal self, and dreaded self===
There are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self, ideal self, and the dreaded self. The real, ideal, and dreaded selves develop in children in a sequential pattern on cognitive levels.
* Moral judgment stages: Individuals describe their real, ideal, and dreaded selves with stereotypical labels, such as &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. Individuals describe their ideal and real selves in terms of disposition for actions or as behavioral habits. The dreaded self is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits.
* Ego development stages: Individuals describe their ideal and real selves in terms of traits that are based on attitudes as well as actions. The dreaded self is often described as having failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered.
* Self-understanding stages: Individuals describe their ideal and real selves as having unified identities or characters. Descriptions of the dreaded self focus on failure to live up to one&#x27;s ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems.
This development brings with it increasingly complicated and encompassing moral demands. This level is where individuals&#x27; self-esteems can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations. This feeling will moderately affect one&#x27;s self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their dreaded selves.

== Types of self-esteems ==

=== High ===

People with a healthy level of self-esteem:
* firmly believe in certain values and principles, and are ready to defend them even when finding opposition, feeling secure enough to modify them in light of experience.
* are able to act according to what they think to be the best choice, trusting their own judgment, and not feeling guilty when others do not like their choice.
* do not lose time worrying excessively about what happened in the past, nor about what could happen in the future. They learn from the past and plan for the future, but live in the present intensely.
* fully trust in their capacity to solve problems, not hesitating after failures and difficulties. They ask others for help when they need it.
* consider themselves equal in dignity to others, rather than inferior or superior, while accepting differences in certain talents, personal prestige or financial standing.
* understand how they are an interesting and valuable person for others, at least for those with whom they have a friendship.
* resist manipulation, collaborate with others only if it seems appropriate and convenient.
* admit and accept different internal feelings and drives, either positive or negative, revealing those drives to others only when they choose.
* are able to enjoy a great variety of activities.
* are sensitive to feelings and needs of others; respect generally accepted social rules, and claim no right or desire to prosper at others&#x27; expense.
* can work toward finding solutions and voice discontent without belittling themselves or others when challenges arise.

=== Secure vs. defensive ===

Some people have a secure high self-esteem and can confidently maintain positive self-views without relying on external reassurance. However, others have defensive high self-esteem, and while they also report positive self-views on the Rosenberg Scale, these views are fragile and easily threatened by criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual&#x27;s self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.

The &quot;Journal of Educational Psychology&quot; conducted a study in which they used a sample of 383 Malaysian undergraduates participating in work integrated learning (WIL) programs across five public universities to test the relationship between self-esteem and other psychological attributes such as self-efficacy and self-confidence. The results demonstrated that self-esteem has a positive and significant relationship with self-confidence and self-efficacy since students with higher self-esteem had better performances at university than those with lower self-esteem. It was concluded that higher education institutions and employers should emphasize the importance of undergraduates&#x27; self-esteem development.

=== Implicit and explicit ===

Implicit self-esteem refers to a person&#x27;s disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with explicit self-esteem, which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are theoretically subtypes of self-esteem proper.

However, the validity of implicit self-esteem as a construct is highly questionable, given not only its weak or nonexistent correlation with explicit self-esteem and informant ratings of self-esteem, but also the failure of multiple measures of implicit self-esteem to correlate with each other.

Currently, there is little scientific evidence that self-esteem can be reliably or validly measured through implicit means.

=== Narcissism and threatened egotism ===
Narcissism is a disposition people may have that represents an excessive love for one&#x27;s self. It is characterized by an inflated view of self-worth. Individuals who score high on narcissism measures, Robert Raskin&#x27;s Narcissistic Personality Inventory, would likely respond &quot;true&quot; to such prompt statements as &quot;If I ruled the world, it would be a much better place.&quot; There is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem; that is to say that an individual can have high self-esteem but low narcissism or can be a conceited, obnoxious person and score high self-esteem and high narcissism. However, when correlation analysis is restricted to the sense of superiority or self-admiration aspects of narcissism, correlations between narcissism and self-esteem become strong. Moreover, self-esteem is positively correlated with a sense of superiority even when controlling for overall narcissism.

Narcissism is not only defined by inflated self-esteem, but also by characteristics such as entitlement, exploitativeness, and dominance. Additionally, while positive self-image is a shared characteristic of narcissism and self-esteem, narcissistic self-appraisals are exaggerated, whereas in non-narcissistic self-esteem, positive views of the self compared with others are relatively modest. Thus, while sharing positive self-regard as a main feature, and while narcissism is defined by high self-esteem, the two constructs are not interchangeable.

Threatened egotism is a phenomenon in which narcissists respond to criticism with hostility and aggression, as it threatens their sense of self-worth.

=== Low ===

Low self-esteem can result from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, mental health issues, socioeconomic status, significant emotional experiences, social stigma, peer pressure or bullying.

A person with low self-esteem may show some of the following characteristics:
* Heavy self-criticism and dissatisfaction.
* Hypersensitivity to criticism with resentment against critics and feelings of being attacked.
* Chronic indecision and an exaggerated fear of mistakes.
* Excessive will to please and unwillingness to displease any petitioner.
* Perfectionism, which can lead to frustration when perfection is not achieved.
* Neurotic guilt, dwelling on or exaggerating the magnitude of past mistakes.
* Floating hostility and general defensiveness and irritability without any proximate cause.
* Pessimism and a general negative outlook.
* Envy, invidiousness, or general resentment.
* Sees temporary setbacks as permanent, intolerable conditions.

Individuals with low self-esteem tend to be critical of themselves. Some depend on the approval and praise of others when evaluating self-worth. Others may measure their likability in terms of successes: others will accept themselves if they succeed but will not if they fail. People with chronic low self esteem are at a higher risk for experiencing psychotic disorders; and this behavior is closely linked to forming psychotic symptoms as well.

====Treatments====
Metacognitive therapy, EMDR technique, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and trait and construct therapies have been shown to improve the patient&#x27;s self-esteem.

=== The three states ===
This classification proposed by Martin Ross distinguishes three states of self-esteem compared to the &quot;feats&quot; (s, honors, virtues) and the &quot;anti-feats&quot; (s, embarrassment, shame, etc.) of the individuals.

==== Shattered ====
The individual does not regard themselves as valuable or lovable. They may be overwhelmed by defeat, or shame, or see themselves as such, and they name their &quot;anti-feat&quot;. For example, if they consider that being over a certain age is an anti-feat, they define themselves with the name of their anti-feat, and say, &quot;I am old&quot;. They express actions and feelings such as pity, insulting themselves, and they may become paralyzed by their sadness.

==== Vulnerable ====
The individual has a generally positive self-image. However, their self-esteem is also vulnerable to the perceived risk of an imminent anti-feat (such as defeat, embarrassment, shame, discredit), consequently, they are often nervous and regularly use defense mechanisms. A typical protection mechanism of those with vulnerable self-esteem may consist in avoiding decision-making. Although such individuals may outwardly exhibit great self-confidence, the underlying reality may be just the opposite: the apparent self-confidence is indicative of their heightened fear of anti-feats and the fragility of their self-esteem. They may also try to blame others to protect their self-image from situations that would threaten it. They may employ defense mechanisms, including attempting to lose at games and other competitions in order to protect their self-image by publicly dissociating themselves from a need to win, and asserting an independence from social acceptance which they may deeply desire. In this deep fear of being unaccepted by an individual&#x27;s peers, they make poor life choices by making risky decisions.

==== Strong ====
People with strong self-esteem have a positive self-image and enough strength so that anti-feats do not subdue their self-esteem. They have less fear of failure. These individuals appear humble, cheerful, and this shows a certain strength not to boast about feats and not to be afraid of anti-feats.
They are capable of fighting with all their might to achieve their goals because, if things go wrong, their self-esteem will not be affected. They can acknowledge their own mistakes precisely because their self-image is strong, and this acknowledgment will not impair or affect their self-image. They live with less fear of losing social prestige, and with more happiness and general well-being.
However, no type of self-esteem is indestructible, and due to certain situations or circumstances in life, one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem.

=== Contingent vs. non-contingent ===
A distinction is made between contingent (or conditional) and non-contingent (or unconditional) self-esteem.

&quot;Contingent self-esteem&quot; is derived from external sources, such as what others say, one&#x27;s success or failure, one&#x27;s competence, or relationship-contingent self-esteem.

Therefore, contingent self-esteem is marked by instability, unreliability, and vulnerability. Persons lacking a non-contingent self-esteem are &quot;predisposed to an incessant pursuit of self-value&quot;. However, because the pursuit of contingent self-esteem is based on receiving approval, it is doomed to fail, as no one receives constant approval, and disapproval often evokes depression. Furthermore, fear of disapproval inhibits activities in which failure is possible.
&quot;Non-contingent self-esteem&quot; is described as true, stable, and solid. It springs from a belief that one is &quot;acceptable period, acceptable before life itself, ontologically acceptable&quot;. Belief that one is &quot;ontologically acceptable&quot; is to believe that one&#x27;s acceptability is &quot;the way things &quot;are&quot; without contingency&quot;. In this belief, as expounded by theologian Paul Tillich, acceptability is not based on a person&#x27;s virtue. It is an acceptance given &quot;in spite of our guilt, not because we have no guilt&quot;.

Psychiatrist Thomas A Harris drew on Tillich for his classic &quot;I&#x27;m OK â You&#x27;re OK&quot; that addresses non-contingent self-esteem. Harris translated Tillich&#x27;s &quot;acceptable&quot; by the vernacular &quot;OK&quot;, a term that means &quot;acceptable&quot;. The Christian message, said Harris, is not &quot;YOU CAN BE OK, IF&quot;; it is &quot;YOU ARE ACCEPTED, unconditionally&quot;.

A secure non-contingent self-esteem springs from the belief that one is ontologically acceptable and accepted.

=== Domain-specific self-esteem ===
Whereas global self-esteem addresses how individuals appraise themselves in their entirety, domain-specific self-esteem facets relate to how they appraise themselves in various pertinent domains of life. Such functionally distinct facets of self-esteem may comprise self-evaluations in social, emotional, body-related, school performance-related, and creative-artistic domains.

They have been found to be predictive of outcomes related to psychological functioning, health, education, and work.
Low self-esteem in the social domain (i.e., self-perceived social competence), for example, has been repeatedly identified as a risk factor for bullying victimization.

==Importance==
Abraham Maslow states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted, loved and respected by others and by oneself. Self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence, benevolence, and optimism, and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize.

Self-esteem may make people convinced they deserve happiness. The ability to understand and develop positive self-esteem is essential for building healthy relationships with others. When people have a positive view of themselves, they are more likely to treat others with respect, compassion, and kindness. This creates the foundation for strong, positive relationships that are built on mutual respect and understanding. For Erich Fromm, the love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those who are capable of loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace and is a specially critical condition for teaching professions.

JosÃ©-Vicente Bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is, he says, not a loss of esteem from others, but self-rejection. Bonet claims that this corresponds to major depressive disorder. Freud also claimed that the depressive has suffered &quot;an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard, an impoverishment of his ego on a grand scale... He has lost his self-respect&quot;.

The Yogyakarta Principles, a document on international human rights law, addresses the discriminatory attitude toward LGBT people that makes their self-esteem low to be subject to human rights violation including human trafficking. The World Health Organization recommends in &quot;Preventing Suicide&quot;, published in 2000, that strengthening students&#x27; self-esteem is important to protect children and adolescents against mental distress and despondency, enabling them to cope adequately with difficult and stressful life situations.

Not only does higher self-esteem increase happiness, but it is also associated with improved stress coping and increased willingness to take on challenging tasks. In contrast, a study examined the impact of boosting self-esteem. It found that high self-esteem does offer some benefits, but they are limited. It is often a result, rather than a cause, of success. The researchers also found that efforts to boost self-esteem may not consistently lead to improved performance, and that self-esteem&#x27;s influence on life outcomes is modest, except for a temporary increase in positive self-image awareness.

=== Correlations ===

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s many Americans assumed as a matter of course that students&#x27; self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earned in school, in their relationships with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s, little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.

Peer-reviewed research undertaken since then has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students&#x27; self-esteems in and of itself has no positive effect on grades. Roy Baumeister has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades. The relationship involving self-esteem and academic results does not signify that high self-esteem contributes to high academic results. It simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.

Attempts by pro-esteem advocates to encourage self-pride in students solely by reason of their uniqueness as human beings will fail if feelings of well-being are not accompanied by well-doing. It is only when students engage in personally meaningful endeavors for which they can be justifiably proud that self-confidence grows, and it is this growing self-assurance that in turn triggers further achievement.

Research has found a strong correlation between high self-esteem and self-reported happiness, but it is not yet known whether this relationship is causal. This means that although people with high self-esteem tend to report greater happiness, it is not certain whether having high self-esteem directly causes increased happiness. The relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction is stronger in individualistic cultures.

In addition, people with high self-esteem have been found to be more forgiving than people with low self-esteem. This is because people with high self-esteem tend to have greater self-acceptance and are more likely to view conflict in a positive light, as an opportunity for growth and improvement. In contrast, people with low self-esteem may have a harder time forgiving others, due to a sense of insecurity and self-doubt.

High self-esteem does not prevent children from smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or engaging in early sex.

=== Mental health ===
Self-esteem has been associated with several mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. For example, low self-esteem may increase the likelihood that people who experience dysfunctional thoughts will develop symptoms of depression. 
Consequently, cognitive treatment of depression helps with low self-esteem, and vice versa, addressing low self-esteem improves depressive symptoms. In contrast, high self-esteem may protect against the development of mental health conditions, with research finding that high self-esteem reduces the chances of bulimia and anxiety.

== Neuroscience ==
In research conducted in 2014 by Robert S. Chavez and Todd F. Heatherton, it was found that self-esteem is related to the connectivity of the frontostriatal circuit. The frontostriatal pathway connects the medial prefrontal cortex, which deals with self-knowledge, to the ventral striatum, which deals with feelings of motivation and reward. Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.

== Criticism and controversy ==

Albert Ellis, an influential American psychologist, argued that the concept of self-esteem is actually harmful and unhelpful. Although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate, he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic, illogical and self- and socially destructive â often doing more harm than good. Questioning the foundations and usefulness of generalized ego strength, he has claimed that self-esteem is based on arbitrary definitional premises, and overgeneralized, perfectionistic and grandiose thinking. Acknowledging that rating and valuing behaviors and characteristics is functional and even necessary, he sees rating and valuing human beings&#x27; totality and total selves as irrational and unethical. The healthier alternative to self-esteem according to him is unconditional self-acceptance and unconditional other-acceptance. &quot;Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy&quot; is a psychotherapy based on this approach.

: &quot;There seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem...First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.)...It can also lead people to ignore sensible advice as they stubbornly keep wasting time and money on hopeless causes&quot;

=== False attempts ===
For persons with low self-esteem, any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem. Therefore, possessions, sex, success, or physical appearance will produce the development of self-esteem, but the development is ephemeral at best. Such attempts to raise one&#x27;s self-esteem by positive stimulus produce a &quot;boom or bust&quot; pattern. &quot;Compliments and positive feedback&quot; produce a boost, but a bust follows a lack of such feedback. For a person whose &quot;self-esteem is contingent&quot;, success is &quot;not extra sweet&quot;, but &quot;failure is extra bitter&quot;.

=== As narcissism ===

Life satisfaction, happiness, healthy behavioral practices, perceived efficacy, and academic success and adjustment have been associated with having high levels of self-esteem However, a common mistake is to think that loving oneself is necessarily equivalent to narcissism, as opposed for example to what Erik Erikson speaks of as &quot;a post-narcissistic love of the ego&quot;. People with healthy self-esteem accept and love themselves unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, and yet, in spite of everything, are able to continue to love themselves. In narcissists, by contrast, an &quot;uncertainty about their own worth gives rise to...a self-protective, but often totally spurious, aura of grandiosity&quot;Â â producing the class &quot;of narcissists, or people with very high, but insecure, self-esteem... fluctuating with each new episode of social praise or rejection.&quot; For narcissists, regulating their self-esteem is their constant concern. They use defenses (such as denial, projection, self-inflation, envy, arrogance, and aggression), impression management through self-promotion, embellishment, lying, charm, and domination, and prefer high-status, competitive, and hierarchical environments to support their unstable, fragile, and impaired self-esteem.

Narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem, that is, lack of love towards oneself, but often accompanied by &quot;an immense increase in self-esteem&quot; based on &quot;the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation.&quot;
&quot;Idealized love of self...rejected the part of him&quot; that he denigratesÂ â &quot;this destructive little child&quot; within. Instead, the narcissist emphasizes their virtues in the presence of others, just to try to convince themself that they are a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for their faults; such &quot;people with unrealistically inflated self-views, which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information...tend to have poor social skills.&quot;

<text>North Oxford is an unorganized territory in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 16 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the unorganized territory has a total area of 546.2Â square miles (1,414.7Â km2), of which 509.6Â square miles (1,319.9Â km2) is land and 36.6Â square miles (94.8Â km2) (6.70%) is water.

The territory consists of sixteen townships, which are Adamstown, Andover North Surplus, Andover West Surplus, C Surplus, Bowmantown, Grafton, Lower Cupsuptic, Lynchtown, Magalloway, Oxbow, Parkertown, Parmachenee, Richardsontown, Riley, Township C, and Upper Cupsuptic. The terrain is mountainous, with little level ground suitable for raising crops; and the elevation causes frost in June and August, leaving a growing season of approximately 60 days.

==History of Grafton==
Grafton, the southernmost township, was the only township to achieve incorporation. The first European settler was James Brown in 1834. He built a sawmill in 1838, and a few of the men he hired to cut logs and mill lumber built homes along what is now Maine State Route 26 above Grafton Notch State Park. A few raised some livestock, hay, oats, and potatoes for subsistence. Grafton incorporated in 1852. The town school built just above Grafton Notch had 37 students by 1859, but that number slowly declined to 10 by 1900. The maximum population recorded for the town was 115 in the 1880 census. About a hundred men would come into Grafton for the winter logging season, and leave driving the logs downstream with the spring snowmelt in March or April. The intensity of logging increased in 1893 with completion of the Success Pond Railroad from Berlin, New Hampshire to the New Hampshire border of Grafton. Aboriginal forests had been completely logged when the railroad was dismantled in 1907. When the logging jobs disappeared, most residents sold their land to a pulp and paper company and moved away. Grafton disincorporated in 1919; and the Town records were turned over to Newry, Maine. Most of the structures were demolished by the new landowner to reduce the fire hazard of use by a transient population.

==1944 B-17 crash==

North Oxford was the site of Maine&#x27;s second worst military plane crash. A Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was flying from Nebraska to Dow Field in preparation for a trans-Atlantic flight to participate in the World War II strategic bombing of Europe. The bomber apparently became lost in thunderstorms around North Oxford which may have damaged the plane&#x27;s radio. Local residents heard the bomber wandering through the overcast in searching circles for more than an hour before it crashed 500 feet below the summit of Deer Mountain in the southeastern corner of Parkertown Township. There were no survivors from the ten-man United States Army Air Forces crew. The Deer Mountain crash site now includes a memorial marker and is a popular hiking destination. A similar Long Creek Air Tragedy Memorial 100 miles to the south marks the site of Maine&#x27;s worst plane crash. Through coincidence, both crashes occurred on the same dayâJuly 11, 1944.

<text>Perkins Township (Swan Island) is an unorganized territory in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. Originally incorporated as the town of Perkins, it was later abandoned, and has been uninhabited since the 1940s. The township comprises Swan Island, Little Swan Island and some tidal flatsâall within the Kennebec River between the towns of Richmond and Dresden. The Swan Island Historic District comprises most of the township, with eight buildings, five structures and . Some of the buildings date to the 1750s. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The entire township is now protected as the Steve Powell Wildlife Management Area, and is under the jurisdiction of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Camping, hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing are permitted between May and October; reservations are required.

== History ==
The town of Perkins was incorporated in the mid-19th century and then disincorporated in 1918. During the 19th century, the town was a community of almost 100 residents who engaged in shipbuilding, farming and ice harvesting. The island also attracted summer residents who built summer homes, and its most famous summer resident was Thomas Handasyd Perkins. The town was named for him when it was incorporated in the mid-19th century, after he paid for its incorporation.

Besides town government, the town also had a schoolhouse and cemetery. However the town was disincorporated in 1918, so it became a township managed by the state. By the mid-1940s the Great Depression and ongoing pollution of the Kennebec River led to the decline of the island&#x27;s industries and the island was abandoned.

Little was done until the 1990s when efforts were made to protect some of the buildings, a process that is ongoing.

== Geography and historic features ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Swan Island has a total area of 9.7Â km (3.7Â mi2), of which 5.8Â km (2.2Â mi2) is land and 3.9Â km (1.5Â mi2) (40.37%) is water. The township consists of Swan Island and Little Swan Island. Swan Island is long and relatively narrow, with its northernmost tip roughly opposite the village center of Richmond, across the main channel of the Kennebec River, and whose southernmost tip is just north of the northern extent of Merrymeeting Bay. Little Swan Island is approximately one-third of the way south of the northern tip of Swan Island, on its eastern side.

Access to Swan Island is via a boat dock near its northern tip. The island is roughly divided by its former main road, which ran along its spine. The land is a mix of woods and former fields, a proportion that is maintained by the state as part of its wildlife management activities. Historic features of the island include several cemeteries and the c. 1763 house of Dr. Silvester Gardiner, one of the island&#x27;s first colonial owners, and which is one of the state&#x27;s only examples of 18th-century saltbox architecture.

<text>Henry Jackson Jr. (December 12, 1912 â October 22, 1988) was an American professional boxer and a world boxing champion who fought under the name Henry Armstrong.

Armstrong was one of the few fighters to win in three or more different divisions: featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight. He defended his welterweight title a total of nineteen times.

&quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1937. The Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1940. He is currently ranked by BoxRec as the 12th-greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time. In 2007, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked Armstrong as the second-greatest fighter of the last 80 years. Boxing coach and commentator Teddy Atlas considers Armstrong to be the greatest of all time. Historian Bert Sugar also ranked Armstrong as the second-greatest fighter of all time. ESPN ranked Armstrong as number 3 on their list of the 50 greatest boxers of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990. In 2019, the International Boxing Research Organization (IBRO) ranked him as the second best boxer of all time, pound for pound, as well as the second-best featherweight, third-best welterweight, and fifth-best lightweight of all time.

==Early life==
He was born Henry Jackson Jr. on December 12, 1912, in Columbus, Mississippi. He was the son of Henry Jackson Sr., a sharecropper of African American descent and America Jackson, said to be a &quot;full-blooded&quot; Iroquois. As a child, Henry Jr. moved with his family to St. Louis, Missouri, during the early period of the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to industrial cities of the Midwest and North. There he became involved in boxing. He graduated as an honor student from Vashon High School in St. Louis Later he took the surname Armstrong as his fighting name.

==Early career==
Armstrong began his professional career on July 28, 1931, in a fight with Al Iovino, in which Armstrong was knocked out in three rounds. His first win came later that year, beating Sammy Burns by a decision in six. In 1932, Armstrong moved to Los Angeles, where he lost two four-round decisions in a row to Eddie Trujillo and Al Greenfield. Following these two losses, however, he started a streak of 11 wins.

In 1936, Armstrong split his time among Los Angeles, Mexico City and St. Louis. A few notable opponents of that year include Ritchie Fontaine, Baby Arizmendi, former world champion Juan Zurita, and Mike Belloise. Early in his career, he fought some fights under the ring name Melody Jackson.

In 1937 alone, Armstrong went 27â0 (26KO). Aldo Spoldi was the only opponent to take him the full 10 rounds. He knocked out Baby Casanova in three rounds, Belloise in four, Joe Rivers in three, former world champion Frankie Klick in four, and former world champion Benny Bass in four. Armstrong was given his first world title fight, for the title in the 126-pound weight class against World Featherweight Champion Petey Sarron at Madison Square Garden. Armstrong knocked Sarron out in six rounds, becoming the World Featherweight Champion.

Armstrong&#x27;s two nicknames were &quot;Hurricane Henry&quot; and &quot;Homicide&#x27; Hank&quot;.

In 1938, Armstrong started his season with seven more knockouts in a row, including one over Chalky Wright, a future world champion. The streak finally ended when Arizmendi lasted ten rounds before losing a decision to Armstrong in their fourth fight. Armstrong&#x27;s streak of 27 knockout wins in a row qualifies as one of the longest knockout win streaks in the history of boxing, according to &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

Later in 1938, Armstrong, still the Featherweight division world champion, challenged Barney Ross for the title. Later a fellow member of the three division champions&#x27; club, Ross was then World Welterweight Champion. Armstrong, at pounds, beat Ross, at 142 pounds, by unanimous decision, adding the World Welterweight Championship to his belt. Armstrong lost weight in order to compete in the lower weight division, and beat World Lightweight Champion Lou Ambers by split decision. Armstrong was the first boxer ever to hold world championships in three different weight divisions at the same time. He decided not to maintain the required 126-pound weight anymore and left the featherweight crown vacant.

==Welterweight defenses==
Armstrong dedicated the next two years to defending the welterweight crown, beating, among others, Ceferino Garcia, a future World Middleweight Champion, and Bobby Pacho.

Armstrong defended his Lightweight belt in a rematch with Ambers, which he lost on a 15-round decision. After that, he concentrated once again on defending the world Welterweight title. He defended it in eight fights in a row, the last of which was a nine-round knockout win over Puerto Rico&#x27;s Pedro MontaÃ±ez.

Armstrong sought to become the first boxer to win world titles in four different categories in a rematch with Garcia, already the World Middleweight Champion, but the fight ended in a ten-round draw. Armstrong&#x27;s attempt to win a world title in a fourth division was frustrated. According to boxing historian Bert Sugar, many commentators of the time said that Armstrong deserved the decision in this fight.

Returning to the welterweight division, Armstrong successfully defended the title five more times, until Fritzie Zivic beat him to take the world title in a 15-round decision. This ended Armstrong&#x27;s reign as Welterweight Champion. Armstrong&#x27;s eighteen successful title defenses were the most in history in the Welterweight division.

In 1945, Armstrong retired from boxing. His official record was 152 wins, 21 losses and 9 draws, with 101 knockout wins.

==After boxing==
After retiring from boxing in 1946, Armstrong briefly opened a Harlem nightclub, the Melody Room (named after his first nickname). He returned to settle again in St. Louis, Missouri where, apart from the ceremonies and galas that he attended afterward, he led a quiet retirement. He became a born-again Christian and an ordained Baptist minister and youth advocate, helping to run the Herbert Hoover Boys Club. He also taught young fighters how to box. In February 1966, Rev. Armstrong appeared on the TV game show I&#x27;ve Got a Secret with his simultaneous triple championship as his secret. He died in 1988.

<doc id="150523" wikidata="Q7142532" url="?curid=150523" title="Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation">
<text>Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation (Maliseet-Passamaquoddy: &quot;Sipayik&quot;) is one of two reservations of the federally recognized Passamaquoddy tribe in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 692 as of the 2020 census.

The Passamaquoddy also reside on the Indian Township Reservation.

==Geography==
Sipayik is located near the CanadaâUnited States border in Washington County, Maine on a peninsula with the Little River and Passamaquoddy Bay to the east and Cobscook Bay to the west. It borders Eastport and Perry, and according to the United States Census Bureau, has a total area of 0.6Â mi2 (1.6Â km2).

==Demographics==

The ACS estimates 683 people and 258 households at Sipayik in 2019. Passamaquoddy tribal census rolls report a total of 2,005 tribal members.

According to the ACS, in 2019 11.70% of residents were white; 84.04% Native American; 1.02% from other races, and 3.66% from two or more races. The median income for a household was an estimated $26,429. 35.1% of families and 43.6% of the population had incomes below the poverty line, including 58.3% of those under age 18 and 28.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Drinking water crisis==
===Passamaquoddy Water District===
Sipayik&#x27;s municipal water is provided by the Passamaquoddy Water District (PWD). Despite incorporating the tribe in its name, PWD is not tribally affiliated; it is a state-chartered quasi-municipal corporation created by the Maine Legislature in an emergency act in 1983. PWD is governed by an independent board of trustees and an executive director, and serves slightly over 600 households in Perry, Eastport and Sipayik, Maine. The PWD is responsible for infrastructure at the water source, a water tower at Sipayik, and facilities in Eastport.

PWD water comes from the Boyden Reservoir in Perry, a shallow body that is only 10â11 feet deep at its deepest point. Since it is a shallow, surface-water source, the water contains high amounts of organic matter that are exacerbated by weather events and routine system maintenance procedures. When chlorine is used to treat water containing organic matter, the disinfection by-product trihalomethane (THM) forms. Acute exposure to large doses of THMs can cause liver damage and central nervous system depression in humans, and laboratory animal studies of chronic low-dose exposure suggest that THMs may be carcinogenic. PWD water testing has revealed high levels of THM since testing for disinfection by-products began following the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974. Between 1977 and 1981, THM levels in PWD water were three to four times the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). Levels exceeding the MCL were recorded again in 2005 and 2017, and in both 2018 and 2019 THM concentrations were above the MCL for three out of the four quarters of the year. Boyden Reservoir&#x27;s water level continues to decrease, causing the levels of organic matter to rise along with the amount of chlorine needed to treat the supply. PWD&#x27;s treatment facility has seen $14.9 million worth of upgrades since 2000, and state officials reported in August 2020 that the water test results were within federal regulatory limits. This is disputed by tribal documents.

Since 2000, residents of Sipayik have received 49 public notices on water quality, 22 of which warned of unsafe levels of THM and haloacetic acids and stated that these contaminants can lead to &quot;liver, kidney, and central nervous system problems and an increased risk of cancer.â The water is frequently discolored and odorous, and runs black, brown and green when weather events or routine maintenance procedures cause excess turbidity in the reservoir.

Though most Sipayik residents do not drink the PWD tap water, it is commonly used for other needs such as bathing and household cleaning. Because THMs vaporize at room temperature and can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin, it is likely that even the Sipayik residents who avoid drinking the tap water are still subject to chronic THM exposure.

===Barriers to safe water===
The ability of the Passamaquoddy Tribe to implement solutions to the PWD water crisis is limited because Maine does not grant tribes the ability to regulate and permit water resources independent of the state. A bill was introduced to the 129th Maine legislature to amend Maine&#x27;s tribal sovereignty law, but the legislature had not taken it up by the time it adjourned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the PWD is the only public water utility in Maine that is not tax-exempt. Due to this and its limited customer base, there has not been adequate funding for infrastructure repairs that could improve drinking water quality.

Efforts to develop wells as alternatives to the PWD system and reservoir have met resistance. In 2014, the Passamaquoddy Tribe drilled a well on a parcel of their land in Perry, Maine. After initial testing of the well negatively impacted other wells in the area, the town of Perry passed an ordinance limiting activity on the new well, and the project was halted. In 2020, state regulations also prevented the tribe from independently testing and permitting a well for the new Sipayik Elementary School. The Passamaquoddy Tribe successfully obtained permits and dug a hand-pumped well from which people in need of clean drinking water can fill storage jugs in the fall of 2020.

===Solutions===
In November 2019, the Passamaquoddy Tribe of Pleasant Point received a $30,000 grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for water studies and testing, community outreach, reporting and action plan development. The EPA has recommended testing in a wider variety of the PWD&#x27;s service area and is helping to institute more regular testing of the water.

In early 2020, Passamaquoddy leaders assembled a group of stakeholders in the water crisis to began developing short-, middle- and long-term solutions and to increase water testing at Sipayik. The group includes tribal leaders, PWD leaders, state water officials, EPA Region 1 representatives, and individuals from other municipalities. Tribal leaders expressed a desire to understand exactly what is in the water, to have more routine testing of the PWD system take place at Sipayik as opposed to the neighboring towns of Perry or Eastport, and to establish institutional partnerships to study the health impacts of the PWD water.

As of late September 2020, the stakeholder group had held three meetings during which the State of Maine acknowledged an ongoing public health crisis at Sipayik and pledged to aid in solutions. A state grant program has been announced to address imminent public health threats, and PWD will use the first grant for a one-year pilot project: A granular activated carbon water purification system will be installed to treat the water after the existing PWD treatment. Administration of the 2019 EPA grant, focused on feasibility studies for alternative water supplies, continues; and the tribe is waiting on state permits to install a roadside well using funding from the CARES act.

<text>Jessup ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Howard and Anne Arundel counties, about southwest of Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 10,535.

==Geography==
Jessup is located at (39.138374, â76.774929). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. As of the 2010 census, the center of population for the state of Maryland is located on the grounds of the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup.

==History==
Jessup is located near the site of the historic Spurrier&#x27;s Tavern, a farm and tavern located on the post road between Baltimore and Washington (Route One) where George Washington traveled regularly.

The location of the town was named Pierceland on early maps, but the post-civil war name more commonly given was Jessup&#x27;s Cut, or Jessop&#x27;s Cut, a post village in Howard County on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The name is generally attributed to Jonathan Jessup, a civil engineer who worked on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the hand-dug &quot;cut&quot; though Merrill&#x27;s Ridge he managed as a project. The crews took over 200,000 tons of clay from the clay hill that blocked the trains in freezing weather. The clay was turned into bricks by some of the prisoners from the Maryland Penitentiary who also worked on the Maryland House of Corrections when it was being built. Some of those inmates were then transferred to the House of Correction and they knew the walls were made from Jessup&#x27;s Cut, hence &quot;the CUT&quot;. The name was shortened to Jessups in 1963. Into the mid 20th century, the town was called &quot;Jessups&quot;, then was shortened to &quot;Jessup&quot;.

Since the mid-19th century, the area has been home to various penal institutions. Inmates today still refer to these jails as &quot;the cut,&quot; probably unaware of the origin of the name. The Maryland House of Correction, operated by the Maryland Department of Corrections, included a large onsite farm manned with prison labor to provide food for prisoners onsite and offsite. Prisoner labor was discouraged by job seekers in the 1970s much as it did 100 years earlier during the construction of the B&amp;O at Jessup&#x27;s cut. The State-run Maryland Food Center occupies the land. The prison closed to inmates in 2007. The prison is referred to several times in the NBC television series &quot;&quot; and the HBO original series, &quot;The Wire&quot;. Even though the maximum security prison is now closed, the town still houses a major minimum security prison, Brockbridge Correctional Facility, for violent offenders who are not deemed a threat to society due to the nature of their crimes.

Jessup contains many warehouse delivery facilities. Due to its geographically central location in the state, Jessup is also home to the Maryland Food Center, which includes the Maryland Produce Market and the Maryland Seafood Market. The largest facility was operated by Giant Food, with a facility until September 2012. The company outsourced distribution to C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, relocating its operations to Pennsylvania. In 2013, Coastal Sunbelt Produce announced plans to relocate its 900-employee facility out of state claiming the facility was unable expand to adjacent empty parcels. Howard County was unable to relocate the facility to the vacant state-run facility, or the vacant 760,000sqft Giant Food facility with an offer to gift state land intended for a transportation hub to the company. County Executive Ken Ulman brokered a deal with Preston Scheffenacker Properties, rezoning the historic Duvall Farm site in Laurel, for light industrial use and issued county financed low-interest loans to relocate the facility out of Jessup.

Civil engineer Blake Van Leer put the railroad to use again by creating the first recycle and waste transfer stations on rail to cut emissions. Its official name is Annapolis Junction Recycling &amp; Transfer Station, despite being located in Jessup. This facility sends most material out of state to Virginia. 

Kingdon Gould&#x27;s Laurel Sand and Gravel company, which includes Savage Stone, Fairfax Materials, Allegany Aggregates, Laurel Asphalt, and S.W. Barrick &amp; Sons, purchased the 625-acre chase property in Eastern Jessup, North of the historic town of Savage, Maryland. The site is home to the Savage Stone quarry, mining Baltimore Gabbro rock for road bed construction. The facility started operations in 2005 after special zoning approval with a 25-year reserve in materials. Ridgley&#x27;s Run Community Association directors Kingdon Gould and his son provided community approval of the project in exchange for the construction of the Ridgley&#x27;s Run Community Center.

To the north of the quarry, Orson Adams built two nineteenth-century Victorian Manor Houses named Oak Hill on a 235-acre estate that anchored the community. The homes burned down after the Rouse Company purchased the land and have been redeveloped into apartments.

Resident film maker Wayne Shipley used Jessup as the production location for &quot;One-Eyed Horse&quot; (2008) and &quot;Day of the Gun&quot; (2013). Portions of &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990) and &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; (1995) were filmed in Jessup, with TA Travel Center standing in for &quot;Nord des Ligne&quot; Truck Stop in the latter film.

Major neighborhoods of Jessup include:
*Jessup, community surrounding Jessup station in Anne Arundel County.
*Guilford, located at the intersection of US 1 and Guilford Road.
*Waterloo, located at the intersection of US 1 and Waterloo Road.

*Arnold Elzey, a major general in the Confederate army during the Civil War, retired to a small farm near Jessup.
*DeWanda Wise, an actor, was born in Jessup.

<doc id="150525" wikidata="Q753632" url="?curid=150525" title="Hampstead, Maryland">
<text>Hampstead is a town in Carroll County in the U.S. state of Maryland. The population was 6,323 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Between 1736 and 1738, Robert Owings was assigned to &quot;cut a new road as Christopher Gist had marked it&quot; south from Conewago (now Hanover, Pennsylvania) to a point about halfway to Fort Garrison in Baltimore County. The village of Spring Garden became a stage-line stop on the new road and later became the town of Hampstead, named after Hampstead, in England. The first European settlers to the area were English immigrants who made their way west from the Port of Philadelphia. They were followed by Scots and Germans. Hampstead was used by farmers from surrounding areas as a center to obtain goods brought from Baltimore and to send produce to markets in Baltimore and Pennsylvania. The level and fertile land, coupled with the availability of lime, gave farmers important advantages for successful farming. In 1879, the Harrisburg Division of the Western Maryland Railroad reached Hampstead. The accessibility of the railroad attracted new residents and made dairy farming profitable. The town was incorporated in 1888 and since then has developed from a farming community to a modern town of about 6,300 residents.

Hampstead School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Once defunct and derelict, it was rehabilitated and is now The Residences at Hampstead School, a retirement facility.

==Geography==
Hampstead is located at (39.610303, -76.851493). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Hampstead is approximately south of Manchester, east of Westminster, and north of Reisterstown.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===

The racial makeup of the town was 94.0% White, 2.0% African American, 0.3% Native American, 1.4% Asian, 0.9% from other races, and 1.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.0% of the population.

<text>Mount Airy is a town in Carroll and Frederick counties in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is part of both the Washington Metropolitan Area and Baltimore Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,654. 

==History==
The community was first settled in 1830 and continued to develop throughout the decade, beginning with the construction of house settlements along Parr&#x27;s Ridge. A man named Henry Bussard built the first of these houses. This town was known for its train station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) at Parr&#x27;s Ridge. The railroad ran from Baltimore to Frederick, cities to the east and west, respectively, of Mt. Airy. Following 1830, the town received its official name after the suggestion of &quot;Mount Airy&quot; from an Irish B&amp;O worker who complained about his freezing ears on a windy work day. Over the years, milling, canning and sewing industries initially helped support Mt. Airy&#x27;s economy.

The town&#x27;s proximity to the National Road contributed to its growth. The National Road ran west from Baltimore to Illinois. By the 1890s, the town&#x27;s growth had increased significantly and three new churches were built (one Episcopal and two Methodist). In 1901, a very important bridge was constructed. It&#x27;s known by residents as the Twin Arch, and it helped with railroad transportation. Three great fires (1903, 1914, and 1925) caused setbacks in growth, but the town rebuilt every time.

When Carroll County defined its permanent boundaries in 1837, Mount Airy was divided between two counties, Carroll and Frederick; the town has remained in two counties since that time. About one mile south of the town is the junction of Carroll, Frederick, Howard and Montgomery counties at the source of the South Branch of the Patapsco River.

The town was originally settled in the early 1830s by a core group of six families. Dorsey, Davis and Bussard were the most prominent names in that first settlement, which was followed closely by the construction of the B &amp; O railroad line in 1831. Because Mount Airy sits at an elevation of , a series of four inclined planes were constructed in order for the trains to climb the steep hills. Locomotives and cars were lifted with the assistance of horses and steam winches. Passengers had to disembark during this process. Plane #4, located west of the town at the intersection of Woodville Road and MD Route 144, is still a recognized location today. In 1839 the planes were abandoned, and the new line was constructed north of where Mount Airy is today. This was a result of more powerful locomotives that had been constructed and heavier loads were being hauled. In 1901, a railroad tunnel was constructed on the south side of town and the existing line into town became a spur line into the center of Mount Airy. The town named the first resident, Henry Bussard, the station agent for the new train station. Mr. Bussard was the first major landowner in Mount Airy.

By 1846, the town was sparsely settled with several houses, a store, barber shop and shoemaker shop. Pine Grove Chapel, circa 1846, now a historic monument, was constructed to fill the need for a community church. From the time it was constructed, the chapel basement functioned as a private school.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Us/History&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel remained open during the early part of the Civil War despite soldier encampments in proximity. The school and church were closed later because of distracting soldier activity around the vicinity of the school. After the war ended, the church reopened in 1867 after undergoing a renovation.

In 1893, the Carroll County Board of Education funded the construction of a three-room schoolhouse which was completed in September 1894. The building, approximately in size, was located on the east side of Main Street, 1/4 mile south of the railroad tracks. It is now part of the Calvary United Methodist Church property.

With the incorporation of the town in 1894 came the establishment of the town government structure, including a mayor and council. The first Mount Airy mayor was Byron S. Dorsey, who served ten years in that office between 1894 and 1904. In 1900, the town population had grown to 332 residents. By 1910, the town population was 428, and it was determined that the town had enough student population to justify a state-accredited high school. A high school with classes was organized, but an official high school building to house all eleven grades was not constructed at that time.

The town of Mount Airy endured three disastrous fires during the first quarter of the 20th century. The first fire occurred in 1902 and destroyed the business section of the southern side of the downtown area. The second fire was in 1914 and consumed the north side of the downtown business section. The third fire took place about ten years later, in 1925, and again, the northern side of the downtown business district was destroyed. As a result of the 1925 fire, the Mount Airy Volunteer Fire Company was organized in 1926.

During the late 1920s and early 1930s the town continued to flourish despite the onset of the Great Depression. The 1930 U.S. Census tallied the town population at 845 persons, an increase of 91 people since 1920. The railroad company largely contributed to the growth of not only the population, but the town&#x27;s economy as well. As a result, expanded town services included necessary public utilities such as electric service when Potomac Edison was established in Mount Airy. The thriving economy supported the initiation of several large businesses in the 1930s, such as a poultry operation, two automobile garages, an ice factory, and the creation of the Mount Airy Canning Company, which provided about 250 jobs. In 1932, the first motion picture theater opened in Mount Airy, establishing a core business district. During that time, the town also saw the purchase of land for a town park, the opening of a grocery store and a lumberyard, and the dedication of Pine Grove Chapel for use as a nonsectarian chapel.

The Mount Airy Historic District that includes the railroad station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Currently, Mt. Airy is no longer economically dependent on the railroad, as citizens work a variety of different jobs. Many of its citizens work in Washington, DC, or Baltimore; the city is a part of both of those cities&#x27; metropolitan areas. Mt. Airy is a neighborhood community for these job centers. Mt. Airy is similar to back in the day with the National Road but now with Interstate 70 bordering the southern end of the city with an interchange with MD-27. In the last few decades Mount Airy has seen significant growth, as laid out in the Mount Airy Master Plan from the 1994 to 2003 update. In 2007, President George W. Bush made a speech in Mount Airy.

Mt. Airy hosts townwide events each year including the Main Street Chili Cookoff, Celebrate Mount Airy in August, Mount Airy Oktoberfest in September, Shop Small and A Main Street Christmas in December.

==Geography==
Mount Airy is located on the border between Frederick and Carroll counties, in the far eastern part of Frederick County and the southwest corner of Carroll County. Mount Airy&#x27;s Main Street, formerly MD 27 and now Maryland Route 808, runs atop Parrs Ridge in a northeastâsouthwest direction with elevations ranging between . Numerous valleys that extend outward toward the east and west from this ridge give the town its unusually hilly topography. Mount Airy straddles the division of two major drainage basins. Within the Frederick County portion of the town are the headwaters of Woodville Branch and Ben&#x27;s Branch which are parts of the Linganore Creek watershed, as well as the headwaters of Bush Creek in the southwestern part of the town. The Linganore watershed drains into Lake Linganore, a secondary source of public water for Frederick County. The Linganore and Bush Creek watersheds are part of the Lower Monocacy River watershed, with eventual drainage to the Potomac River. The east side of Mount Airy drains via tributaries of Middle Run and the South Branch of the Patapsco River to Baltimore Harbor. Both the Potomac and the Patapsco are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town of Mount Airy has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.29%, is water.

===Transportation===

The primary means of travel to and from Mount Airy are by road. The most prominent highway serving the town is Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40, which forms the southern border of Mount Airy and leads east to Baltimore and west to Frederick. Maryland Route 27 (Ridge Road) runs through the east side of the town, leading northeast to Westminster, the Carroll County seat, and southwest to Interstate 270 in Germantown. Maryland Route 808 follows the original route of Maryland Route 27 through downtown Mount Airy.

===Climate===
Mount Airy is similar to Westminster in its position astride Parrs Ridge, and has a humid, temperate climate, more specifically a humid subtropical climate falling short of a humid continental climate, with four rather well defined seasons. The general atmospheric flow is from west to east but alternate surges of cold air from the north and of warm humid air from the south occurs in the area, causing highly variable weather. Nearness to the Atlantic Coast allows coastal storms to make up any deficiency of precipitation resulting from the passage of weather systems over the mountains to the west.

The average annual temperature is approximately 54 degrees, with January generally the coldest month and July the warmest. Temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit an average of 27 days a year. The Town of Mount Airy is in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a for an annual extreme minimum temperature of 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit.

The average annual precipitation totals about 45 inches, with February the driest and August the wettest month. During the growing season, which averages about 177 days from April through to September, the last part of July through to the first part of August is the driest, with an average of 85-90 degrees. The average seasonal snowfall in Mount Airy per year is 28 inches, which is equal to the U.S. national average.

==History==
According to the Maryland Municipal League:

:In the 1850s, the area that is now the town of Queen Anne, was part of a 225-acre farm owned by Jacob Morgan. Initially, the town nucleus was nothing but a 1Â½-story dwelling, but in 1864 Mr. Morgan built a more substantial placeâit was known locally as âthe mansion house,â and the locale was known as Morganville.

:At that time, the Pennsylvania Railroad had been laid as far south as Greensboro and, a little later, to Ridgely and Hillsboro and thence across Tuckahoe Creek. In 1878, the railroad purchased a site for a station across the creek in Queen Anneâs County, and, quite logically, named it Queen Anne when the station was finally put into service about 1882.

==Transportation==

The primary means of travel to and from Queen Anne is by road. Maryland Route 404 Alternate, Maryland Route 303 and Maryland Route 518 are the state highways directly serving the town. Maryland Route 404 and Maryland Route 309 pass just outside the town corporate limits to the north and west.

<text>Bondsville is an area and former census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of Palmer in Hampden County in the western part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. The population of the CDP was 1,876 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village was named after Emelius Bond who first secured the water rights of the Swift River in 1846 to form the Bond Village Manufacturing Company.

== History ==

Born in 1800 in Brimfield, Massachusetts, Emelius Bond arrived in what would become Bondsville in 1830 and started a mill that utilized the water power of the Swift River. The Bond Village Manufacturing Company was later granted the legal rights to the waters of the Swift River in 1846. Later, the company would be purchased and become known as the Boston Duck Company which produced fabrics and specialized in fabric for raincoats. The Boston Duck Company closed its doors in 1941 where the building and many of its mill houses were auctioned off. In October 1968, the entire complex which stood over much of Main Street, was destroyed in a multi-day massive fire.

Overlooking Main Street is the former St. Bartholomew Roman Catholic church which was closed by Bishop Timothy A. McDonnell on Christmas Eve of 2009. The church had been constructed between 1878 and 1879, with the first Mass being said in the completed church proper on Christmas Day of 1879. The church&#x27;s first permanent pastor was Rev. Bartholomew L. McKeany who served from 1879 until his death in 1910. 

Two railroads served the village. The Boston and Maine Railroad had a station on Maple Street behind the former Bleach and Dye Works building. This station was located just south of the Swift River before a large train overpass. The station has been tended to by stationmaster George Girouard, who was later awarded a golden ticket on the railroad for his years of service. The second railroad was the Boston and Albany Railroad which had both a passenger and freight station which actually stood in the town of Belchertown, Massachusetts between Keyes Street and the Swift River. This line would be discontinued at the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir as the next stop was in Enfield, Massachusetts which is now under the waters of the reservoir.

<text>Devens is a regional enterprise zone and census-designated place in the towns of Ayer and Shirley (in Middlesex County) and Harvard (in Worcester County) in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It is the successor to Fort Devens, a military post that operated from 1917 to 1996. The population was 1,697 at the 2020 census, down from 1,840 in 2010.

== History ==

The area itself is named after jurist and Civil War general Charles Devens. In 2011, the CDP tried to secede from Ayer, Shirley, and Harvard and become the 352nd town in the state but failed the vote. Some residents are still looking to secede to become a town.

===Military use===

The area operated as Camp Devens and later Fort Devens from 1917 to 1996. The Fort&#x27;s sitting was due primarily to its location at a major hub of the rail network in New England. The U.S. Army base was officially closed in 1996 after 79 years of service. Some parcels were retained by the federal military for use as the Devens Reserve Forces Training Area, reactivated as a smaller Fort Devens in 2007.

===Civilian use===
The process for distribution of surplus land parcels on the former Fort Devens allowed the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Shriver Job Corps, Massachusetts National Guard, Massachusetts Veterans and MassDevelopment to acquire the land. The Bureau of Prisons established the Federal Medical Center, Devens, a prison hospital. The bulk of the land was purchased by MassDevelopment for $17 million. MassDevelopment is a quasi-public development authority that has been given the task of turning Devens into a residential and business community. Since the closing of the military base, many of the existing buildings have been renovated or reconstructed; housing developments now exist, along with a growing business park, a new hotel, restaurants, two disc golf courses and a golf course. Veterans of the Army Security Agency have also expressed interest in building a museum there, as Fort Devens was their principal training facility for more than two decades.

A comprehensive disposition process has been ongoing since 2003, charged with determining the future political governance of Devens. During 2005-06 it was determined that the governance scenario best suited for the regional stakeholders was to create a new independent town. On October 24, 2006, a vote to confirm the disposition recommendation for future governance was voted down by two of the six stakeholders, the adjoining towns of Harvard and Ayer (residents of Shirley, the Devens residents, MassDevelopment and the Devens Enterprise Commission supported the resolution). On November 7, 2006, during the state elections, the second opportunity to vote on Devens disposition had only Harvard voting against the scenario with the towns of Ayer and Shirley supporting Devens as a town. Devens&#x27;s disposition will now be determined by another disposition process or by the state legislature. Residents of Devens vote in either Harvard or Ayer but still have no elected representatives that have municipal authority in Devens. MassDevelopment maintains the utilities (such as gas, electricity and water) and contracts out public safety services such as firefighting and police.

Devens is home to, among other enterprises, New England Studios, a film studio opened in 2014 and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which raised $1.8 billion in December 2021 to build a tokamak fusion device.

==Geography==
Devens is on the boundary between Middlesex and Worcester counties, with approximately half in the northwestern part of the town of Harvard in northeastern Worcester County and the rest in the southeastern part of the town of Shirley and the western part of the town of Ayer in northwestern Middlesex County. The Devens CDP is bordered to the northeast by the village of Ayer and to the west by the village of Shirley.

Massachusetts Route 2 forms the southern edge of the community, with access from Exit 106. Route 2 leads west to the Leominster/Fitchburg area and east to Concord.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Devens CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.31%, are water. The Nashua River flows northward through the west side of the community, part of the Merrimack River watershed.

==Demographics==
&quot;For demographic information about the area prior to 2010, see Fort Devens (CDP), Massachusetts.&quot;
==Government==
Devens residents are represented at two levels:
* An elected committee, the Devens Committee. that is an advisory committee to MassDevelopment. The committee has five members with a chair, vice-chair and secretary
* Some residents living outside of Devens proper are represented by the town governments of the Towns of Ayer (northeast) and Harvard (southeast).

==Nuclear fusion facility==
Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an MIT spinoff, raised $1.8 billion in December 2021 to build a tokamak fusion device, called SPARC, at a scale intended to achieve ânet energy,â that is, it is expected to output more energy than required to sustain its nuclear fusion reactions. The company is building this facility in Devens. The full-scale machine is planned to be fully operational by 2025.

==Education==
Devens is a non-operating school district. It currently contracts with the town of Harvard for educating its children. However, Devens is the home of the Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School. Parker is a public charter school with students from about 30 towns in the central Massachusetts area.

==Places of interest==
With the exception of the U.S. Army Garrison Fort Devens cantonment area, the Devens Reserve Forces Training Area, and the Federal Medical Center prison, most of the former Fort Devens area has been returned to civilian use.

Of interest to the general public in Devens:
* Oxbow National Wildlife Refuge is located to the south side of the former Fort Devens base.
* Fort Devens Historic District is located to the north of the former Fort Devens.
* The Fort Devens Museum http://fortdevensmuseum.org (94 Jackson Rd, #305) is a small museum on the history of Fort Devens from 1917 to the present

<doc id="150536" wikidata="Q1001742" url="?curid=150536" title="Holland, Michigan">
<text>Holland is a city in Ottawa and Allegan counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located in the western region of the Lower Peninsula, the city is situated near the eastern shore of Lake Michigan on Lake Macatawa, which is fed by the Macatawa River. As of the 2020 census, the population was 34,378, with an urbanized area population of 107,034.

Holland was founded by Dutch Americans and is in an area that has a large percentage of citizens of Dutch American heritage. It is home to Hope College and Western Theological Seminary, institutions of the Reformed Church in America. Holland&#x27;s economy includes manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and higher education. It is home to a number of prominent companies, including Herman Miller, Haworth, and Adient. The city also attracts thousands of visitors each year for its annual Tulip Time Festival, which celebrates the area&#x27;s Dutch heritage and tulip fields.

The city spans the Ottawa/Allegan county line, with in Ottawa and the remaining in Allegan. Holland is the largest city in both Ottawa and Allegan counties. The Ottawa County portion is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, while the Allegan County portion anchors the Holland micropolitan statistical area, which is coextensive with Allegan County. The city is part of the larger Grand RapidsâWyoming combined statistical area.

==History==
Ottawa County was originally populated by Ottawa Indians. In 1846, Reverend George Smith established the Old Wing Mission as an outreach to the native population. The Ottawa living here were primarily practicing Catholics, but Smith tried converting them to Protestantism. While generally unsuccessful in converting the Native population, the two groups worked together relatively closely for a short time. This attempt to work and live together was not valued by the next group who arrived.

Holland was settled in 1847 by Dutch Calvinist separatists, under the leadership of Dr. Albertus van Raalte. Dire economic conditions in the Netherlands compelled them to emigrate, while their desire for religious freedom led them to unite and settle together as a group.

Van Raalte and his colony settled on land in the midst of the Ottawa (Odawa) people&#x27;s Old Wing Mission Colony near the Macatawa River (also known as the Black River) where it streams into Lake Macatawa (Called Black Lake prior to June 4, 1935) which, in turn, leads to Lake Michigan via a channel. The Dutch settlers and the Ottawa people never got along. Dutch settlers began stealing sugar and venison from the Ottawa. The Dutch were unwilling to accept the Ottawa people&#x27;s mix of Catholic and Native culture. Soon, Dutch leaders tried to force the natives into wooded land in Allegan County. Eventually, the natives moved north to preserve their way of life and culture. Chief Peter Waukazoo and Reverend George Smith decided to move the community and the Ottawa Mission from Holland up to Northport (on the Leelanau Peninsula), voyaging on boats and canoes.

In Holland&#x27;s early history, Van Raalte was a spiritual leader, as well as overseeing political, educational and financial matters. In 1847, Van Raalte established a congregation of the Reformed Church in America, which would later be called the First Reformed Church of Holland. On March 25, 1867, Holland was incorporated as a city with Isaac Cappon being the city&#x27;s first mayor.

===October 1871 Fire===
The city suffered a major fire on October 8â10, 1871, at the same time as the Great Chicago Fire in Illinois and the very deadly Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin. Due to the Great Michigan Fire (which included the Port Huron Fire of 1871), Manistee and Port Huron, Michigan, also burned at the same time. Also known as the Great Midwest fires, the series of fires across Michigan claimed approximately 500 lives, though the exact death toll remains unknown. The vast majority of downtown burned in the fire, claiming 1 life in the aftermath of the fire. The exact cause of the fire remains unknown. There are a number of theories about what caused the fire. The congruence with the Chicago fire has led to some claims of a link, such as embers floating over Lake Michigan to start the Holland Fire. However, one of the theories are rather fantastical and fairly unlikely, that burning methane gas from a passing comet lead to the fires. The most likely explanation remains that strong winds strengthened a small brush fire, first igniting the nearby forests before burning the town itself. However, no definitive explanation for the fires have ever been given, and the exact cause remains unknown.

==Arts and culture==
The city is perhaps best known for its Dutch heritage, which serves not only as a part of the city&#x27;s cultural identity, but the local economy as well: the Tulip Time Festival in May and various Dutch-themed attractions augment the nearby Lake Michigan shoreline in attracting thousands of tourists annually. Over 28% of the population identified as being of Dutch descent.

The Holland Museum contains exhibits about the city&#x27;s history. Another, the Cappon House Museum, was built in 1874 and is a historic museum that once housed the first mayor of Holland, Dutch immigrant Isaac Cappon. The Settlers House Museum, a building that survived the great fire, contains furnishings and relics from the 19th century.

Holland&#x27;s downtown is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The &quot;Snowmelt Project&quot; established pipes transporting warm water from the nearby power plant to travel underneath downtown with the purpose of clearing the streets and sidewalks in the downtown area of any snow.

De Zwaan, an original 250-year-old Dutch windmill, is situated on Windmill Island, a municipal park. Its height is with sails.

Holland boasts an annual Fiesta, organized by Latin Americans United for Progress, usually on the Saturday closest to May 5 (Cinco de Mayo). Holland is also host to the annual Tulipanes Latino Art &amp; Film Festival, which is held to celebrate the Latino contribution to the culture.

===Religion===
Holland is known as the &quot;City of Churches&quot;. There are around 140 churches in the greater Holland area, many of which are with the Reformed Church in America and Christian Reformed Church in North America denominations. The city is the home to the church that started the trend of the &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot; bracelets in 1989.

===Tourism===

Each May, Holland hosts an annual Tulip Time Festival. Tulip planting and the festival began in 1930 when 250,000 tulips were planted for the event. Currently six million tulips are used throughout the city. Tulips are planted along many city streets, in city parks and outside municipal buildings as well as at tourist attractions like Dutch Village, the city-owned Windmill Island Gardens, and at a large tulip farm named Veldheer Tulip Gardens. It is normally held the second week of May, during the tulip blooming season. Cruise ships such as the Yorktown from the Great Lakes Cruising Company make Holland a port of call.

About one million tourists visit Tulip Time each year, for which the community finds innovative ways to enhance self-funded projects. The Tulip Time Festival has attracted big-name acts in recent years such as: Christina Aguilera in 2000, O-Town in 2001, the Verve Pipe in 2004, and Jars of Clay in 2006. Ed McMahon visited Tulip Time in 2007 along with Bobby Vinton. Comedian Bill Cosby headlined the 2014 Tulip Time Festival.

Holland is located on Lake Macatawa, near the shores of Lake Michigan. Scattered along the shoreline are many public beach accesses including Tunnel Park and the widely popular Holland State Park. Across the channel from the State Park is the Holland Harbor Light, known as &quot;Big Red&quot;. Smaller beaches along Lake Michigan are present but not well marked. Public accesses are frequent along dead-end streets bordering the shoreline.

The city&#x27;s primary shopping district is centered along 8th Street, the city&#x27;s main street downtown.

The 8th Street business district features a thermal snow-melting system which uses cooling water from the local electric plant. In 1988, the city rebuilt the entire street and sidewalk system, installing the thermal pipes underneath. The system will melt up to an inch an hour down to 15Â°.

==Government==

The City of Holland uses a council/manager form of government. The day-to-day operations of the city are under the supervision of the city manager and their staff. The city manager is responsible for selecting all department heads, preparation of the budget and supervision of all employees through their appointments.

The city manager serves at the direction of the mayor and city council which are elected positions. The current city manager is Keith Van Beek, former Ottawa County deputy county administrator, who was appointed in February 2018 by the city council. Soren Wolff served as the city manager from 1988 until his retirement in the Fall 2011. Soren previously served the city as assistant city manager in the mid-1970s and had a street named after him near Fairbanks Avenue and 13th Street, which is the main entrance to Smallenburg Park and many of Hope College&#x27;s athletic facilities. The current assistant city manager is Matt VanDyken, the former IT director for the city.

Holland&#x27;s city charter requires a mayor and eight city council members. The mayor serves a two-year term, and two at-large council members and six ward council members each serve four-year terms.

The current mayor is Nathan Bocks, a local attorney elected in November 2019.

<text>South Haven is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. Most of the city is in Van Buren County, although a small portion extends into Allegan County. The population was 3,964 at the 2020 census.

Because of its position on Lake Michigan, at the mouth of the Black River, South Haven has always been a port city. During settlement, major ship lines stopped there, both passenger and freight. In the early 1900s South Haven became a resort town, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Catskills of the Midwest.&quot; South Haven is a major regional tourist draw because of its recreational harbor and beaches. It is the western terminus of the Kal-Haven Trail, popular with bicyclists and snowmobilers. Nearby are Van Buren State Park and the Van Buren Trail State Park.

Noted botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey was born in South Haven. His childhood home was presented to the city in the 1930s, and is now a museum.

==History==

Prior to colonization by white settlers, the area was inhabited at different times by Potawatomi and Iroquois native people. In 1833, the U.S. government granted Jay R. Monroe a land patent for 65 acres of land along the shore of Lake Michigan. In the 1850s the first permanent settlers arrived, and early in the decade the first steam sawmills were built on the Black River. About this time, the settlement gained its first merchant, physician, lawyer, and minister, and the first schoolhouse was built. The first bank was organized in 1867. South Haven was incorporated as a village in 1869, and as a city in 1902. South Haven was named in relation to nearby Grand Haven.

In 1853, the first hotel in South Haven, known as the Forest House, was built at the corner of Phoenix and Center Streets. The building was subsequently moved a few doors south and still stands, though greatly modified, and no longer used as a hotel.

The timber harvested in South Haven was shipped to Chicago and Milwaukee via steamboats and schooners, and the cleared forests were then used by fruit farmers, who primarily grew peaches, blueberries and apples. The farming industry created many jobs in the area, and the city began to boom. Around the early 1900s, theaters, a casino, an opera house, an amusement park, and many resorts contributed to a rise in popularity of the city. Being a resort city resulted in a seasonal economy, however, and in an effort to stabilize the economy, the city&#x27;s board of trade successfully recruited several different industries to the area.
In 1925, the first foreign shipments of goods arrived, beginning an era of foreign shipments that would last until the mid-1960s. The last passenger steamboat left South Haven for Chicago on Labor Day, 1941, though recreational boating increased steadily. In the 1950s and 1960s several new factories came to the area, and although the resort businesses in the area began to flounder, the resorts that remained grew stronger.

In 1970, &quot;The Centennial Celebration and Blueberry Festival&quot; took place, and the city&#x27;s 64-slip marina was dedicated. To this day the Blueberry Festival continues to draw many visitors to the city. Other events, such as the Ice Breaker Festival, Harborfest, the art shows and Fourth of July fireworks display remain very popular. The beaches, boating and relaxing atmosphere will continue to ensure that the City of South Haven remains a popular warm-weather destination. The South Pier Lighthouse, built in 1903 to replace the light established in 1872, is still operational, and is accessible from a public beach.

South Haven is home to a public school district as well as Roman Catholic and Lutheran parochial grammar schools. In addition, Western Michigan University and Lake Michigan College, a junior college, have branch campuses located within the city. The city has annexed portions of South Haven Township, Van Buren County and a small portion of Casco Township, Allegan County.

==Architecture==

The club house has two large stained glass windows portraying Sir Walter Scott and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The South Haven Center for the Arts is housed in the 1906 neoclassical Carnegie Library, also on Phoenix St.

<doc id="150538" wikidata="Q1005953" url="?curid=150538" title="Midland, Michigan">
<text>Midland is a city in and the county seat of Midland County, Michigan, in the United States. The city&#x27;s population was 42,547 as of the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Midland Metropolitan Statistical Area, part of the larger Saginaw-Midland-Bay City Combined Statistical Area. The city is bordered by Midland Township, though the two are administered separately.

Midland is located at the confluence of Chippewa and Tittabawassee rivers in Central Michigan. The city is home to the headquarters of Dow Chemical Company, one of the largest chemical producers in the world, which was founded by Herbert Henry Dow in the city in 1897. The city is also home to Midland Center for the Arts and Northwood University.

==History==
By the late 1820s, Midland was established as a fur trading post of the American Fur Company supervised by the post at Saginaw. Here agents purchased furs from Ojibwe trappers. The Campau family of Detroit operated an independent trading post at this location in the late 1820s.

Dow Chemical Company was founded in Midland in 1897, and its world headquarters are still located there. Through the influence of a Dow Chemical plant opening in Handa, Aichi, Japan, Midland and Handa have become sister cities. Dow Corning was also headquartered in Midland.

In 1969, the city unilaterally defined a Midland Urban Growth Area (MUGA), a two-mile territory around the city limits, in an attempt to control urban sprawl. As the county&#x27;s only capable drinking water supplier, the city would provide water services to communities outside the MUGA such as the nearby village of Sanford. The city would not provide water services within the MUGA without annexation to the city of Midland. This allowed the city to control most of the growth in the county. Since 1991, the policy has since been revised with a series of Urban Cooperation Act Agreements with surrounding townships. Case-by-case redrawings of the MUGA line now allow Midland to sell water to the surrounding townships without annexation.

On May 19, 2020, the Sanford Dam and Edenville Dam both failed, prompting an evacuation of 10,000 Midland residents. Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency, predicting that parts of Midland and Sanford would be covered in nine feet of water within 12â15 hours. She urged residents to seek shelter with family and friends or at emergency shelters. This major &quot;500 year&quot; flooding event occurred just months after the COVID-19 stay at home order went into effect.

== Geography ==
The city lies within eastern Midland County, with a small portion extending east into Bay County. Most of the city&#x27;s area is incorporated from Midland Township. The city is northwest of Saginaw and west of Bay City. It is part of the Flint/Tri-Cities region.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 5.41%, are water. The city is along the Tittabawassee River, a southeast-flowing tributary of the Saginaw River, leading to Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron.

Dow Memorial Library, Midland&#x27;s public library named in his mother&#x27;s honor.

==Infrastructure==

===Power===
In 1967, Dow Chemical attained criticality on a 100Â kW nuclear research reactor at the Midland facility, primarily as a neutron source and to irradiate samples. The reactor continues to operate.

In 1968, Consumers Power (now Consumers Energy) began construction of a nuclear power plant in Midland, primarily for Dow Chemical Company. The project&#x27;s budget was $257 million, with completion anticipated in 1972. Extreme construction problems caused years of delays and costs soared. The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 resulted in a massive change in nuclear regulatory requirements and system redesign. When it was revealed that the containment buildings were settling and foundation cracks were discovered, Dow canceled their contract with Consumers Power, and the project was abandoned in 1984. The $4.1 billion investment nearly bankrupted Consumers Power. However, in 1985, Consumers Power formed a partnership with eight other companies to convert Midland&#x27;s abandoned nuclear plant into a gas-fired power plant. Transformation of the plant began in 1986 and was completed at a cost of $500 million. The Midland Cogeneration Venture began producing power in 1991 and that success restored faith in Consumers Power. The facility now produces 10% of the power consumption for the lower peninsula of Michigan.

<doc id="150540" wikidata="Q2442951" url="?curid=150540" title="Niles, Michigan">
<text>Niles is a city in Berrien and Cass counties in the U.S. state of Michigan, near the Indiana state line city of South Bend. The population was 11,988 according to the 2020 census. It is the larger, by population, of the two principal cities in the Niles-Benton Harbor metropolitan area, an area with 153,797 people.

==History==
Niles lies on the banks of the St. Joseph River, at the site of the French Fort St. Joseph, which was built in 1697 to protect the Jesuit Mission established in 1691. After 1761, it was held by the British and was captured on May 25, 1763, by Native Americans during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion. The British retook the fort but it was not re-garrisoned and served as a trading post. During the American Revolutionary War, the fort was held for a short time by a Spanish force. The occupation of the fort by the four nations of France, Britain, Spain, and the United States has earned Niles the nickname City of Four Flags.

The town was named after Hezekiah Niles, editor of the &quot;Niles Register&quot;, a Baltimore newspaper. The town of Niles as it exists today was settled in 1827. Between 1820 and 1865, Niles was an integral part of the Underground Railroad, helping slaves escape from as far south as New Orleans through the Heartland, and eventually into Canada.

==Geography==
The city is situated on the St. Joseph River and is mostly surrounded by Niles Township. Glacial deposits of large boulders and smooth stones mingle with heavy sedimentary deposits, producing rolling hills and steep river banks. The soil is rich and fertile. Crinoid and related fossils are easily found south of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Attractions==

Chapin Mansion, built by Henry A. Chapin and formerly serving as Niles City Hall, is located downtown.

The Riverfront Park in Niles stretches about a mile and a half of the St. Joseph River. The park and the immediate surrounding down town area is the main stage for many of the city&#x27;s seasonal cultural events, including the Niles Riverfest, the Bluegrass Festival, the Hunter Ice Festival, and the Apple Festival Parade. The park also includes the Armed Forces Memorial, public stage, City&#x27;s free skateboard park, playground, and sand volleyball courts.

Niles includes two other smaller but notable parks. The Saint Joseph River Park, parts of which are now being excavated by archeologists, is south of the French Paper Mill Factory Dam. It includes part of the original Fort St. Joseph. Archaeologists from Western Michigan University have uncovered numerous artifacts at this location. In the summer they host an &quot;Open House&quot; that allows patrons to visit the dig site, see displays of some of the artifacts, and also see demonstrations of historical reenactments. Niles also has a small park, Island Park, that is on an island in the middle of the St. Joseph River. The park has been known to become completely submerged during high flood waters.

In 2003, the City of Niles was awarded a MEDC Community Development Block Grant which, together with private and city funds, allowed for the removal of aluminum fronts from two blocks on Main St. Basic facade restoration along with streetscape improvements were also made, including brick sidewalks and numerous brick flower beds. Jerry Tyler Airport is located at the eastern edge of the city; it is the location of the city&#x27;s annual Fourth of July celebration.

Near Niles to the northwest is Fernwood Botanical Garden and Nature Preserve. Barron Lake and its adjacent community is to the east. The University of Notre Dame is six miles to the south in South Bend, Indiana.

Niles is located on the northern end of the Indiana-Michigan River Valley Trail, a system of interconnected multi-use trails connecting the cities of Mishawaka, Indiana, South Bend, and Niles. The trail runs through the aforementioned Riverfront Park.

==Infrastructure==
===Rail===
The two rail lines currently serving Niles are Amtrak&#x27;s Blue Water and Wolverine services. The Blue Water line runs between Chicago and Port Huron, by way of East Lansing and Flint. The Wolverine line runs between Chicago and Pontiac, by way of Jackson, Ann Arbor and Detroit. Freight service provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway. However, it was once served by several other lines. The Amtrak line was the Michigan Central Railroad&#x27;s main line, opened through Niles in 1848 and 1849. The St. Joseph Valley Railroad opened in 1870 as the Michigan Central&#x27;s South Bend Branch, and the Michigan Air Line Railroad, leased to the Michigan Central, opened a line heading east from Niles in 1871, known as the Air Line Branch. The final line through Niles was the southeastânorthwest Benton Harbor Branch of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (also known as the Big Four), originally opened by the Elkhart, Niles and Lake Michigan Railroad in 1881. All of these lines were part of the New York Central Railroad system. The Air Line Branch was abandoned at Niles in 1937, and the Benton Harbor Branch (Big Four) was removed north of Niles in 1980. The South Bend Branch was removed later that decade.

The Amtrak station is located along the main line east of the former Benton Harbor Branch crossing and west of the former junctions with the South Bend and Air Line Branches. Amtrak uses the old Michigan Central station; the current structure was built in 1892 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Scenes in films such as &quot;Continental Divide&quot;, &quot;Midnight Run&quot; and &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; were shot here. Baggage cannot be checked at this location; however, up to two suitcases in addition to any &quot;personal items&quot; such as briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment are allowed on board as carry-ons.

<text>Union City is a village in the U.S. state of Michigan. Most of the village is within Union Township in Branch County with only a very small portion extending north into Burlington Township in Calhoun County. The population was 1,714 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area was first surveyed by Robert Clark in 1826, and Isaiah Bennett purchased the first plot of land from the government in 1831. Justus Goodwin bought a large piece of Bennett&#x27;s land in 1833, and he built a mill and became the first postmaster when a post office began operating on November 9, 1834. The post office was named Goodwinville. In 1835, E. W. Morgan platted the community and named it Union City. The post office was also renamed as Union City on January 23, 1840. The name was believed to come from the &quot;union&quot; of the Coldwater River and St. Joseph River that ran through the area. Union City incorporated as a village in 1866.

Union City was designated as Station No. 2 of the famous Underground Railroad, where John D. Zimmerman (1811-1879), formerly of Connecticut, was stationmaster. The slaves seeking refuge were taken into a home built around 1840 by Mr. Zimmerman, who arrived in Union City from Fairfield, Connecticut, in the spring of 1838. He brought with him a set of blacksmith tools to operate the blacksmith shop promised for him by Israel Ward Clark, one of the four proprietors of the village of Union City in 1837. In September 1839, Zimmerman returned to Union City with his family; he soon built a wagon factory, blacksmith shop, and a Greek Revival house. Outraged by the institution of slavery, Zimmerman became a stationmaster for the Underground Railroad, hiding escaped slaves in his house and assisting them in their flight to Canada and freedom. The home is on the list of Michigan State Historic Sites and is located at 119 East High Street.

In the early 1920s Union City built a hydroelectrical plant to deliver cheaper electricity to the town. By 1923 Riley Dam was constructed on nearby St. Joseph River, and the backwater forms Union Lake.

Children&#x27;s author and illustrator Patricia Polacco lives in Union City. Her home, the &quot;Meteor Ridge Farm&quot;, formerly called &quot;The Plantation&quot;, was built in 1859 or 1860 and also served as a stop on the Underground Railroad, even receiving a personal visit from President Lincoln. One of Polacco&#x27;s first books, &quot;Meteor!&quot;, is based on a true story of a meteor that fell on a farm in the town. Union City now has an annual Meteor Festival in early July, with many activities for children. The original meteor of the story resides in Riverside Cemetery as a family marker.

Union City also sponsors an annual Memorial Day parade, and holds a community Memorial Day service at Riverside Cemetery.

Parts of the horror film trilogy &quot;Evil Dead&quot; were filmed west of Union City.

On May 1st, 2024, an EF3 tornado struck the city with 0 deaths.
