<text>Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a genetic disorder in which the electrical activity of the heart is abnormal due to channelopathy. It increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death. Those affected may have episodes of syncope. The abnormal heart rhythms seen in those with Brugada syndrome often occur at rest. They may be triggered by a fever.
About a quarter of those with Brugada syndrome have a family member who also has the condition. Some cases may be due to a new genetic mutation or certain medications. The most commonly involved gene is SCN5A which encodes the cardiac sodium channel. Diagnosis is typically by electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the abnormalities may not be consistently present. Medications such as ajmaline may be used to reveal the ECG changes. Similar ECG patterns may be seen in certain electrolyte disturbances or when the blood supply to the heart has been reduced.
There is no cure for Brugada syndrome. Those at higher risk of sudden cardiac death may be treated using an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In those without symptoms the risk of death is much lower, and how to treat this group is less clear. Isoproterenol may be used in the short term for those who have frequent life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, while quinidine may be used longer term. Testing people&#x27;s family members may be recommended.
The condition affects between 1 and 30 per 10,000 people. It is more common in males than females and in those of Asian descent. The onset of symptoms is usually in adulthood. It was first described by Andrea Nava and Bortolo Martini, in Padova, in 1989; it is named after Pedro and Josep Brugada, two Spanish cardiologists, who described the condition in 1992. Chen first described the genetic abnormality of SCN5A channels.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Although many of those with Brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms, Brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms, such as ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Blackouts may be caused by brief abnormal heart rhythms that revert to a normal rhythm spontaneously. If a dangerous heart rhythm does not stop by itself and is left untreated, the person may have a fatal cardiac arrest. However, blackouts can occur in those with Brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm, because of a sudden drop in blood pressure, known as vasovagal syncope.

The abnormal heart rhythms seen in Brugada syndrome often occur at rest, after a heavy meal, and even during sleep. These situations are linked to periods when the vagus nerve is activated, referred to as periods of high vagal tone. Abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever and after excessive alcohol use. Sodium-channel-blocking medications, commonly used to treat cardiac arrhythmia, may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with Brugada syndrome and should be avoided.

== Causes ==
The individual heart muscle cells communicate with each other with electrical signals that are disrupted in those with Brugada syndrome. As a genetic condition, the syndrome is ultimately caused by changes to a person&#x27;s DNA, known as genetic mutations. The first mutations described in association with Brugada syndrome were in a gene responsible for a protein or ion channel that controls the flow of sodium ions through the cell membrane of heart muscle cells – the cardiac sodium channel. Many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with Brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way, or affect other ionic currents.

A long list of factors that can generate a Brugada ECG pattern have been described, including certain medications, electrolyte disturbances such as a decrease in the levels of potassium in the blood, and a reduction in blood supply to key areas of the heart, specifically the right ventricular outflow tract. Drugs that have been implicated include antiarrhythmic medications such as flecainide, verapamil and propranolol, antidepressants such as amitryptiline, and drugs that enhance vagal tone such as acetylcholine. The ECG pattern can also be seen following excessive use of alcohol or cocaine.

=== Genetics ===
Brugada syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is needed to produce the syndrome. However, a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have Brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation. The gene in which mutations are most commonly found in Brugada syndrome, known as &quot;SCN5A&quot;, is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel. Mutations in SCN5A associated with Brugada syndrome generally cause the flow of sodium ions to decrease. However, only 20% of cases of Brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in &quot;SCN5A&quot;, as in the majority of patients with Brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible. Over 290 mutations in the &quot;SCN5A&quot; gene have been discovered to date, each altering sodium channel function in subtly different ways. This variation partially explains the differences in severity of the condition between different persons, ranging from a highly dangerous condition causing death at a young age to a benign condition that may not cause any problems at all. However, the genetics of Brugada syndrome are complex, and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes. Because of these complex interactions, some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of Brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not, referred to as variable penetrance. Mutations in the SCN5A gene seem to have a prognostic value.

Several other genes have been identified in association with Brugada syndrome. Some are responsible for other proteins that form part of the sodium channel, known as sodium channel β subunits (SCN1B, SCN2B, SCN3B) while others form different types of sodium channel (SCN10A). Some genes encode ion channels that carry calcium or potassium ions (CACNA1C, CACNB2, KCND3, KCNE3, KCNJ8, KCNT1), while others generate proteins that interact with ion channels. (GPD1L, PKP2, MOG1, FGF12). Another gene associated with this condition is RRAD. The genes associated with Brugada syndrome and their description include:
Some mutations associated with Brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions. Those who show more than one cardiac conditions at the same time caused by a single mutation are described as having an &#x27;overlap syndrome&#x27;. An example of an overlap syndrome is Brugada and long QT syndrome (LQT3) caused by a mutation in SCN5A that reduces the peak sodium current but simultaneously leaves a persistent current leak. Brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) caused by a mutation in the PKP2 gene, causing a Brugada ECG pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of ARVC. Another example of an overlap syndrome would be Brugada syndrome and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) caused by a mutation in KCNT1 that leads to an abnormal gain-of-function in potassium channels of neurons and cardiomyocytes.

== Mechanisms ==

The abnormal heart rhythms seen in those with Brugada syndrome are typically dangerous arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, but those with BrS are also more likely to experience rapid heart rates due to less dangerous arrhythmias such as AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia and abnormally slow heart rhythms such as sinus node dysfunction. There are several mechanisms by which the genetic mutations causing this condition might produce these arrhythmias.

Some argue that the main reason these arrhythmias arise is due to abnormally slow electrical conduction in areas of the heart, specifically the right ventricle. The genetic variants associated with BrS support the concept as SCN5A, the gene most commonly associated with the condition, along with SCN10A, SCN1B, SCN2B and SCN3B, all directly affect the sodium current &quot;I&quot;Na. The sodium current is a major contributor to the characteristic flow of electrical charge across the membrane of heart muscle cells that occurs with each heartbeat known as the action potential. &quot;I&quot;Na causes the initial rapid upstroke of the action potential (phase 0), and decreasing the early peak current, as occurs in BrS-associated genetic variants, leads to slowing of the electrical conduction through the heart muscle. This slow conduction allows &#x27;short circuits&#x27; to form, blocking the waves of electrical activity in some areas while allowing the waves to pass in others in a phenomenon known as wavebreak. Given the right circumstances, this wavebreak can allow the waves of electricity to perform a U-turn within the muscle, travelling in the reverse direction before beginning to rapidly circle around a point, referred to as re-entry, and causing an abnormal heart rhythm. Those who support this view (known as the depolarisation hypothesis) argue that conduction slowing may explain why arrhythmias in those with Brugada syndrome tend to occur in middle age, when other factors such as scarring or fibrosis that accompany old age have exacerbated the tendency to conduction slowing caused by the genetic mutation.

Others suggest that the main cause of arrhythmias is a difference in the electrical properties between the inside (endocardium) and outside (epicardium) of the heart (known as the repolarisation hypothesis). The shape of the action potential differs between the epicardium and the endocardium. The action potential in cells from the epicardium shows a prominent notch after the initial spike due to a transient outward current. This notch is far less evident in cells from the endocardium, and the difference between the endocardium and epicardium are most clearly seen in the right ventricle. In those with Brugada syndrome, these differences are increased, creating a brief period within each cardiac cycle when current flows from the endocardium to the epicardium creating the characteristic ECG pattern. The differences in electrical properties between the epi- and endocardium are described as a &#x27;transmural dispersion of repolarisation&quot; which if large enough can lead to electrical impulses becoming blocked in some regions but not others. Once again, this wavebreak can allow the waves of electricity which usually travel in only one direction to instead begin circling around a point as a re-entrant circuit, causing an arrhythmia.

A further factor promoting arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome is changes to the structure of the heart. Whilst the heart of those with Brugada syndrome may look normal, scarring or fibrosis is often seen in particular regions of the heart, specifically the right ventricular outflow tract. As Brugada syndrome can be caused by mutation in many different genes, it is possible that different mechanisms may be responsible for the arrhythmias seen in different patients.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Electrocardiography ===
Brugada syndrome is diagnosed by identifying characteristic patterns on an electrocardiogram. The pattern seen on the ECG includes ST elevation in leads V1-V3 with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) appearance. There may be evidence of a slowing of electrical conduction within the heart, as shown by a prolonged PR interval. These patterns may be present all the time, but may appear only in response to particular drugs (see below), when the person has a fever, during exercise, or as a result of other triggers. The ECG pattern may become more obvious by performing an ECG in which some of the electrodes are placed in different positions from usual, specifically by placing leads V1 and V2 higher up the chest wall in the 1st or 2nd intercostal spaces.

Three forms of the Brugada ECG pattern have historically been described, although the Type 3 pattern is frequently merged with the Type 2 pattern in contemporary practice.
* Type 1 has a coved type ST elevation with at least 2 mm (0.2 mV) J-point elevation and a gradually descending ST segment followed by a negative T-wave.
* Type 2 has a saddle-back pattern with at least 2 mm J-point elevation and at least 0.5 mm elevation of the terminal ST segment with a positive or biphasic T-wave. A type 2 pattern can occasionally be seen in healthy subjects.
* Type 3 has a saddle-back (type 2 like) pattern, with at least 2 mm J-point elevation but less than 1 mm elevation of the terminal ST segment. 
According to current recommendations, only a Type 1 ECG pattern, occurring either spontaneously or in response to medication, can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome as Type 2 and 3 patterns are not infrequently seen in persons without the disease.

=== Provocation testing ===
Some medications, particularly antiarrhythmic drugs that block the cardiac sodium current &quot;I&quot;Na, can reveal a Type 1 Brugada pattern in susceptible people. These drugs can be used to help make a diagnosis in those suspected of having Brugada syndrome (e.g. survivors of an unexplained cardiac arrest, family members of a person with Brugada syndrome) but in whom a diagnostic ECG pattern has not been seen. In these cases, sodium current blocking medications can be given in a controlled environment. The most commonly used drugs for this purpose are ajmaline, flecainide, and procainamide, with some suggestions indicating that ajmaline may be the most effective. Precaution must be taken in giving these medications as there is a small risk of causing abnormal heart rhythms.

=== Genetic testing ===
Genetic testing can be helpful to identify patients with Brugada syndrome, most commonly in family members of a person with Brugada syndrome, but sometimes performed in a person who has died suddenly and unexpectedly. However, interpretation of the results of genetic testing is challenging. In family members who all carry a particular genetic variant associated with Brugada syndrome, some family members may show evidence of Brugada syndrome on their ECGs while others may not. This means that carrying a genetic mutation associated with Brugada syndrome does not necessarily imply that a person is truly affected by the condition. To further complicate matters, many frequently occurring variations in the SCN5A gene do not cause any problems, and therefore genetic variants are sometimes identified in persons with Brugada syndrome that are not truly causing the disease.

=== Other investigations ===
Invasive electrophysiological studies, in which wires are passed through a vein to stimulate and record electrical signals from the heart, can sometimes be used to assess the risk of a person with Brugada syndrome experiencing dangerous abnormal heart rhythms. Risk stratification is also sometimes performed using a signal averaged ECG. Ambulatory ECG monitoring, including implantation of a loop recorder, is sometimes used to assess whether dizziness or faints in a person with Brugada syndrome are due to abnormal heart rhythms or other causes such as vasovagal syncope.

== Treatment ==
The main aim when treating people with Brugada syndrome is to reduce the risk of sudden death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. While some with this condition are at high risk of serious heart rhythm disturbances, others are at much lower risk, meaning that some may require more intensive treatment than others. In addition to treating the person who has Brugada syndrome, it is often important to investigate members of their immediate family to see if they too carry the condition.

=== Lifestyle ===
The first line of treatment, suitable for all people with Brugada syndrome regardless of their risk of arrhythmias, is lifestyle advice. People should be advised to recognise and avoid things that may increase the risk of serious arrhythmias. These include avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, avoiding certain medications, and treating fever promptly with paracetamol. Although the abnormal heart rhythms seen in Brugada syndrome are generally more likely to occur at rest or even during sleep, some people with Brugada syndrome experience arrhythmias during strenuous exercise. Some physicians may therefore advise people with Brugada syndrome that while gentle exercise is helpful, very strenuous exercise should be avoided.

=== Implantable defibrillator ===
In people felt to be at higher risk of sudden cardiac death, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended. These small devices implanted under the skin continuously monitor the heart rhythm. If the device detects a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia it can give the heart a small electric shock, stunning the heart back into a normal rhythm. An ICD can also function as a pacemaker, preventing abnormally slow heart rates that can also occur in people with Brugada syndrome.

Implanting an ICD is a relatively low-risk procedure and is frequently performed as a day case under local anaesthetic. However, complications such as infection, bleeding or unnecessary shocks can occur, which can sometimes be serious. Because of the small risk associated with implanting an ICD, as well as the cost of the devices, ICDs are not recommended for all people with Brugada syndrome but are instead reserved for people deemed at higher risk of sudden cardiac death.

=== Medication ===
Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug that may reduce the chance of serious abnormal heart rhythms occurring in some people with Brugada syndrome. It is most frequently used in people with Brugada syndrome who have an ICD and have experienced several episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias, but may also be used in people at high risk of arrhythmias but in whom an ICD is not appropriate.

Isoprenaline, a drug that has similarities with adrenaline, can be used in an emergency for people with Brugada syndrome who are having frequent repeated life-threatening arrhythmias, known as an &quot;electrical storm&quot;. This drug must be given as a continuous infusion into a vein and therefore is not suitable for long-term use.

=== Catheter ablation ===
A further treatment option for people with Brugada syndrome is radiofrequency catheter ablation. In this procedure, wires are passed through a vein in the leg into the heart, or through a small hole underneath the sternum. These wires are used to find the area of the heart responsible for initiating the arrhythmias. The tip of one of these wires is used to make a series of tiny burns, intentionally damaging the area of abnormal heart muscle that has been causing the problem. Current recommendations suggest that this treatment should be reserved for those with Brugada syndrome who have had repeated shocks from an ICD.

== Epidemiology ==
Between 1 and 30 per 10,000 people are affected by Brugada syndrome. Although those affected are born with the condition, symptoms typically only begin in adulthood. While the rare cases seen in childhood are equally likely to be male or female, in adulthood symptoms occur more frequently in males than females, potentially due to the higher testosterone levels found in men.

Brugada syndrome is more common in people of Asian descent and is the most common cause of sudden death in young males without known underlying cardiac disease in Thailand and Laos. In these countries Brugada syndrome is likely to be responsible for many cases of sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS). Local names vary – in the Philippines the condition has been known as &quot;Bangungut&quot; meaning &quot;a scream followed by sudden death during sleep&quot;, while in Thailand it was known as Lai Tai, and in Japan Pokkuri. Type 1 Brugada ECG patterns are seen more frequently in Asian populations (0–0.36%) than those in Europe (0–0.25%) and the United States (0.03%). Similarly, Type 2 and Type 3 ECG patterns are more prevalent in Asia (0.12–2.23%) than in Europe (0.0–0.6%) or the United States (0.02%).

== History ==
Brugada syndrome is named after the Spanish cardiologists Josep and Pedro Brugada who described the condition in 1992, although the association between the characteristic ECG pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989. Brugada syndrome was described as a cause for the sudden unexplained cardiac death syndrome seen in Thai men in 1997. The first genetic mutations affecting the SCN5A gene associated with the syndrome were identified by their brother Ramon Brugada in 1998, with many more mutations affecting at least 19 genes subsequently identified by others. Studies in the 2000s led to competing theories surrounding the mechanisms by which abnormal heart rhythms were generated. Research into Brugada syndrome is ongoing, identifying new genetic variants, exploring mechanisms of arrhythmias, and searching for better treatments.

== Society and culture ==
* A 1992 segment of the television series &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; profiled the Guamanian Santos family that had lost various members due to unidentified heart issues. Surviving members of the family were ultimately diagnosed with Brugada syndrome.
* The British television soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; featured a storyline in which one of the characters experienced cardiac arrest due to Brugada syndrome.
* In episode 8 of the 8th season of the TV sitcom Scrubs (&quot;My Lawyer&#x27;s in Love&quot;), Perry Cox asks a final question of intern Ed which he is unable to answer. He is subsequently fired. One correct answer to his question is Brugada Syndrome, while Long QT syndrome would have also been an acceptable answer.
* In &quot;Transplant&quot;, Season 2, Episode 2, a patient of South Asian descent is diagnosed with it.
* Season 3 Episode 8 of St. Elsewhere &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; references Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome with a storyline about a Filipino man admitted with tightness in his chest and arm pain who dies in his sleep with his hair turning white.

<text>Heritability is a statistic used in the fields of breeding and genetics that estimates the degree of &quot;variation&quot; in a phenotypic trait in a population that is due to genetic variation between individuals in that population. The concept of heritability can be expressed in the form of the following question: &quot;What is the proportion of the variation in a given trait within a population that is &quot;not&quot; explained by the environment or random chance?&quot;

Other causes of measured variation in a trait are characterized as environmental factors, including observational error. In human studies of heritability these are often apportioned into factors from &quot;shared environment&quot; and &quot;non-shared environment&quot; based on whether they tend to result in persons brought up in the same household being more or less similar to persons who were not.

Heritability is estimated by comparing individual phenotypic variation among related individuals in a population, by examining the association between individual phenotype and genotype data, or even by modeling summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics, particularly in selective breeding and behavior genetics (for instance, twin studies). It is the source of much confusion because its technical definition is different from its commonly-understood folk definition. Therefore, its use conveys the incorrect impression that behavioral traits are &quot;inherited&quot; or specifically passed down through the genes. Behavioral geneticists also conduct heritability analyses based on the assumption that genes and environments contribute in a separate, additive manner to behavioral traits.

==Overview==

Heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation. This is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics. For example, it is incorrect to say that since the heritability of personality traits is about 0.6, that means that 60% of your personality is inherited from your parents and 40% comes from the environment. In addition, heritability can change without any genetic change occurring, such as when the environment starts contributing to more variation. As a case in point, consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence. Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases, causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation, like showing different levels of intelligence. On the other hand, heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases, causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation, like showing more similar levels of intelligence. Heritability increases when genetics are contributing more variation or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation; what matters is the relative contribution. Heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment. High heritability of a trait, consequently, does not necessarily mean that the trait is not very susceptible to environmental influences. Heritability can also change as a result of changes in the environment, migration, inbreeding, or how heritability itself is measured in the population under study. The heritability of a trait should not be interpreted as a measure of the extent to which said trait is genetically determined in an individual.

The extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved. Matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype, making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments. Individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity, which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases. Recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes. However, there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment.

Estimates of heritability use statistical analyses to help to identify the causes of differences between individuals. Since heritability is concerned with variance, it is necessarily an account of the differences between individuals in a population. Heritability can be univariate – examining a single trait – or multivariate – examining the genetic and environmental associations between multiple traits at once. This allows a test of the genetic overlap between different phenotypes: for instance hair color and eye color. Environment and genetics may also interact, and heritability analyses can test for and examine these interactions (GxE models).

A prerequisite for heritability analyses is that there is some population variation to account for. This last point highlights the fact that heritability cannot take into account the effect of factors which are invariant in the population. Factors may be invariant if they are absent and do not exist in the population, such as no one having access to a particular antibiotic, or because they are omnipresent, like if everyone is drinking coffee. In practice, all human behavioral traits vary and almost all traits show some heritability.

==Definition==
Any particular phenotype can be modeled as the sum of genetic and environmental effects:
:Phenotype (&quot;P&quot;) = Genotype (&quot;G&quot;) + Environment (&quot;E&quot;).
Likewise the phenotypic variance in the trait – Var (P) – is the sum of effects as follows:
:Var(&quot;P&quot;) = Var(&quot;G&quot;) + Var(&quot;E&quot;) + 2 Cov(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;E&quot;).
In a planned experiment Cov(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) can be controlled and held at 0. In this case, heritability, formula_1 is defined as
:formula_2

&quot;H&quot;2 is the broad-sense heritability. This reflects all the genetic contributions to a population&#x27;s phenotypic variance including additive, dominant, and epistatic (multi-genic interactions), as well as maternal and paternal effects, where individuals are directly affected by their parents&#x27; phenotype, such as with milk production in mammals.

A particularly important component of the genetic variance is the additive variance, Var(A), which is the variance due to the average effects (additive effects) of the alleles. Since each parent passes a single allele per locus to each offspring, parent-offspring resemblance depends upon the average effect of single alleles. Additive variance represents, therefore, the genetic component of variance responsible for parent-offspring resemblance. The additive genetic portion of the phenotypic variance is known as Narrow-sense heritability and is defined as
:formula_3

An upper case &quot;H&quot;2 is used to denote broad sense, and lower case &quot;h&quot;2 for narrow sense.

For traits which are not continuous but dichotomous such as an additional toe or certain diseases, the contribution of the various alleles can be considered to be a sum, which past a threshold, manifests itself as the trait, giving the liability threshold model in which heritability can be estimated and selection modeled.

Additive variance is important for selection. If a selective pressure such as improving livestock is exerted, the response of the trait is directly related to narrow-sense heritability. The mean of the trait will increase in the next generation as a function of how much the mean of the selected parents differs from the mean of the population from which the selected parents were chosen. The observed &quot;response to selection&quot; leads to an estimate of the narrow-sense heritability (called realized heritability). This is the principle underlying artificial selection or breeding.

===Example===
The simplest genetic model involves a single locus with two alleles (b and B) affecting one quantitative phenotype.

The number of B alleles can be 0, 1, or 2. For any genotype, (&quot;B&quot;i,&quot;B&quot;j), where &quot;B&quot;i and &quot;B&quot;j are either 0 or 1, the expected phenotype can then be written as the sum of the overall mean, a linear effect, and a dominance deviation (one can think of the dominance term as an &quot;interaction&quot; between &quot;B&quot;i and &quot;B&quot;j):

formula_4

The additive genetic variance at this locus is the weighted average of the squares of the additive effects:
:formula_5

where formula_6

There is a similar relationship for the variance of dominance deviations:
:formula_7

where formula_8

The linear regression of phenotype on genotype is shown in Figure 1.

===Assumptions===
Estimates of the total heritability of human traits assume the absence of epistasis, which has been called the &quot;assumption of additivity&quot;. Although some researchers have cited such estimates in support of the existence of &quot;missing heritability&quot; unaccounted for by known genetic loci, the assumption of additivity may render these estimates invalid. There is also some empirical evidence that the additivity assumption is frequently violated in behavior genetic studies of adolescent intelligence and academic achievement.

==Estimating heritability==
Since only &quot;P&quot; can be observed or measured directly, heritability must be estimated from the similarities observed in subjects varying in their level of genetic or environmental similarity. The statistical analyses required to estimate the genetic and environmental components of variance depend on the sample characteristics. Briefly, better estimates are obtained using data from individuals with widely varying levels of genetic relationship - such as twins, siblings, parents and offspring, rather than from more distantly related (and therefore less similar) subjects. The standard error for heritability estimates is improved with large sample sizes.

In non-human populations it is often possible to collect information in a controlled way. For example, among farm animals it is easy to arrange for a bull to produce offspring from a large number of cows and to control environments. Such experimental control is generally not possible when gathering human data, relying on naturally occurring relationships and environments.

In classical quantitative genetics, there were two schools of thought regarding estimation of heritability.

One school of thought was developed by Sewall Wright at The University of Chicago, and further popularized by C. C. Li (University of Chicago) and J. L. Lush (Iowa State University). It is based on the analysis of correlations and, by extension, regression. Path Analysis was developed by Sewall Wright as a way of estimating heritability.

The second was originally developed by R. A. Fisher and expanded at The University of Edinburgh, Iowa State University, and North Carolina State University, as well as other schools. It is based on the analysis of variance of breeding studies, using the intraclass correlation of relatives. Various methods of estimating components of variance (and, hence, heritability) from ANOVA are used in these analyses.

Today, heritability can be estimated from general pedigrees using linear mixed models and from genomic relatedness estimated from genetic markers.

Studies of human heritability often utilize adoption study designs, often with identical twins who have been separated early in life and raised in different environments. Such individuals have identical genotypes and can be used to separate the effects of genotype and environment. A limit of this design is the common prenatal environment and the relatively low numbers of twins reared apart. A second and more common design is the twin study in which the similarity of identical and fraternal twins is used to estimate heritability. These studies can be limited by the fact that identical twins are not completely genetically identical, potentially resulting in an underestimation of heritability.

In observational studies, or because of evocative effects (where a genome evokes environments by its effect on them), G and E may covary: gene environment correlation. Depending on the methods used to estimate heritability, correlations between genetic factors and shared or non-shared environments may or may not be confounded with heritability.

===Regression/correlation methods of estimation===
The first school of estimation uses regression and correlation to estimate heritability.

====Comparison of close relatives====
In the comparison of relatives, we find that in general,

:formula_9

where &quot;r&quot; can be thought of as the coefficient of relatedness, &quot;b&quot; is the coefficient of regression and &quot;t&quot; is the coefficient of correlation.

=====Parent-offspring regression=====
Heritability may be estimated by comparing parent and offspring traits (as in Fig. 2). The slope of the line (0.57) approximates the heritability of the trait when offspring values are regressed against the average trait in the parents. If only one parent&#x27;s value is used then heritability is twice the slope. (This is the source of the term &quot;regression,&quot; since the offspring values always tend to regress to the mean value for the population, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the slope is always less than one). This regression effect also underlies the DeFries–Fulker method for analyzing twins selected for one member being affected.

=====Sibling comparison=====
A basic approach to heritability can be taken using full-Sib designs: comparing similarity between siblings who share both a biological mother and a father. When there is only additive gene action, this sibling phenotypic correlation is an index of &quot;familiarity&quot; – the sum of half the additive genetic variance plus full effect of the common environment. It thus places an upper limit on additive heritability of twice the full-Sib phenotypic correlation. Half-Sib designs compare phenotypic traits of siblings that share one parent with other sibling groups.

=====Twin studies=====

Heritability for traits in humans is most frequently estimated by comparing resemblances between twins. &quot;The advantage of twin studies, is that the total variance can be split up into genetic, shared or common environmental, and unique environmental components, enabling an accurate estimation of heritability&quot;. Fraternal or dizygotic (DZ) twins on average share half their genes (assuming there is no assortative mating for the trait), and so identical or monozygotic (MZ) twins on average are twice as genetically similar as DZ twins. A crude estimate of heritability, then, is approximately twice the difference in correlation between MZ and DZ twins, i.e. Falconer&#x27;s formula &quot;H&quot;2=2(r(MZ)-r(DZ)).

The effect of shared environment, &quot;c&quot;2, contributes to similarity between siblings due to the commonality of the environment they are raised in. Shared environment is approximated by the DZ correlation minus half heritability, which is the degree to which DZ twins share the same genes, &quot;c&quot;2=DZ-1/2&quot;h&quot;2. Unique environmental variance, &quot;e&quot;2, reflects the degree to which identical twins raised together are dissimilar, &quot;e&quot;2=1-r(MZ).

===Analysis of variance methods of estimation===
The second set of methods of estimation of heritability involves ANOVA and estimation of variance components.

====Basic model====
We use the basic discussion of Kempthorne. Considering only the most basic of genetic models, we can look at the quantitative contribution of a single locus with genotype Gi as

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the effect of genotype Gi and formula_12 is the environmental effect.

Consider an experiment with a group of sires and their progeny from random dams. Since the progeny get half of their genes from the father and half from their (random) mother, the progeny equation is

:formula_13

=====Intraclass correlations=====
Consider the experiment above. We have two groups of progeny we can compare. The first is comparing the various progeny for an individual sire (called &quot;within sire group&quot;). The variance will include terms for genetic variance (since they did not all get the same genotype) and environmental variance. This is thought of as an &quot;error&quot; term.

The second group of progeny are comparisons of means of half sibs with each other (called &quot;among sire group&quot;). In addition to the error term as in the within sire groups, we have an addition term due to the differences among different means of half sibs. The intraclass correlation is
:formula_14 ,
since environmental effects are independent of each other.

=====The ANOVA=====
In an experiment with formula_15 sires and formula_16 progeny per sire, we can calculate the following ANOVA, using formula_17 as the genetic variance and formula_18 as the environmental variance:

The formula_19 term is the intraclass correlation between half sibs. We can easily calculate formula_20. The expected mean square is calculated from the relationship of the individuals (progeny within a sire are all half-sibs, for example), and an understanding of intraclass correlations.

The use of ANOVA to calculate heritability often fails to account for the presence of gene–-environment interactions, because ANOVA has a much lower statistical power for testing for interaction effects than for direct effects.

====Model with additive and dominance terms====

For a model with additive and dominance terms, but not others, the equation for a single locus is

:formula_21

where

formula_22 is the additive effect of the ith allele, formula_23 is the additive effect of the jth allele, formula_24 is the dominance deviation for the ijth genotype, and formula_12 is the environment.

Experiments can be run with a similar setup to the one given in Table 1. Using different relationship groups, we can evaluate different intraclass correlations. Using formula_26 as the additive genetic variance and formula_27 as the dominance deviation variance, intraclass correlations become linear functions of these parameters. In general,

:Intraclass correlationformula_28

where formula_16 and formula_30 are found as

formula_31P[ alleles drawn at random from the relationship pair are identical by descent], and

formula_32P[ genotypes drawn at random from the relationship pair are identical by descent].

Some common relationships and their coefficients are given in Table 2.

===Linear mixed models===
A wide variety of approaches using linear mixed models have been reported in literature. Via these methods, phenotypic variance is partitioned into genetic, environmental and experimental design variances to estimate heritability. Environmental variance can be explicitly modeled by studying individuals across a broad range of environments, although inference of genetic variance from phenotypic and environmental variance may lead to underestimation of heritability due to the challenge of capturing the full range of environmental influence affecting a trait. Other methods for calculating heritability use data from genome-wide association studies to estimate the influence on a trait by genetic factors, which is reflected by the rate and influence of putatively associated genetic loci (usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on the trait. This can lead to underestimation of heritability, however. This discrepancy is referred to as &quot;missing heritability&quot; and reflects the challenge of accurately modeling both genetic and environmental variance in heritability models.

When a large, complex pedigree or another aforementioned type of data is available, heritability and other quantitative genetic parameters can be estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or Bayesian methods. The raw data will usually have three or more data points for each individual: a code for the sire, a code for the dam and one or several trait values. Different trait values may be for different traits or for different time points of measurement.

The currently popular methodology relies on high degrees of certainty over the identities of the sire and dam; it is not common to treat the sire identity probabilistically. This is not usually a problem, since the methodology is rarely applied to wild populations (although it has been used for several wild ungulate and bird populations), and sires are invariably known with a very high degree of certainty in breeding programmes. There are also algorithms that account for uncertain paternity.

The pedigrees can be viewed using programs such as Pedigree Viewer , and analyzed with programs such as ASReml, VCE , WOMBAT , MCMCglmm within the R environment or the BLUPF90 family of programs .

Pedigree models are helpful for untangling confounds such as reverse causality, maternal effects such as the prenatal environment, and confounding of genetic dominance, shared environment, and maternal gene effects.

===Genomic heritability===

When genome-wide genotype data and phenotypes from large population samples are available, one can estimate the relationships between individuals based on their genotypes and use a linear mixed model to estimate the variance explained by the genetic markers. This gives a genomic heritability estimate based on the variance captured by common genetic variants. There are multiple methods that make different adjustments for allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium. Particularly, the method called High-Definition Likelihood (HDL) can estimate genomic heritability using only GWAS summary statistics, making it easier to incorporate large sample size available in various GWAS meta-analysis.

== Response to selection ==
In selective breeding of plants and animals, the expected response to selection of a trait with known narrow-sense heritability formula_33 can be estimated using the &quot;breeder&#x27;s equation&quot;:

:formula_34

In this equation, the Response to Selection (R) is defined as the realized average difference between the parent generation and the next generation, and the Selection Differential (S) is defined as the average difference between the parent generation and the selected parents.

For example, imagine that a plant breeder is involved in a selective breeding project with the aim of increasing the number of kernels per ear of corn. For the sake of argument, let us assume that the average ear of corn in the parent generation has 100 kernels. Let us also assume that the selected parents produce corn with an average of 120 kernels per ear. If h2 equals 0.5, then the next generation will produce corn with an average of 0.5(120-100) = 10 additional kernels per ear. Therefore, the total number of kernels per ear of corn will equal, on average, 110.

Observing the response to selection in an artificial selection experiment will allow calculation of realized heritability as in Fig. 4.

Heritability in the above equation is equal to the ratio formula_35 only if the genotype and the environmental noise follow Gaussian distributions.

== Controversies ==

Heritability estimates&#x27; prominent critics, such as Steven Rose, Jay Joseph, and Richard Bentall, focus largely on heritability estimates in behavioral sciences and social sciences. Bentall has claimed that such heritability scores are typically calculated counterintuitively to derive numerically high scores, that heritability is misinterpreted as genetic determination, and that this alleged bias distracts from other factors that researches have found more causally important, such as childhood abuse causing later psychosis. Heritability estimates are also inherently limited because they do not convey any information regarding whether genes or environment play a larger role in the development of the trait under study. For this reason, David Moore and David Shenk describe the term &quot;heritability&quot; in the context of behavior genetics as &quot;...one of the most misleading in the history of science&quot; and argue that it has no value except in very rare cases. When studying complex human traits, it is impossible to use heritability analysis to determine the relative contributions of genes and environment, as such traits result from multiple causes interacting. In particular, Feldman and Lewontin emphasize that heritability is itself a function of environmental variation. However, some researchers argue that it is possible to disentangle the two.

The controversy over heritability estimates is largely via their basis in twin studies. The scarce success of molecular-genetic studies to corroborate such population-genetic studies&#x27; conclusions is the &quot;missing heritability&quot; problem. Eric Turkheimer has argued that newer molecular methods have vindicated the conventional interpretation of twin studies, although it remains mostly unclear how to explain the relations between genes and behaviors. According to Turkheimer, both genes and environment are heritable, genetic contribution varies by environment, and a focus on heritability distracts from other important factors. Overall, however, &quot;heritability&quot; is a concept widely applicable.

<text>Penetrance in genetics is the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant (or allele) of a gene (genotype) that also expresses an associated trait (phenotype). In medical genetics, the penetrance of a disease-causing mutation is the proportion of individuals with the mutation that exhibit clinical symptoms among all individuals with such mutation. For example: If a mutation in the gene responsible for a particular autosomal dominant disorder has 95% penetrance, then 95% of those with the mutation will go on to develop the disease, showing its phenotype, whereas 5% will not.  

Penetrance only refers to whether an individual with a specific genotype exhibits any phenotypic signs or symptoms, and is not to be confused with variable expressivity which is to what extent or degree the symptoms for said disease are shown (the expression of the phenotypic trait). Meaning that, even if the same disease-causing mutation affects separate individuals, the expressivity will vary. 

== Degrees of penetrance ==

=== Complete penetrance ===
If 100% of individuals carrying a particular genotype express the associated trait, the genotype is said to show complete penetrance. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), is an autosomal dominant condition which shows complete penetrance, consequently everyone who inherits the disease-causing variant of this gene will develop some degree of symptoms for NF1. 

=== Reduced penetrance ===
The penetrance is said to be reduced if less than 100% of individuals carrying a particular genotype express associated traits, and is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. &quot;BRCA1&quot; is an example of a genotype with reduced penetrance. By age 70, the mutation is estimated to have a breast cancer penetrance of around 65% in women. Meaning that about 65% of women carrying the gene will develop breast cancer by the time they turn 70.

* Non-penetrance: Within the category of &quot;reduced penetrance,&quot; individuals carrying the mutation without displaying any signs or symptoms, are said to have a genotype that is non-penetrant. For the BRCA1 example above, the remaining 35% which never develop breast cancer, are therefore carrying the mutation, but it is non-penetrant. This can lead to healthy, unaffected parents carrying the mutation on to future generations that might be affected.

== Factors affecting penetrance ==
Many factors such as age, sex, environment, epigenetic modifiers, and modifier genes are linked to penetrance. These factors can help explain why certain individuals with a specific genotype exhibit symptoms or signs of disease, whilst others do not. 

=== Age-dependent penetrance ===
If clinical signs associated with a specific genotype appear more frequently with increasing age, the penetrance is said to be age dependent. Some diseases are non-penetrant up until a certain age and then the penetrance starts to increase drastically, whilst others exhibit low penetrance at an early age and continue to increase with time. For this reason, many diseases have a different estimated penetrance dependent on the age. 

A specific hexanucleotide repeat expansion within the C9orf72 gene said to be a major cause for developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an example of a genotype with age dependent penetrance. The genotype is said to be non-penetrant until the age of 35, 50% penetrant by the age of 60, and almost completely penetrant by age 80. 

=== Gender-related penetrance ===

For some mutations, the phenotype is more frequently present in one sex and in rare cases mutations appear completely non-penetrant in a particular gender. This is called gender-related penetrance or sex-dependent penetrance and may be the result of allelic variation, disorders in which the expression of the disease is limited to organs only found in one sex such as testis or ovaries, or sex steroid-responsive genes. Breast cancer caused by the BRCA2 mutation is an example of a disease with gender-related penetrance. The penetrance is determined to be much higher in women than men. By age 70, around 86% of females in contrast to 6% of males with the same mutation is estimated to develop breast cancer. 

In cases where clinical symptoms or the phenotype related to a genetic mutation are present only in one sex, the disorder is said to be sex-limited. Familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP) caused by a mutation in the LHCGR gene, is an example of a genotype only penetrant in males. Meaning that males with this particular genotype exhibit symptoms of the disease whilst the same genotype is nonpenetrant in females.

=== Genetic modifiers ===
Genetic modifiers are genetic variants or mutations able to modify a primary disease-causing variant&#x27;s phenotypic outcome without being disease causing themselves. For instance, in single gene disorders there is one gene primarily responsible for development of the disease, but modifier genes inherited separately can affect the phenotype. Meaning that the presence of a mutation located on a loci different from the one with the disease-causing mutation, may either hinder manifestation of the phenotype or alter the mutations effects, and thereby influencing the penetrance. 

=== Environmental modifiers ===
Exposure to environmental and lifestyle factors such as chemicals, diet, alcohol intake, drugs and stress are some of the factors that might influence disease penetrance. For example, several studies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, associated with an elevated risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women, have examined associations with environmental and behavioral modifiers such as pregnancies, history of breast feeding, smoking, diet, and so forth.

=== Epigenetic regulation ===

Sometimes, genetic alterations which can cause genetic disease and phenotypic traits, are not from changes related directly to the DNA sequence, but from epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation or histone modifications. Epigenetic differences may therefore be one of the factors contributing to reduced penetrance. A study done on a pair of genetically identical monozygotic twins, where one twin got diagnosed with leukemia and later on thyroid carcinoma whilst the other had no registered illnesses, showed that the affected twin had increased methylation levels of the BRCA 1 gene. The research concluded that the family had no known DNA-repair syndrome or any other hereditary diseases in the last four generations, and no genetic differences between the studied pair of monozygotic twins were detected in the BRCA1 regulatory region. This indicates that epigenetic changes caused by environmental or behavioral factors had a key role in the cause of promotor hypermethylation of the BRCA1 gene in the affected twin, which caused the cancer.    

== Determining penetrance ==
It can be challenging to estimate the penetrance of a specific genotype due to all the influencing factors. In addition to the factors mentioned above there are several other considerations that must be taken into account when penetrance is determined: 

=== Ascertainment bias ===
Penetrance estimates can be affected by ascertainment bias if the sampling is not systematic. Traditionally a phenotype-driven approach focusing on individuals with a given condition and their family members has been used to determine penetrance. However, it may be difficult to transfer these estimates over to the general population because family members may share other genetic and/or environmental factors that could influence manifestation of said disease, leading to ascertainment bias and an overestimation of the penetrance. Large-scale population-based studies, which use both genetic sequencing and phenotype data from large groups of people, is a different method for determining penetrance. This method offers less upward bias compared to family-based studies and is more accurate the larger the sample population is. These studies may contain a healthy-participant-bias which can lead to lower penetrance estimates. 

=== Phenocopies ===
A genotype with complete penetrance will always display the clinical phenotypic traits related to its mutation (taking into consideration the expressivity), but the signs or symptoms displayed by a specific affected individual can often be similar to other unrelated phenotypical traits. Taking into consideration the effect that environmental or behavioral modifiers have, and how they can impact the cause of a mutation or epigenetic alteration, we now have the cause as to how different paths lead to the same phenotypic display. When similar phenotypes can be observed but by different causes, it is called &quot;phenocopies.&quot; Phenocopies is when environmental and/or behavioral modifiers causes an illness which mimics the phenotype of a genetic inherited disease. Because of phenocopies, determining the degree of penetrance for a genetic disease requires full knowledge of the individuals attending the studies, and the factors that may or may not have caused their illness.       

For example, new research on &quot;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (&quot;HCM&quot;)&quot; based on a technique called &quot;Cardiac Magnetic Resonance&quot; (CMR), describes how various genetic illnesses that showcase the same phenotypic traits as HCM, are actually phenocopies. Previously these phenocopies were all diagnosed and treated, thought to arrive from the same cause, but because of new diagnostic methods, they can now be separated and treated more efficiently.

<doc id="155627" wikidata="Q186969" url="?curid=155627" title="Ibuprofen">
<text>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation. This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be taken orally (by mouth) or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour.
Common side effects include heartburn, nausea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. As with other NSAIDs, potential side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding. Long-term use has been associated with kidney failure, and rarely liver failure, and it can exacerbate the condition of patients with heart failure. At low doses, it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however, at higher doses it may. Ibuprofen can also worsen asthma. While its safety in early pregnancy is unclear, it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy, so it is not recommended during that period. Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ibuprofen is a weaker anti-inflammatory agent than other NSAIDs.
Ibuprofen was discovered in 1961 by Stewart Adams and John Nicholson while working at Boots UK Limited and initially marketed as Brufen. It is available under a number of brand names including [[Advil]], Motrin, and [[Nurofen]]. Ibuprofen was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and in 1974 in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 33rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17million prescriptions.

Ibuprofen is used primarily to treat fever (including postvaccination fever), mild to moderate pain (including pain relief after surgery), painful menstruation, osteoarthritis, dental pain, headaches, and pain from kidney stones. About 60% of people respond to any NSAID; those who do not respond well to a particular one may respond to another. A Cochrane medical review of 51 trials of NSAIDs for the treatment of lower back pain found that &quot;NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain&quot;.

It is used for inflammatory diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used for pericarditis and patent ductus arteriosus.

===Ibuprofen lysine===
In some countries, ibuprofen lysine (the lysine salt of ibuprofen, sometimes called &quot;ibuprofen lysinate&quot;) is licensed for treatment of the same conditions as ibuprofen; the lysine salt is used because it is more water-soluble.

In 2006, ibuprofen lysine was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between , who are no more than 32 weeks gestational age when usual medical management (such as fluid restriction, diuretics, and respiratory support) is not effective.

==Adverse effects==

Adverse effects include nausea, heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, gastrointestinal ulceration, headache, dizziness, rash, salt and fluid retention, and high blood pressure.

Infrequent adverse effects include esophageal ulceration, heart failure, high blood levels of potassium, kidney impairment, confusion, and bronchospasm. Ibuprofen can exacerbate asthma, sometimes fatally.

Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Ibuprofen may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to demonstrate the presence of the drug in a person having experienced an anaphylactic reaction, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. A monograph relating ibuprofen plasma concentration, time since ingestion, and risk of developing renal toxicity in people who have overdosed has been published.

In October 2020, the U.S. FDA required the drug label to be updated for all NSAID medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid.

===Cardiovascular risk===
Along with several other NSAIDs, chronic ibuprofen use is correlated with the risk of progression to hypertension in women, though less than for paracetamol (acetaminophen), and myocardial infarction (heart attack), particularly among those chronically using higher doses. On 9 July 2015, the U.S. FDA toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with ibuprofen and related NSAIDs; the NSAID aspirin is not included in this warning. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued similar warnings in 2015.

=== Skin ===
Along with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been associated with the onset of bullous pemphigoid or pemphigoid-like blistering. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been reported to be a photosensitizing agent, but it is considered a weak photosensitizing agent compared to other members of the 2-arylpropionic acid class. Like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen is an extremely rare cause of the autoimmune diseases Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

=== Interactions ===

==== Alcohol ====
Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of stomach bleeding.

==== Aspirin ====
According to the FDA, &quot;ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin, potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention&quot;. Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and a dose of aspirin depends on which is taken first. It would be 30 minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and 8 hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for enteric-coated aspirin. If ibuprofen is taken only occasionally without the recommended timing, though, the reduction of the cardioprotection and stroke prevention of a daily aspirin regimen is minimal.

==== Paracetamol (acetaminophen) ====
Ibuprofen combined with paracetamol is considered generally safe in children for short-term usage.

===Overdose===
Ibuprofen overdose has become common since it was licensed for over-the-counter (OTC) use. Many overdose experiences are reported in the medical literature, although the frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low. Human responses in cases of overdose range from an absence of symptoms to a fatal outcome despite intensive-care treatment. Most symptoms are an excess of the pharmacological action of ibuprofen and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, ear ringing, and nystagmus. Rarely, more severe symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, fast heart rate, atrial fibrillation, coma, liver dysfunction, acute kidney failure, cyanosis, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest have been reported. The severity of symptoms varies with the ingested dose and the time elapsed; however, individual sensitivity also plays an important role. Generally, the symptoms observed with an overdose of ibuprofen are similar to the symptoms caused by overdoses of other NSAIDs.

The correlation between the severity of symptoms and measured ibuprofen plasma levels is weak. Toxic effects are unlikely at doses below 100mg/kg, but can be severe above 400mg/kg (around 150 tablets of 200mg units for an average adult male); however, large doses do not indicate the clinical course is likely to be lethal. A precise lethal dose is difficult to determine, as it may vary with age, weight, and concomitant conditions of the person.

Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal absorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. Most ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys&#x27; excretion of the unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.

===Miscarriage===
A Canadian study of pregnant women suggests that those taking any type or amount of NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen) were 2.4 times more likely to miscarry than those not taking the medications. However, an Israeli study found no increased risk of miscarriage in the group of mothers using NSAIDs.

==Pharmacology==
Ibuprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2, in turn, is converted by other enzymes into various prostaglandins (which mediate pain, inflammation, and fever) and thromboxane A2 (which stimulates platelet aggregation and promotes blood clot formation).

Like aspirin and indomethacin, ibuprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor, in that it inhibits two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs appears to operate mainly through inhibition of COX-2, which decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Inhibition of COX-1 instead would be responsible for unwanted effects on the gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of the individual COX isoforms in the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and gastric damage effects of NSAIDs is uncertain, and different compounds cause different degrees of analgesia and gastric damage.

Ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. The &quot;R&quot;-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the &quot;S&quot;-enantiomer &quot;in vivo&quot;. The &quot;S&quot;-enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer. The &quot;R&quot;-enantiomer is converted through a series of three main enzymes. These enzymes include acyl-CoA-synthetase, which converts the &quot;R&quot;-enantiomer to (−)-&quot;R&quot;-ibuprofen I-CoA; 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase, which converts (−)-&quot;R&quot;-ibuprofen I-CoA to (+)-&quot;S&quot;-ibuprofen I-CoA; and hydrolase, which converts (+)-&quot;S&quot;-ibuprofen I-CoA to the &quot;S&quot;-enantiomer. In addition to the conversion of ibuprofen to the &quot;S&quot;-enantiomer, the body can metabolize ibuprofen to several other compounds, including numerous hydroxyl, carboxyl and glucuronyl metabolites. Virtually all of these have no pharmacological effects.

Unlike most other NSAIDs, ibuprofen also acts as an inhibitor of Rho kinase and may be useful in recovery from spinal cord injury. Another unusual activity is inhibition of the sweet taste receptor.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After oral administration, peak serum concentration is reached after 12 hours, and up to 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. The majority of ibuprofen is metabolized and eliminated within 24 hours in the urine; however, 1% of the unchanged drug is removed through biliary excretion.

==Chemistry==

Ibuprofen is practically insoluble in water, but very soluble in most organic solvents like ethanol (66.18g/100mL at 40°C for 90% EtOH), methanol, acetone and dichloromethane.

The original synthesis of ibuprofen by the Boots Group started with the compound isobutylbenzene. The synthesis took six steps. A modern, greener technique with fewer waste byproducts for the synthesis involves only three steps and was developed in the 1980s by the Celanese Chemical Company. The synthesis is initiated with the acylation of isobutylbenzene using the recyclable Lewis acid catalyst hydrogen fluoride. The following catalytic hydrogenation of isobutylacetophenone is performed with either Raney nickel or palladium on carbon to lead into the key-step, the carbonylation of 1-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethanol. This is achieved by a PdCl2(PPh3)2 catalyst, at around 50 bar of CO pressure, in the presence of HCl (10%). The reaction presumably proceeds through the intermediacy of the styrene derivative (acidic elimination of the alcohol) and (1-chloroethyl)benzene derivative (Markovnikow addition of HCl to the double bond).

===Stereochemistry===
Ibuprofen, like other 2-arylpropionate derivatives such as ketoprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, contains a stereocenter in the α-position of the propionate moiety. The product sold in pharmacies is a racemic mixture of the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;R&quot;-isomers. The &quot;S&quot; (dextrorotatory) isomer is the more biologically active; this isomer has been isolated and used medically (see dexibuprofen for details).

The isomerase enzyme, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, converts (&quot;R&quot;)-ibuprofen into the (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer.

(S)-ibuprofen, the eutomer, harbors the desired therapeutic activity. The inactive (R)-enantiomer, the distomer, undergoes a unidirectional chiral inversion to offer the active (S)-enantiomer. That is, when the ibuprofen is administered as a racemate the distomer is converted &quot;in vivo&quot; into the eutomer while the latter is unaffected.

==History==
Ibuprofen was derived from propionic acid by the research arm of Boots Group during the 1960s. The name is derived from the 3 functional groups: isobutyl (ibu) propionic acid (pro) phenyl (fen). Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin. The molecule was discovered and synthesized by a team led by Stewart Adams, with a patent application filed in 1961. Adams initially tested the drug as treatment for his hangover. In 1985, Boots&#x27; worldwide patent for ibuprofen expired and generic products were launched.

The medication was launched as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the United Kingdom in 1969, and in the United States in 1974. Later, in 1983 and 1984, it became the first NSAID (other than aspirin) to be available over-the-counter (OTC) in these two countries. Boots was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Technical Achievement in 1985 for the development of the drug.

In November 2013, work on ibuprofen was recognized by the erection of a Royal Society of Chemistry blue plaque at Boots&#x27; Beeston Factory site in Nottingham, which reads:

and another at BioCity Nottingham, the site of the original laboratory, which reads:

==Availability and administration==

Ibuprofen was made available by prescription in the United Kingdom in 1969 and in the United States in 1974.

&quot;Ibuprofen&quot; is the International nonproprietary name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), Australian Approved Name (AAN) and United States Adopted Name (USAN). In the United States, it has been sold under the brand-names Motrin and Advil since 1974 and 1984, respectively. Ibuprofen is commonly available in the United States up to the FDA&#x27;s 1984 dose limit OTC, rarely used higher by prescription.

In 2009, the first injectable formulation of ibuprofen was approved in the United States, under the brand name Caldolor.

Ibuprofen can be taken orally (by mouth) (as a tablet, a capsule, or a suspension) and intravenously.

==Research==
Ibuprofen is sometimes used for the treatment of acne because of its anti-inflammatory properties, and has been sold in Japan in topical form for adult acne. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen may be useful in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up). NSAIDs are of unclear utility in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Ibuprofen has been associated with a lower risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and may delay or prevent it. Aspirin, other NSAIDs, and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had no effect on the risk for Parkinson&#x27;s. In March 2011, researchers at Harvard Medical School announced in &quot;Neurology&quot; that ibuprofen had a neuroprotective effect against the risk of developing Parkinson&#x27;s disease. People regularly consuming ibuprofen were reported to have a 38% lower risk of developing Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but no such effect was found for other pain relievers, such as aspirin and paracetamol. Use of ibuprofen to lower the risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in the general population would not be problem-free, given the possibility of adverse effects on the urinary and digestive systems.

Some dietary supplements might be dangerous to take along with ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, but , more research needs to be conducted to be certain. These supplements include those that can prevent platelet aggregation, including ginkgo, garlic, ginger, bilberry, dong quai, feverfew, ginseng, turmeric, meadowsweet (&quot;Filipendula ulmaria&quot;), and willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.); those that contain coumarin, including chamomile, horse chestnut, fenugreek and red clover; and those that increase the risk of bleeding, like tamarind.

Ibuprofen lysine is sold for rapid pain relief; given in the form of its lysine salt, absorption is much quicker (35 minutes for the salt compared to 90120 minutes for ibuprofen). However, a clinical trial with 351 participants in 2020, funded by Sanofi, found no significant difference between ibuprofen and ibuprofen lysine concerning the eventual onset of action or analgesic efficacy.

<text>Tanita Tikaram (born 12 August 1969) is a British pop/folk singer-songwriter. She achieved chart success with the singles &quot;Twist in My Sobriety&quot; and &quot;Good Tradition&quot; from her 1988 debut album, &quot;Ancient Heart&quot;.

==Background==
Tikaram was born in Münster, West Germany, the daughter of an Indo-Fijian British Army officer, Pramod Tikaram, and a Sarawakian Malay mother, Fatimah Rohani. Because of her father&#x27;s military career, she spent her early life in Germany before moving to Basingstoke, Hampshire, England in her early teens. She is the younger sister of the actor Ramon Tikaram and the great-niece of Sir Moti Tikaram, who was the first Lord Chief Justice of an independent Fiji and the world&#x27;s longest-serving national ombudsman. She attended Queen Mary&#x27;s College in Basingstoke.

==Career==
Tikaram started singing in nightclubs while she was still a teenager and came to the attention of WEA Records. Her debut album, &quot;Ancient Heart&quot;, produced by Rod Argent and Peter Van Hooke, was released in September 1988 when she was 19 years old. The album&#x27;s first two singles, &quot;Good Tradition&quot; and &quot;Twist in My Sobriety&quot;, became top 10 hits around Europe and the album sold around four million copies worldwide. Both the single &quot;Twist In My Sobriety&quot; and Tikaram herself were nominated at the 1989 Brit Awards for Best British Single and Female Artist categories respectively.

A quick succession of albums for WEA – &quot;The Sweet Keeper&quot; (1990), &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Angel&quot; (1991), and &quot;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&quot; (1992) – did not achieve the same commercial success, with each album selling fewer than the previous one. Her 1992 album &quot;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&quot;, which was the first Tikaram fully produced herself, did not chart at all.

Taking a break from the music industry and moving to San Francisco, Tikaram returned in 1995 with the album &quot;Lovers in the City&quot;, which received better reviews than her previous albums and achieved better sales. Still, it was her last studio album for WEA and her contract was finished in 1996 with the release of the compilation album &quot;The Best of Tanita Tikaram&quot;.
Signed to Mother Records, Tikaram released &quot;The Cappuccino Songs&quot; in 1998, and then retired for several years from the music industry, reappearing in 2005 with the album &quot;Sentimental&quot;, which was released on a French label. In 2012, she released &quot;Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot;, her first album in seven years. After 2013, she continued touring the UK and Europe.

&quot;Closer to the People&quot; was released on 11 March 2016. In December 2015, Tikaram released a videoclip for the song &quot;Food On My Table&quot;, although she stated this was not the first single of the album. The first single, &quot;Glass Love Train&quot;, was released on 22 January 2016.

She performed as a special guest at Glastonbury Festival&#x27;s Abbey Extravaganza in September 2021.

==Personal life==
Tikaram moved from Basingstoke to the Primrose Hill area of north London when she became successful and, as of 2016, still lived there.

In an interview with lesbian magazine &quot;Diva&quot;, published in 2017, Tikaram said that she had been in a relationship with multimedia artist Natacha Horn for the past five years, who had produced several of her videos.

<text>MxPx () is an American punk rock band from Bremerton, Washington, formed in 1992 as Magnified Plaid. As of 2016, current members include Mike Herrera (bass guitar, lead vocals), Yuri Ruley (drums, percussion), Tom Wisniewski (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Chris Adkins (rhythm guitar, backing vocals). The band&#x27;s discography includes twelve studio albums, four EPs, four compilation albums, a live album, a VHS tape, a DVD and 20 singles. A number of the group&#x27;s releases have charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Christian Albums.

== History ==

=== Early start (1992) ===
MxPx was formed in Bremerton, Washington in July 1992 by Mike Herrera, Yuri Ruley, and Andy Husted, who were 15 years old at the time, playing their first show in Herrera&#x27;s parents&#x27; backyard. Herrera and Ruley were classmates at Central Kitsap High School in Silverdale, Washington, and Husted attended South Kitsap High School in Port Orchard, Washington.

The group was originally called Magnified Plaid, which was a tribute to Husted&#x27;s fascination with plaid shirts, but did not fit on the band&#x27;s posters. Consequently, the name was abbreviated to M.P. on show posters. Yuri Ruley, who used Xs in place of periods, made the posters for the band, resulting in the four-letter moniker.

=== Tooth &amp; Nail years (1993–1997) ===
MxPx recorded a four-song 7-inch record with Aaron Sprinkle in Seattle, who played it for Brandon Ebel of Tooth &amp; Nail Records. The band then played a showcase for the label in 1993 in Herrera&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage. The band&#x27;s first major album, &quot;Pokinatcha&quot; (1994), was released while the band members were still in high school. The album, though classified as Christian punk, incorporated the quick styles of hardcore punk, and is composed of influence from skate punk and punk underground. Their debut album is characterized by their raw punk sound, catchy rhythm, and classic punk three-chord guitar style.

Guitarist Andy Husted soon left the band and was replaced by a friend, Tom Wisniewski. Despite only knowing power chords on guitar, Wisniewski was willing to be in the band. MxPx released two further albums with Tooth &amp; Nail: &quot;Teenage Politics&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Life in General&quot; in 1996, which features the single &quot;Chick Magnet&quot; and artwork by the artist Coop.

=== A&amp;M years (1997–2004) ===

In 1997, MxPx signed a deal with A&amp;M Records. This record deal saw the re-release of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Life in General&quot;. MxPx then released two more studio albums, the first, &quot;Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo&quot; was released in 1998. The album peaked at No. 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold on January 27, 2000, by the RIAA. The band first appeared on Kevin Lyman’s Vans Warped Tour in 1997 alongside Blink-182, The Descendents and more, and went on the full tour in 1998 alongside Bad Religion, Rancid, NOFX, and many others.

In 1999, they released &quot;At the Show&quot;, their first live album recorded on August 24, 1998, at the 930 Club in Washington, DC and on August 25, 1998, at TLA in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the time of the recording, the band was touring in support of &quot;Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo&quot; as well as the B-sides collection &quot;Let it Happen&quot;, also released in 1998.

&quot;The Ever Passing Moment&quot; was released in May 2000 via A&amp;M Records. The band gained critical recognition for this album and landed a slot supporting the Offspring and Cypress Hill on the &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; tour. &quot;Responsibility&quot; proved to be a radio hit, peaking at #24 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The video, directed by The Malloys, features the band messing around and causing mayhem while caddying at a golf course, and also includes an appearance by &quot;Cheers&quot; star George Wendt. The song was featured in the Daria Television Movie &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;.

The band once again joined the cross-country Vans Warped Tour in 2002 alongside Bad Religion, NOFX, Reel Big Fish, and more.

The band&#x27;s version of the song &quot;Scooby Doo, Where Are You?&quot; is in the soundtrack of the 2002 movie &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. MxPx toured alongside New Found Glory and Good Charlotte on the annual Honda Civic Tour in May and June 2003. The group&#x27;s studio album &quot;Before Everything &amp; After,&quot; was released by A&amp;M in 2003. The album achieved the band&#x27;s highest ever chart position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 51.

On August 20, 2004, MxPx joined My Chemical Romance, Pennywise, and “many bands from previous tours” to perform at the Vans Warped Tour 10-year celebration show in Foxborough, Massachusetts at the Gillette Stadium near Boston.

The group provided the song &quot;The Empire&quot; for &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Songs&quot;, which won the Gospel Music Association 2005 Dove Award for Special Event Album of the Year.

=== SideOneDummy years (2005–2006) ===

In 2005 MxPx was dropped by A&amp;M, signed with SideOneDummy Records and then released their seventh full-length album &quot;Panic&quot; in June. &quot;Panic&quot; turned out to be a breakthrough moment for the band when their single &quot;Heard That Sound&quot; proved a radio hit. It also featured the Blink-182/+44 singer-bassist Mark Hoppus on &quot;Wrecking Hotel Rooms.&quot; &quot;Panic&quot; heightened the return of the band&#x27;s skate punk/punk-rock roots sound. In support of Panic, MxPx joined the 2005 Vans Warped Tour alongside supergroup Transplants, Fall Out Boy, The Offspring, and more.

In September 2006, MxPx and the City of Bremerton started a marketing effort revolving around the band&#x27;s song &quot;Move to Bremerton&quot;. The band was given keys to the city by Mayor Cary Bozeman in recognition of the group&#x27;s contributions to the city.

MxPx spent the majority of 2005 and 2006 touring in support of the band&#x27;s 7th album &quot;Panic&quot;. On November 21, 2006, Tooth &amp; Nail Records re-released &quot;Let It Happen&quot;, an earlier rarities compilation, in a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; which included a bonus DVD featuring 12 music videos, new artwork, and two new songs. &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;, MxPx&#x27;s second rarities album, was released on Side One Dummy Records on October 24, 2006. The album consists of many previously unreleased songs, re-recorded B-sides and acoustic demos.

=== Tooth &amp; Nail and Rock City (2007–2017) ===

MxPx released the full-length album &quot;Secret Weapon&quot; in 2007, the band&#x27;s first release on its original label Tooth &amp; Nail since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Life in General&quot;. The album debuted at No. 76 on the Billboard 200. The album&#x27;s sound was a shift back to the group&#x27;s original punk-rock stylings.

The band appeared on the &quot;Thank You Billy Graham&quot; tribute song, album, and video documentary, respectively.

In 2009, the band released a six-song EP entitled &quot;Left Coast Punk EP&quot;, which was the first record released by Rock City Recording Company, MxPx&#x27;s own record label. Also in 2009, the group released a Christmas album, titled &quot;Punk Rawk Christmas&quot;. In late 2009, Mike Herrera teamed up with frontman of The Ataris, Kris Roe, and Chris Wilson, the drummer of The Summer Obsession and formerly of Good Charlotte, for the MxPx All Stars tour in Japan and Malaysia.

The band released a documentary entitled &quot;Both Ends Burning&quot; on December 1, 2011. In addition, Mike, Tom, and Yuri were working on their ninth studio album. On December 19, 2011, the band announced that the album would be called &quot;Plans Within Plans&quot;. It was released on April 3, 2012. In 2012, drummer Yuri Ruley and guitarist Tom Wisniewski announced their retirement from touring. After a brief hiatus, they both returned as full-time members in 2015 and continue to tour with the band today.

In honor of the 20th anniversary &quot;Life in General&quot;, the band released a re-recorded version free of charge for a limited time on September 18, 2016. It can now be found as &quot;Life in General 2.0&quot; on music streaming platforms. In 2017 it was added to the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums of All Time&quot; article, landing the esteemed record at No. 27.

=== Self-titled album, &quot;Southbound to San Antonio&quot;, and &quot;Find A Way Home&quot; (2018–present) ===
After MxPx fulfilled their contractual obligations with former labels, the band moved to return to their DIY roots, taking back control of their music and lengthy catalog of music. 

On March 29, 2018, the band announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund their tenth full-length studio album. The self-titled album, &quot;MxPx&quot;, was released July 25, 2018. Before the release of the album, a music video for &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; came out at the end of June 2018. The album was performed live on Facebook on the release date.

After its release, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; was added to the relaunched 2020 edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+ 2 Remastered. According to ScreenRant, MxPx&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; joined new and returning artists for the famous soundtrack that made tracks such as Goldfinger&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; a mainstay.

MxPx went back on tour in 2019 and early 2020, selling out self-booked and promoted tours nationwide. An audio recording at their San Antonio show in early 2020 was captured for a future live album release.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band were unable to perform live for much of 2020 and 2021. On April 1, 2020, Mike Herrera announced the Life in Quarantine live streams every Friday on the group&#x27;s official Facebook page throughout April and May. The streams included live performances, Herrera answering fan questions, and more. After concluding the Life in Quarantine series on May 29, 2020, the group took songs from the live recordings and released Life in Quarantine-The Collection on July 3, 2020. The group followed up the collection with a brand new single, &quot;Fever Dream&quot;, which was released on July 16, 2020.
On October 6, 2020, the group announced they would be starting a new live performance experience separated into various rounds. The first round of the series titled &quot;Between This World and the Next&quot; premiered on October 16, 2020, in which the band performed a full livestream concert. The group hosted several rounds of &quot;Between This World and the Next&quot; which featured new tracks, custom set lists, and fan questions.

On March 11, 2021, the band announced the release of their exclusive MxPx Box Collection featuring 10 full-length albums, original album artwork, bonus inserts and album commentary, zoetropic slipmat, hardcover book, and durable outer case. The box set was made available for pre-order on March 19, 2021, and immediately sold out units on the same day. To thank fans for instantly selling out the exclusive box set, the group organized and announced the release of their new single &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep Waiting&quot; and a free live show hosted on April 16, 2021.

Of &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep Waiting&quot;, Herrera told SPIN Magazine in an interview, &quot;[‘Can&#x27;t Keep Waiting’] morphed a little bit as we played it on the livestreams, and people kept asking when it was coming out, so we finally were like, ‘OK, we should probably record this thing.’&quot;

In July 2021, MxPx teamed up with Kalie Wolfe of rising band RIVALS to release an upbeat track titled, &quot;Say Yes&quot;, which was placed on Five Guys’ streaming station and later featured on Fortnite Radio.

On November 12, 2021, MxPx surprise dropped their new live album &quot;Southbound to San Antonio&quot;. The album features 23 of the band&#x27;s live performances from their last in-person show before the pandemic on February 29, 2020. Following the release of Southbound to San Antonio, the group announced that they would be returning to the stage for two special performances on April 1, 2022, in Anaheim, California at House of Blues and the following night on April 2, 2022, in Phoenix, Arizona at the Marquee Theatre.

During a live streaming concert on December 23, 2022, Mike announced that a new album will be out in 2023. On July 6, the band officially announced on their social media platforms that their next album &quot;Find A Way Home&quot;, would release August 25, with pre-orders up for sale on their website. The lead single, “Stay Up All Night”, was dropped on July 21, with the music video releasing a day prior. Since the release of the album, the band has played several virtual live performances across social media, taking over pages for bands such as Bowling for Soup, Goldfinger, and Less Than Jake.

==Arthur==
Arthur is a side project of MxPx featuring all three members of MxPx and their former tech assistant Neil Hundt, who now techs for Pearl Jam. The group released an EP called &quot;Loneliness Is Bliss&quot; in 1999. The band members went by their middle names: Arthur (where the band name came from), Edmund, Zane, and Alexander (Mike Herrera, Tom Wisniewski, Yuri Ruley, and Neil Hundt, respectively). After over ten years since the inception of &quot;Loneliness Is Bliss&quot;, the band released a full-length album called &quot;Watch the Years Crawl By&quot; on December 7, 2010. In 2013 those involved in the project announced that they would be discontinuing the project.

== Musical style and influences ==

MxPx is usually described as a pop-punk band, but has also been labeled as skate punk and punk rock. Originally a punk rock band, by the rise of popularity of pop punk in the late 1990s and early 2000s the group leaned more towards a more pop-punk sound. Albums like &quot;The Ever Passing Moment&quot; and &quot;Before Everything and After&quot; were criticized by some fans for its pop-punk style. MxPx&#x27;s influences include Descendents, NOFX, Bad Religion, Rancid, Social Distortion, All, the Clash, the Dead Milkmen, The Who, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, and the Ramones.

Many of the band&#x27;s early releases touch on Christian themes and placed them in the front of the Christian punk scene. However, by 2012, &quot;Christian punk&quot; was a genre classification that the band was trying to distance themselves from. As of 2015, MxPx singer Mike Herrera has said he is no longer Christian. When asked about the topic he stated &quot;...do I believe in god? I&#x27;m not sure. Do I believe in this exact religion? No I don&#x27;t.&quot;

<text>The University of York (abbreviated as or York for post-nominals) is a public collegiate research university in York, England. Established in 1963, the university has expanded to more than thirty departments and centres, covering a wide range of subjects.

South-east of the city of York, the university campus is about in size. The original campus, Campus West, incorporates the York Science Park and the National Science Learning Centre, and its wildlife, campus lakes and greenery are prominent. In May 2007 the university was granted permission to build an extension to its main campus, on arable land just east of the nearby village of Heslington. The second campus, Campus East, opened in 2009 and now hosts five colleges and three departments as well as conference spaces, a sports village and a business start-up &#x27;incubator&#x27;. The institution also leases King&#x27;s Manor in York city centre. The university had a total income of £515.5 million in 2023–24 of which £100.4 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £379.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;York Financial Statement 23/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

York was one of the first of the plate glass universities established in the 1960s, and runs a distinctive collegiate system, which currently consists of eleven colleges. The eleventh college, David Kato, opened in 2022. The university is a member of regional research groups including the N8 Group and White Rose University Consortium as well as the national Russell Group.

==History==
===Origins===
The first petition for the establishment of a university in York was presented to James I in 1617. In 1641, a second petition was drawn up but was not delivered due to the English Civil War in 1642. A third petition was created in 1647 but was rejected by Parliament. In the 1820s there were discussions about the founding of a university in York, but this did not come to fruition due to the founding of Durham University in 1832. In 1903, F. J. Munby and the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, among others, proposed a &quot;Victoria University of Yorkshire&quot;.

Oliver Sheldon a director of Rowntree&#x27;s and co-founder of York Civic Trust, was a driving force behind the campaign to found the university.

===Establishment===
John Bowes Morrell was the driving force behind the university&#x27;s establishment. York accepted its first students the year of Morrell&#x27;s death, 1963, opening with 216 undergraduates, 14 postgraduates, and 28 academic and administrative staff. The university started with six departments: Economics, Education, English, History, Mathematics, Politics. At the time, the university consisted of three buildings, principally the historic King&#x27;s Manor in the city centre and Heslington Hall, which has Tudor foundations and is in the village of Heslington on the edge of York. A year later, work began on purpose-built structures on the Heslington Campus, which now forms the main part of the university.

Baron James of Rusholme, the university&#x27;s first Vice-Chancellor, said of the University of York that &quot;it must be collegiate in character, that it must deliberately seek to limit the number of subjects and that much of the teaching must be done via tutorials and seminars&quot;. Due to the influence of Graeme Moodie, founding head of the Politics Department, students are involved in the governance of the university at all levels, and his model has since been widely adopted.

York&#x27;s first two Colleges, Derwent and Langwith, were founded in 1965, as was the University of York Library. These were the first residential colleges. They were followed by Alcuin and Vanbrugh in 1967 and Goodricke in 1968. In 1972 this was followed by Wentworth College.

The university was noted for its inventive approach to teaching. It was known for its early adoption of joint honours degrees which were often very broad such as history and biology. It also took an innovative approach to social science introducing a five-year-long degree in the subject.

===Expansion===
After 1972 the construction of Colleges ceased until 1990 with the foundation of James College. Initially James was intended to be a postgraduate only college. However, the university began to expand rapidly, almost doubling in size from 4,300 to 8,500 students. In 1993, therefore it was decided that the college should become open to undergraduates. The expansion of student numbers also resulted in the creation of more accommodation by the university, which was named &#x27;Halifax Court&#x27;; the members of Halifax Court were members of other colleges, however, soon formed their own Junior Common Room. In 2002, Halifax Court was made a full college of the university and was renamed Halifax College.

In 2003, the university set out plans to create a campus for 5,000 additional students, and to introduce a number of new subjects such as law and dentistry. For a number of years, the university&#x27;s expansion plans were limited by planning restrictions. The City of York planning conditions stipulate that only 20% of the land area may be built upon, and the original campus was at full capacity.

In 2004, plans were finalised for a 117 hectare extension to the campus, initially called Heslington East, designed to mirror the existing Heslington West campus. They are now known as Campus East and Campus West. The plans set out that the new campus would be built on arable land between Grimston Bar park and ride car park and Heslington village. The land was removed from the green belt especially for the purpose of extending the university. After a lengthy consultation and a public inquiry into the proposals in 2006, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government gave the go-ahead in May 2007. In May 2008 the City of York planners approved the design for the residential college, Goodricke. In &quot;The Press&quot; on 28 July 2008, Shepherd Construction was named as the preferred contractor for the Goodricke College buildings. The proposal included landscaping the whole area, constructing a lake with marsh borders, planting light woodland and many specimen trees, and maximising biodiversity.

Construction began in 2008, with the first buildings, including Goodricke college, coming into use in October 2009. It was decided that rather than create a new college that an existing college should be moved. Goodricke College was selected for this and moved onto the new campus in 2009 with James taking over its building on Campus West. Goodricke was officially opened by the Duke of York in April 2010. In 2012, the same process took place with Langwith moving to Campus East and Derwent taking over its previous buildings. In 2014 Campus East saw the establishment of the ninth college, named Constantine College after the Roman emperor Constantine the Great, who was proclaimed Augustus in York in 306 AD.

Work began in December 2019 to build two new colleges on Campus East. These will comprise around 1,400 new student bedrooms as well as new social spaces. The university says that &quot;development has been designed to optimise the beautiful landscape and will be built with respect for the existing ecological diversity around the lake&quot;.

==Campus==
===Campus West===

In 1964, work began on the campus facilities in the grounds of Heslington Hall. The marshy land was drained, the winding lake that dominates the campus was built, and the area was landscaped. The original buildings were designed by architects Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Sir Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, with input also from the Vice-Chancellor Lord James, Professor Patrick Nuttgens and the Registrar, John West-Taylor. The new structures were assembled using the CLASP system of prefabricated construction, hence York&#x27;s inclusion among the so-called plate glass universities. The buildings are connected by numerous covered walkways and bridges. Most of the university&#x27;s arts departments occupy premises in the college buildings, while many of the science departments have their own buildings.

====Central Hall====

A landmark building is Central Hall, a half-octagonal concert hall used for convocations and examinations, as well as theatrical and musical performances. It is a Grade II-listed building, as is the West campus landscape. It has played host to the Wailers, George Melly, Soft Machine, Pink Floyd, and Paul McCartney. Performances by big-name acts have been rarer at the university following a 1985 the Boomtown Rats concert, during which the cover of the orchestra pit was damaged. A ban on pop performances, and in particular dancing, in Central Hall was imposed by the university, although it has occasionally been relaxed. Central Hall is still used for classical concerts and since a rock concert was held there on 13 March 2010 it has been available again for full booking. Public concerts are regularly held in the music department&#x27;s Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall, the Arthur Sykes Rymer Auditorium and in some of the colleges.

====University library====

The University of York Library opened in 1965 two years after the university itself opened. The building was designed by Robert Mathews, Johnson-Marshall and partners. The primary site of library comprises a series of three linked buildings to the north side of the University of York&#x27;s West Campus: the JB Morrell, the Raymond Burton, and the Fairhurst buildings. Originally just consisting of the JB Morrell, in 2003 the Raymond Burton library was added to the site, designed by Leach Rhodes Walker architects and houses both the Humanities research reading room and the Borthwick institute for archives. The Raymond Burton Library was also recently nominated for a SCONUL Design award. In 2012 the Library had a £20 million renovation incorporating the neighbouring Fairhurst building, now housing the majority of libraries study spaces including the postgraduate study lounge.

A secondary site of the library is located in the King&#x27;s Manor building.

====Grounds====
The campus lake is the largest plastic-bottomed lake in Europe. The decision by Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to give the university a lake had two motivations: one, to give the university a distinct image and identity while also creating areas to foster community; and two, more practically to create a drainage basin for the relatively flat agricultural site as it was feared the construction of the new buildings would increase the risk of flooding. The lake has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild waterfowl, including greylag, Canada, barnacle and snow geese, coots, moorhens and large numbers of ducks, including mallards, tufted ducks, and common pochards. There is also a growing population of black swans and a few great crested grebe. Grey herons have also been sighted on the lake. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence. On occasions the lake has been called Scullion&#x27;s Lake. However, the use of this name varies, which challenges it&#x27;s authenticity. It has been applied to the whole lake, to the Derwent fish pond, and to the end of the lake around Wentworth. No historic use of the term has been found to add support to any of these terms use.

Other parts of the campus support a large rabbit population. On at least one occasion, students have been cautioned by the university for hunting rabbits.

Campus West has both indoor and outdoor sports facilities, including an all-weather AstroTurf pitch and County standard cricket pitch. A large, tent-like structure allows for indoor sport, gymnastics and dance.

In 2013 it was reported that the university was planning a major redevelopment of Campus West, which would also result in the creation of a tenth college.

====Heslington Hall====
Heslington Hall is a Grade II* listed rebuilt manor house consisting of a central nine-bay two-storey block with attics and two two-storey wings at each end. It is built of brick in English bond with sandstone ashlar dressings. The original Manor house was constructed in 1568 for Sir Thomas Eynns, the Secretary and Keeper of the Seal to the Council of the North; and his wife Elizabeth.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, the house was vacated by the family, allowing it to be taken over by the Royal Air Force as the headquarters of No. 4 Group RAF, part of RAF Bomber Command. The hall was not re-occupied by the family after the war. In 1955 the hall was given Grade II* listed building status. When the university was founded, Sir Bernard Feilden supervised its conversion into the administrative headquarters of the university. The hall and University were at that time in the East Riding of Yorkshire although they are now part of the City of York.

====Science Park and on-campus organisations====

Next door to the university on the York Science Park are organisations including the Higher Education Academy, the Digital Preservation Coalition, the National Non-Food Crops Centre, the York Neuroimaging Centre, the York JEOL Nanocentre, the IT office of VetUK, the UK head office of AlphaGraphics, the accelerated mass spectrometry specialists Xceleron Ltd, and the Leeds, York &amp; North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce. The Science Park is also home to some parts of the School of Physics, Engineering and Technology. The Department of Electronic Engineering&#x27;s Recording studios are located in the park and in summer 2011, the Department of Physics moved its Plasma Physics and Fusion Group to the Genesis buildings in the Science Park at the newly created York Plasma Institute, and moved its Physics of Life group to the Science Park in winter 2019. York Conferences are located on the university campus.

===King&#x27;s Manor===
Located in York city centre, about from the main Heslington West campus, the historic King&#x27;s Manor began as the Abbot&#x27;s House of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey and went on to become the headquarters of the Council of the North following the dissolution of the monasteries. For many years after 1966, the King&#x27;s Manor housed the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies (IoAAS). The IoAAS was a postgraduate institute primarily specialising in providing mid-career education for architects and others. In particular, it became well known for its one-year Diploma Course in Conservation Studies. It is now home to the Archaeology, Medieval Studies and Eighteenth Century Studies departments, and is regularly used by other related departments such as History. It has a public restaurant and is used for art displays.

Not far from the King&#x27;s Manor is the Minster Library, in Dean&#x27;s Park. Students and staff of the university are able to use the Minster Library, which shares staff and cataloguing with the main university library, and holds the huge collection of early books belonging to the Dean and Chapter of York Minster.

The university announced in 2024 that it would stop using King&#x27;s Manor for teaching and research due to the cost of maintaining the property and problems with accessibility, with the departments moving to the main Heslington campus.

===Campus East===
Several departments have purpose-built facilities on Campus East, including Law and the York Management School. In October 2010, several departments moved into new facilities on Campus East including the Department of Theatre, Film and Television and the Department of Computer Science.

Campus East also includes the York Sports Village and a new purpose built £1.1 million Olympic-sized outdoor velodrome, the only one in Yorkshire or the North East of England.

===Other properties===
The university owns several other properties including Catherine House, Constantine House, 54 Walmgate, and Fairfax House. The university publishes an annual code of practice for student accommodation to help students living off-campus.

==Organisation and administration==
===Colleges===
York is a collegiate university and has eleven colleges. All colleges have equal status, and each has its own constitution. Each college is governed by its own College Council, which contains a combination of university staff and elected student members and is chaired by a Senior College Fellow. The day-to-day running of the colleges is managed by administrative staff from the university&#x27;s Student Life and Wellbeing unit, with all the colleges coordinated by an administrative Senior Colleges Manager. In 2023, the university substituted the academic role of College Principal for the unrenumerated post of Senior College Fellow. Most colleges have a Junior Common Room for undergraduate students, which is managed by the elected Junior Common Room Committee. Some colleges retain a Graduate Common Room for postgraduate students, as well as a Senior Common Room, which is managed by elected representatives of the college&#x27;s academic and administrative members. Other colleges however combine undergraduate and postgraduate representation together into student associations. The colleges are deliberately assigned undergraduates, postgraduate students and staff from a wide mixture of disciplines. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; noted, &quot;The colleges are tight-knit communities within the university and enjoy a healthy rivalry.&quot; The colleges share practical features of the halls of residence of other UK universities, as well as the traditional Oxbridge and Durham colleges. In recent years, the university has built three new colleges on Campus East. The ninth college was founded in 2014 and was named Constantine after the Roman emperor Constantine I, who was proclaimed Augustus in York in 306 AD. The tenth was founded in 2021 and named after Anne Lister. The eleventh was founded in 2022 and named after David Kato.

==Student activities==
===Representation===
The students&#x27; union is the University of York Students&#x27; Union and is referred to as YUSU. Its membership is currently the entire student population of the university. In 2008 YUSU was able to open its first Union-run licensed venue The Courtyard. In addition to the students&#x27; union, there is the Graduate Students&#x27; Association (GSA), the Students&#x27; Union for postgraduate students, which follows normal SU functions such as representing postgraduates on university committees and Council.

Each college has its own JCRC or students&#x27; association which provide a variety of services, including college events and student welfare services; they also organise the Freshers&#x27; Fortnight activities in their college.

Non-partisan political societies are well represented at the university, with the York Student Think Tank – which produces research in collaboration with national policy organisations such as IPPR, New Generation Society – an informal debating society, and The York Union Society – which competes in inter-varsity debating tournaments against other universities. There are also very active party political societies on campus with the University of York Labour Club, the University of York Liberal Democrat Society, the University of York Conservative and Unionist Association and the University of York Green Party Society; campaigning on issues both on and off campus, as well as organising debates and talks by high-profile speakers. There is also a branch of People and Planet, which campaigns on environmental and ethical issues.

Provisions for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBT) students at the university are divided among two distinct organisations. YUSU LGBTQ+ is a liberation network built into the students&#x27; union, which represents LGBTQ+ students by campaigning for issues on campus, offering welfare &amp; support and running events for all LGBTQ+ students to attend, such as cabaret evenings and chilled mixers. The LGBTQ Social Society also organises social events aimed at LGBTQ+ students and their friends. While remaining separate, these two groups generally have strong links to each other as well as links from the student network to the Staff LGBTI+ Matters Forum, which offers largely similar provision to staff members of the university.

===Student Union bars and venues===

The university&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union run a number of bars and venues across both campuses, namely The Courtyard, The Kitchen, The Glasshouse, The Lounge and Vanbrugh Arms. Additionally, the Union also ran a venue known as D-Bar (located in Derwent College) but had to temporarily close it due to the COVID-19 pandemic. D-Bar later reopened as a cafe during refurbishments of Derwent, before fully reopening in 2022. Shortly after reopening as a bar, D-Bar was hosting an LGBTQ+ event when it was gate crashed by Derwent College Rugby team which was called out by the then-LGBTQ+ Officers, Matt Rogan and Daniel Loyd.

In 2020, Patrick O&#x27;Donnell, the president of YUSU, unveiled a new, purpose built venue named The Forest which would be used for a wide variety of events. Later that year, Brian Terry, the then Student Activities Officer, had the venue used as part of a week long Freshers Fair, advertising societies and clubs to students in a Covid-safe environment.

In 2021, The Lakeside Tap was opened to replace The Forest but was closed the next year.

===Media===

York Student Television (YSTV) was founded at the university in 1967 and is England&#x27;s oldest student television station. YSTV once held the world record for longest continuous television broadcast under a single director. It was named the best student television station at the 2012, 2014 and 2019 NaSTA Awards. The University of York Filmmaking Society was a student-run filmmaking group; between 1999 and 2014 its members made two feature films and many shorts, some of which were shown at national film festivals.

University Radio York (URY) is the oldest independent radio station in the United Kingdom and winner of the Student Radio Awards Best Station Award 2020.

Nouse was established in 1964 and was 2005 NUS/Mirror Student paper of the year and 2009 NUS Best Student Media. It has also won multiple Guardian Student Newspaper awards throughout the past decade, for both its pioneering website and outstanding individual journalists. Its rival newspaper, Vision, was named Guardian Student Newspaper of the Year for three consecutive years between 2002 and 2004—the only time this has occurred in the 27-year history of the prestigious awards—and won it again in 2007. In 2011, it won the award for a fifth time, making it the most awarded student newspaper in the United Kingdom. It also won Best Small Budget Publication at the 2006 NUS/Mirror National Student Media Awards.

The Lemon Press, York&#x27;s satire magazine, was launched in 2009, in both print and online formats. In 2010 it won the NUS Award for Best Student Media. The Yorker is an online publication set up by students as an independent company in 2007; it was nominated for the Guardian Student media awards after running for only a few months.

York Student Cinema (YSC), operating since the late 1960s, show around 30 films a term using a professional 35 mm projector, an industry standard Christie CP2000 digital projector, and a full size CinemaScope screen in one of the largest rooms on campus. It has won the BFFS film society of the year award several times and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016.

In 2019, the History of Art department began publishing &quot;Aspectus&quot;, an annual research journal edited by current postgraduates within the department.

===Sports===
The university teams play in black-and-gold colours. York is a member of British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) and has 65 teams participating. At the end of the 2013/14 BUCS season York came 38th out of 145 participating institutions.

As well as BUCS every summer term the university take part in the Roses Tournament, a sports competition against Lancaster University, which is the largest inter-university tournament in Europe. The venue of the event alternates each year between York and Lancaster, and involves numerous sports clubs, including the conventional (football, hockey) and the more unusual (octopush, ultimate frisbee). York are leading Lancaster with 27 wins to 26, with one draw in 1974.

The university has also previously also been in the White Rose Varsity Tournament. This started in 2005 against York&#x27;s other university, York St John University. York won all six of the tournaments held. In 2011 attempts to try and increase the competitiveness of the competition saw York St John replaced by the University of Hull. York won all 3 tournaments against Hull, which resulted in it being scrapped in 2013.

In 2014 a new tournament, &quot;College Varsity&quot;, was created, which was held between the colleges of the University of York and the colleges of Durham University.

===Arts===

The University of York Music Society and the University of York Drama Society are two of the largest student societies on campus; with each having performances and/or concerts every week during term. Central Hall Musical Society performs a number of shows and showcases every year.

Other performing societies include the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, PantSoc who stage a student-written pantomime three times a year, and York ComedySoc, one of the most active comedy societies in the UK, putting on a show every week along with workshops in stand-up, improv and sketch writing/acting. ComedySoc sends two shows to the Edinburgh Fringe each year: The Shambles, ComedySoc&#x27;s in-house improv comedy troupe and The Dead Ducks, ComedySoc&#x27;s in-house sketch comedy troupe. Both troupes perform throughout the year on campus and in/around York and have received critical acclaim for their shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.

===Long Boi===

Long Boi was a 70-cm tall Indian Runner-Mallard Duck cross that lived by Derwent College, and became an unofficial mascot to the university. In 2022 students campaigned to erect a life-sized statue of Long Boi due to his &#x27;cultural significance&#x27; and &#x27;contribution to student life&#x27;. In response, the union president said that he would explore possible options to construct a statue. In spring 2023, after several months without a confirmed sighting, the university announced that Long Boi was presumed to be dead.

A fundraising campaign raised enough money to commission a life-size bronze statue of Long Boi by sculptor Neil Mason. The statue was formally unveiled by BBC Radio Presenter Greg James in The University of York&#x27;s Central Hall on 26 September 2024.

<doc id="155638" wikidata="Q2344707" url="?curid=155638" title="The Crying of Lot 49">
<text>The Crying of Lot 49 is a novella by the American author Thomas Pynchon. It was published on April27, 1966, by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. The shortest of Pynchon&#x27;s novels, the plot follows Oedipa Maas, a young Californian woman who begins to embrace a conspiracy theory as she possibly unearths a centuries-old feud between two mail distribution companies. One of these companies, Thurn and Taxis, actually existed, operating from 1806 to 1867, and was the first private firm to distribute postal mail. Like most of Pynchon&#x27;s writing, &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; is often described as postmodernist literature. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the book in its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.

==Plot==
In the mid-1960s, Oedipa Maas lives a fairly comfortable life in a northern Californian village, despite her lackluster marriage with Mucho Maas, a rudderless radio jockey and ephebophile, and her sessions with Dr. Hilarius, an unhinged German psychotherapist who tries to medicate his patients with LSD. One day, Oedipa learns of the death of an ex-lover, Pierce Inverarity, an incredibly wealthy and powerful real-estate mogul from the Los Angeles area, who has nominated her as the executor of his estate. Oedipa goes to meet Inverarity&#x27;s lawyer, a former child actor named Metzger, and they begin an affair, which fascinates a local teenage rock band, the Paranoids, who begin following the pair voyeuristically. At a bar, Oedipa notices the graffiti symbol of a muted post horn with the label &quot;W.A.S.T.E.&quot; and she chats with Mike Fallopian, a right-wing historian and critic of the postal system, who claims to use a secret postal service.

It emerges that Inverarity had Mafia connections, illicitly attempting to sell the bones of forgotten U.S. World War II soldiers for use as charcoal to a cigarette company. One of the Paranoids&#x27; friends mentions that this strongly reminds her of a Jacobean revenge play she recently saw called &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. Intrigued by the coincidence, Oedipa and Metzger attend a performance of the play, which briefly mentions the name &quot;Tristero&quot;. After the show, Oedipa approaches the play&#x27;s director and star, Randolph Driblette, who deflects her questions about the mention of the unusual name. After seeing a man scribbling the post horn symbol, Oedipa reconnects with Mike Fallopian, who tells her he suspects a conspiracy. This is supported when watermarks of the muted horn symbol are discovered hidden on Inverarity&#x27;s private stamp collection. The symbol appears to be a muted variant of the coat of arms of Thurn and Taxis, an 18th-century European postal monopoly that suppressed all opposition, including Trystero (or Tristero), a competing postal service that was defeated but possibly driven underground. Based on the symbolism of the mute, Oedipa thinks that Trystero exists as a countercultural secret society with unknown goals.

She researches an older censored edition of &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, which confirms that Driblette indeed made a conscious choice to insert the &quot;Tristero&quot; line. She seeks answers through a machine claimed to have psychic abilities but the experience is awkward and unsuccessful. As she feverishly wanders the Bay Area, the muted post horn symbol appears in many random places. Finally, a nameless man at a gay bar tells her that the symbol simply represents an anonymous support group for people with broken hearts. Oedipa witnesses people referring to and using mailboxes disguised as regular waste bins marked with &quot;W.A.S.T.E.&quot; (later suggested to be an acronym for &quot;We Await Silent Tristero&#x27;s Empire&quot;). Even so, Oedipa sinks into paranoia, wondering if Trystero exists or if she is merely overthinking a series of false connections.

Fearing for her sanity, Oedipa makes an impromptu visit to Dr. Hilarius, only to find him having lost his own mind, firing a gun randomly and raving madly about his days as a Nazi medical intern at Buchenwald. She helps the police subdue him, only to return home to find that her husband Mucho has lost his mind in his own way, having become addicted to LSD. Oedipa consults an English professor about &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, learns that Randolph Driblette has mysteriously committed suicide, and is left pondering whether Trystero is simply a prolonged hallucination, a historical plot, or an elaborate practical joke that Inverarity arranged for her before his death. Oedipa goes to an auction of Inverarity&#x27;s possessions and waits on the bidding of lot 49, which contains the stamp collection with the muted horn symbol. Having learned that a particular bidder is interested in the stamps, she hopes to discover if this person will be a representative of the Trystero secret society.

==Critical reception==
Critics have read the book as both an &quot;exemplary postmodern text&quot; and a parody of postmodernism. Contemporary reviews were mixed, with many critics comparing it unfavourably to Pynchon&#x27;s first novel &quot;V.&quot;. A reviewer in &quot;Time&quot; described the novel as &quot;a metaphysical thriller in the form of a pornographic comic strip&quot;. In a positive &quot;The New York Times&quot; review, Richard Poirier wrote &quot;Pynchon&#x27;s technical virtuosity, his adaptations of the apocalyptic-satiric modes of Melville, Conrad, and Joyce, of Faulkner, Nathanael West, and Nabokov, the saturnalian inventiveness he shares with contemporaries like John Barth and Joseph Heller, his security with philosophical and psychological concepts, his anthropological intimacy with the off-beat – these evidences of extraordinary talent in the first novel continue to display themselves in the second&quot;.

===Self-reception===
Pynchon described, in the prologue to his 1984 collection &quot;Slow Learner&quot;, an &quot;up-and-down shape of my learning curve&quot; as a writer and specifically does not believe he maintained a &quot;positive or professional direction&quot; in the writing of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, &quot;which was marketed as a &#x27;novel&#x27;, and in which I seem to have forgotten most of what I thought I&#x27;d learned up until then&quot;.

==Allusions in the book==

As ever with Pynchon&#x27;s writing, the labyrinthine plots offer myriad cultural references. Knowing these references allows for a much richer reading of the work. J. Kerry Grant wrote &quot;A Companion to the Crying of Lot 49&quot; to catalogue these references but it is neither definitive nor complete.

=== Maxwell&#x27;s demon ===
After being prompted to by Stanley Koteks, Oedipa seeks out John Nefastis and his invention coined the &#x27;Nefastis Machine&#x27;. This machine attempts to serve as a perpetual motion machine, utilizing the theory of Maxwell&#x27;s demon to sort molecules within a closed chamber. Nefastis explains that a telepathic operator or &#x27;sensitive&#x27; is necessary to work the invention by looking into a photo of James Clerk Maxwell.

Despite Nefastis&#x27; attempt at invention, the second law of thermodynamics and its statement regarding entropy cannot be disproven, as the system gains entropy by way of measurement by the demon. This alludes to a famous retort of Maxwell&#x27;s demon by Szilard and Brillouin which sought to establish congruence between entropy in information theory and thermodynamics. Scholars have pointed to the entropic nature and indeterminacy of the novel as a symbol which invalidates the demon&#x27;s existence.

Oedipa&#x27;s role within &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; can be likened to Maxwell&#x27;s demon—a force which seeks to reverse the flow of entropy on the town of San Narciso. Just as the demon is hypothesized to sort unpredictable, random molecules to create order from disorder, Oedipa seeks to make sense of the mystery of Trystero. San Narciso as a city is often described as &#x27;still&#x27; or &#x27;silent&#x27;; a place where life has stagnated, one cultural microcosm of many within the United States. The concept of Trystero acts as a promise to reverse the entropic regress that America has fallen into, as an &#x27;anarchist miracle&#x27;.

=== &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; ===
The connection between Oedipus and the protagonist of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, Oedipa Maas, tends to align with one of two interpretations within literature: that of the Sophoclean tragedy &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, and that of the Oedipus Complex, a psychoanalytical theory pioneered by Sigmund Freud. Comparing the novel with &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, some scholars argue that both Oedipus and Oedipa serve as solvers of riddles—Oedipus in answering the Sphinx&#x27;s riddle and Oedipa in attempting to uncover the mystery behind Trystero. However, critics of this interpretation claim that these riddles share little topical symmetry.

Supporters of the Freudian interpretation tend to point towards Pynchon&#x27;s heavy borrowing of Greek literature and extensive use of allusions as part of the cyclic, incestuous nature of recycling within literature. Alternatively, the homogeneity of society around San Narciso as a result of the convergence of entropy has also been pointed to as having an incestuous nature.

=== &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; ===

Upon arrival in San Narciso, Oedipa stops to check in at the Echo Courts Motel, which sports a painted sheet metal likeness of the nymph Echo from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. This figure of Echo is holding a flower, suggested to be &quot;Narcissus poeticus&quot;, alike to the flower Narcissus turns into within the myth of Echo and Narcissus. Additionally, the pool at Echo Courts Motel is described as flat-surfaced, possibly symbolizing the pool in which Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection.

Scholars have drawn parallels between Oedipa and both Narcissus and Echo. Oedipa is initially suggested to bear a self-proclaimed resemblance to Echo, and it has been suggested the longing for answers regarding Trystero mirrors Echo&#x27;s desire of Narcissus. Oedipa also recurringly encounters mirrors throughout the novel, initially failing to find herself in the bathroom mirror at Echo Courts, which could point to the beginning of her paranoia. She additionally recounts a dream in which she is making love to her husband at the motel, only to awake to herself staring back at her through a mirror, an act of self-love by way of a mirror, alluding to the fate of Narcissus within &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

===&quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;===
Pynchon devotes a significant part of the book to a play-within-a-book, a detailed description of a performance of an imaginary Jacobean revenge play, involving intrigues between Thurn und Taxis and Trystero. Like &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, based on &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot; that William Shakespeare placed within &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the events and atmosphere of &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (by the fictional Richard Wharfinger) mirror those transpiring around them. In many aspects it resembles a typical revenge play, such as &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; by Thomas Kyd, &quot;Hamlet&quot; by Shakespeare and plays by John Webster and Cyril Tourneur.

===The Beatles===

&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; was published shortly after Beatlemania and the &quot;British invasion&quot; that took place in the United States and other Western countries. Internal context clues indicate that the novel is set in the summer of 1964, the year in which &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was released. Pynchon makes a wide variety of Beatles allusions. Most prominent are the Paranoids, a band composed of cheerful marijuana smokers whose lead singer, Miles, is a high-school dropout described as having a &quot;Beatle haircut&quot;. The Paranoids all speak with American accents but sing in English ones; at one point, a guitar player is forced to relinquish control of a car to his girlfriend because he cannot see through his hair. It is not clear whether Pynchon was aware of the Beatles&#x27; nickname for themselves, &quot;Los Para Noias&quot;; since the novel is replete with other references to paranoia, Pynchon may have chosen the band&#x27;s name for other reasons.

Pynchon refers to a rock song, &quot;I Want to Kiss Your Feet&quot;, an adulteration of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. The song&#x27;s artist, Sick Dick and the Volkswagens, evokes the names of such historical rock groups as the El Dorados, the Edsels, the Cadillacs and the Jaguars (as well as an early name the Beatles themselves used, &quot;Long John and the Silver Beetles&quot;). &quot;Sick Dick&quot; may also refer to Richard Wharfinger, author of &quot;that ill, ill Jacobean revenge play&quot; known as &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. The song&#x27;s title also keeps up a recurring sequence of allusions to Saint Narcissus, a 3rd-century bishop of Jerusalem.

Late in the novel, Oedipa&#x27;s husband, Mucho Maas, a disc jockey at Kinneret radio station KCUF, describes his experience of discovering the Beatles. Mucho refers to their early song &quot;She Loves You&quot;, as well as hinting at the areas the Beatles were later to explore. Pynchon wrote,

Whenever I put the headset on now,&quot; he&#x27;d continued, &quot;I really do understand what I find there. When those kids sing about &#x27;She loves you,&#x27; yeah well, you know, she does, she&#x27;s any number of people, all over the world, back through time, different colors, sizes, ages, shapes, distances from death, but she loves. And the &#x27;you&#x27; is everybody. And herself. Oedipa, the human voice, you know, it&#x27;s a flipping miracle.&quot; His eyes brimming, reflecting the color of beer. &quot;Baby,&quot; she said, helpless, knowing of nothing she could do for this, and afraid for him. He put a little clear plastic bottle on the table between them. She stared at the pills in it, and then understood. &quot;That&#x27;s LSD?&quot; she said.

===Vladimir Nabokov===
Pynchon, like Kurt Vonnegut, was a student at Cornell University, where he probably at least audited Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s Literature 312 class. (Nabokov had no recollection of him but Nabokov&#x27;s wife Véra recalls grading Pynchon&#x27;s examination papers, thanks only to his handwriting, &quot;half printing, half script&quot;.) The year before Pynchon graduated, Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Lolita&quot; was published in the United States. &quot;Lolita&quot; introduced the word &quot;nymphet&quot; to describe a girl between the ages of nine and fourteen, sexually attractive to the hebephilic main character, Humbert Humbert and it was also used in the novel&#x27;s adaptation to cinema in 1962 by Stanley Kubrick. In the following years, mainstream usage altered the word&#x27;s meaning to apply to older girls. Perhaps appropriately, Pynchon provides an early example of the modern &quot;nymphet&quot; usage entering the . Serge, the Paranoids&#x27; teenage counter-tenor, loses his girlfriend to a middle-aged lawyer. At one point he expresses his angst in song:

:What chance has a lonely surfer boy
:For the love of a surfer chick,
:With all these Humbert Humbert cats
:Coming on so big and sick?
:For me, my baby was a woman,
:For him she&#x27;s just another nymphet.

===Remedios Varo===
Early in &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, Oedipa recalls a trip to an art museum in Mexico with Inverarity, during which she encountered a painting, &quot;Bordando el Manto Terrestre&quot; (&quot;Embroidering the Earth’s Mantle&quot;) by Remedios Varo. The 1961 painting shows eight women inside a tower, where they are presumably held captive. Six maidens are weaving a tapestry that flows out of the windows and seems to constitute the world outside of the tower. Oedipa&#x27;s reaction to the tapestry gives us some insight into her difficulty in determining what is real and what is a fiction created by Inverarity for her benefit,

She had looked down at her feet and known, then, because of a painting, that what she stood on had only been woven together a couple thousand miles away in her own tower, was only by accident known as Mexico, and so Pierce had taken her away from nothing, there&#x27;d been no escape.

<text>The Rendon Group is a public relations firm headed by John Rendon.

==History==

===John Rendon===
John Rendon began his career in Democratic Party politics with George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign. He later served as the Executive Director and Political Director of the Democratic National Committee; managed President Carter&#x27;s 1980 Democratic convention in New York; and subsequently worked as Director of Scheduling and Advance for President Carter&#x27;s reelection campaign. In 1985, Rendon began working for clients internationally. The company was founded in 1981 and offers consulting and training in Strategic Communications, Crisis Communications, Public Affairs, Political Consulting, Media Monitoring and Analysis, Media Training, Media Relations, Opinion Polling, Social Media, and New Business Risk Analysis. According to the Rendon Group website, the company has worked in over 98 countries to date.

===Iraq===

A number of publications have reported on The Rendon Group&#x27;s work with the CIA in the 1990s. After allegation of inflated staff salaries, the CIA conducted an audit in 1995. ABC reported that the company spent $23 million in the first year of work. The CIA has not commented as to whether the claims were accurate.

According to a freelance translator who helped translate some of the radio broadcasts into Arabic, the program was poorly run. &quot;No one in-house spoke a word of Arabic,&quot; he says. The scripts, he adds, were often ill-conceived. &quot;Who in Iraq is going to think it&#x27;s funny to poke fun at Saddam&#x27;s mustache,&quot; the student notes, &quot;when the vast majority of Iraqi men themselves have mustaches?&quot;

Writing in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, Seymour Hersh said the Rendon Group was &quot;paid close to a hundred million dollars by the CIA&quot; for its work with the INC.&quot; Journalist James Bamford reported in the Rolling Stone that Rendon came up with the name for the INC and helped install Ahmed Chalabi as its head. Francis Brooke, adviser to Ahmed Chalabi and former employee of The Rendon Group said, “Those arguments are false. Mr. Rendon was a consultant. The Iraqi National Congress was founded independently by Dr. Chalabi, and Mr. Rendon provided consulting services during that period.”

The Rendon Group replied on its website to Mr. Bamford&#x27;s article, saying, “For the record, the Rendon Group (TRG) had no role whatsoever in making the case for the Iraq war, here at home or internationally. Mr. Bamford&#x27;s contention to the contrary is flatly untrue. TRG reviews open source media reports for the Department of Defense and analyzes and charts positive and negative trends very much the same way public opinion researchers analyze polling data. Unable to find facts that support his thesis, Mr. Bamford relies on false information and mischaracterization to create his story.” The post goes on to address numerous factual errors in Bamford&#x27;s article.

===OSI===
The Office of Strategic Influence, or OSI, was a department created by the United States Department of Defense on October 30, 2001.
According to a DOD IG Report, The Rendon Group never had any connection to OSI aside from a 60-day deployment. In February 2002, OSI provided a government contracting technical representative to assist in managing a work order given to The Rendon Group that was funded by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence for the Joint Information Operation Task Force. This Task Order funded a 60-day deployment of two media advisors to Indonesia to support the embassy&#x27;s public diplomacy and opinion research. Later, DOD publicly disbanded the OSI following a backlash when Pentagon officials said the new office would engage in &quot;black&quot; disinformation campaigns, of which The Rendon Group was not a part.

===Afghanistan===
In December, 2005, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that the Rendon Group received $1.4 million in 2004 to help the Afghan government with media relations. According to the paper, President Karzai and Zalmay Khalilzad, then the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, were unhappy with the work. The article quoted Jeff Raleigh, who helped oversee Rendon in Kabul for the U.S. Embassy and later left the U.S. Embassy in September, as saying the contract was &quot;a rip-off of the U.S. taxpayer&quot;. Later Jeff Raleigh&#x27;s Afghan supervisor said Jeff wanted full control of The Rendon Group and was out of his bound. Furthermore, the same official, Ambassador Daod, in a signed letter said that The Rendon Group did a great job and really helped his office. Former Pentagon spokesman Richard McGraw said, &quot;I think they did an excellent job in a tough circumstance.&quot; The company continued its working relationship with the Pentagon, who funded an additional $3.9 million project to create a media team for anti-narcotics programs. Advocates say Rendon helps fight propaganda from Islamic fundamentalists and strategize messaging for their clients. Critics say the Pentagon&#x27;s use of media firms such as Rendon blurs the line between public relations and propaganda. 

In late August 2009 &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; reported that the Rendon Group was employed by US Forces Afghanistan to provide “news analysis and media assessment”, including profiling journalists writing on the war.[5] Stars and Stripes alleged that one of their reporters had been denied embedding access for refusing to highlight positive coverage. According to Air Force Capt. Elizabeth Mathias, a public affairs officer with U.S. Forces Afghanistan in Kabul, the reports were designed so that, “We know with whom we’re working.” She said that [DOD] had not “denied access to anyone because of what may or may not come out of their biography.” However DOD has moved from a “positive”, “neutral”, “negative” scale to one of accuracy. The work was allegedly intended to analyze how effectively the military is communicating its message and familiarize US Forces with the journalists covering the war, these claims however seem to be contradicted by the actual profiles (which Stars and Stripes obtained physical copies of) which included no mention on accuracy but instead were not only focused on if journalist past work could be said to be positive, neutral or negative, but also included ways in which these journalist could be manipulated to produce positive spin. This manipulation was paid for by taxpayers.

<text>A voivodeship ( ) or voivodate is the area administered by a voivode (governor) in several countries of central and eastern Europe. Voivodeships have existed since medieval times and the area of extent of voivodeship resembles that of a duchy in western medieval states, much as the title of voivode was equivalent to that of a duke. Other roughly equivalent titles and areas in medieval Eastern Europe included ban (bojan, vojin or bayan) and banate.

In a modern context, the word normally refers to one of the provinces () of Poland. , Poland has 16 voivodeships.

==Terminology==
A voi(e)vod(e) (literally, &quot;leader of warriors&quot; or &quot;war leader&quot;, equivalent to the Latin &quot;Dux Exercituum&quot;) was originally a military commander who stood, in a state&#x27;s structure, next to the ruler. Later the word came to denote an administrative official.

Words for &quot;voivodeship&quot; in various languages include the ; the ; the ; the Bulgarian: &quot;voivoda&quot; (войвода); the Serbian: &quot;vojvodina&quot; (војводина), &quot;vojvodstvo&quot; (војводство) or &quot;vojvodovina&quot; (војводовина); the ; the (&quot;vajаvodstva&quot;); the . Some of these words, or variants of them, may also be used in English.

Named for the word for &quot;voivodeship&quot; is the autonomous Serbian province of Vojvodina.

Though the word &quot;voivodeship&quot; (other spellings are &quot;voievodship&quot; and &quot;voivodship&quot;) appears in English dictionaries such as the OED and Webster&#x27;s, it is not in common general usage, and voivodeships in Poland and elsewhere are frequently referred to as &quot;provinces&quot;. Depending on context, historic voivodeships may also be referred to as &quot;duchies&quot;, &quot;palatinates&quot; (the Latin word &quot;palatinatus&quot; was used for a voivodeship in Poland), &quot;administrative districts&quot; or &quot;regions&quot;.

==Historical voivodeships==
===in Southeastern Europe===

In the territory of modern Romania and Moldova, the regions of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania were formerly voivodeships. The region of Maramureș, now split between Romania and Ukraine, also used to be its own voivodeship, the Voivodeship of Maramureș.

Historical voivodeships in the territory of modern Serbia include the Voivodeship of Salan (9th–10th centuries), Voivodeship of Sermon (11th century), and Voivodeship of Syrmia of Radoslav Čelnik (1527–1530). A voivodeship called Serbian Vojvodina was established in 1848–1849; this was transformed into the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat, a land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1849 to 1860. This is the origin of the name of the present-day Serbian autonomous province of Vojvodina.

<doc id="155650" wikidata="Q44793182" url="?curid=155650" title="Fluoride">
<text>Fluoride () is an inorganic, monatomic anion of fluorine, with the chemical formula (also written ), whose salts are typically white or colorless. Fluoride salts typically have distinctive bitter tastes, and are odorless. Its salts and minerals are important chemical reagents and industrial chemicals, mainly used in the production of hydrogen fluoride for fluorocarbons. Fluoride is classified as a weak base since it only partially associates in solution, but concentrated fluoride is corrosive and can attack the skin.

Fluoride is the simplest fluorine anion. In terms of charge and size, the fluoride ion resembles the hydroxide ion. Fluoride ions occur on Earth in several minerals, particularly fluorite, but are present only in trace quantities in bodies of water in nature.

== Nomenclature ==
Fluorides include compounds that contain ionic fluoride and those in which fluoride does not dissociate. The nomenclature does not distinguish these situations. For example, sulfur hexafluoride and carbon tetrafluoride are not sources of fluoride ions under ordinary conditions.

The systematic name &quot;fluoride&quot;, the valid IUPAC name, is determined according to the additive nomenclature. However, the name &quot;fluoride&quot; is also used in compositional IUPAC nomenclature which does not take the nature of bonding involved into account.
&quot;Fluoride&quot; is also used non-systematically, to describe compounds which release fluoride upon dissolving. Hydrogen fluoride is itself an example of a non-systematic name of this nature. However, it is also a trivial name, and the preferred IUPAC name for &quot;fluorane&quot;.

==Occurrence==

Fluorine is estimated to be the 13th-most abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust and is widely dispersed in nature, entirely in the form of fluorides. The vast majority is held in mineral deposits, the most commercially important of which is fluorite (CaF2). Natural weathering of some kinds of rocks, as well as human activities, releases fluorides into the biosphere through what is sometimes called the fluorine cycle.

===In water===

Fluoride is naturally present in groundwater, fresh and saltwater sources, as well as in rainwater, particularly in urban areas. Seawater fluoride levels are usually in the range of 0.86 to 1.4 mg/L, and average 1.1 mg/L (milligrams per litre). For comparison, chloride concentration in seawater is about 19 g/L. The low concentration of fluoride reflects the insolubility of the alkaline earth fluorides, e.g., CaF2.

Concentrations in fresh water vary more significantly. Surface water such as rivers or lakes generally contains between 0.01 and 0.3 mg/L. Groundwater (well water) concentrations vary even more, depending on the presence of local fluoride-containing minerals. For example, natural levels of under 0.05 mg/L have been detected in parts of Canada but up to 8 mg/L in parts of China; in general levels rarely exceed 10 mg/litre 
* In parts of Asia the groundwater can contain dangerously high levels of fluoride, leading to serious health problems. 
* Worldwide, 50 million people receive water from water supplies that naturally have close to the &quot;optimal level&quot;.
* In other locations the level of fluoride is very low, sometimes leading to fluoridation of public water supplies to bring the level to around 0.7–1.2 ppm.
*Mining can increase local fluoride levels

Fluoride can be present in rain, with its concentration increasing significantly upon exposure to volcanic activity or atmospheric pollution derived from burning fossil fuels or other sorts of industry, particularly aluminium smelters.

===In plants===
All vegetation contains some fluoride, which is absorbed from soil and water. Some plants concentrate fluoride from their environment more than others. All tea leaves contain fluoride; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.

== Chemical properties ==

=== Basicity ===
Fluoride can act as a base. It can combine with a proton ():

This neutralization reaction forms hydrogen fluoride (HF), the conjugate acid of fluoride.

In aqueous solution, fluoride has a p&quot;K&quot;b value of 10.8. It is therefore a weak base, and tends to remain as the fluoride ion rather than generating a substantial amount of hydrogen fluoride. That is, the following equilibrium favours the left-hand side in water:

However, upon prolonged contact with moisture, soluble fluoride salts will decompose to their respective hydroxides or oxides, as the hydrogen fluoride escapes. Fluoride is distinct in this regard among the halides. The identity of the solvent can have a dramatic effect on the equilibrium shifting it to the right-hand side, greatly increasing the rate of decomposition.

=== Structure of fluoride salts===
Salts containing fluoride are numerous and adopt myriad structures. Typically the fluoride anion is surrounded by four or six cations, as is typical for other halides. Sodium fluoride and sodium chloride adopt the same structure. For compounds containing more than one fluoride per cation, the structures often deviate from those of the chlorides, as illustrated by the main fluoride mineral fluorite (CaF2) where the Ca2+ ions are surrounded by eight F− centers. In CaCl2, each Ca2+ ion is surrounded by six Cl− centers. The difluorides of the transition metals often adopt the rutile structure whereas the dichlorides have cadmium chloride structures.

===Inorganic chemistry===
Upon treatment with a standard acid, fluoride salts convert to hydrogen fluoride and metal salts. With strong acids, it can be doubly protonated to give . Oxidation of fluoride gives fluorine. Solutions of inorganic fluorides in water contain F− and bifluoride . Few inorganic fluorides are soluble in water without undergoing significant hydrolysis. In terms of its reactivity, fluoride differs significantly from chloride and other halides, and is more strongly solvated in protic solvents due to its smaller radius/charge ratio. Its closest chemical relative is hydroxide, since both have similar geometries.

===Naked fluoride===
Most fluoride salts dissolve to give the bifluoride () anion. Sources of true F− anions are rare because the highly basic fluoride anion abstracts protons from many, even adventitious, sources. Relative unsolvated fluoride, which does exist in aprotic solvents, is called &quot;naked&quot;. Naked fluoride is a strong Lewis base, and a powerful nucleophile. Some quaternary ammonium salts of naked fluoride include tetramethylammonium fluoride and tetrabutylammonium fluoride. Cobaltocenium fluoride is another example. However, they all lack structural characterization in aprotic solvents. Because of their high basicity, many so-called naked fluoride sources are in fact bifluoride salts. In late 2016 imidazolium fluoride was synthesized that is the closest approximation of a thermodynamically stable and structurally characterized example of a &quot;naked&quot; fluoride source in an aprotic solvent (acetonitrile). The sterically demanding imidazolium cation stabilizes the discrete anions and protects them from polymerization.

=== Biochemistry ===
At physiological pHs, hydrogen fluoride is usually fully ionised to fluoride. In biochemistry, fluoride and hydrogen fluoride are equivalent. Fluorine, in the form of fluoride, is considered to be a micronutrient for human health, necessary to prevent dental cavities, and to promote healthy bone growth. The tea plant (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; L.) is a known accumulator of fluorine compounds, released upon forming infusions such as the common beverage. The fluorine compounds decompose into products including fluoride ions. Fluoride is the most bioavailable form of fluorine, and as such, tea is potentially a vehicle for fluoride dosing. Approximately, 50% of absorbed fluoride is excreted renally with a twenty-four-hour period. The remainder can be retained in the oral cavity, and lower digestive tract. Fasting dramatically increases the rate of fluoride absorption to near 100%, from a 60% to 80% when taken with food. Per a 2013 study, it was found that consumption of one litre of tea a day, can potentially supply the daily recommended intake of 4 mg per day. Some lower quality brands can supply up to a 120% of this amount. Fasting can increase this to 150%. The study indicates that tea drinking communities are at an increased risk of dental and skeletal fluorosis, in the case where water fluoridation is in effect. Fluoride ion in low doses in the mouth reduces tooth decay. For this reason, it is used in toothpaste and water fluoridation. At much higher doses and frequent exposure, fluoride causes health complications and can be toxic.

==Applications==

Fluoride salts and hydrofluoric acid are the main fluorides of industrial value.

===Organofluorine chemistry===

Organofluorine compounds are pervasive. Many drugs, many polymers, refrigerants, and many inorganic compounds are made from fluoride-containing reagents. Often fluorides are converted to hydrogen fluoride, which is a major reagent and precursor to reagents. Hydrofluoric acid and its anhydrous form, hydrogen fluoride, are particularly important.

===Production of metals and their compounds===
The main uses of fluoride, in terms of volume, are in the production of cryolite, Na3AlF6. It is used in aluminium smelting. Formerly, it was mined, but now it is derived from hydrogen fluoride. Fluorite is used on a large scale to separate slag in steel-making. Mined fluorite (CaF2) is a commodity chemical used in steel-making. Uranium hexafluoride is employed in the purification of uranium isotopes.

===Cavity prevention===
Fluoride-containing compounds, such as sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate are used in topical and systemic fluoride therapy for preventing tooth decay. They are used for water fluoridation and in many products associated with oral hygiene. Originally, sodium fluoride was used to fluoridate water; hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and its salt sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) are more commonly used additives, especially in the United States. The fluoridation of water is known to prevent tooth decay and is considered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be &quot;one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century&quot;. In some countries where large, centralized water systems are uncommon, fluoride is delivered to the populace by fluoridating table salt. For the method of action for cavity prevention, see Fluoride therapy. Fluoridation of water has its critics . Fluoridated toothpaste is in common use. Meta-analysis show the efficacy of 500 ppm fluoride in toothpastes. However, no beneficial effect can be detected when more than one fluoride source is used for daily oral care.

===Laboratory reagent===
Fluoride salts are commonly used in biological assay processing to inhibit the activity of phosphatases, such as serine/threonine phosphatases. Fluoride mimics the nucleophilic hydroxide ion in these enzymes&#x27; active sites. Beryllium fluoride and aluminium fluoride are also used as phosphatase inhibitors, since these compounds are structural mimics of the phosphate group and can act as analogues of the transition state of the reaction.

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for some minerals in 1997. Where there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) was used instead. AIs are typically matched to actual average consumption, with the assumption that there appears to be a need, and that need is met by what people consume. The current AI for women 19 years and older is 3.0 mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). The AI for men is 4.0 mg/day. The AI for children ages 1–18 increases from 0.7 to 3.0 mg/day. The major known risk of fluoride deficiency appears to be an increased risk of bacteria-caused tooth cavities. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of fluoride the UL is 10 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For women ages 18 and older the AI is set at 2.9 mg/day (including pregnancy and lactation). For men, the value is 3.4 mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 0.6 to 3.2 mg/day. These AIs are comparable to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA reviewed safety evidence and set an adult UL at 7.0 mg/day (lower for children).

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount of a vitamin or mineral in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). Although there is information to set Adequate Intake, fluoride does not have a Daily Value and is not required to be shown on food labels.

==Estimated daily intake==
Daily intakes of fluoride can vary significantly according to the various sources of exposure. Values ranging from 0.46 to 3.6–5.4 mg/day have been reported in several studies (IPCS, 1984). In areas where water is fluoridated this can be expected to be a significant source of fluoride, however fluoride is also naturally present in virtually all foods and beverages at a wide range of concentrations. The maximum safe daily consumption of fluoride is 10 mg/day for an adult (U.S.) or 7 mg/day (European Union).

The upper limit of fluoride intake from all sources (fluoridated water, food, beverages, fluoride dental products and dietary fluoride supplements) is set at 0.10 mg/kg/day for infants, toddlers, and children through to 8 years old. For older children and adults, who are no longer at risk for dental fluorosis, the upper limit of fluoride is set at 10 mg/day regardless of weight.

== Safety ==
=== Ingestion ===
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Dietary Reference Intakes, which is the &quot;highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects&quot; specify 10 mg/day for most people, corresponding to 10 L of fluoridated water with no risk. For young children the values are smaller, ranging from 0.7 mg/d to 2.2 mg/d for infants. Water and food sources of fluoride include community water fluoridation, seafood, tea, and gelatin.

Soluble fluoride salts, of which sodium fluoride is the most common, are toxic, and have resulted in both accidental and self-inflicted deaths from acute poisoning. The lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg elemental fluoride per kg body weight). A case of a fatal poisoning of an adult with 4 grams of sodium fluoride is documented, and a dose of 120 g sodium fluoride has been survived. For sodium fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6), the median lethal dose (LD50) orally in rats is 125 mg/kg, corresponding to 12.5 g for a 100 kg adult.

Treatment may involve oral administration of dilute calcium hydroxide or calcium chloride to prevent further absorption, and injection of calcium gluconate to increase the calcium levels in the blood. Hydrogen fluoride is more dangerous than salts such as NaF because it is corrosive and volatile, and can result in fatal exposure through inhalation or upon contact with the skin; calcium gluconate gel is the usual antidote.

In the higher doses used to treat osteoporosis, sodium fluoride can cause pain in the legs and incomplete stress fractures when the doses are too high; it also irritates the stomach, sometimes so severely as to cause ulcers. Slow-release and enteric-coated versions of sodium fluoride do not have gastric side effects in any significant way, and have milder and less frequent complications in the bones. In the lower doses used for water fluoridation, the only clear adverse effect is dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of children&#x27;s teeth during tooth development; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health. Fluoride was known to enhance bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, but it was not effective for vertebral fractures and provoked more nonvertebral fractures. In areas that have naturally occurring high levels of fluoride in groundwater which is used for drinking water, both dental and skeletal fluorosis can be prevalent and severe.

==== Hazard maps for fluoride in groundwater ====

Around one-third of the human population drinks water from groundwater resources. Of this, about 10%, approximately 300 million people, obtain water from groundwater resources that are heavily contaminated with arsenic or fluoride. These trace elements derive mainly from minerals. Maps locating potential problematic wells are available.

=== Topical ===
Concentrated fluoride solutions are corrosive. Gloves made of nitrile rubber are worn when handling fluoride compounds. The hazards of solutions of fluoride salts depend on the concentration. In the presence of strong acids, fluoride salts release hydrogen fluoride, which is corrosive, especially toward glass.

== Other derivatives ==

<text>The Princely House of Thurn and Taxis (, ) is a family of German nobility that is part of the &quot;Briefadel&quot;. It was a key player in the postal services in Europe during the 16th century, until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and became well known as the owner of breweries and commissioner of several castles. The family has resided in Regensburg since 1748 with their seat at St. Emmeram Castle from 1803. The family is one of the wealthiest in Germany, and the current head of the House is Albert, 12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. 

They are one of the mediatised Houses for their former Sovereign Imperial counties, later mediatised to Kingdom of Württemberg (Buchau Princely Abbey, now Bad Buchau), Kingdom of Bavaria and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.

== History ==
The Tasso family (from the Italian word for &quot;badger&quot;, the family&#x27;s heraldic animal) was a Lombard family in the area of Bergamo. The earliest records place them in Almenno in the Val Brembana around 1200, before they fled to the more distant village of Cornello to escape feuding between Bergamo&#x27;s Colleoni (Guelf) and Suardi (Ghibelline) families. Around 1290, after Milan had conquered Bergamo, Omodeo Tasso organized 32 of his relatives into the Company of Couriers (&quot;Compagnia dei Corrieri&quot;) and linked Milan with Venice and Rome. The recipient of royal and papal patronage, his post riders were so comparatively efficient that they became known as &quot;bergamaschi&quot; throughout Italy. 

Ruggiero de Tassis was named to the court of the Emperor Frederick the Peaceful in 1443. He organized a post system between Bergamo and Vienna by 1450; from Innsbruck to Italy and Styria around 1460; and Vienna with Brussels around 1480. Upon his success, Ruggiero was knighted and made a gentleman of the Chamber. was appointed Chief Master of Postal Services at Innsbruck in 1489. Philip of Burgundy elevated Janetto&#x27;s brother to captain of his post in 1502. Owing to a payment dispute with Philip, Francisco opened his post to public use in 1506. In 1512 the family was ennobled by Emperor Maximilian I. By 1516, Francisco had moved the family to Brussels in the Duchy of Brabant, where they became instrumental to Habsburg rule, linking the rich Habsburg Netherlands to the Spanish court. The normal route passed through France, but a secondary route across the Alps to Genoa was available in times of hostility. 

At the death of Francisco in 1517, Emperor Charles V appointed Francisco&#x27;s nephew Johann Baptista von Taxis (1470-1541) as &quot;Generalpostmeister&quot; of the Kaiserliche Reichspost. Johann Baptista was briefly succeeded by his eldest son, Franz II von Taxis (1514-1543), after whose untimely death the family split into two further branches. The youngest son, Leonhard I von Taxis, succeeded as &quot;Generalpostmeister&quot; and is the ancestor of the princely Thurn and Taxis family. Johann Baptista&#x27;s second-eldest son, Raymond de Tassis (1515-1579), took over the office of postmaster-general to the Crown of Spain and settled in Spain. Raymond married into Spanish nobility, and his eldest son Juan de Tassis was created Count of Villamediana in 1603 by Phillip III. The Spanish line of the family became extinct with Juan de Tassis, 2nd Count of Villamediana, a poet who died in mysterious circumstances in 1622.

In 1608 the Brussels line was raised to the status of hereditary barons, and in 1642 the Innsbruck line as well (which descends from Gabriel de Tassis, d. 1529). When the Brussels line was raised to the hereditary status of counts in 1624, they needed illustrious lineage to legitimize their intended further ascension to the high nobility. Alexandrine von Taxis commissioned genealogists to &quot;clarify&quot; their origin, who until then had only been considered a family descending from medieval knights who had become merchants. They now claimed, albeit without documentary evidence, that they descended from the Italian noble family Della Torre, or Torriani, who had ruled in Milan and Lombardy until 1311. She then applied to the emperor for a name change. With the Germanization, the coat of arms symbol of the Milanese family, the tower &quot;(Torre)&quot;, became &quot;Thurn&quot; (an older German spelling, nowadays &quot;Turm&quot;) and was placed in front of the actual family name &quot;Tasso&quot;, translated with &quot;Taxis&quot; (an older German spelling for &quot;Dachs&quot; = Badger). The tower of the Torriani was added to the badger as a coat of arms. They formally adopted the German form of their name in 1650, including the comital Innsbruck line, which also exists to this day.

In 1681 the Brussels line was elevated to the Spanish Netherlands&#x27; rank of prince with Eugen Alexander Franz, 1st Prince of Thurn and Taxis, with Braine-le-Château (acquired in 1670) as his titular principality &quot;(Principauté de la Tour et Tassis)&quot;, and in 1695 to the rank of imperial prince at the behest of Emperor Leopold I, although at that time no territorial possessions existed in the Holy Roman Empire. Admission to the &quot;Imperial Council of Princes&quot; in the Imperial Diet took place in 1704.

The Brussels line moved to Frankfurt in 1703 because of the War of the Spanish Succession; their new family seat built from 1731 was the Palais Thurn und Taxis. Emperor Charles VII appointed Alexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis, &quot;Principal Commissioner&quot; (Lord Chancellor) of the Imperial Diet in 1743. He therefore moved to Regensburg, where the parliament was seated, in 1748. The position became hereditary in the family who lived in different houses there, but the company headquarters remained in Frankfurt. When Saint Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey in Regensburg was secularized in 1803, the monastery buildings were donated to the princes of Thurn and Taxis, who had them converted into a residence, henceforth known as &quot;Schloss Thurn and Taxis&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;Saint Emmeram Palace&quot;. It has remained their family seat to this day.

In 1786, Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, acquired the Upper Swabian county of Friedberg with the lordships of Scheer, Dürmentingen and Bussen from the princes of Waldburg, which from 1787 was known as the &quot;County of Friedberg-Scheer&quot;. Only then did the Thurn und Taxis rule their own principality of the empire for 20 years, but their main source of income remained the Imperial Reichspost.

The family operated the Thurn-und-Taxis Post, successor to the Imperial Reichspost of the Holy Roman Empire, between 1806 and 1867. Their postal service was gradually lost over the centuries, with the Spanish network being bought by the crown in the 18th century and the German post being purchased by Prussia after the fall of the Free City of Frankfurt in 1866. By investing their earnings from the postal business - later also the settlements for the postal rights - in numerous landed estates, a large number of forests and farms as well as castles were added to the family property, especially from secularized church property, among them Buchau Abbey, Marchtal Abbey, Neresheim Abbey, Ennetach Abbey, Siessen Abbey, and others. In 1803 they were summarized as &quot;Imperial Principality of Buchau&quot;. The buildings of these monasteries were mostly re-donated to the church in the 20th century, but the lands continue to be cultivated by the princely administration. Besides the St Emmeram&#x27;s Palace the current prince still owns Taxis Castle (Trugenhofen) and Garatshausen Castle at Feldafing on Lake Starnberg.
Rainer Maria Rilke wrote his &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; while visiting Princess Marie of Thurn and Taxis (&quot;née&quot; Princess of Hohenlohe, wife of Prince Alexander) at her family&#x27;s Duino Castle. Rilke later dedicated his only novel (&quot;The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge&quot;) to the princess, who was his patroness. Her son Prince Alexander (1881–1937) became an Italian citizen named &quot;Principe della Torre e Tasso&quot; and was raised in 1923 by the Italian king to &quot;Duke of Castel Duino&quot;. Today Duino Castle belongs to his grandson, Prince Carlo della Torre e Tasso, Duca di Castel Duino (b. 1952). The Duino branch is part of the family&#x27;s Czech branch that in the early 19th century settled in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). 

Several members of the family have been Knights of Malta.

Until 1919, the titles of the head of the princely house were &quot;His Serene Highness the Fürst von Thurn und Taxis, Prince of Buchau and Prince of Krotoszyn, Duke of Wörth and Donaustauf, Princely Count of Friedberg-Scheer, Count of Valle-Sássina, Marchtal, Neresheim etc., Hereditary Postmaster General.&quot;

The current head of the house of Thurn and Taxis is Albert II, 12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, son of Johannes and his wife, Gloria. The family is one of the wealthiest in Germany. The family&#x27;s brewery was sold to the Paulaner Group of Munich in 1996, but it still produces beer under the brand of &quot;Thurn und Taxis&quot;.

The Thurn and Taxis family came to massive media attention during the late 1970s through mid-1980s when Prince Johannes married Countess Mariae Gloria of Schönburg-Glauchau, a member of an impoverished but mediatized noble family. The couple&#x27;s wild, &quot;jet set&quot; lifestyle and Princess Gloria&#x27;s over-the-top appearance (characterized by bright hair colours and &quot;avant-garde&quot; clothes) earned her the nickname of &quot;Princess TNT&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
* The mail monopoly of Thurn and Taxis is central to the plot of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; by Thomas Pynchon.

<doc id="155656" wikidata="Q1067410" url="?curid=155656" title="Royal mottos of Swedish monarchs">
<text>The royal motto of the Swedish monarch is a Swedish royal tradition stemming from the early 16th century. All reigning monarchs of Sweden, beginning with Gustav I, have had their own mottos during their respective periods of reign. The Swedish royal motto in many ways is equivalent to a national motto. The tradition among Swedish monarchs, in common with the Danish and Norwegian monarchies, but different from that of most other modern European monarchies, is that the motto is not the same for one dynasty, but is personal to each monarch. Historically the royal motto has been used in connection with the Swedish coat of arms, and until 30 June 2017 it could be seen in print on the 1 krona coin. The new generation of coins does not feature a motto.

Gustav III was the first king to have his motto only in Swedish. Up until Adolf Frederick, the motto for every regent had been in Latin and Swedish (or, as in the case of Gustav II Adolf, in German). Due to the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, Oscar II had to change his motto.

<text>An allotment (British English), is a plot of land made available for individual, non-commercial gardening for growing food plants, so forming a kitchen garden away from the residence of the user. Such plots are formed by subdividing a piece of land into a few or up to several hundred parcels that are assigned to individuals or families, contrary to a community garden where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people. The term &quot;victory garden&quot; is also still sometimes used, especially when a garden dates back to the First or Second World War.

The individual size of a parcel typically suits the needs of a family, and often the plots include a shed for tools and shelter, and sometimes a hut for seasonal or weekend accommodation. The individual gardeners are usually organised in an allotment association, which leases or is granted the land from an owner who may be a public, private or ecclesiastical entity, and who usually stipulates that it be only used for gardening (i.e., growing vegetables, fruits and flowers), but not for permanent residential purposes (this is usually also required by zoning laws). The gardeners have to pay a small membership fee to the association and have to abide by the corresponding constitution and by-laws. However, the membership entitles them to certain democratic rights.

==Socio-cultural and economic functions==

The Luxembourg-based , representing three million European allotment gardeners since 1926, describes the socio-cultural and economic functions of allotment gardens as offering an improved quality of life, an enjoyable and profitable hobby, relaxation, and contact with nature. For children, gardens offer places to play and to learn about nature, while for the unemployed, they offer a feeling of doing something useful as well as low-cost food. For the elderly and disabled, gardens offer an opportunity to meet people, to share in activity with like-minded people, and to experience activities like planting and harvesting.

==By country==
===Austria===
The first garden was started in Purkersdorf in 1905.

===Canada===
In cities like Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Montreal, and Ottawa, these are called community gardens.

===Czechia and Slovakia===

Allotment gardening used to be widely popular in the former Czechoslovakia under the communist regime. It gave people from suburban prefab apartment blocks – called in Czech – a chance to escape from city chaos, pollution, and concrete architecture. Holiday houses and gardens served also as the only permitted form of investment of savings for common middle-class citizens.

===Denmark===
In 1778, land was laid out outside the fortifications of the town of Fredericia for allotment gardens, and, according to an 1828 circular from the royal chancellery allotment, gardens were established in several towns.

Private initiative formed the first Danish allotment association in Aalborg in 1884, and in Copenhagen an association named (lit. &#x27;The Workers&#x27; Protection&#x27;) founded the first allotment gardens of the Danish Capital in 1891. Since then, allotment gardens have spread to most Danish towns.
In 1904, there were about 20,000 allotment gardens in Denmark. 6,000 of them were in Copenhagen. During the interwar years, the number of allotment gardens grew rapidly. In 2001, the number of allotment gardens was estimated to be about 62,120.

In 1908, twenty allotment associations in Copenhagen formed the Allotment Garden Union, which in 1914 was expanded to cover all of Denmark. The Allotment Garden Federation was founded to negotiate more favourable deals with the state and the municipalities from which the allotments associations rented the land. Today, the federation represents roughly 400 allotment associations in 75 municipalities.

The Danish tradition for allotment gardens later spread to the other Nordic countries: first Sweden, then Norway and Finland.

Today, most allotment gardens are on land owned by the municipality, which rents the land to an allotment association. The association in turn gives each member a plot of land. To preserve allotment gardens as something that is available for all kinds of people, the membership charge is set significantly below what a market price would be. Since allotments are often placed on attractive plots of land, this has led to huge waiting lists for membership in many allotment associations.

Although the main purpose of the allotment is gardening, most allotment gardens have a pavilion built in them. These pavilions can range in size from an old rebuilt railway car to a small summer house. Many people grow so fond of their allotment gardens that they live there the entire summer. In most cases, however, members are not allowed to live there the entire year.

===Finland===
The Federation of Finnish Allotment Gardens is a non-profit organization that supports allotment gardeners and connects them to allotments and each other. The first allotment garden was established 1916 in Tampere, and today there are about 30 allotment associations all around Finland made up of roughly 3700 allotmenteers.

===France===

Family gardens, or allotments, which appeared at the end of the 19th century, are plots of land made available to inhabitants by municipalities. These plots, most often allocated to vegetable gardening, were initially intended to improve the living conditions of the workers by providing them with social balance and food self-sufficiency.

Today, they are enjoying renewed interest by helping to create “green oases” near cities, which are useful in the face of the threat of global warming. They also respond to current concerns to produce vegetables locally by low-income categories of the population and participate in creating &quot;social ties&quot; in urbanized areas.
Created in February 2007, the National Council of Collective and Family Gardens (CNJCF) aims to encourage and promote their development, the protection of plant heritage and biodiversity, gardening that respects the environment and defends its positions with public authorities and other institutions. The CNJCF today federates nearly 135,000 members, making up the three founding associations: the National Horticultural Society of France (SNHF), the National Federation of Family and Collective Gardens (FNJFC)15 and the Garden of the Railwayman (Jardinot).

===Germany===
The history of the allotment gardens in Germany is closely connected with the period of industrialization and urbanization in Europe during the 19th century, when a large number of people migrated from the rural areas to the cities to find employment and a better life. Very often, these families were living under extremely poor conditions, suffering from inappropriate housing, malnutrition and other forms of social neglect. To improve their overall situation and to allow them to grow their own food, the city administrations, the churches or their employers provided open spaces for garden purposes. These were initially called the &quot;gardens of the poor&quot;.

The idea of organised allotment gardening reached a first peak after 1864, when the so-called &quot;Schreber Movement&quot; started in the city of Leipzig in Saxony. A public initiative decided to lease areas within the city, to give children a healthy and close-to-nature environment to play in. Later, these areas included actual gardens for children, but soon adults tended towards taking over and cultivating these gardens. This kind of gardening also became popular in other European countries, especially Germanic countries such as Austria (and its dependencies), the Netherlands and Switzerland. In German-speaking countries, allotment gardens are accordingly generally known as (singular: ), sometimes literally translated as &quot;Schreber gardens&quot;. Another common term is (&#x27;small gardens&#x27;, singular: ).

The aspect of food security provided by allotment gardens became particularly evident during World Wars I and II. The socio-economic situation was very miserable, particularly regarding the nutritional status of urban residents. Many cities were isolated from their rural hinterlands and agricultural products did not reach the city markets anymore or were sold at very high prices on the black market. Consequently, food production within the city, especially fruit and vegetable production in home gardens and allotment gardens, became essential for survival. The importance of allotment gardens for food security was so obvious that in 1919, one year after the end of World War I, the first legislation for allotment gardening in Germany was passed. The so-called &quot;Small Garden and Small-Rent Land Law&quot;, provided security in land tenure and fixed leasing fees. In 1983, this law was amended by the (). Today, there are still about 1.4 million allotment gardens in Germany, covering an area of . In Berlin alone, there are 833 allotment garden complexes.

===Malta===
 Malta introduced its first allotment gardens in April 2011. The objective of the scheme, which was called (&#x27;Try Your Hand at Farming&#x27;), was to encourage people, especially the young and those living in urban areas, to take up organic farming. The scheme had over 50 allotment plots located at Għammieri, Malta, with each plot measuring 50 square metres in size. All plots were fully irrigated and those who participated in the scheme received continual support and training. Malta&#x27;s allotment gardens were terminated in 2013, following a change in administration. In September, 2019, Heritage Malta, an agency which falls under the Ministry for Culture, started an initiative to re-introduce the concept of allotments. Located just above the Abbatija Tad-Dejr catacombs in Rabat, the new allotment plots were issued with several restrictions in an effort to protect the sensitivity of the archaeological site.

===Netherlands===

The first allotment gardens in the Netherlands were founded in 1838. In the 19th century, cities started allotment gardens for working-class families. Around the first world war, in which the Netherlands remained neutral, the users of the gardens started demanding that the gardens would be governed by the members. In 1928, the allotment garden societies founded the national level (AVVN). During the German Occupation of WWII, many &quot;Volkstuinen&quot; started. Until the 1950s, the gardens were primarily used for vegetable production; since then there has been a shift to recreational use. Depending on the city and society, small sheds, greenhouses or small garden houses are allowed. In some cases, permanent habitation is allowed during summertime. The Netherlands has 240,000 allotments.

===Norway===
There are 13 allotment gardens in Norway, with around 2000 allotments. The oldest, Rodeløkkens Kolonihager, dates to 1907. The largest, Solvang Kolonihager, has around 600 allotments and is in Oslo, close to the woods and Sognsvann lake. The allotment gardens are quite popular, and there can be a waiting list of 10 and in some cases even 20 years.

===Philippines===
In 2003, the first allotment garden of the Philippines was established in Cagayan de Oro, Northern Mindanao as part of a European Union funded project. Meanwhile, with the assistance of the German Embassy in Manila and several private donors from Germany, this number has grown to five self-sustaining gardens located in different urban areas of the city, enabling a total of 55 urban poor families the legal access to land for food production. Further four allotment gardens, two of them within the premises of public elementary schools are presently being set up for additional 36 families using the asset-based community development approach. Some of the gardeners belong to the poorest in the city, the garbage pickers of the city&#x27;s landfill site. Aside from different vegetables, the gardeners grow also herbs and tropical fruits. In some gardens, small animals are kept and fish ponds are maintained to avail the gardeners of additional protein sources for the daily dietary needs. Each allotment garden has a compost heap where biodegradable wastes from the garden as well as from the neighboring households are converted into organic fertilizer, thus contributing to the integrated solid waste management program of the city. Further, all gardens are equipped with so-called urine-diverting ecological sanitation toilets similar to practices in Danish allotment gardens described by Bregnhøj et al. (2003).

===Poland===

In Poland, allotment gardens date back to 1897 when Doctor Jan Jalkowski founded the &#x27;Sun Baths&#x27; () community gardens and health area in Grudziądz. The emergence of allotment gardens in Poland, similarly to the situation in other European countries, was linked to the industrialisation epoque. The creation of the allotments was treated as a response to food and health problems of a growing number of rural population migrating into cities. Former peasants were encouraged to reproduce their rural subsistence patterns in a new environment to increase social stability through additional food provision, creation of green spaces, and exercise. The organisers opted that the gardens should first and foremost meet the needs of the poorest.

The role of allotment gardens did not change significantly in the twentieth century. During the Communist regime allotment gardeners were mostly focused on improving the household budget by producing food for family needs. In the late 1980s, food expenses comprised 40% of the household budget. It was also during that time when spending time at the allotment gardens () became a cultural phenomenon.

With the collapse of Communism and the arrival of Capitalism, the function and main purpose of the allotment gardens were redefined. In 2013 the regulator characterised their primary role as to satisfy recreational and other social needs – food security was only mentioned among the latter.

Currently, there are 965,000 registered allotment gardeners in Poland. Allotment gardeners, who cultivate publicly owned urban space, constitute the largest group of city land managers in the country. The transition from the predominantly productive character of the allotments to the pleasure gardens that has been observed in Poland is the combined result of market trends, current aesthetic needs, pressure from allotment administrators, and city developers willing to adopt these attractive green spaces. Progressive urbanization is threatening the existence of allotment gardens especially those located in city centres, the other threat is an idea of turning allotments into public open spaces, which would most probably transform them into parks.

In the past years, the interest in allotment gardens has been rising again, mostly around younger people who see their environmental, community building, and leisure potential.

===Portugal===

Since 2011, the municipality of Lisbon has created more than 19 allotment gardens ( or ). These are granted to residents by means of a public application process.

Otherwise, allotment gardens in Portugal are often precarious, as land is spontaneously divided into strips as cities grow.

===Russia===
The first allotments (&quot;dachas&quot;) in Russia began to appear during the reign of Peter the Great. Initially they were small estates in the country, which were given to loyal vassals by the Tsar. In archaic Russian, the word () means &quot;something given&quot;.

During the Age of Enlightenment, Russian aristocracy used their allotments for social and cultural gatherings, which were usually accompanied by masquerade balls and fireworks displays. The Industrial Revolution brought about a rapid growth in the urban population, and urban residents increasingly desired to escape the heavily polluted cities, at least temporarily. By the end of the 19th century, the allotment became a favorite summer retreat for the upper and middle classes of Russian society.

After the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, most dachas were nationalized. Some were converted into vacation homes for the working class, while others, usually of better quality, were distributed among the prominent functionaries of the Communist Party and the newly emerged cultural and scientific elite. All but a few allotments remained the property of the state and the right to use them was usually revoked when a dacha occupant was dismissed or fell out of favor with the rulers of the state. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s favourite Dacha was in Gagra, Abkhazia. The construction of new dachas was restricted until the late 1940s and required the special approval of the Communist Party leadership.

The period after World War II saw a moderate growth in dacha development. Since there was no actual law banning the construction of dachas, squatters began occupying unused plots of land near cities and towns, some building sheds, huts, and more prominent dwellings that served as dachas. This practice of squatting was spurred by the desire of urban dwellers, all living in multi-story apartment buildings, to spend some time close to nature, and also to grow their own fruits and vegetables. The latter was caused by the failure of the centrally planned Soviet agricultural program to supply enough fresh produce. As time passed, the number of squatters grew geometrically and the government had no choice but to officially recognize their right to amateur farming. The 1955 legislation introduced a new type of legal entity into the Soviet juridical system, a so-called &quot;gardeners&#x27; partnership&quot; (; not to be confused with community garden). The gardeners&#x27; partnerships received the right to permanent use of land exclusively for agricultural purposes and permission to connect to public electrical and water supply networks. In 1958, yet another form of organization was introduced, a &quot;cooperative for dacha construction (DSK)&quot; (), which recognized the right of an individual to build a small house on the land leased from the government.

The 1980s saw the peak of the dacha boom, with virtually every affluent family in the country having a dacha of their own or spending weekends and holidays at friends&#x27; dachas. Often ill-equipped and without indoor plumbing, dachas were nevertheless the ultimate solution for millions of Russian working-class families to having an inexpensive summer retreat. Having a piece of land also offered an opportunity for city dwellers to indulge themselves in growing their own fruits and vegetables. To this day, May Day holidays remain a feature of Russian life allowing urban residents a long weekend to plant seeds and tend fruit trees as the ground defrosts from the long Russian winter. Since there are no other national holidays that are long enough for planting, many employers give their staff an extra day off specifically for that purpose.

The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union saw the return to private land ownership. Most dachas have since been privatized, and Russia is now the nation with the largest number of owners of second homes. The growth of living standards in recent years allowed many dacha owners to spend their discretionary income on improvements. Thus, many recently built dachas are fully equipped houses suitable for use as permanent residences. The market-oriented economy transformed the dacha into an asset, which generally reflects the prosperity of its owner and can be freely traded in the real estate market.

Due to the rapid increase in urbanization in Russia, many village houses are currently being sold to be used as allotments. Many Russian villages now have () as temporary residents. Some villages have been fully transformed into dacha settlements, while some older dacha settlements often look like more permanent lodgings. The advantages of purchasing a dacha in a village usually are: lower costs, greater land area, and larger distances between houses. The disadvantages may include: lower-quality utilities, less security, and typically a farther distance to travel.

===Sweden===
In Landskrona, around the area of the Citadel, the first allotment gardens of Sweden were made available for lease in the 1860s, later followed by those in Malmö in 1895, and Stockholm in 1904. The local authorities were inspired by Anna Lindhagen, a social-democratic leader and a woman in the upper ranks of society, who visited allotment gardens in Copenhagen and was delighted by them. In her first book on the topic devoted to the usefulness of allotment gardens she wrote:For the family, the plot of land is a uniting bond, where all family members can meet in shared work and leisure. The family father, tired with the cramped space at home, may rejoice in taking care of his family in the open air, and feel responsible if the little plot of earth bestows a very special interest upon life.Anna Lindhagen is said to have met Lenin when he passed through Stockholm from the exile in Switzerland on their return trip to Russia after the February Revolution in 1917. She invited him to the allotment gardens of Barnängen to show all its benefits. However, she did not win his approval. Lenin was totally unresponsive to this kind of activity. To poke in the soil was to prepare the ground for political laziness in the class struggle. The workers should not be occupied with gardening, they should rather devote themselves to the proletarian revolution.

The Swedish Federation of Leisure Gardening was founded in 1921 and represents today more than 26,000 allotment and leisure gardeners. The members are organised in about 275 local societies all over Sweden. The land is usually rented from the local authorities.

=== Turkey ===
Allotments or hobby gardens () as they are known in Turkey became really popular after 2000s. A hobby garden or organic garden is an area or plot of land where vegetables and fruits can be grown. Hobby gardens, which have become very popular in recent years, offer a natural environment in city life. 

Hobby gardens, which are mostly prepared by municipalities and put into service by charging annual rental fees, are now used by many people to grow vegetables and fruits and to be in touch with nature. The size of the hobby garden and the type of soil may vary depending on the region.

Hobby gardens can also be put up for sale through share deeds. In addition, in the parceling prepared, the hobby garden must be specified in the same way on the real land.

===United Kingdom===

A 1732 engraving of Birmingham, England, shows the town encircled by allotments, some of which still exist to this day. Another old allotment site is Great Somerford Free Gardens in the Wiltshire village of Great Somerford. These were created in 1809 following a letter to King George III from Rev Stephen Demainbray (a chaplain to the king) in which he asked the king to spare, in perpetuity, six acres from the Great Somerford Inclosure Act 1806 (46 Geo. 3. c. &quot;63&quot; for the benefit of the poor of his parish.

Following the inclosure acts and the Commons Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 56), the land available for personal cultivation by the poor was greatly diminished. To fulfill the need for land, allotment legislation was enacted. The law was first fully codified in the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908, then modified by the Allotments Act 1922 (12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5. c. 51) and subsequent Allotments Acts up until the Allotments Act 1950.

Under the acts, a local authority is required to maintain an &quot;adequate provision&quot; of land, usually a large allotment field which can then be subdivided into allotment gardens for individual residents at a low rent. Allotment sizes are often quoted in square rods, although the use of the rod has been illegal for trade purposes since 1965. The rent is set at what a person &quot;may reasonably be expected to pay&quot; (1950); in 1997 the average rent for a ten square rods, or plot was £22 a year. In February 2012 the UK&#x27;s first Green-controlled council, Brighton and Hove, caused controversy when they stated their intention to raise the rent for a standard 250 m2 plot to £110 per year, with many people suggesting that this was contrary to the environmental agenda on which they were elected. Each plot cannot exceed forty square rods, i.e. and must be used for the production of fruit or vegetables for consumption by the plot-holder and their family (1922), or of flowers for use by the plot-holder and their family. The exact size and quality of the plots is not defined. The council has a duty to provide sufficient allotments to meet demand. The total income from allotments was £2.61 million and total expenditure was £8.44 million in 1997.

The total number of plots has varied greatly over time. In the 19th and early 20th century, the allotment system supplied much of the fresh vegetables eaten by the poor. In 1873 there were 244,268 plots and by 1918 there were around 1,500,000 plots. While numbers fell in the 1920s and 1930s, following an increase to 1,400,000 during World War II there were still around 1,117,000 plots in 1948. This number has been in decline since then, falling to 600,000 by the late 1960s and 300,000 by 2009. The Thorpe Inquiry of 1969 investigated the decline and put the causes as the decline in available land, increasing prosperity and the growth of other leisure activities.

The popular 1970s British television programme &quot;The Good Life&quot;, about a couple seeking to &quot;escape the rat race&quot; by becoming &quot;totally self-sufficient&quot; in a suburban setting, utilised an allotment to achieve their aims. Increased interest in &quot;green&quot; issues from the 1970s revived interest in allotment gardening, whilst the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners (NSALG), and the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society (SAGS) in Scotland, continued to campaign on behalf of allotment users. However, the rate of decline was only slowed, falling from 530,000 plots in 1970 to 497,000 in 1977, although there was a substantial waiting list. By 1980 the surge in interest was over, and by 1997 the number of plots had fallen to around 265,000, with waiting lists of 13,000 and 44,000 vacant plots. In 2008 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that 330,000 people held an allotment, whilst 100,000 were on waiting lists.

In 2006, a report commissioned by the London Assembly identified that whilst demand was at an all-time high across the capital, the pressure caused by high-density building was further decreasing the amount of allotment land. The issue was given further publicity when &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported on the community campaign against the potential impact of the development for the 2012 Summer Olympics on the future of the century-old Manor Garden Allotments, Hackney Wick. In March 2008, Geoff Stokes, secretary of the NSALG, claimed that councils are failing in their duty to provide allotments. &quot;[T]hey sold off land when demand was not so high. This will go on because developers are now building houses with much smaller gardens.&quot; The Local Government Association has issued guidance asking councils to consider requiring developers to set land aside to make up for the shortfalls in allotment plots.

Against the falling trend of land set aside for allotments is an increasing awareness of the need for cities to counter issues of food security and climate change through greater self-sufficiency. This drive to expand allotments is also a response to food price inflation, a desire to reduce food miles and surplus provision of land in post-industrial towns and cities in the developed world. Some of these themes were taken up in a recent urban agriculture project in Middlesbrough in the Tees Valley.

The gendered origins of allotment spaces has been the subject of research, with findings including that a lack of toilets and sanitation can be a barrier to women, with some even miscarrying on their plots.

===United States===

Many &quot;community gardens&quot; founded in the United States began as &quot;victory gardens&quot; in World War II, and later evolved into community gardens. Plots in these gardens are often rented out by the city, starting at plots of just . The environmental movement has increased interest in community gardening.

<doc id="155664" wikidata="Q325358" url="?curid=155664" title="Railway platform">
<text>A railway platform is an area in a train station alongside a railway track providing convenient access to trains. Almost all stations have some form of platform, with larger stations having multiple platforms.

Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan hosts 44 platforms, more than any other rail station in the world. The world&#x27;s longest station platform is at Hubballi Junction in India at . The Appalachian Trail station or Benson station in the United States, at the other extreme, has a platform which is only long enough for a single bench.

Among some American train conductors, the word &quot;platform&quot; has entered usage as a verb meaning &quot;to berth at a station&quot;, as in the announcement: &quot;The last two cars of this train will not platform at East Rockaway&quot;.

==Height relative to trains==

The most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track, usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor. This would often not be considered a true platform. The more traditional platform is elevated relative to the track but often lower than the train floor, although ideally they should be at the same level. Occasionally the platform is higher than the train floor, where a train with a low floor serves a station built for trains with a high floor, for example at the Dutch stations of the DB Regionalbahn Westfalen (see ). On the London Underground some stations are served by both District line and Piccadilly line trains, and the Piccadilly trains have lower floors.

A tram stop is often in the middle of the street; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk, e.g. , and sometimes has no platform. The latter requires extra care by passengers and other traffic to avoid accidents. Both types of tram stops can be seen in the tram networks of Melbourne and Toronto. Sometimes a tram stop is served by ordinary trams with rather low floors and metro-like light rail vehicles with higher floors, and the tram stop has a dual-height platform. A railway station may be served by heavy-rail and light-rail vehicles with lower floors and have a dual- height platform, as on the RijnGouweLijn in the Netherlands.
In all cases the platform must accommodate the loading gauge and conform to the structure gauge of the system.

==Types of platform==
Platform types include the bay platform, side platform (also called through platform), split platform and island platform. A bay platform is one at which the track terminates, i.e. a dead-end or siding. Trains serving a bay platform must reverse in or out. A side platform is the more usual type, alongside tracks where the train arrives from one end and leaves towards the other. An island platform has through platforms on both sides; it may be indented on one or both ends, with bay platforms. To reach an island platform there may be a bridge, a tunnel, or a level crossing. A variant on the side platform is the spanish solution which has platforms on both sides of a single through track.

Modern station platforms can be constructed from a variety of materials such as glass-reinforced polymer, pre-cast concrete or expanded polystrene, depending on the underlying substructure. 

==Identification==

Most stations have their platforms numbered consecutively from 1; a few stations, including , , King&#x27;s Cross, , and (in the UK); and Lidcombe, Sydney (Australia), start from 0. At platforms 3 through to 12 are split along their length with odd numbered platforms facing north and east and even facing south and west, with a small signal halfway along the platform. Some, such as , use letters instead of numbers (this is to distinguish the platforms from numbered ones in the adjoining Waterloo main-line station for staff who work at both stations); some, such as Paris-Gare de Lyon, use letters for one group of platforms but numbers for the other.

The actual meaning of the word platform depends on country and language. In some countries such as the United States, the word platform refers to the physical structure, while the place where a train can arrive is referred to as a &quot;track&quot; (e.g. &quot;The train is arriving on Track 5&quot;). In other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and most Commonwealth countries, platform refers specifically to the place where the train stops, which means that in such a case island platforms are allocated two separate numbers, one for each side. Some countries are in the process of switching from platform to track numbers, i.e. the Czech Republic and Poland. In locations where track numbers are used an island platform would be described as one platform with two tracks. Many stations also have numbered tracks or platforms which are used only for through traffic and do not have physical platform access.

==Facilities==

Some of the station facilities are often located on the platforms. Where the platforms are not adjacent to a station building, often some form of shelter or waiting room is provided, and employee cabins may also be present. The weather protection offered varies greatly, from little more than a roof with open sides, to a closed room with heating or air-conditioning. There may be benches, lighting, ticket counters, drinking fountains, shops, trash boxes, and static timetables or dynamic displays with information about the next train.

There are often loudspeakers as part of a public address (PA) system. The PA system is often used where dynamic timetables or electronic displays are not present. A variety of information is presented, including destinations and times (for all trains, or only the more important long-distance trains), delays, cancellations, platform changes, changes in routes and destinations, the number of carriages in the train and the location of first class or luggage compartments, and supplementary fee or reservation requirements.

==Safety==
Some metro stations have platform screen doors between the platforms and the tracks. They provide more safety, and they allow the heating or air conditioning in the station to be separated from the ventilation in the tunnel, thus being more efficient and effective. They have been installed in most stations of the Singapore MRT and the Hong Kong MTR, and stations on the Jubilee Line Extension in London.

Platforms should be sloped upwards slightly towards the platform edge to prevent wheeled objects such as trolleys, prams and wheelchairs from rolling away and into the path of the train. Many platforms have a cavity underneath an overhanging edge so that people who may fall off the platform can seek shelter from incoming trains. 

For security against theft or to secure stowaways, some countries have special security officers stationed at stations, just like the police, but specifically for railways, For example, in Indonesia and poland, there are special railway security officers. 

===High-speed rail===

In high-speed rail, passing trains are a significant safety problem as the safe distance from the platform edge increases with the speed of the passing train. A study done by the United States Department of Transportation in 1999 found that trains passing station platforms at speeds of can pose safety concerns to passengers on the platforms who are away from the edge due to the aerodynamic effects created by pressure and induced airflow with speeds of to depending on the train body aerodynamic designs. Additionally, the airflow can cause debris to be blown out to the waiting passengers. If the passengers stand closer at , the risk increases with airflow that can reach speeds of to .
In United Kingdom, a guideline for platform safety specifies that for the platforms with train passing speeds between and , there should be a yellow-line buffer zone of and other warning signs. If trains can pass at speeds higher than , the platforms should be inaccessible to passengers unless there are waiting rooms or screened areas to provide protection. The European Union has a regulation for platforms that are close to tracks with train passing speeds of or more should not be accessible to passengers unless there is a lower speed limit for trains that intend to stop at the station or there are barriers to limit access.

===Markings===

Platforms usually have some form of warnings or measures to keep passengers away from the tracks. The simplest measure is markings near the edge of the platform to demarcate the distance back that passengers should remain. Often a special tiled surface is used as well as a painted line, to help blind people using a walking aid, and help in preventing wheelchairs from rolling too near the platform edge.

In the US, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 regulations require a detectable warning strip wide, consisting of truncated dome bumps in a visually-contrasting color, for the full length of the platform.

=== Curvature ===

Ideally platforms should be straight or slightly convex, so that the guard (if any) can see the whole train when preparing to close the doors. Platforms that have great curvature have blind spots that create a safety hazard. Mirrors or closed-circuit cameras may be used in these cases to view the whole platform. Also passenger carriages are straight, so doors will not always open directly onto a curved platform – often a platform gap is present. Usually such platforms will have warning signs, possibly auditory, such as London Underground&#x27;s famous phrase &quot;Mind the gap&quot;.

There may be moveable gap filler sections within the platform, extending once the train has stopped and retracting after the doors have closed. The New York City Subway employs these at 14th Street–Union Square on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and at Times Square on the 42nd Street Shuttle, and formerly at the South Ferry outer loop station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

<text>Raymond Pettibon (born Raymond Ginn, June 16, 1957) is an American artist who lives and works in New York City. Pettibon came to prominence in the early 1980s in the southern California punk rock scene, creating posters and album art mainly for groups on SST Records, owned and operated by his older brother, Greg Ginn. He has subsequently become widely recognized in the fine art world for using American iconography variously pulled from literature, art history, philosophy, and religion to politics, sport, and sexuality.

==Early life==

The fourth of five children born to R.C.K. Ginn, an English teacher who published several spy novels; his mother was a housewife. Pettibon grew up in Hermosa Beach, California. He was raised Christian Scientist. He earned an economics degree from UCLA in 1977 and worked as a high school mathematics teacher in the L.A. public school system for a short period, before pursuing and completing his BFA in 1977.

In 1976, his brother, guitarist/songwriter Greg Ginn, founded the influential punk rock band Black Flag. Initially, Pettibon had been a bass player in the group when it was known by the name Panic. When the band discovered that another band called Panic existed, Pettibon suggested the name Black Flag and designed their distinctive &quot;four bars&quot; logo, a stylized black flag rippling in the wind. Around the same time, Pettibon adopted his new surname, from the nickname petit bon (good little one) given to him by his father. Pettibon&#x27;s artwork appeared on fliers, album covers and gift items (T-shirts, stickers and skateboards) for Black Flag through the early 1980s, and he became well known in the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

Pettibon is married to video artist Aïda Ruilova, with whom he has a son. He is an avid sports fan.

==Work==
Known for his comic-like drawings with disturbing, ironic or ambiguous text, Pettibon&#x27;s subject matter is sometimes violent and anti-authoritarian. From the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, he was closely associated with the punk rock band Black Flag and the record label SST Records, both founded by his older brother Greg Ginn. In addition, Pettibon designed the cover of the 1990 Sonic Youth album &quot;Goo&quot;; bassist Kim Gordon had been a longtime admirer of Pettibon&#x27;s art and written about him for &quot;Artforum&quot; in the 1980s. Beginning in the mid-1980s, he became a well-known figure in the contemporary art scene.

Pettibon works primarily with India ink on paper and many of his early drawings are black and white, although he sometimes introduces color through the use of pencil, watercolor, collage, gouache or acrylic paint. He has stated that his interest in this technique is a result of the influence of artists such as William Blake and Goya, and the style of political editorial cartoons. His drawings come out by the hundreds. He started to publish them as limited-edition photocopied booklets in 1978. These booklets, which he continues to produce as &quot;Superflux Pubs,&quot; are considered &quot;the sum of his ideas and aesthetics&quot;. Pettibon started working in collage in the mid-80s with simple newsprint elements collaged onto black and white images. In his new works, the artist again uses the means of collage.

As Holland Cotter noted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

A retrospective of Pettibon&#x27;s work entitled &quot;A Pen of All Work&quot;, spanned three floors of New York City&#x27;s New Museum in 2017.

===Public art projects===
For New York&#x27;s High Line, Pettibon created a temporary billboard in 2013, displaying a 2010 baseball drawing called &quot;No Title (Safe he called ...)&quot; and featuring Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers sliding home.

===Other projects===
In addition to his works on paper, Pettibon has also made animations from his drawings, live action shot-on-video films from his own scripts (each focusing on the American counterculture of the 1960s-1970s), unique artist&#x27;s books, fanzines, prints, and large permanent wall drawings that often include an arrangement of his own works on paper almost creating an installation of collage. In the early 1990s, fellow artist Mike Kelley played guitar on an album of songs that Pettibon recorded for the independent label Blast First out of New York and London. He is now the lead singer of the Niche Makers, a band based in Venice, California.

Together with German sound artist Oliver Augst he released the musical &quot;The Whole World Is Watching&quot; (with Schorsch Kamerun, Keiji Haino and Marcel Daemgen) in 2007 as part of the MaerzMusik festival of the Berliner Festspiele, Berlin.

Pettibon&#x27;s artwork inspired the music video for the 2011 song &quot;Monarchy of Roses&quot; by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Pettibon is also mentioned in the song&#x27;s lyrics.
In June 2013, a new documentary series, &quot;The Art of Punk&quot; was released on YouTube. The first episode features the art of Black Flag and Pettibon.

== Recognition ==
Raymond Pettibon is the recipient of numerous awards and prizes. In 1991, he was awarded the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award for which a catalog was produced. In 2001, the Museum Ludwig named Pettibon the winner of its Wolfgang Hahn Prize. In 2003, Pettibon was awarded the Grand Prize of Honor for his participation in the 25th Biennial of Graphic Arts, Ljubljana, Slovenia. For the 2004 Whitney Biennial, Pettibon was invited to create an installation of drawings for the exhibition. He was awarded the Bucksbaum Award for his installation, the world&#x27;s largest award given to an individual artist. (The Bucksbaum Award is awarded every two years and is always given to an artist whose work is displayed in that year&#x27;s Whitney Biennial.) As part of the honor, the Whitney Museum organized a solo exhibition that opened in the Fall of 2005, featuring new works and published an artist&#x27;s book for the occasion. Most recently, Pettibon was awarded the University of Vienna&#x27;s Oskar Kokoschka Prize for 2010. Established by the Austrian government in 1980, following the painter&#x27;s death, the Kokoschka Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist every two years.

<text>Minor Threat (also referred to as First Two Seven Inches) is a compilation album by American hardcore punk band Minor Threat, released in March 1984 through Dischord Records. The compilation consisted of the group&#x27;s first and second extended plays, Minor Threat (originally released June 1981) and In My Eyes (originally released December 1981). The 1984 &quot;Minor Threat&quot; LP featured the same cover as the 1981 &quot;Minor Threat&quot; EP, depicting vocalist Ian MacKaye&#x27;s younger brother Alec (Untouchables, The Faith). The image has been imitated by punk bands such as Rancid on their album &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; and in the Major Threat ad campaign by Nike.

All the tracks from the &quot;Minor Threat&quot; and &quot;In My Eyes&quot; EPs are available on CD on Minor Threat&#x27;s 1989 compilation album &quot;Complete Discography&quot; and also on &quot;Dischord 1981: The Year in 7&quot;s&quot;.

==Album information==
&quot;Straight Edge&quot;, a song from the &quot;Minor Threat&quot; EP, inadvertently inspired the straight edge movement. The song, while written merely as an account of MacKaye&#x27;s personal views and lifestyle, was seen to be a call for abstinence from drugs and alcohol, a then-unusual concept for punk rock and rock music in general.

&quot;Out of Step,&quot; from the follow-up &quot;In My Eyes&quot; EP, further demonstrates the aesthetic: &quot;Don&#x27;t smoke/ Don&#x27;t drink/ Don&#x27;t fuck/ At least I can fucking think/ I can&#x27;t keep up/ Can&#x27;t keep up/ Can&#x27;t keep up/ I&#x27;m out of step with the world.&quot; Some in Minor Threat, particularly drummer Jeff Nelson, took exception to what they saw as MacKaye&#x27;s imperious attitude on the song. This spurred the band to re-record the track as the title song of their 1983 &quot;Out of Step&quot; album, on which MacKaye clearly sang &quot;&quot;I&quot; don&#x27;t drink/smoke/fuck&quot; (as was the intent of his words all along), and an argument between him and Nelson in which he states that &quot;this is no set of rules, I&#x27;m not telling you what to do&quot; was surreptitiously recorded by producer Don Zientara to be dubbed onto the track right before the final chorus. According to Mark Andersen and Mark Jenkins&#x27; &quot;Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation&#x27;s Capital&quot;, this argument was over exactly what would be said in the message that Nelson wanted MacKaye to record stating essentially what he said without knowing it was being recorded.

&quot;In My Eyes&quot; is an anti-drug song which has been covered by rap metal band Rage Against the Machine, among others. Along with &quot;Straight Edge&quot; and &quot;Out of Step,&quot; &quot;In My Eyes&quot; helped to solidify views of Minor Threat as a band with an anti-drug platform. Unlike the original &quot;Straight Edge,&quot; a relatively standard hardcore composition, each verse of &quot;In My Eyes&quot; seethes with anger and contempt, building up to the cathartic release of the chorus.

&quot;Guilty of Being White&quot; led to accusations of racial prejudice, due to perceived similarities between the song&#x27;s lyrics and that of white power rhetoric which often frames the majority race as victims at the hands of a minority group. However, MacKaye has strongly denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. According to him, the song was written about his experiences growing up in Washington, D.C. at a time of high racial tension, where the majority race in his school was African-American and many black students were hostile towards whites. Slayer later covered the song, though they changed the lyric &quot;guilty of being white&quot; to &quot;guilty of being right&quot; at the song&#x27;s climax. This infuriated MacKaye, since they we&#x27;re turning his lyrics into having a rasistic message.

&quot;Minor Threat&quot; is a youth anthem which has been covered by bands as diverse as Sublime, Silverchair, Rise Against, Title Fight, and Pennywise.

&quot;Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot; is a cover, written by the team of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart in the mid-1960s, and first recorded by Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and later the Monkees. &quot;Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot; has been covered by many punk acts including the Sex Pistols, Johnny Thunders, Untouchables, State of Alert, Ant &amp; Dec and Government Issue.

<text>Out of Step is the third EP by American hardcore punk band Minor Threat. It was released on vinyl in April 1983 through Dischord Records. Although &quot;Out of Step&quot; has only been released on CD in limited quantities, it has been repressed on vinyl as recently as 2010. All tracks from the album are available on Minor Threat&#x27;s 1989 compilation album &quot;Complete Discography&quot;.

It is considered a critical release in punk rock, particularly the hardcore subgenre. Many critics and magazines have cited it as one of the best progressions in the history of rock music, which specifically helped shape the path of many genres of underground musical currents alternative music). Its influence is notorious in future bands that would boost the youth crew movement, also in other genres such as grunge, post-hardcore, 1990&#x27;s skate punk and thrash metal, as well in the development of the New York hardcore music scene and aesthetics style.

This album’s increased complexity in songs, with more elaborate riffs and arrangements, is its main distinguishing factor compared to the band’s previous recordings. The bass octaves retain the dynamics of the guitar line. Brian Baker became second guitarist for the album, and Steven Hansgen joined the bass.

The lyrics of most songs focus on themes like self-reflection, youth frustration, personal problems, and difficulties with friendships. This is in contrast to Minor Threat&#x27;s first recordings, which had a politically critical message and did not revolve around drug use.

==Background, recording and reissues==

After a temporary break-up in 1982, Minor Threat entered Inner Ear Studios in January 1983 to record &quot;Out of Step&quot;. The album was produced and engineered by Don Zientara. The lyrics on &quot;Out of Step&quot; deal mainly with friendships and problems associated with them, unlike their previous recordings which were an outlet for MacKaye&#x27;s message. The album artwork was drawn by Cynthia Connolly.

In May–June 1983, Southern Studios founder John Loder traveled from England to New York where Minor Threat would play a show, and there he offered the band to release &quot;Out of Step&quot; in the UK. The band knew that he was working with Crass which led them to accept the offer, starting a long-standing relationship between Dischord Records and Southern Studios.

The first vinyl pressing of the album (with plain black cover) appears on the &quot;Complete Discography&quot; compilation. After the second pressing, the band remixed the album and this version remained in print on vinyl until the 2000s. The latter is distinguishable by a colored stripe with suggested retail price across the front, and &quot;Dischord 10 UK&quot; and &quot;Utopia&quot; in the dead wax. The biggest differences between the original mix and the remixed version are in the songs &quot;Out of Step&quot; and the initially untitled &quot;Cashing In&quot;.

In the mid-2000s, the album was remastered on vinyl by Chicago Mastering Service, with no stripe.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Out of Step&quot; was met with positive reviews and ratings. Ned Raggett of AllMusic awards it four-and-a-half out of five stars and states: &quot;Building on the promise and fire of the band&#x27;s earlier singles, &quot;Out of Step&quot; instantly became iconic for American hardcore, not to mention for the D.C. scene, for years to come, as well as any number of bands who conflated personal and social politics.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;Out of Step&quot; has received a number of accolades and is cited as a landmark of the hardcore punk genre. It is mentioned in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.–based independent record label specializing in punk rock. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot; by their band the Teen Idles. With other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the 1980s indie rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.

The label is most notable for employing the do it yourself ethic, producing all of its albums and selling them at discount prices without finance from major distributors. Dischord continues to release records by bands from Washington D.C., and to document and support the Washington D.C. music scene. As of October 2016, the label employs four people.

Dischord was a local label in the early days of hardcore, and is one of the more famous independent labels, along with the likes of Alternative Tentacles, Epitaph Records, SST Records, and Touch and Go Records.

The logo of the label was created by Nelson, who has an associate degree in advertising design.

==History==
Influenced by existing labels like Dangerhouse Records, MacKaye and Nelson took up residence in the now known &quot;Dischord House&quot; and ran the label out of its premises.

Dischord&#x27;s first release was &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot; by Teen Idles released in 1980. The band members cut, folded, and glued the record packaging themselves to keep costs down. The label&#x27;s first split 12&quot; was &quot;Faith / Void Split&quot; by the bands the Faith and Void.

Dischord limits itself to bands from the D.C. scene. The label offers the same basic deal to all artists: Dischord fronts a certain amount of money to record and manufacture and once those costs are recouped, the label&#x27;s distributor takes 30 percent of the profit and the band and label split the remainder.

Jeff Nelson has claimed the venture was never intended to be profit-making but was instead simply a way to get their friends albums in fans’ hands.

In spite of criticism over the years about how the label is run, MacKaye claims everything works and will continue to operate in the same fashion of no contracts or lawyers.

In 2017, they put their catalog on Bandcamp for free streaming or purchase.

In May 2021, it was announced that Dischord would be re-releasing the label&#x27;s first six 7&quot; records in a remastered box set. With the catalog number &quot;Dischord 200&quot;, it consisted of singles and EPs by Minor Threat, Government Issue, Teen Idles, SOA, and Youth Brigade.

==Roster==

Bands such as Minor Threat, Government Issue, the Faith, Void, Iron Cross, Embrace, Rites of Spring, Nation of Ulysses, Scream, Soulside, S.O.A., the Teen Idles, Gray Matter, Jawbox, Marginal Man, Shudder to Think, Dag Nasty, Lungfish and Fugazi have released records on Dischord.

Additions to the Dischord roster as of the late 1990s and 2000s include Q and Not U, Beauty Pill, Antelope, Soccer Team, French Toast, Faraquet, Black Eyes, the Aquarium, Title Tracks, Edie Sedgwick, Slant 6, and Andalusians. Many of these acts, notably Q and Not U and Black Eyes, are influential and experimental post-hardcore bands.

==Legacy==
Dischord Records influenced many other labels such as Simple Machines, Lovitt Records and DeSoto Records.

<doc id="155681" wikidata="Q1424762" url="?curid=155681" title="Horatio Hornblower">
<text>Horatio Hornblower is a fictional officer in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, the protagonist of a series of novels and stories by C. S. Forester. He later became the subject of films and radio and television programmes, and C. Northcote Parkinson elaborated a &quot;biography&quot; of him, &quot;The True Story of Horatio Hornblower&quot;.

Forester&#x27;s series about Hornblower tales began with the novel &quot;The Happy Return&quot; (US title: &quot;Beat to Quarters&quot;), published in 1937. Herein, Hornblower is a captain on a secret mission to Central America in 1808. Later stories fill out his career, starting with his unpromising beginning as a seasick midshipman. As the Napoleonic Wars progress, he steadily gains promotion as a result of his skill and daring, despite his initial poverty and lack of influential friends. After surviving many adventures in a wide variety of locales, he rises to become Admiral of the Fleet.

== Inspirations ==
Forester&#x27;s original inspiration was an old copy of the &quot;Naval Chronicle&quot; that described the effective dates of the Treaty of Ghent. Two countries could be at war in one part of the world after a peace was obtained months before in another part because of the time required to communicate around the world. The burdens that this placed on captains far from home led Forester to invent a character struggling with the stresses of a &quot;man alone&quot;.

Many parallels exist between Hornblower and real naval officers of the period, notably Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson, Sir George Cockburn, Lord Cochrane, Sir Edward Pellew, Jeremiah Coghlan, Sir James Gordon, and Sir William Hoste. The actions of the Royal Navy at the time, documented in official reports and in the &quot;Naval Chronicle&quot;, provided much of the material for Hornblower&#x27;s fictional adventures.

The name &quot;Horatio&quot; was inspired by the character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and chosen also because of its association with contemporary figures such as Nelson. The surname &quot;Hornblower&quot; comes from Arthur Hornblow, a Hollywood producer who was a colleague and friend of Forester&#x27;s.

Frederick Marryat has been identified as &quot;the father of the seafaring adventure novel from which all others followed, from C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower to Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin&quot;. Hornblower and the eponymous protagonist of Marryat&#x27;s novel &quot;Peter Simple&quot; both start their careers rather unpromisingly and without influential friends, but advance through hard work, honesty, and bravery. Both fight duels before their careers have properly started and both are taken prisoner early in their careers.

==Characteristics==
Hornblower is courageous and intelligent, and a skilled seaman, but he is burdened by intense reserve, introspection, and self-doubt, and is described as &quot;unhappy and lonely&quot;. Despite numerous personal feats of extraordinary skill and cunning, he belittles his own achievements by numerous rationalisations, remembering only his fears. He consistently ignores or is unaware of the admiration in which he is held by his fellow sailors. He regards himself as cowardly, dishonest, and at times, disloyal, never crediting his ability to persevere, think rapidly, organise, or cut to the heart of a matter. His sense of duty, his hard work, and his drive to succeed make these imagined negative characteristics undetectable by everyone but him. He frets obsessively over petty failures that reinforce his poor self-image. His introverted nature and incredibly high standards isolate him from the people around him, including his closest friend, William Bush, with whom he is frequently foul-tempered. He is guarded with almost everyone, unless the matter is the business of discharging his duty as a king&#x27;s officer, when he is clear and decisive.

Hornblower possesses a highly developed sense of duty, refusing to put personal benefit in the way of the best interests of his service and his country. This is frequently misinterpreted by those around him as either modesty or false humility, though he often fails to even recognise the possibility existed until it is pointed out to him in retrospect. On occasion, however, he is able to set his duty aside, usually in order to show loyalty to someone he respects. For example, in &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;, he contrives an escape for his personal steward who would otherwise have been hanged for striking a superior officer. Hornblower is philosophically opposed to flogging and capital punishment, and is pained when circumstances or the Articles of War force him to impose such sentences.

He suffers from seasickness at the start of each of his voyages. As a midshipman, he becomes seasick at the sheltered roadstead of Spithead. He is tone-deaf and finds music an incomprehensible irritant; in a scene in &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;, he is unable to recognise the British national anthem.

A voracious reader, he can provide discourse on both contemporary and classical literature. His skill at mathematics makes him both an adept navigator and a talented whist player. He uses his ability at whist to supplement his income during a poverty-stricken period of inactivity. Due to time spent as a prisoner of war early in his career, he is adept in both French and Spanish, which frequently proves useful in when fighting ships of those nationalities.

== Analysis and reception ==
With Hornblower, C. S. Forester is credited with inventing the naval historical novel. Stephanie Jones called Hornblower &quot;the most renowned sailor in contemporary fiction&quot;.

Igor Webb noted that Forester intended for the books to be read by adults, but they have become popular among adolescents as well.

Forester wrote the Hornblower series to avoid entanglements with real-world history. Hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval victory occurs during the Napoleonic Wars. Similarly during the War of 1812 he was never in a battle with Americans.

== Fictional biography ==

=== Youth ===
Hornblower is born in Kent, the son of a physician. He has no inherited wealth or influential connections who can advance his career. In &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, the first novel published, Hornblower&#x27;s age is given as 37 in July 1808, implying a birth year of 1770 or 1771. However, when Forester decided to write about Hornblower&#x27;s early career in the sixth novel &quot;Mr Midshipman Hornblower&quot;, he made his hero about five years younger, giving his birth date as 4 July 1776, the date of the adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence. This adjustment allows Hornblower to begin his career in wartime. He is given a classical education, and by the time he joins the Royal Navy, at the age of 17, he is well versed in Greek and Latin. He is tutored in French by a penniless French &quot;émigré &quot;and has an aptitude for mathematics, which serves him well as a navigator.

=== Early career ===
Hornblower&#x27;s early exploits are many and varied. He joins the Royal Navy as a midshipman, where he is bullied and tries to resolve the matter by forcing a duel with his tormentor. He is then transferred to under Edward Pellew and distinguishes himself. He fends off fire ships, which interrupt his (failed) first examination for promotion to lieutenant. He is given command of the sloop &quot;Le Rêve&quot; while still only an acting lieutenant; the vessel blunders into a Spanish fleet in the fog, resulting in Hornblower&#x27;s capture and imprisonment in Ferrol. During his captivity, he acquires a fluent knowledge of both Galician and Spanish, and is finally confirmed as a commissioned lieutenant. He leads a daring rescue of Spanish crewmen from a shipwreck during a storm, which leads to his being picked up by a British warship patrolling offshore; since he had given his Spanish captors his parole that he would not escape, though, he insists upon being returned to captivity. The Spanish release him for his bravery.

As a junior lieutenant, he serves in HMS &quot;Renown&quot; under Captain Sawyer, whose bouts of paranoia on a mission to the Caribbean strain discipline to breaking point. On this voyage, he begins his long friendship with William Bush, at the time his senior in rank. Due to his exploits, Hornblower is made commander, but his promotion is not confirmed when he returns to England following the Peace of Amiens. This causes him great financial distress; he has to repay the difference between a commander&#x27;s pay and a lieutenant&#x27;s from his meagre half-pay. He uses his skill at whist to supplement his income, playing for money with admirals and other distinguished men in an officers&#x27; club.

==== HMS &quot;Hotspur&quot; ====
In 1803, renewed hostilities against France seem imminent, and Hornblower is confirmed in the rank of commander, and appointed captain of the sloop-of-war . Before sailing, he marries Maria, the daughter of his landlady, despite his doubts about the match. Maria dotes upon the irritable Hornblower in ways that he finds vexing; she annoys him with both her ignorance and hero-worship of him. However, he warms to her over the course of several books and becomes a good (though not perfect) husband to her and father to their two children, Horatio and Maria.

After gruelling service during the blockade of Brest aboard &quot;Hotspur&quot;, he is promised a promotion to post captain by Commander-in-Chief William Cornwallis and is recalled to England. He meets the Secretary of the Admiralty and the rank is conferred when Hornblower agrees to take part in a dangerous mission he himself has suggested—delivering forged letters to Admiral Villeneuve that lead the French fleet to sortie, leading to the British victory at Trafalgar.

==== HMS &quot;Atropos&quot; ====
Following this exploit, Hornblower is given command of the sixth-rate ship HMS &quot;Atropos&quot;. His first task is to organise Nelson&#x27;s funeral procession along the River Thames and he has to deal with the near-sinking of the barge conveying the hero&#x27;s coffin.

&quot;Atropos&quot; is ordered to join the British Mediterranean fleet. Hornblower is sent on a secret mission to recover gold and silver from a sunken British transport on the bottom of Marmorice Bay within the Ottoman Empire with the aid of pearl divers from Ceylon. The operation is successful, though Hornblower has a narrow escape from a Turkish warship intent on capturing the gold.

After unloading the treasure at Gibraltar, &quot;Atropos&quot; and another British warship capture a large Spanish frigate after a desperate battle. In the friendly port of Palermo, Hornblower oversees the repairs of the battle damage, but just as this work is finished, the ship is given to the King of the Two Sicilies to keep him as an ally. Returning to England, Hornblower finds his two young children dying of smallpox.

==== HMS &quot;Lydia&quot; ====
Later in the timeline, but written of in the first novel in order of publication, he makes a long, difficult voyage in command of the frigate HMS &quot;Lydia&quot; round the Horn to the Pacific, where his mission is to support a megalomaniac, El Supremo, in his rebellion against the Spanish. He captures &quot;Natividad&quot;, a much more powerful Spanish ship, but reluctantly has to cede it to El Supremo to placate him. When he finds that the Spanish have switched sides in the interim, he is forced to find and sink the ship he had captured—adding injury to insult, as he had given up the prize money to maintain the uneasy alliance with the madman.

Hornblower also takes on an important passenger in Panama, Lady Barbara Wellesley, the fictional younger sister of Arthur Wellesley (later to become the Duke of Wellington). He is at first nettled and infuriated by her forthright and outspoken manner, her ability to see easily through his reserve, and the great social gap between them. Over time, however, her beauty, strength, and intelligence win his heart, and the two become dangerously attracted to each other. Before things get out of hand, Hornblower informs Lady Barbara that he is married. She leaves the &quot;Lydia&quot; two days later when they rendezvous with other British ships. Hornblower fears for his career, having offended &quot;the daughter of an earl, the sister of a marquis&quot;.

=== HMS &quot;Sutherland&quot; ===
After these exploits, he is given command of HMS &quot;Sutherland&quot;, a 74-gun ship of the line. His feelings are disturbed during this period by the fact that his commander, Admiral Leighton, has recently married Lady Barbara. The admiral treats Hornblower with disdain.

While waiting at his Mediterranean rendezvous point for the rest of his squadron—and its commander—to arrive, he carries out a series of raids against the French along the south coast of Spain, earning the nickname &quot;the terror of the Mediterranean&quot;. After saving Admiral Leighton&#x27;s flagship, HMS &quot;Pluto&quot;, which had become dismasted in stormy seas, from the French battery at Rosas, he learns that a French squadron of four ships of the line has slipped the blockade at Toulon. He decides that his duty requires that he fight them at one-to-four odds to prevent them from entering a well-protected harbour. In the process, his ship is crippled, and with two-thirds of the crew incapacitated (including Lt. Bush), he surrenders to the French, but not before severely crippling three of the French ships and damaging the fourth. As a prisoner in Rosas, he witnesses the destruction of the French ships at anchor by Leighton&#x27;s squadron.

He is sent with his coxswain, Brown, and his injured first lieutenant, Bush, to Paris for a show trial and execution on charges of piracy for using a false flag to enter a French-held harbour despite him raising the British ensign before opening fire. During the journey, Hornblower and his companions escape. After a winter sojourn at the chateau of the Comte de Graçay, during which he has an affair with the nobleman&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law, the escapees travel down the River Loire to the coastal city of Nantes. There, he recaptures a Royal Navy cutter, the &quot;Witch of Endor&quot;, mans the vessel with a commandeered gang of galley prisoners, and escapes to the Channel Fleet.

As an indication of Admiralty approval of Hornblower&#x27;s actions, Lt. Bush is promoted into &quot;Witch of Endor&quot; as commander, and shortly thereafter to post captain, with &quot;the dockyard job at Sheerness waiting for [him].&quot;

When Hornblower arrives home, he discovers that his first wife Maria has died in childbirth, that the baby boy survives, and that Lady Barbara (now widowed after Admiral Leighton died of wounds sustained during the attack on Rosas that Hornblower had observed as a prisoner) has taken charge of the child, with her brothers Lords Wellesley and Wellington acting as godfathers.

Hornblower faces a mandatory court-martial for the loss of the &quot;Sutherland&quot;, but is &quot;most honourably acquitted.&quot; A national hero in the eyes of the public and a useful propaganda tool for various politicians and the Prince Regent, he is made a Knight of the Order of the Bath and appointed a Colonel of Marines (a &quot;sinecure&quot; which confers a salary without any additional duties).

Hornblower and Lady Barbara are now free (after a decent interval) to marry. They move to the fictional village of Smallbridge, Kent, where Hornblower has purchased an estate. However, the new lord of the manor longs for the sea.

=== Flag officer ===
A return to duty comes when he is appointed to be commodore and sent with a squadron of small craft on a mission to the Baltic Sea, where he must be a diplomat as much as an officer. He foils an assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander I of Russia and is influential in the monarch&#x27;s decision to resist the French invasion of the Russian Empire. While at the court of the tsar, it is implied that he is unfaithful to Barbara, dallying with a young Russian noblewoman. He provides assistance in the siege of Riga, employing his bomb ketches against the French army, where he meets General Carl von Clausewitz of the Prussian Army.

Ill with typhus, he returns to England. Upon his recovery, he is tasked with dealing with mutineers off the coast of France. After tricking the French into attacking the mutinous ship, he rounds up the rebels, personally shooting their ringleader as he tries to escape. When he is approached by a French official willing to negotiate the surrender of a major port, he seizes the opportunity and engineers the return of the Bourbons to France. He is rewarded by being created a peer as Baron Hornblower of Smallbridge in the County of Kent. However, his satisfaction is marred by the death in action of his friend, Bush.

When Napoleon returns from exile at the start of the Hundred Days, Hornblower is staying at the estate of the Comte de Graçay. While there, he renews his affair with Marie de Graçay. When the French Army goes over to Napoleon &quot;en masse&quot;, Hornblower, the Count, and his family choose to fight rather than flee to Britain. He leads a Royalist guerrilla force, and causes the returned Emperor&#x27;s forces much grief before his band is finally cornered; in a desperate shootout, Marie is slain, and Hornblower is captured. After a brusque hearing before a military tribunal, the Count and he are both sentenced to death, but he is granted a stay of execution and ultimately released due to Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.

After several years ashore, he is promoted to rear admiral and appointed naval Commander-in-Chief of the West Indies. He foils an attempt by veterans of Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard to free Napoleon from his captivity on Saint Helena, captures a slave ship, and encounters Simón Bolívar&#x27;s army. He also discovers a plot by Lady Barbara to engineer the escape of a Marine bandsman sentenced to death for a minor offence. He overlooks her breach of the law and reassures her of his love. While attempting to return to England, the Hornblowers are caught in a hurricane, and Horatio saves Barbara&#x27;s life from the storm. In a moment of terror and desperation, she reveals that she never loved her first husband, only him. Hornblower retires to Kent and eventually becomes Admiral of the Fleet.

His final achievement occurs at his home, when he assists a seemingly mad man claiming to be Napoleon to travel to France. That person turns out to be Napoleon III, the nephew of Hornblower&#x27;s great nemesis and the future president and later emperor of France. For his assistance, Lord Hornblower is created a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. It is to be noted that this final story, while an interesting addition to the saga, is empirically incompatible with historical fact, since the Duke of Wellington, Lady Barbara’s brother and Hornblower’s own brother-in-law, died some days before Napoleon III’s hasty return to France. It is inconceivable that Barbara and Hornblower would have been sitting quietly and contentedly at home during a profound family bereavement, or that Napoleon III would have failed to offer his condolences on the death of Lady Barbara’s own renowned brother. 

Be that as it may, at the end of his long and heroic career, Hornblower is wealthy, famous, and contented, a beloved, indulgent husband and father, and finally free of the insecurities and self-loathing that had driven him throughout his life.

Forester provides two different brief summaries of Hornblower&#x27;s career. The first was in the first chapter of &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, which was the first Hornblower novel written. The second occurs midway through &quot;The Commodore&quot;, when Czar Alexander asks him to describe his career. The two accounts are incompatible. The first account would have made Hornblower about five years older than the second. The second account is more nearly compatible with the rest of Hornblower&#x27;s career, but it omits the time he spent as a commander in &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;. There are other discrepancies as well; in one account of his defeat of a Spanish frigate in the Mediterranean, he distinguished himself as lieutenant and in another he is a post-captain with less than three years&#x27; seniority. In &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, Bush is serving with Hornblower for the first time, but other books in the series set earlier in his career completely disregard that. It appears that these discrepancies arose as the series matured and accounts needed to be modified to coincide with his age and career.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s biography ===
C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a fictional biography of Hornblower with the encouragement of C. S. Forester&#x27;s widow, detailing his career and personal information. It corrects or elucidates some questionable points in the novels, and includes a confession that Hornblower kicked Captain Sawyer down the hatchway of the &quot;Renown&quot;. It adds subsequent careers of Lord Hornblower&#x27;s relatives, ending with the present Viscount Hornblower&#x27;s emigration to South Africa in the late 1960s. According to Parkinson, Hornblower in later life became a director of P&amp;O, governor of Malta (1829–1831), commander in chief at Chatham (1832–1835), a viscount (in 1850), and Admiral of the Fleet, dying at the age of 80 on 12 January 1857.

This biography has confused some readers, who have taken it as a factual work. Parkinson includes in Horatio&#x27;s family tree a number of real-life Hornblowers. They include:
* Jonathan Hornblower senior and Jonathan Hornblower junior, noted engineers who designed and worked with steam engines in Cornish mines in the late 18th century
* Josiah Hornblower, an engineer who moved to America and became speaker of the New England Assembly
* Jabez Carter Hornblower, son of Jonathan junior and another engineer

==Bibliography==
The Hornblower canon by Forester consists of 11 novels (one unfinished) and five short stories.
In addition, &quot;The Hornblower Companion&quot; includes maps showing where the action took place in the 10 complete novels and Forester&#x27;s notes on how they were written.

Another short story, &quot;The Point and the Edge&quot;, is included only as an outline in &quot;The Hornblower Companion&quot;. The following diagram shows the relationship between the dates of the stories&#x27; action and of their publication.

=== Omnibus publications ===
The first three novels written, &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot;, and &quot;Flying Colours&quot; were collected as &quot;Captain Hornblower R.N&quot; (1939) by Michael Joseph and as &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower&quot; (1939) by Little Brown in the US. Both a single-volume edition and a three-volume edition (in a slip case) were published.

&quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot;, &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot;, and &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot; were compiled in one book, variously titled &quot;Hornblower&#x27;s Early Years&quot;, &quot;Horatio Hornblower Goes to Sea&quot;, or &quot;The Young Hornblower&quot;. &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot; was replaced by &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot; in later UK editions of &quot;The Young Hornblower&quot;.

&quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot;, &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, and &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot; were compiled into one omnibus edition, called &quot;Captain Hornblower&quot;.

&quot;Flying Colours&quot;, &quot;The Commodore&quot;, &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;, and &quot;Hornblower in the West Indies&quot; were presented as a third omnibus edition called &quot;Admiral Hornblower&quot; to fill out the series.

&quot;Commodore Hornblower&quot;, &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;, and &quot;Hornblower in the West Indies&quot; were also compiled into one book, called &quot;The Indomitable Hornblower&quot;.

Four &quot;Cadet Editions&quot; were released by Little Brown and later by Michael Joseph, each collecting two Hornblower novels and edited for younger readers:
&quot;Hornblower Goes to Sea&quot; (1953, 1954), from &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot;;
&quot;Hornblower Takes Command&quot; (1953, 1954), from &quot;Hornblower and The Atropos&quot; and &quot;Beat To Quarters&quot;;
&quot;Hornblower in Captivity&quot; (1939, 1955), from &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot; and &quot;Flying Colours&quot;; and
&quot;Hornblower&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (1946, 1955), from &quot;Commodore Hornblower&quot; and &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;.

The short stories &quot;The Hand of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Hornblower&#x27;s Charitable Offering&quot;, and &quot;Hornblower and His Majesty&quot; plus other Hornblower material not previously published in book-form were collected in &quot;Hornblower One More Time&quot; (4 July 1976) though only 350 copies were printed.

As of June 2017 Amazon offers an electronic (Kindle) omnibus, &quot;Hornblower Addendum&quot;, consisting of the stories: &quot;Hornblower and the Hand of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Hornblower and the Widow McCool&quot;, &quot;Hornblower&#x27;s Charitable Offering&quot;, &quot;Hornblower and His Majesty&quot;, and &quot;The Last Encounter&quot;, although two of these are also included in the book &quot;Hornblower During the Crisis&quot;.

=== Serialisation ===
The Hornblower novels were all serialised in US periodicals and most also in UK periodicals. Except for the first novel &quot;Beat to Quarters&quot;, the serialisations appeared before the books.

== In other media ==

=== Screen adaptations ===
* The film &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower&quot; (1951) stars Gregory Peck in the title role, encompassing the events in &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot;, and &quot;Flying Colours&quot;, with C. S. Forester sharing writing credits. Peck and co-star Virginia Mayo would recreate their roles on a one-hour &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; program broadcast on 21 January 1952, which is included as an audio-only feature in the film&#x27;s DVD release.
* An episode of the American TV series &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Hornblower&quot; (1963) starring David Buck in the title role was based on &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;
* The ITV and A&amp;E television series &quot;Hornblower&quot; (1998–2003) starred Ioan Gruffudd as Hornblower, and included stories from &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot;, &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot;, and &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;.

=== Radio adaptations ===
* Michael Redgrave played Hornblower in a radio series of the same name between 1952 and 1953, later rebroadcast over Mutual in the United States syndicated via Towers of London.
* Nicholas Fry played Hornblower in the radio series &quot;The Hornblower Story&quot; in 1979/80 for the BBC (20 × 30 min.). This series covers the books, &quot;Mr Midshipman Hornblower&quot;, &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot;, &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot; and &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;.

=== Literary appearances ===
* In the fictional setting of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; by Alan Moore, Hornblower is the equivalent of Lord Nelson, with &quot;The Black Dossier&quot; (2007) depicting Hornblower&#x27;s Column as one of London&#x27;s most popular landmarks.
* A &quot;biography&quot;, called &quot;The Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower&quot;, was published in 1970 by C. Northcote Parkinson which gives various scholarly &quot;corrections&quot; to the stories told by Hornblower&#x27;s creator.
* In Dudley Pope&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Ramage&quot;, Hornblower is mentioned in passing as a former shipmate of the title character, Lord Ramage, when both were midshipmen.
* Sten Nadolny&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Discovery of Slowness&quot; contains allusions to the Hornblower cycle. For instance, the &quot;Lydia&quot; is written among other vessels in a sailor&#x27;s bar in Plymouth. Lieutenant Gerard who appears in &quot;The Happy Return&quot; and &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot; is mentioned several times.
* In Dewey Lambdin&#x27;s &quot;King, Ship, and Sword&quot;, the main character Alan Lewrie (another fictional British captain of the era) makes a visit to the Admiralty and takes particular note of a tall, thin lieutenant in a threadbare uniform with a melancholy expression. While the lieutenant&#x27;s name is never mentioned, he displays several of Hornblower&#x27;s best-known characteristics, and the state of a penniless lieutenant fits with the events at the end of &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot; (this scene takes place during the Peace of Amiens).

== Legacy ==
Ernest Hemingway is quoted as saying, &quot;I recommend Forester to everyone literate I know&quot;, and Winston Churchill stated, &quot;I find &quot;Hornblower&quot; admirable.&quot;

The popular Richard Sharpe novels by Bernard Cornwell were inspired by the Hornblower series; Cornwell avidly read the series as a child, and was disappointed to learn that there was no similar series chronicling the Napoleonic Wars on land, so he set out to rectify this.

The first of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey/Maturin novels was commissioned by an editor at American publisher J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., who thought that it was likely that O&#x27;Brian could write more novels in the Hornblower genre.

The Richard Bolitho series by Douglas Reeman (writing as Alexander Kent) has drawn him acclaim &quot;as the true heir to the highly successfully C. S. Forester [author of the Horatio Hornblower series of sea adventures].&quot;

Dudley Pope was encouraged by C. S. Forester to create his Lord Ramage series of novels set around the same period.

Gene Roddenberry was influenced by the Hornblower character while creating the &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard. Nicholas Meyer, director of some of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, frequently cites Horatio Hornblower as one of his primary influences.

David Weber&#x27;s character Honor Harrington closely parallels Hornblower, and Weber deliberately gave her the same initials. Like Hornblower, Harrington comes from a modest background, lacking patronage of any sort, and throughout the series accrues promotions, peerages and other honours, rising to the rank of admiral.

Lois McMaster Bujold&#x27;s Vorkosigan Saga uses the Hornblower series as a structural model.

The astronauts of the 1972 Apollo 17 mission to the Moon named a small crater near the landing site Horatio in honour of Horatio Hornblower.

In 1980, US President Jimmy Carter gave his speech accepting the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination on August 14. This was notable for his gaffe intended to be a tribute to Hubert Humphrey, whom he referred to as &quot;Hubert Horatio Hornblower&quot;.

<text>Ital, also spelled I-tal (), is food often celebrated by those in the Rastafari movement. It is compulsory in the Bobo Ashanti and Nyabinghi mansions, though not in the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The word derives from the English word &quot;vital&quot;, with the initial &quot;v&quot; removed. This emphasis on the letter &quot;I&quot; is done to many words in the Rastafari vocabulary to signify the unity of the speaker with God and all of nature. 
The expression of Ital eating varies widely from Rasta to Rasta, and there are few universal rules of Ital living. 

The primary goal of adhering to an Ital diet is to increase liveliness. The life energy that Rastafari generally believe lives within all human beings, as conferred from the Almighty, is referred to as Livity. A common tenet of Rastafari beliefs is the sharing of a central Livity among living things, and what is put into one&#x27;s body should enhance Livity rather than reduce it. Though there are different interpretations of ital regarding specific foods, the general principle is that food should be natural, or pure, and directly from the earth; Rastafari therefore often avoid food which is chemically modified or contains artificial additives (e.g., colour, flavourings, and preservatives). Some also avoid added salt in foods, especially salt with the artificial addition of iodine, while pure sea or kosher salt is eaten by some. In strict interpretations, foods that have been produced using chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizer are not considered ital. Early adherents adopted their dietary laws based on their interpretation of several books of the Bible, including the Book of Genesis (&quot;Then God said, &quot;I give you every Seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.&quot; (Genesis 1:29)), the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Along with growing dreadlocks and the sacramental smoking of ganja, observing a vegetarian diet is one of the practices early Rastafari adopted from Indian indentured servants living in Jamaica. Rastafari&#x27;s founder, Leonard Howell, affectionately called &quot;Gong&quot; and &quot;Gyangunguru Maragh&quot;, though not of Indian descent, was fascinated with Hindu practices and was instrumental in promoting a plant-based diet in the Rastafari community of Pinnacle.

==Vegetarianism==
Most expressions of the Ital diet include adherence to a strict vegetarian diet. This is based in part on the belief that since meat is dead, eating it would therefore work against Livity elevation. It is also practiced because as strict adherents to natural living, Rastafarians often believe the human being is a natural vegetarian based on human physiology and anatomy. Some adherents to Ital diets are strict vegans, as they do not consider dairy to be natural for human consumption either. Despite most adherents being vegetarian, some consider fish to be acceptable.

==Drugs==
Rastafari does not approve of alcohol consumption. However, some choose to drink alcohol in moderation as long as it does not reach a level that clouds the mind or reduces their livity. Most Rastas disapprove of cigarettes due to the serious health concerns associated with their use, and some avoid coffee and other caffeinated beverages (though this is less common). Some Rastafari grow their own coffee, sugar, and cocoa.

==Other restrictions==
The strictest interpretations also avoid the consumption of rock salt (sea salt can be substituted), and food that has been preserved by canning or drying, and even prohibit the use of metal cooking utensils. In this case, only clay and wood cooking pots, crockery, and cutlery are used. Few adherents of ital follow the strictest interpretation; some Rastafarians do not adhere to them at all.

<text>Christie&#x27;s is a British auction house founded in 1766 by James Christie. Its main premises are on King Street, St James&#x27;s in London, and it has additional salerooms in New York, Paris, Hong Kong, Milan, Amsterdam, Geneva, Shanghai, and Dubai. It is owned by Groupe Artémis, the holding company of François Pinault. In 2022 Christie&#x27;s sold US$8.4 billion in art and luxury goods, an all-time high for any auction house. On 15 November 2017, the &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; was sold at Christie&#x27;s in New York for $450 million to Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah Al Saud, the highest price ever paid for a painting.

== History ==
=== Founding ===

The official company literature states that founder James Christie (1730–1803) conducted the first sale in London on 5 December 1766, and the earliest auction catalogue the company retains is from December 1766. However, other sources note that James Christie rented auction rooms from 1762, and newspaper advertisements for Christie&#x27;s sales dating from 1759 have also been traced. After his death, Christie&#x27;s son, James Christie the Younger (1773–1831) took over the business.

=== 20th century ===

Christie&#x27;s was a public company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, from 1973 to 1999. In 1974, Jo Floyd was appointed chairman of Christie&#x27;s. He served as chairman of Christie&#x27;s International plc from 1976 to 1988, until handing over to Lord Carrington, and later was a non-executive director until 1992. Christie&#x27;s International Inc. held its first sale in the United States in 1977. Christie&#x27;s growth was slow but steady since 1989, when it had 42% of the auction market.
In 1990, the company reversed a long-standing policy and guaranteed a minimum price for a collection of artworks in its May auctions. In 1996, sales exceeded those of Sotheby&#x27;s for the first time since 1954. However, profits did not grow at the same pace; from 1993 through 1997, Christie&#x27;s annual pretax profits were about $60M , whereas Sotheby&#x27;s annual pretax profits were about $265M for those years.

In 1993, Christie&#x27;s paid $10.9M for the London gallery Spink &amp; Son, which specialised in Oriental art and British paintings; the gallery was run as a separate entity. The company bought Leger Gallery for $3.3M in 1996, and merged it with Spink to become Spink-Leger. Spink-Leger closed in 2002. To make itself competitive with Sotheby&#x27;s in the property market, Christie&#x27;s bought Great Estates in 1995, then the largest network of independent estate agents in North America, changing its name to Christie&#x27;s Great Estates Inc.

In December 1997, under the chairmanship of Lord Hindlip, Christie&#x27;s put itself on the auction block, but after two months of negotiations with the consortium-led investment firm SBC Warburg Dillon Read it did not attract a bid high enough to accept. In May 1998, François Pinault&#x27;s holding company, Groupe Artémis S.A., first bought 29.1 per cent of the company for $243.2M, and subsequently purchased the rest of it in a deal that valued the entire company at $1.2bn. The company has since not been reporting profits, though it gives sale totals twice a year. Its policy, in line with UK accounting standards, is to convert non-UK results using an average exchange rate weighted daily by sales throughout the year.

=== 21st century ===

In 2002, Christie&#x27;s France held its first auction in Paris.

Like Sotheby&#x27;s, Christie&#x27;s became increasingly involved in high-profile private transactions. In 2006, Christie&#x27;s offered a reported $21M guarantee to the Donald Judd Foundation and displayed the artist&#x27;s works for five weeks in an exhibition that later won an AICA award for &quot;Best Installation in an Alternative Space&quot;. In 2007 it brokered a $68M deal that transferred Thomas Eakins&#x27;s &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot; (1875) from the Jefferson Medical College at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia to joint ownership by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. In the same year, the Haunch of Venison gallery became a subsidiary of the company.

On 28 December 2008, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Pinault&#x27;s debts left him &quot;considering&quot; the sale of Christie&#x27;s and that a number of &quot;private equity groups&quot; were thought to be interested in its acquisition. In January 2009, the company employed 2,100 people worldwide, though an unspecified number of staff and consultants were soon to be cut due to a worldwide downturn in the art market; later news reports said that 300 jobs would be cut. With sales for premier Impressionist, Modern, and contemporary artworks tallying only US$248.8M in comparison to US$739M just a year before, a second round of job cuts began after May 2009.

In 2012, Impressionist works, which dominated the market during the 1980s boom, were replaced by contemporary art as Christie&#x27;s top category. Asian art was the third most lucrative area. With income from classic auctioneering falling, treaty sales made £413.4 million ($665M) in the first half of 2012, an increase of 53% on the same period last year; they now represent more than 18% of turnover. The company has since promoted curated events, centred on a theme rather than an art classification or time period.

As part of a companywide review in 2017, Christie&#x27;s announced the layoffs of 250 employees, or 12 per cent of the total work force, based mainly in Britain and Europe.

In June 2021, Christie&#x27;s Paris held its first sale dedicated to women artists, most notably Louise Moillon&#x27;s &quot;Nature morte aux raisins et pêches&quot;.

In 2022 Christie&#x27;s sold $8.4bn in art and luxury goods, an all-time high for any auction house.

Christie&#x27;s agreed to acquire American classic car auction house, Gooding &amp; Company, in September 2024.

== Commissions ==
From 2008 until 2013, Christie&#x27;s charged 25 per cent for the first $50,000; 20 per cent on the amount between $50,001 and $1M, and 12 per cent on the rest. From 2013, it charged 25 per cent for the first $75,000; 20 per cent on the next $75,001 to $1.5M and 12 per cent on the rest.

As of 2023, Christie&#x27;s commission (buyer&#x27;s premium) is 26 per cent of the hammer price of each lot up to £800,000/US$1,000,000, plus 21 per cent of the hammer price from £800,001/US$1,000,001 up to and including £4,500,000/US$6,000,000, and 15 per cent on the rest.

== Locations ==
As of 2023, Christie&#x27;s has offices in 46 countries worldwide, with salerooms in London, New York, Paris, Geneva, Milan, Amsterdam, Dubai, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.

=== Europe ===
Christie&#x27;s flagship saleroom is in London on King Street in St. James&#x27;s, where it has been based since 1823. It had a second London saleroom in South Kensington which opened in 1975 and primarily handled the middle market. Christie&#x27;s permanently closed the South Kensington saleroom in July 2017 as part of their restructuring plans announced in March 2017. The closure was due in part to a considerable decrease in sales between 2015 and 2016 in addition to the company expanding its online sales presence.

In early 2017, Christie&#x27;s also announced plans to scale back its operation in Amsterdam.

=== Americas ===
In 1977, led by then Chairman Stephen Lash, the company opened its first international branch on Park Avenue in New York City in the Delmonico&#x27;s Hotel grand ballroom on the second floor; in 1997 it took a 30-year lease on a space in Rockefeller Center for $40M.

Until 2001, Christie&#x27;s East, a division that sold lower-priced art and objects, was located at 219 East 67th Street. In 1996, Christie&#x27;s bought a townhouse on East 59th Street in Manhattan as a separate gallery where experts could show clients art in complete privacy to conduct private treaty sales.

Christie&#x27;s opened a Beverly Hills saleroom in 1997. In April 2017, in moved to a two-story flagship space in Beverly Hills, designed by wHY.

=== Asia ===
Christie&#x27;s has been operating a space in Hong Kong&#x27;s Alexandra House since 2014. In 2021, the company announced plans to move its Hong Kong headquarters to the Zaha Hadid-designed luxury tower The Henderson in 2024, where it will launch year-round auctions. Measuring more than over four storeys, the new space, which incorporates a permanent saleroom and galleries, is comparable in size to Christie&#x27;s London headquarters.

The &quot;Dragons&quot; armchair by Irish furniture designer Eileen Gray sold for 21.9M euros, setting an auction record for a piece of 20th century decorative art.
* In 2009, controversy arose again after the auction of two imperial bronze zodiac sculptures (for US$36M) collected by Yves Saint Laurent, as the items had been looted in 1860 from the Old Summer Palace of Beijing by French and British forces at the close of the Second Opium War.
* Christie&#x27;s Hong Kong, November 2009 sale of Fine Modern Chinese Paintings, sold a work by Fu Baoshi titled &quot;Landscape inspired by Dufu&#x27;s Poetic Sentiments&quot;, for HK$60M (US$7.7M) – a world record for the artist.
* Christie&#x27;s auctioned Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Nude, Green Leaves and Bust&quot; on 4 May 2010. The piece sold for US$106.5M, making the sale among the most expensive paintings ever sold.
* On 14 June 2010 Amedeo Modigliani&#x27;s &quot;Tête&quot;, a limestone sculpture of a woman&#x27;s head, sold for $52.6M, making it one of the most expensive sculpture ever sold, and at the time the most expensive work of art sold in France.
* On 18 April 2012, the silver cup given to the marathon winner, Greek athlete Spyridon Louis, at the first modern Olympic Games staged in Athens in 1896 sold for £541,250, breaking the auction record for Olympic memorabilia.
* On 22 June 2012, George Washington&#x27;s personal annotated copy of the &quot;Acts Passed at a Congress of the United States of America&quot; from 1789, which includes The Constitution of the United States and a draft of the Bill of Rights, was sold at Christie&#x27;s for a record $9,826,500, with fees the final cost, to The Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association. This was the record for a document sold at auction.
* On 12 November 2013, Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Three Studies of Lucian Freud&quot; sold for 142.4M(including the buyer&#x27;s premium) to an unnamed buyer, nominally becoming the most expensive work of art ever to be sold at auction.
* On 11 May 2015, Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Les Femmes d&#x27;Alger (&quot;Version O&quot;)&quot; sold for 179.3M to an unnamed buyer, becoming the most expensive work of art ever to be sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s New York. In November of the same year, Amedeo Modigliani&#x27;s &quot;Nu Couché&quot; (1917–18) sold at Christie&#x27;s in New York for $170.4M, making it the second most expensive work sold at auction.
* In May 2016, the Oppenheimer Blue diamond sold for CHF56,837,000, a record price for a jewel at auction.
* On 7 July 2016, the highest price ever sold for an old master painting at Christie&#x27;s was achieved with £44,882,500 for Rubens&#x27; Lot and his Daughters.
* On 11 November 2017, a Patek Philippe Titanium wristwatch Ref. 5208T-010 was sold for $6.226M (CHF6,200,000) in Geneva, making it one of the most expensive watches ever sold at auction.
* On 15 November 2017, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; sold for a record $450.3M (including buyer&#x27;s premium).
* On 4 July 2019, a bust fragment of Tutankhamun was sold for £4.7M. The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities had tried to stop the auction, citing concerns that the bust had been looted from a temple and illegally taken from Egypt in the 1970s.
* On 25 June 2020, Christie&#x27;s sold a Timurid Quran manuscript, described as &quot;rare and breathtaking&quot;, for £7M (with fees), ten times its estimate. The price was the highest price ever paid for a Quran manuscript. Probably created at a Timurid prince&#x27;s court, the manuscript comprised 534 folios of Arabic calligraphy on &quot;gold-flecked, coloured paper from Ming China&quot;. The sale was criticized that since the &quot;object apparently has no provenance prior to the 1980s, we can&#x27;t know anything about the context in which it was removed from its country of origin.&quot;
* In October 2020, Christie&#x27;s sold Stan, one of the world&#x27;s most complete &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; skeletons for US$31.8M, setting a new world record for any dinosaur skeleton or fossil ever sold at auction at the time.
* In May 2022, Andy Warhol&#x27;s silkscreen painting &quot;Shot Sage Blue Marilyn&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for $195M, making it the most expensive work of American art sold at auction and the most expensive work of 20th-century art sold at auction.
* In September and October 2022 at Christie&#x27;s, the &quot;James Bond&quot; film franchise auctioned 61 lots of vehicles, watches, costumes, props, posters, and memorabilia from the 25 Bond films. The auction raised nearly £7M from 28 countries, and proceeds went to over 45 charities.
* In November 2022, the art collection of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was auctioned at Christie&#x27;s New York. It was the biggest sale in art auction history, surpassing $1.5bn in sales. Six works sold for more than $100M: Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Les Poseuses Ensemble (Petite version)&quot;, ($149M, with fees); Paul Cézanne&#x27;s 1888–90 &quot;La Montagne Sainte-Victoire&quot; ($138M); van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Verger avec cyprès&quot; ($117M); and Gustav Klimt&#x27;s 1903 &quot;Birch Forest&quot; ($105M). The auction also included paintings by Botticelli, David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Jan Brueghel the Younger. Proceeds from the auction benefitted undisclosed philanthropies.
* In May 2023, the jewellery collection once owned by Austrian billionaire Heidi Horten, who died in 2022, set a record for the most valuable single collection of jewels in an auction, fetching CHF180M ($201M). In August 2023, Christie&#x27;s cancelled a second Horten jewellery sale, which had been scheduled for November, after Jewish charities and organizations refused to accept portions of the proceeds from the first sale citing the source of Horten&#x27;s wealth.
* In November 2024 a painting by surrealist artist Rene Magritte broke an auction record, selling for more than $121 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York. The previous record for a work by Magritte was $79 million, set in 2022.

== Criticism ==
=== Price-fixing scandal in 2000 ===
In 2000, allegations surfaced of a price-fixing arrangement between Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s. Executives from Christie&#x27;s subsequently alerted the Department of Justice of their suspicions of commission-fixing collusion.

Christie&#x27;s gained immunity from prosecution in the United States as a longtime employee of Christie&#x27;s confessed and cooperated with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Numerous members of Sotheby&#x27;s senior management were fired soon thereafter, and A. Alfred Taubman, the largest shareholder of Sotheby&#x27;s at the time, took most of the blame; he and Dede Brooks (the CEO) were given jail sentences, and Christie&#x27;s, Sotheby&#x27;s and their owners also paid a civil lawsuit settlement of $512M.

=== Insufficient or invalid provenance for looted works ===
Christie&#x27;s has been criticised for &quot;an embarrassing history of a lack of transparency around provenance&quot;. In 2003, Christie&#x27;s was criticised for its handling of two Nazi-looted artworks claimed by heirs of the original Jewish owners. In one case, it refused to divulge to the heirs the location of an Italian painting formerly owned by Jewish Viennese banker Heinrich Graf, looted by the Gestapo. Christie&#x27;s eventually revealed the holder&#x27;s name after the Jewish Community of Vienna filed a successful suit in the UK on behalf of Graf&#x27;s American daughters in late 2004. In the other 2003 case Christie&#x27;s declined to inform the family that it had discovered that a painting consigned to it had been looted from Ulla and Moriz Rosenthal, a Jewish couple murdered in Auschwitz.

On 19 May 2020, the craft supply company Hobby Lobby, who purchased material for loan or donation to The Museum of the Bible, filed a diversity action on the auction house regarding the sale and purchase of the Gilgamesh tablet by private sale agreement on 14 July 2014, allegedly while knowing the Iraqi-origin cuneiform object had a fake provenance. In June 2020, they were forced to withdraw four Greek and Roman antiquities from sale after it was discovered that they came from &quot;sites linked to convicted antiquities traffickers&quot;. The same month, they were criticised for putting up a Benin plaque and two Igbo alusi figures for auction. The plaque was tied to similar plaques taken from Nigeria during the Benin Expedition of 1897 and remained unsold after an auction was held. The alusi figures are alleged to have been taken from Nigeria during the Nigerian Civil War and were sold for €212,500 (after fees), below their low estimate of €250,000. Christie&#x27;s claims to require &quot;verifiable documented provenance that the object was taken out of its source nation prior to the earlier date of 2000, or the date which is legally applicable between the country in which the sale takes place and the source nation&quot;.

In November 2014, Christie&#x27;s had to withdraw a prehistoric sculpture from Sardinia, valued at $800,000–$1.2m, put on auction by Michael Steinhardt, a US-billionaire, who was given a lifetime ban on acquiring further antiquities by the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office in 2021. After having acquired artworks with unverified provenance for years, for example by convicted art dealer Giacomo Medici, Steinhard&#x27;s collection had been subjected to search warrants and investigations since 2017. He finally surrendered 180 looted and illegally smuggled antiquities valued at $70m. According to The Guardian, the district attorney said: &quot;For decades, Michael Steinhardt displayed a rapacious appetite for plundered artefacts without concern for the legality of his actions, the legitimacy of the pieces he bought and sold or the grievous cultural damage he wrought across the globe.

In February 2023 a French court ordered Christie&#x27;s to unconditionally restitute Dutch painting &quot;The Penitent Magdalene&quot;, signed Adriaen van der Werff (1707), looted in 1942 from Lionel Hauser in Paris and last sold by the auction house without any provenance in London in April 2005. Christie&#x27;s had offered the Hauser heirs 50 per cent of the sale price; the heirs refused the offer and took the case to court.

==Blockchain Technology at Auctions==

In 2018, Christie&#x27;s began offering &quot;digital passports&quot; stored on the blockchain to a select number of private collectors purchasing art. These &quot;certificates of ownership&quot; gave the buyer a clear and transparent provenance record of the piece of art they were purchasing, a record that could never be erased or manipulated, and accessible worldwide.

Six years later in October 2024, two Christie&#x27;s auctions exhibited this block-chain technology in the most public events to date. In the first, on 2 October, Christie&#x27;s New York showcased the work of Diane Arbus and Cindy Sherman in &quot;An Eye Towards the Real: Photographs from the Collection of Ambassador Trevor Traina&quot; - a former U.S. ambassador to Austria and founder of the web3 wallet provider &quot;Kresus&quot;. Eight days later, on 10 October, Christie&#x27;s New York auctioned &quot;Ascend&quot;, a digital work created by Ryan Koopmans and Alice Wexell, marking the first time a piece inscribed on Bitcoin&#x27;s Ordinals protocol had been sold in a live auction at Christie’s. Christie&#x27;s sees this &quot;integration of physical and digital ownership&quot; as the future of art auctioning, and the most efficient way for buyers to know they&#x27;ve purchased a work with as accurate and secure a provenance as possible.

== Christie&#x27;s Fine Art Storage Services (CFASS) ==
Christie&#x27;s first ventured into storage services for outside clients in 1984, when it opened a 100,000 square feet brick warehouse in London that was granted &quot;Exempted Status&quot; by HM Revenue and Customs, meaning that property may be imported into the United Kingdom and stored without incurring import duties and VAT. Christie&#x27;s Fine Art Storage Services, or CFASS, is a wholly owned subsidiary that runs Christie&#x27;s storage operation.

In September 2008, Christie&#x27;s signed a 50-year lease on an early 1900s warehouse of the historic N.Y.D. Company in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and subsequently spent $30M converting it into a six-storey, 250,000 square feet art-storage facility. The facility opened in 2010 and features high-tech security and climate controls that maintain a virtually constant 70° and 50% relative humidity.

Located near the Upper Bay tidal waterway near the Atlantic Ocean, the Brooklyn facility was hit by at least one storm surge during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. CFASS subsequently faced client defections and complaints arising from damage to works of art. In 2013, AXA Art Insurance filed a lawsuit in New York court alleging that CFASS&#x27; &quot;gross negligence&quot; during the hurricane damaged art collected by late cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and his wife Jacqueline Rebecca Louise de Rothschild. Later that year, StarNet Insurance Co., the insurer for the LeRoy Neiman Foundation and the artist&#x27;s estate, also filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court claiming that the storage company&#x27;s negligence caused more than $10M in damages to Neiman&#x27;s art.

== Educational and other ventures ==
Christie&#x27;s Education previously offered master&#x27;s degree programs in London and New York, but they were planned to be phased out in 2019. In 2020, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, Christie&#x27;s noted that there was a lack of racial diversity in the art world, and admitted that Christie&#x27;s degree programs only exacerbated these inequities.

However, Christie&#x27;s continue to offer non-degree programmes in London, New York, Hong Kong and Amsterdam as well as online. In addition they offer an Art Business Masterclass Certificate and the Luxury Masterclass Certificate.

With Bonhams, Christie&#x27;s is a shareholder in the London-based Art Loss Register, a privately owned database used by law enforcement services worldwide to trace and recover stolen art.

== Management ==
Since its acquisition by François Pinault, Christie&#x27;s CEOs have been as follows:
* 1999–2010: Edward Dolman
* 2010–2014: Steven Murphy
* 2014–2017: Patricia Barbizet
* 2017–2025: Guillaume Cerutti
* 2025–present: Bonnie Brennan

<text>Speculative fiction is an umbrella genre of fiction that encompasses all the subgenres that depart from realism, or strictly imitating everyday reality, instead presenting fantastical, supernatural, futuristic, or other imaginative realms. This catch-all genre includes, but is not limited to, science fiction, fantasy, supernatural horror, slipstream, magical realism, superhero fiction, alternate history, utopia and dystopia, fairy tales, steampunk, cyberpunk, weird fiction, and some apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction. In other words, it speculates on something supposedly nonexistent within reality.

The term has been used for works of literature, film, television, drama, video games, radio, and their hybrids. 

== Speculative versus realistic fiction ==
The umbrella genre of speculative fiction is characterized by a lesser degree of adherence to realistic or plausible individuals, events, or places, while the umbrella genres of &quot;realistic fiction&quot; or literary realism are characterized by a greater degree of adherence. For instance, speculative fiction may depict an entirely imaginary universe or one in which the laws of nature do not strictly apply (often, the sub-genre of fantasy). Or, it depicts true historical moments, except that they have concluded in a completely imaginary way or been followed by major new events that are completely imaginary (the genre of alternative history). Or, it depicts impossible technology or technology that defies current scientific understandings or capabilities (the genre of science fiction).

Contrarily, realistic fiction involves a story whose basic setting (time and location in the world) is, in fact, real and whose events could believably happen in the context of the real world. One realistic fiction sub-genre is historical fiction, centered around true major events and time periods in the past. The attempt to make stories feel faithful to reality or to more objectively describe details, and the 19th-century artistic movement that began to vigorously promote this approach, is called &quot;literary realism&quot;, which incorporates some works of both fiction and non-fiction.

=== Distinguishing science fiction from other speculative fiction ===
&quot;Speculative fiction&quot; is sometimes abbreviated &quot;spec-fic&quot;, &quot;spec fic&quot;, &quot;specfic&quot;, &quot;S-F&quot;, &quot;SF&quot;, or &quot;sf&quot;. The last three abbreviations, however, are ambiguous as they have long been used to refer to science fiction (which lies within this general range of literature). It is sometimes also known as &quot;the fantastic&quot; or as &quot;fantastika&quot;, the latter term attributed to science fiction scholar John Clute who coined it in 2007 after the term for the genre in some Slavic languages.

The term has been used by some critics and writers dissatisfied with what they consider to be a limitation of science fiction: the need for the story to hold to scientific principles. They argue that &quot;speculative fiction&quot; better defines an expanded, open, imaginative type of fiction than does &quot;genre fiction&quot;, and the categories of &quot;fantasy&quot;, &quot;mystery&quot;, &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;science fiction&quot;. Harlan Ellison used the term to avoid being pigeonholed as a science fiction writer. Ellison, a fervent proponent of writers embracing more literary and modernist directions, broke out of genre conventions to push the boundaries of speculative fiction. 

The term &quot;suppositional fiction&quot; is sometimes used as a sub-category designating fiction in which characters and stories are constrained by an internally consistent world, but not necessarily one defined by any particular genre.

==History==

Speculative fiction as a category ranges from ancient works to paradigm-changing and neotraditional works of the 21st century. Characteristics of speculative fiction have been recognized in older works whose authors&#x27; intentions, or in the social contexts of the stories they portray, are now known. For example, the ancient Greek dramatist, Euripides, () whose play &quot;Medea&quot; seems to have offended Athenian audiences when he speculated that the titular shamaness Medea killed her own children, as opposed to their being killed by other Corinthians after her departure. 

In historiography, what is now called &quot;speculative fiction&quot; has previously been termed &quot;historical invention&quot;, &quot;historical fiction&quot;, and other similar names. These terms have been extensively noted in literary criticism of the works of William Shakespeare, such as when he co-locates Athenian Duke Theseus, Amazonian Queen Hippolyta, English fairy Puck, and Roman god Cupid across time and space in the Fairyland of the fictional Merovingian Germanic sovereign Oberon, in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In mythography the concept of speculative fiction has been termed &quot;mythopoesis&quot;, or mythopoeia. This practice involves the creative design and generation of lore and mythology for works of fiction. The term&#x27;s definition comes from its use by J. R. R. Tolkien, whose novel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, demonstrates a clear application of this process. Themes common in mythopoeia, such as the supernatural, alternate history and sexuality, continue to be explored in works produced within the modern speculative fiction genre.

The creation of speculative fiction in its general sense of hypothetical history, explanation, or ahistorical storytelling, has also been attributed to authors in ostensibly non-fiction modes since as early as Herodotus of Halicarnassus (fl. 5th century BCE), for his &quot;Histories&quot;, and was already both practiced and edited out by early encyclopedic writers like Sima Qian ( or 135 BCE–86 BCE), author of Shiji.

These examples highlight the caveat that many works, now regarded as intentional or unintentional speculative fiction, long predated the coining of the genre term; its concept, in its broadest sense, captures both a conscious and unconscious aspect of human psychology in making sense of the world, and responds to it by creating imaginative, inventive, and artistic expressions. Such expressions can contribute to practical societal progress through interpersonal influences, social and cultural movements, scientific research and advances, and the philosophy of science.

In its English-language usage in arts and literature since the mid 20th century, &quot;speculative fiction&quot; as a genre term has often been attributed to Robert A. Heinlein, who first used the term in an editorial in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, 8 February 1947. In the article, Heinlein used &quot;Speculative Fiction&quot; as a synonym for &quot;science fiction&quot;; in a later piece, he explicitly stated that his use of the term did not include fantasy. However, though Heinlein may have come up with the term on his own, there are earlier citations: a piece in &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1889 used the term in reference to Edward Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Looking Backward: 2000–1887&quot; and other works; and one in the May 1900 issue of &quot;The Bookman&quot; said that John Uri Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Etidorhpa, The End of the Earth&quot; had &quot;created a great deal of discussion among people interested in speculative fiction&quot;. A variation on this term is &quot;speculative literature&quot;.

The use of &quot;speculative fiction&quot; in the sense of expressing dissatisfaction with traditional or establishment science fiction was popularized in the 1960s and early 1970s by Judith Merril, as well as other writers and editors in connection with the New Wave movement. However, this use of the term fell into disuse around the mid-1970s.

In the 2000s, the term came into wider use as a convenient collective term for a set of genres. However, some writers, such as Margaret Atwood, who wrote &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, continue to distinguish &quot;speculative fiction&quot; specifically as a &quot;no Martians&quot; type of science fiction, &quot;about things that really could happen.&quot;

Speculative fiction is also used as a genre term that combines different ones into a single narrative or fictional world such as &quot;science fiction, horror, fantasy...[and]...mystery&quot;.

The Internet Speculative Fiction Database contains a broad list of different subtypes.

According to publisher statistics, men outnumber women about two to one among English-language speculative fiction writers aiming for professional publication. However, the percentages vary considerably by genre, with women outnumbering men in the fields of urban fantasy, paranormal romance and young adult fiction.

Academic journals which publish essays on speculative fiction include &quot;Extrapolation&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot;.

<doc id="155696" wikidata="Q346444" url="?curid=155696" title="Howie Dorough">
<text>Howard Dwaine Dorough (born August 22, 1973), also known as Howie D, is an American singer. He is a member of the pop vocal group Backstreet Boys.

==Early life==
Dorough was born August 22, 1973, in Orlando, Florida, where he met his friend and bandmate AJ McLean through a mutual vocal coach at the Latin carnival in 1989. His mother Paula Flores-Dorough, a school worker, is Puerto Rican, and his father, Hoke Dwaine Dorough, a police officer, former army soldier, real estate developer and bank security, was Irish American. He is the youngest by 10 years of five siblings. His sister, Pollyanna, is also a singer. Another sister, Caroline, died of lupus in September 1998.

==Career==
===Early career===
Dorough&#x27;s love and passion for entertainment started when he was three years old, singing &quot;Babyface&quot; with his little guitar. He started performing around age six or seven, thanks to his sister Polyanna, singing during mass in the church choir and having his first role in the musical adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as a singer and actor. Throughout elementary school, his mother enrolled him in children&#x27;s community theaters and he performed in many community theater productions of top musicals, among them &quot;Sound Of Music,&quot; &quot;Showboat&quot; and &quot;Camelot&quot; and got him in singing/voice and acting lessons by putting him in a performing arts academy where he also took dance lessons in classical ballet, tap, and jazz. He even was in an all-boy ballet troupe. He did Little League once before switching to the arts. During junior high to high school, Dorough sang in the choir, even qualified for All-State Chorus and talent shows, and joined the drama club, acting in school productions and a school TV show called &quot;Macho &amp; Camacho.&quot; He got discovered by an acting agent when he was 14, who gave him the stage name, Tony Donetti, and also managed to land roles in movies, such as &quot;Parenthood&quot; and &quot;Cop and a Half&quot;, a lead role in the Nickelodeon TV production pilot for &quot;Welcome Freshman&quot; and star in a commercial for Disney World he even audition for the Mickey mouse club like his bandmates. He was a victim of bullying as a child for his lack of Spanish language, his falsetto vocal range when he was 12 and his weight.

His choir teacher asked Dorough to perform the National Anthem at his high school basketball game. He agreed but forgot the words when it was time to sing. Despite the extreme embarrassment, he got right back on his horse and began performing again when he sang &#x27;Unchained Melody&#x27; at his school talent show, and got a standing ovation. He also auditioned for a Latin boy band Menudo, but he did not make it. He was also involved in a peer counseling group called Friends, where he talked to other kids about living &quot;a clean life, having fun, going to school, avoiding drugs.&quot; When he&#x27;s not working in the spotlight, he works as a tour guide in Universal Orlando and worked with his sister at Zarro&#x27;s Bread Basket one summer in New York when he was 14.

He was selected &#x27;Most Talented&#x27; and graduated from Edgewater High School in 1991, the Top 10 of his class. After high school, Dorough auditioned for Backstreet Boys under his stage name, but they lost his headshot and contact info; however, after six months, they were able to track him down, thanks to AJ, and was already in the group. He got a scholarship, and attended both University of Central Florida and Valencia College with an Associate of Arts Degree with *NSYNC member, Chris Kirkpatrick.

===Backstreet Boys===
Lou Pearlman created the Backstreet Boys in 1993, selecting Howie Dorough along with AJ McLean, Brian Littrell, Nick Carter, and Kevin Richardson. They were then booked to perform at many venues, such as high schools and shopping malls, and eventually signed a contract with Jive Records in 1994. They slowly became popular in European countries, starting with Germany, and embarked on a tour supporting their debut album. The album slowly climbed to the top ten slots in most countries and was on its way to selling more than 8 million copies.

While their second album, &quot;Backstreet&#x27;s Back&quot;, was being released in Europe, they released their first album in the United States, a compilation of their international debut and &quot;Backstreet&#x27;s Back&quot;. The album climbed to No. 4 on the &quot; Billboard&quot; 200 and sold over 14 million copies. Meanwhile, &quot;Backstreet&#x27;s Back&quot; became an even more significant success than their debut album, opening at the number-one spot in many countries.

Dorough is most known for his infamous fart, which was recorded and used as a part of the beat for the song &quot;The Call&quot; from the Backstreet Boys&#x27; fourth album, Black And Blue.

They started recording &quot;Millennium&quot; in 1998 and released it in May 1999. It became one of the biggest-selling albums ever, taking number one in many countries. Their first single from &quot;Millennium&quot;&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot;, &quot;Shape Of My Heart&quot; was released to radio on October 3. &quot;Black and Blue&quot; recorded first-week sales of 1.59 million copies in the US, making the Backstreet Boys the first artists to back-to-back million album sales.

After releasing their greatest hits album, they went on hiatus and regrouped in 2003. They released their next album, &quot;Never Gone&quot; in 2005. While critics negatively reviewed it, it enjoyed a lot of commercial success. They released their next album, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; in 2007 and the follow-up &quot;This Is Us&quot; in 2009. Their eighth album &quot;In a World Like This&quot; was released on July 30, 2013. Their ninth album &quot; DNA&quot; was released on January 25, 2019, with a new headlining tour following in May of the same year. They have become one of the biggest-selling artists of all time, with record sales exceeding 135 million worldwide.

===Solo projects===
Dorough worked as a producer for singer/songwriter George Nozuka and Katelyn Tarver as part of his management partnership with former 3deep member CJ Huyer, called HC Entertainment, formed in 2004. Since 2010, he&#x27;s also been managing a Canadian band Neverest, under Dorough&#x27;s company, 3 Street Management.

In 2006, he started work on his first solo album. The album would include Spanish/Latin songs as well as American ones. But he eventually changed his mind on the style of the album. Noting that his Spanish was not the best and that he did not want to be something he was not. Around 2010, he started to work on an album that was more pop/r&amp;b style. Dorough&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Back to Me&quot;, was eventually released on November 15, 2011. The album featured many songs that Dorough co-wrote himself. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;100&quot;, was released in the summer of 2011 and received moderate airplay primarily in Canada. Also in November 2011, Dorough joined Britney Spears for her Femme Fatale Tour in South America.

In 2015, while Howie had not announced that he was working on a second solo album, some producers mentioned working with Howie on a new album that is said to be released the same year. On May 9, 2019, he announced on Twitter and Instagram that his new solo album, &quot;Which One Am I,&quot; would be released on July 12, 2019.

Dorough has been private about his romantic connections. According to &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, he dated his singing partner Jennifer during his final year of high school, but they broke up due to his career in 1994, leaving him heartbroken. While touring Europe in 1995 or 1996, he briefly dated a woman named Sabina and then dated a Canadian model named Claudia Opdenkelder. He stated, &quot;I had come out of a relationship, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything serious.&quot;

On December 6, 2000, Dorough met Leigh Anne Boniello, a film executive producer for Warner Brothers and DreamWorks, who was working as the webmaster for the official Backstreet Boys website at the time. Howie and Leigh dated for six years, and in 2006, he proposed to her in front of her family on New Year&#x27;s. A year later, on December 8, 2007, they married in a traditional Catholic ceremony at St. James Cathedral in Orlando, where he was baptized and sang in the choir. They have two sons together.

<text>Sales are activities related to selling or the number of goods sold in a given targeted time period. The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale. A period during which goods are sold for a reduced price may also be referred to as a &quot;sale&quot;.

The seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in an interaction with a &quot;buyer&quot;, which may occur at the point of sale or in response to a purchase order from a customer. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The &quot;seller&quot;, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson, but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including &quot;salesclerk&quot;, &quot;shop assistant&quot;, and &quot;retail clerk&quot;.

In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. In the United States, the laws governing sales of goods are mostly uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.

==Definition==
A person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer, or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same &quot;coin&quot; or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party&#x27;s need for the other&#x27;s item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer&#x27;s terms, &quot;worth the price&quot;. Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.

Although the skills required are different, from a management viewpoint, sales is a part of marketing. Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as &quot;salespersons&quot; (singular: &quot;salesperson&quot;). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of persuading &quot;art&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a &quot;systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way&quot;.

While the sales process refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of advertising, promotion, public relations, and direct marketing.

Selling is the profession-wide term, much like marketing defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at marketing, advertising, promotions, and even public relations as ways to create a unique transaction.

Many believe that the focus of selling is on the human agents involved in the exchange between buyer and seller. Effective selling also requires a systems approach, at minimum involving roles that sell, enable selling, and develop sales capabilities. Selling also involves salespeople who possess a specific set of sales skills and the knowledge required to facilitate the exchange of value between buyers and sellers that is unique from marketing and advertising.

Within these three tenets, the following definition of professional selling is offered by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD):
Team selling is one way to influence sales. Team selling is &quot;a group of people representing the sales department and other functional areas in the firm, such as finance, production, and research and development&quot;. (Spiro) Team selling came about in the 1990s through total quality management (TQM). TQM occurs when companies work to improve their customer satisfaction by constantly improving all their operations.

=== Relationships with marketing ===
Marketing and sales differ greatly, but they generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect. A marketing plan includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P&#x27;s). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value of the products and services to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of successful interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as advertising, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations, creating new sales channels, or creating new products. It can also include encouraging the potential customer to visit the organization&#x27;s website, contact the organization for more information, or interact with the organization via social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook and blogs. Social values play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales is the process of persuasion and effort from one person to one person (B2C), or one person to a corporation (B2B), in order to make a living resource enter the company. This may occur in person, over the phone or digitally.

The field of sales process engineering views &quot;sales&quot; as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, the labels &quot;sales&quot; and &quot;marketing&quot; cover several processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another. In this context, improving an &quot;output&quot; (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.

Many large corporations structure their marketing departments, so they are integrated with all areas of the business. They create multiple teams with a singular focus, and the managers of these teams must coordinate efforts to drive profits and business success. For example, an &quot;inbound&quot; campaign seeks to drive more customers &quot;through the door&quot;, giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides as well.

The sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer and the sales channel or salesperson. As sales is the forefront of any organization, this would always need to take place before any other business process may begin. Sales management involves breaking down the selling process and increasing the effectiveness of the discrete processes, as well as improving the interactions between processes. For example, in an outbound sales environment, the typical process includes outbound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to improve each discrete step.

One further common complication of marketing is the difficulty in measuring results for some marketing initiatives. Some marketing and advertising executives focus on creativity and innovation without concern for the top or bottom lines – a fundamental pitfall of marketing for marketing&#x27;s sake.

Many companies find it challenging to get their marketing and sales teams to agree. The two departments, although different in nature, handle very similar concepts and have to work together to achieve the business&#x27;s goals. Building a good relationship between the two teams that encourages communication can be the key to success.

===Industrial marketing===
The idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for salespeople depends entirely on context. For example, this may be possible in some B2C situations; however, for many B2B transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible. Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. Fast-moving consumer-goods (FMCG) require no salespeople at the point of sale to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer&#x27;s trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a salesperson to manage the sales process – particularly in the face of competitors. Small and medium businesses selling such large ticket items to a geographically dispersed client base use manufacturers&#x27; representatives to provide this highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.

===Sales and marketing alignment and integration===
Another area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration of corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical functions.

Sales, Digital Marketing and Automated Marketing campaigns. With the increase of the use of the internet today, sales functions of several enterprises are finding traditional methods of marketing quite old fashioned and less efficient. So the use of automated Marketing Applications is on the rise ranging from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to sales force management.

Traditionally, these two functions, as referred above, have operated separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen&#x27;s book &quot;The Profit Maximization Paradox&quot; sees the changes in the competitive landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the complexity of choice, price, and opportunities for the customer forced this seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to messaging and strategy.

==Methods==
A sale can take place through face-to-face contact, via mail order, through a vending machine or through online selling. Other methods of selling include:

* Agency-based sales
** Complex sales
** Consignment
** Consultative sales
** Retail or consumer
** Sales agents (for example in real estate or in manufacturing)
** Sales outsourcing through direct branded representation
** Telemarketing or telesales
** Transaction sales
* Business-to-business – Business-to-business (&quot;B2B&quot;) sales are likely to be larger in terms of volume, economic value and complexity than business-to-consumer (&quot;B2C&quot;) sales. Often the complexity involves one business working closely with the other to define problems, to finding solutions, to supporting after-sale operation. Because of this complexity, there is a need to manage the relationships between the buying and selling organizations, for example using Peter Cheverton&#x27;s relationship models and the stakeholder map by Anderson, Bryson and Crosby
* Channel sales, an indirect sales model, which differs from direct sales. Channel selling is a way for sellers to reach the &quot;B2B&quot; and &quot;B2C&quot; markets through distributors, re-sellers or value added re-sellers VARS. 
* Direct sales, involving person to person contact
* Electronic
**Electronic Data Interchange
** Web – Business-to-business (&quot;B2B&quot;) and business-to-consumer (&quot;B2C&quot;)
* Pro forma sales
* Request for proposal – An invitation for suppliers, through a bidding process, to submit a proposal on a specific product or service; an RFP usually represents part of a complex sales process, also known as &quot;enterprise sales&quot;
* Selling technique:
** Action selling
** Auctions
** Challenger sales
** Cold calling
** Collaborative Selling
** Compass Selling
** Conceptual selling
** Consultative selling
** Cross-selling
** Guaranteed sale
** Hard selling
** Inbound sales
** Needs-based selling
** Paint-the-picture
** Personal selling

=== Sales agents ===
Agents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales process; for example:
* Buyers broker or Buyer brokerage: This is where the salesman represents the consumer making the purchase. This is most often applied in large transactions.
* Disclosed dual agent: This is where the salesman represents both parties in the sale and acts as a mediator for the transaction. The role of the salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair deal.
* Internet Sales Professionals: These people are primarily responsible for ensuring immediate response to the leads generated via social media, website or email campaigns.
* Sales broker, seller agency, seller agent, seller representative: This is a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on the selling end of a deal.
* Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management techniques in order to facilitate improved profits and increased sales volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing department as well as oversight concerning the fair and honest execution of the sales process by their agents.
* Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and report all activities (through their own sales management channels) back to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see sales outsourcing).
* Salesperson: The primary function of salespeople is to generate and close business resulting in profit. The salesperson will accomplish their primary function through a variety of means including phone calls, email, social media, networking, and cold calling. The primary objective of the successful salesperson is to find the consumers to sell to. Sales are often referred to as a &quot;numbers game&quot; because a general law of averages and pattern of successful closing of business will emerge through heightened sales activity. These activities include but are not limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships with prospects, building trust with future clients, identifying and filling needs of consumers, and therefore turning prospective customers into actual ones. Many tools are used by successful salespeople, the most important of which is questioning which can be defined as a series of questions and resulting answers allowing the salesperson to understand a customer&#x27;s goals and requirements relevant to the product they are selling. The creation of value or perceived value is the result of taking the information gathered, analyzing the goals and needs of the prospective customer and leveraging the products or services the salesperson&#x27;s firm represents or sells in a way that most effectively achieves the prospective client&#x27;s goals or suits their needs. Effective salespeople will package their offering and present their proposed solution in a way that leads the prospective customer to the conclusion that they acquire the solution, resulting in revenue and profit for the salesperson and the organization they represent.

=== vs. ===
In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act defines outside sales representatives as &quot;employees [who] sell their employer&#x27;s products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer&#x27;s place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer&#x27;s place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer&#x27;s home&quot; while defining those who work &quot;from the employer&#x27;s location&quot; as inside sales. Inside sales generally involves attempting to close business primarily over the phone via telemarketing, while outside sales (or &quot;field&quot; sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer&#x27;s location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to upselling to existing customers.

=== Sales coaching ===
Sales coaching is a one-on-one coaching process by high-performing sales professionals and consultants with salespeople, managers, and executives. The process involves equipping them with the knowledge, abilities, and skills needed to become more effective sales professionals. Unlike sales training, sales coaching is typically an individualized, ongoing endeavor.

==Law==

In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. In the United States, the laws governing sales of goods are mostly uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.

The European Commission proposed adoption of a Common European Sales Law in 2011 and set out a proposed regulation on this area of law in 2014. Whilst remaining optional, the Commission&#x27;s intention was to offer traders a means of breaking down barriers occasioned by the different legal systems of its (then) 28 Member States. A 2012 &quot;Communication&quot; from the Commission argued that a Common European Sales Law would help to address some of the concerns which it had identified in the development of a market for cloud computing services. However, the proposal was withdrawn in December 2014 when the Commission&#x27;s work plan was rationalised.

<text>Frances Brooke ( Moore; 12 January 1724 – 23 January 1789) was an English novelist, essayist, playwright and translator. Hers was the first English novel known to have been written in Canada.

==Biography==
Frances Moore was born in Claypole, Lincolnshire, England, the daughter of a clergyman. She was only three years old when her father died. Her mother&#x27;s death followed soon after.

By the late 1740s, she had moved to London, where she embarked on her career as a poet and playwright. She did not drew attention until she published her essay serial &quot;The Old Maid&quot;. Under the pseudonym of Mary Singleton, Spinster, she edited 37 issues of this weekly periodical (1755–1756), which was patterned after &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

In 1756 she married Rev. Dr John Brooke, rector at Colney, Norfolk. The following year he left for Canada as a military chaplain while his wife remained in England. In 1763 she wrote her first novel, &quot;The History of Lady Julia Mandeville&quot;. In the same year Brooke sailed to Quebec, Canada to join her husband, who was then chaplain to the British garrison there. In autumn 1768 she returned to London, where she continued her writing.

Brooke was well-known in London&#x27;s literary and theatrical communities. In 1769 she published &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot;, the first novel written in Canada. This brief stint in North America has caused some critics to label her &quot;the first novelist in North America.&quot; Evidence of Brooke&#x27;s wisdom and experience of life and its vicissitudes is apparent in her writing. One exemplary observation reflects that &quot;It is a painful consideration, my dear, that the happiness or misery of our lives are generally determined before we are proper judges of either.&quot; Another reviewer recommended it for young ladies and praised the writer for her &quot;art of engaging the attention by a lively stile, a happy descriptive talent, characters well-marked, and a variety of tender and delicate sentiments&quot;.

Also in 1769, Frances Brooke&#x27;s novel &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot; was used in the earliest Oxford English Dictionary citation for the hyperbolic or figurative sense of &quot;literally&quot;; the sentence from the novel was, &quot;He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally &quot;to feed among the lilies&quot;.&quot; The citation was still used in the OED&#x27;s 2011 revision.

Brooke died in Sleaford, England, aged 65.

==Legacy==
Brooke is widely seen by literary historians and critics as the first Canadian novelist for writing her 1769 work &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot;. Her literary reception is based mostly on this publication. It was popular among scholars after its recovery, with more than a dozen scholarly articles written on its subject matter by 2004. Modern paperback reprints include a definitive scholarly edition. Critics of Brooke have studied themes present in &quot;Emily Montague,&quot; such as applying free-trade imperialism to 18th-century Canada, proto-feminism, and displacing the French Catholic threat in British Columbian colonies.

While the purpose and material of &quot;Emily Montague&quot; are often debated among critics, its reception as a work is largely neutral to negative. Recent critics such as Dermot McCarthy concede that &quot;Brooke&#x27;s inability to imagine her ambivalence... is understandable given her time and background... However, her failure should not be endorsed.&quot; Desmond Pacey, in his &quot;Essays in Canadian Criticism&quot; writes that &quot;&quot;Emily Montague&quot;&#x27;s artistic shortcomings are obvious: the plot is thin, conventional, repetitive, and poorly integrated with the informative sections of the book; the style is generally stilted and monotonous; the characters, with one or two exceptions, are traditional in conception and deficient in life; the whole performance is heavily didactic and sentimental.&quot; Juliet McMaster cites &quot;Emily Montague&quot; as a source of inspiration and parody for Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Love and Freindship&quot;, but states that overall, &quot;&quot;Emily Montague&quot; is no mean literary achievement.&quot; Even in its own time, views divided on its value. The &quot;Monthly Review&quot; in its September 1769 issue wrote that its &quot;frost pieces... decorate a short story which has nothing extraordinary in it.&quot; While Brooke is promoted as a Canadian novelist, Benet&#x27;s &quot;Reader&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; entry notes how &quot;Brooke&#x27;s work was based on English models and had no perceptible effect on Canadian literature.&quot;

Other Brooke works, such as her 1777 novel &quot;The Excursion&quot;, have received scholarly interest for their pastoral traditions and their political satire against the English theatre industry of the 18th century, while some of her works such as her 1781 play &quot;The Siege of Sinopoe&quot; have close to no reception. Brooke&#x27;s personal life is the subject of a number of scholarly journals, mostly on her relations with actors David Garrick and Mary Ann Yates. Brooke herself was the subject of her own monograph, and in recent years has gained popularity as the &quot;destroyer of English (not literally)&quot; after an online article published by the University of Pennsylvania, which regards Brooke as being used in the earliest Oxford English Dictionary citation of the hyperbolic use of the word &quot;literally&quot; to mean &quot;figuratively&quot;.

In 1985, the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, approving 337 names for features on the surface of Venus, honoured Brooke by naming a crater after her.

<text>Ralph Hosea Chaplin (1887–1961) was an American writer, artist and labor activist.

==Background==
Chaplin was born in 1887. At the age of seven, he saw a worker shot dead during the Pullman Strike in Chicago, Illinois. He had moved with his family from Ames, Kansas to Chicago in 1893.

==Career==

During a time in Mexico he was influenced by hearing of the execution squads established by Porfirio Díaz, and became a supporter of Emiliano Zapata.

On his return, he began work in various union positions, most of which were poorly paid. Some of Chaplin&#x27;s early artwork was done for the &quot;International Socialist Review&quot; and other Charles H. Kerr publications.

For two years Chaplin worked in the strike committee with Mother Jones for the bloody Kanawha County, West Virginia strike of coal miners in 1912–13. These influences led him to write a number of labor oriented poems, one of which became the words for the oft-sung union anthem, &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;.
Chaplin then became active in the Industrial Workers of the World (the IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;) and became editor of its eastern U.S. publication &quot;Solidarity&quot;. In 1917 Chaplin and some 100 other Wobblies were rounded up, convicted, and jailed under the Espionage Act of 1917 for conspiring to hinder the draft and encourage desertion. He wrote &quot;Bars And Shadows: The Prison Poems&quot; while serving four years of a 20-year sentence.

Although he continued to work for labor rights after his release from prison, Chaplin was very disillusioned by the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the evolution of the Soviet state and international communism, particularly its involvement in American politics and unions in 1920–1948, as he details in his autobiography, &quot;Wobbly&quot;.

Chaplin maintained his involvement with the IWW, serving in Chicago as editor of its newspaper, the &quot;Industrial Worker&quot;, from 1932 to 1936. Chaplin left the IWW in 1936.

Eventually Chaplin settled in Tacoma, Washington, where he edited the American Federation of Labor&#x27;s local labor publication. He converted to Roman Catholicism and published his autobiography &quot;Wobbly.&quot; From 1949 until his death, he was curator of manuscripts for the Washington State Historical Society.

==Death and legacy==
Chaplin died in 1961.

According to the IWW, Chaplin likely designed the now widely used anarcho-syndicalist image, the black cat. In 2022, law professor Ahmed White mentioned him in his book on the IWW called &quot;Under the Iron Heel&quot;.

<text>Erwin Komenda (6 April 1904 - 22 August 1966) was an Austrian automobile designer and Porsche employee, and a lead contributor to the design of the bodies for the VW Beetle and various Porsche sports cars.

Erwin Komenda was born on 6 April 1904 in Jauern am Semmering. His father, Franz Komenda, was the technical director of the first power station on the Semmering and in Weyer / Enns, where the family relocated in 1913.
From 1916 to 1920 he attended a higher technical institute for iron processing in Steyr.
From 1920 to 1926 he worked as an automotive designer in the &quot;Wiener Karosseriefabrik&quot; and completed the bodywork design course at Josef Feldwabel in the Vienna Technological Museum of Commerce.
From 1926 to 1929 he was a designer in the Steyr works. Here he met Ferdinand Porsche for the first time, who came to Steyr as Technical Director after leaving Daimler-Benz AG.
From 1929 to 1931 he was chief designer of the experimental and body development department of Daimler-Benz AG in Sindelfingen. During this time, cars such as the Mercedes-Benz Mannheim 370 K were built with a remarkably weight-saving new design, equipped with Steyr technology from the Steyr XXX: &quot;swinging-axle suspension, independent suspension, braking systems&quot;. Also a streamlined small car with rear engine was developed.

In November 1931, Komenda joined the engineering office newly founded by Ferdinand Porsche as head of the bodywork design department, which he headed until 1966.
Among other projects, he developed the body of the VW beetle.
With more than 21.5 million units, the VW Beetle became the best-selling automobile of the 20th century. With graduate engineer Josef Mickl, a Porsche employee specializing in aircraft construction and aerodynamics, Komenda developed the bodywork of the P-Auto Union racing car and Cisitalia racing car.
As early as 1946 Komenda began work on the body of the first Porsche sports car. He developed the body of the Porsche 356, various following types and the Porsche 550 Spyder.
As a responsible Porsche engineer, he led the Stuttgart-based company into the next generation, accompanying and supervising the bodywork production of the Porsche 901, which was further developed into the 911. One of his latest projects was the development of the plastic body of the 904 race car.
Komenda&#x27;s last phase of life was marked by in-house difficulties with Porsche family members during the development of the Porsche 911.
Erwin Komenda died on 22 August 1966. He was an active employee at Porsche until his early, sudden death. His life ended with the development of the Porsche 911.

<text>Royal Liverpool Philharmonic is a music organisation based in Liverpool, England, that manages a professional symphony orchestra, a concert venue, and extensive programmes of learning through music. Its orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, is the UK&#x27;s oldest continuing professional symphony orchestra. In addition to the orchestra, the organisation administers the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Company and other choirs and ensembles. It is involved in educational and community projects in Liverpool and its surrounding region. It is based in the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, an Art Deco concert hall built in the late 1930s.

==History==

===19th century===
The organisation has its origins in a group of music amateurs in the early 19th century. They had met during the 1830s in St Martin&#x27;s Church under the leadership of William Sudlow, a stockbroker and organist; their main interest was choral music. The Liverpool Philharmonic Society was established on 10 January 1840 with the object of promoting &quot;the Science and Practice of Music&quot;; its orchestra consisted largely of amateur players. The society was the second of its kind to be established, the first being the London-based Royal Philharmonic Society whose orchestra was disbanded in 1932.

The organisation was founded for the rich and élite members of Liverpool society, for &quot;the pleasure of the moneyed merchant class in the town&quot;. Its first concert was given on 12 March 1840 in a room at the back of a dance academy in Great Richmond Street and was conducted by John Russell with William Sudlow as organist. The programme consisted of 13 short orchestral and choral pieces, including works by Auber, Rossini, Spohr, Henry Bishop, and George Onslow, and madrigals by Thomas Morley and John Wilbye. The society outgrew this room and gave its performances in the hall of the Collegiate Institution in Shaw Street. In 1843 the society appointed its first principal conductor, the Swiss-born J. Zeugheer Herrmann, who continued in this role until his death in 1865. During the following year, the orchestra performed its first symphonies, Haydn&#x27;s No. 99 and Beethoven&#x27;s First.
In 1844 the society appointed the Liverpool architect John Cunningham to prepare plans for a concert hall to be situated at the junction of Hope Street and Myrtle Street. It was to contain an audience of 2,100 and an orchestra of 250. To raise money for its building, shares were issued and members of Liverpool society were invited to buy seats in the boxes to be included in the hall. The foundation stone was laid in 1846 and construction began the following year. In 1847 the society invited Felix Mendelssohn to compose a cantata based on words from Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; to celebrate the opening of the hall. Mendelssohn died before this could be carried out. The hall cost £30,000 (£ as of 2025) and was formally opened on 27 August 1849. The first concert was performed by an orchestra of 96 and a choir of over 200; performers at the concert included three future conductors of the orchestra, Alfred Mellon, Julius Benedict and Charles Hallé. The organist was W. T. Best. The hall was not full for the first performance; this was attributed to two factors, the high price of admission, and the fear that the building, without central supporting pillars, was unsafe.

Problems soon arose. In 1850 the choir formed the Liverpool Philharmonic Auxiliary Society and were in conflict with their conductor. Herrmann offered his resignation, which was not accepted. By 1852 the financial problems of the society were deteriorating. Membership was exclusive and not all the seats on offer had been taken up. Suggestions that the conditions for membership should be relaxed were refused. In 1852 the society widened its activities from music by arranging theatrical performances, including Charles Dickens&#x27; company and an appearance by William Makepeace Thackeray. In 1855 it was discovered that William Sudlow, the Honorary Secretary had been stealing money from the society; an amount of more than £2,424 (£ as of 2025) had been embezzled. Sudlow resigned from the society. He was replaced by a paid secretary; the post was given to Henry Sudlow, a distant relative of William. Henry was to serve the society for some 30 years with no similar problem. Prominent performers appearing for the society in 1856 were Jenny Lind, Clara Schumann and Charles Hallé. Dickens returned in 1858 and during that year the society was able to pay off the mortgage on the hall.
By 1865 Hermann&#x27;s health was deteriorating and a new principal conductor, Alfred Mellon, was appointed in September. Mellon died only 18 months later, and was replaced by Julius Benedict, who remained in post until 1880, when his eyesight was deteriorating. While Benedict was principal conductor, the society flourished both artistically and financially. This did not continue during the tenure of the next principal conductor, despite his later fame. Max Bruch was appointed on 23 February 1880 and served for less than three years. During this time he experienced conflict with the committee of the society and complained about the behaviour of the audience. He resigned in January 1883 at which time the standards of the orchestra and the choir had deteriorated, and members of the committee were disagreeing with each other. The person appointed to sort this out was Charles Hallé who had by this time established the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester. Hallé continued as principal conductor until his death in 1895. During this time the orchestra and choir flourished. Those who appeared with the society during this time included Paderewski, Hubert Parry, Nellie Melba, and Clara Butt. In 1883 the secretary, Henry Sudlow, died; he was replaced by George Broadbent.

===1900–1939===
The next principal conductor was Frederic Cowen who remained in post until 1913. During this time more Romantic music was played, including works by Elgar, and this was not always popular with the audiences. Although the society continued to be exclusive, there was criticism about the behaviour of its members during concerts. Performers who appeared during this time were Fritz Kreisler, and Rachmaninoff, the latter playing his Third Piano Concerto and conducting other works at a concert in 1911. After the resignation of Frederic Cowen, the society did not appoint another principal conductor until 1942. 

During this period the orchestra was conducted by a series of guest conductors, who included Wilhelm Furtwängler, George Szell, Pierre Monteux, Serge Koussevitzky, and Bruno Walter. Soloists included Pablo Casals, John McCormack, Elisabeth Schumann, Yehudi Menuhin (his first appearance was at the age of 15), Solomon, Benno Moiseiwitsch, and Maggie Teyte. The British conductors to have a major influence on the orchestra during this time were Sir Henry Wood and Sir Thomas Beecham. During the early 1930s there was concern about the deteriorating financial situation of the society. There was a problem in filling seats and it was suggested that the rule of wearing evening dress at concerts should be relaxed; this was turned down.

Disaster struck the society on 5 July 1933 when the Philharmonic Hall was destroyed by fire. Concerts were mainly held in the Central Hall until a new hall could be built; larger scale works were performed in St George&#x27;s Hall. Considerable discussion took place about the financing and the design of the new hall. It was decided that the society would pay for it without help from the City Corporation. Herbert J. Rowse was appointed as architect and he designed to hall in art deco style; it cost a little over £120,000 (£ as of 2025). Sir Thomas Beecham conducted the opening concert on 20 June 1939. Incorporated in the hall is an organ built by Rushworth and Dreaper, the pipework being hidden behind decorative grilles either side of the orchestra platform. The organ console rises from beneath, and was originally built on a turntable, allowing the organist to face the audience and conductor, or the choir. The console is now fitted with wheels and can be played anywhere on the platform. A Walturdaw rising cinema screen is also housed under the platform, the last such screen in the world still in working order.

===Second World War===
After the outbreak of the Second World War there was pressure to suspend the orchestra&#x27;s concerts. The chairman of the management committee, David Webster, strongly resisted it, insisting that music was an essential morale-booster. He set up low-priced concerts for factory workers and members of the armed forces. The pre-war rule insisting that audiences wear formal evening dress was abolished. Webster recruited Malcolm Sargent as chief conductor; though not generally loved by orchestral players Sargent was immensely popular with the paying public. Guest conductors included Sir Henry Wood and Charles Münch.

Wartime disbanding of other orchestras - most notably that of the all-star BBC Salon Orchestra on 11 July 1942 after a month&#x27;s notice - enabled Webster and Sargent to recruit leading players such as Anthony Pini and Reginald Kell, with the result that for a few years the Liverpool Philharmonic had a strong claim to be the finest orchestra in the country. During Webster&#x27;s period as chairman, the orchestra increased its concerts from 32 a year to 148 and, in 1942, became a permanent body for the first time. Until then the Philharmonic was not a permanent ensemble, but comprised a nucleus of local players augmented from a pool of musicians who also played for the Hallé and latterly BBC Northern Orchestra. During the autumn and winter months the orchestra gave no more than one concert in a fortnight. The Hallé, which operated on a similar &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, followed Liverpool&#x27;s example the following year and became a permanent ensemble for the first time, under John Barbirolli.

The financial situation of the society improved in 1942 when the local authority, Liverpool City Corporation, bought the freehold of the hall for £35,000; the corporation undertook to pay the society an annuity of £4,000 and to allow it free use of the hall provided that it gave an agreed number of concerts each year, and maintained a permanent orchestra. The society agreed to promote musical education in and around Liverpool. In Sargent&#x27;s first season, the orchestra made its first recording, its first broadcast, and gave its first school children&#x27;s concert. Under him there was a &quot;spectacular explosion&quot; in the number of concerts and recording sessions performed. In 1944 the orchestra made its first appearance in London, performing at the Royal Albert Hall. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;If Liverpool felt any qualms about letting its orchestra, accustomed as it is to the perfect acoustics of its own hall, try its fortunes in the rough and tumble of the Albert Hall, they will have been silenced, for what was immediately apparent was … an ensemble and congruity of tone-colouring that London in its less fortunate conditions can only envy&quot;. Sargent and the orchestra gave the British premieres of Tippett&#x27;s First Symphony, and Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra and, in October 1946, the concert première of Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot;. Guest conductors in the immediate postwar years included Beecham, Sir Adrian Boult, the young Charles Groves, and Karl Rankl, who made so good an impression that he was appointed musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company.

===Late 1940s–1960s===
In 1948 Sargent resigned as principal conductor. On 2 October 1949 Yehudi Menuhin and the Liverpool Philharmonic (conducted by Malcolm Sargent) played at Belle Vue, Manchester. Sargent&#x27;s successor, Hugo Rignold, initially had a difficult time, partly because of his background as a jazz and dance band player. However, he served in the post for six years and left in 1954 with an enhanced reputation. From 1955 the society had joint principal conductors, John Pritchard and Efrem Kurtz. The latter resigned in 1957 and Pritchard continued as sole principal conductor until 1963. In August 1956, the orchestra, conducted by Basil Cameron, made its Prom debut with an all Beethoven programme, consisting of the Fidelio overture, the violin concerto with Campoli as soloist, and Symphony No.5.

In 1957 the society and orchestra were granted &quot;Royal&quot; status and were authorised to include this word in their title. The following year the Queen became the patron of the orchestra. In 1958 the society instigated a competition for young conductors. The first winner was Zubin Mehta. Under Pritchard&#x27;s successor the competition became a seminar for young conductors, in which participants included Andrew Davis, Mark Elder, John Eliot Gardiner, James Judd and Barry Wordsworth. Pritchard was a champion of contemporary music and with the help of David Lloyd-Jones he introduced a series of concerts known as &quot;Musica Viva&quot; showcasing new compositions. During Pritchard&#x27;s time, the society commissioned Walton to write his Second Symphony, which received its première at the Edinburgh Festival in 1960. Pritchard was succeeded by Charles Groves, who served as principal conductor for 14 years until he resigned in 1977. Groves helped to maintain the high standards of the orchestra and also encouraged the work of modern composers. He was the first English conductor to direct a full cycle of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies. The orchestra undertook its first overseas tour in 1966, playing in Germany and Switzerland. In 1968 Groves conducted a performance of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla Symphony&quot;, in the presence of the composer, with Messiaen&#x27;s wife, Yvonne Loriod, playing the concertante piano part.

===1970s–present day===
After Groves&#x27; fourteen years&#x27; tenure as principal conductor, each of his three successors remained in post for much shorter periods; Walter Weller from 1977 to 1980, David Atherton from 1980 to 1983 and Marek Janowski from 1983 to 1987. In 1983 Edward Cowie was made Composer in Residence, the first such appointment to a major British orchestra. Musically the society was also entering a period of greater security with the appointment in 1987 of Libor Pešek as principal conductor. Pešek remained in post for ten years and during this time the standards and popularity of the orchestra improved. In Pešek&#x27;s first season, the director of the society, Stephen Gray, retired after 23 years in the post. The occasion was marked by a concert at which Groves, Weller, Atherton, Janowski, Pešek and a former associate conductor, Simon Rattle, all conducted. In 1990 Royal Liverpool Philharmonic celebrated the 150th anniversary of its foundation. In the 1990–91 season, among the works performed that were new to the society was Paul McCartney&#x27;s Liverpool Oratorio, conducted in Liverpool Cathedral by Carl Davis. In 1992, a rear extension was added to the hall. During the following year, while on tour, the orchestra was the first non-Czech orchestra to perform the opening concert in the Prague Spring Festival.

The hall was refurbished in 1995 at a cost of £10.3 million; during this time concerts were performed in Liverpool Cathedral. As part of this refurbishment, the curving interior, which had originally been constructed in fibrous plaster, was replaced with concrete. In 1997, Libor Pešek stood down as principal conductor and was given the title of conductor laureate. Petr Altrichter was the next chief conductor, from 1997 to 2001. Gerard Schwarz succeeded Altrichter, from 2001 to 2006. In 2006, Vasily Petrenko became chief conductor, at age 29 the youngest conductor to have held the post. Also in 2006 the society entered into a sponsorship agreement with the radio music station Classic FM. It was the station&#x27;s first arts partner and the orchestra was given the title of the &quot;Classic FM Orchestra in North West England&quot;. As a result of this partnership, concerts of more &quot;popular and accessible&quot; pieces from the classical repertoire are played, and the radio station broadcasts some of these concerts. By the start of 2008, the station had broadcast 25 concerts, and the contract for the partnership has been extended to 2012. In 2008 Liverpool was a European Capital of Culture and the society played a major role in the events performed as part of this celebration. In 2009, Petrenko&#x27;s title was changed from principal conductor to chief conductor, and he extended his contract with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra until 2015. In July 2018, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra announced that Petrenko would conclude his chief conductorship at the close of the 2020–2021 season, and then become the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate.

In June 2019, Domingo Hindoyan first guest-conducted the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. In June 2020, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra announced the appointment of Hindoyan as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2021–2022 season. In July 2023, the RLPO announced the extension of Hindoyan&#x27;s contract as chief conductor through July 2028.

==Associated organisations==

===Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir===

A choir has been an integral part of Liverpool Philharmonic since its foundation. Originally called the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the name &quot;Royal&quot; was added to its title in 1990. Its longest serving chorus master was Dr J. E. Wallace who held this position from 1929 to 1970, apart from a break during the Second World War.

===Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Company===

Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Company works with young musicians of varying levels of expertise from across the Liverpool City Region. The Youth Company comprises four ensembles: Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Academy Orchestra, Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Session Orchestra, and Liverpool Philharmonic Brass Band. The Youth Company also includes four choirs: Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir, Liverpool Philharmonic Cambiata Choir, Liverpool Philharmonic Children&#x27;s Choir and Liverpool Philharmonic Melody Makers.

The organisation&#x27;s Youth Orchestra was founded as the Merseyside Youth Orchestra in 1951. Its conductor for the first 22 years of its existence was William Jenkins. Since 2014 its Principal Conductor has been Simon Emery, director of music at the local Liverpool Blue Coat School. The first work to be performed by the orchestra was the overture to Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. The orchestra changed its name to the present one in 2006. Its patron is Sir Simon Rattle, who was a percussionist in the orchestra from 1965 to 1972.

===Ensemble 10:10===

This group was formed in 1997 by two members of the orchestra, principal clarinettist Nick Cox and associate principal cello Hilary Browning, to address a gap in programming by performing works of contemporary music and was initially run by the players themselves, receiving funding from the north-west arts board. It was later taken over by the society and has since been conducted by Clark Rundell, and has performed a large number of world premières.

==Projects==

===Learning Programme===

Royal Liverpool Philharmonic has been organising events aimed towards schools and the community since the 1940s, when Sargent introduced concerts for schools. These concerts still exist today, with the organisation hosting a series of 13 Schools’ Concerts every year which are attended by around 18000 young people from across the region.

In 2003 the society a project known as &quot;Music for Life&quot; was launched to work with people in the most deprived areas in the city, working with primary schools and their communities. The project includes providing instruments and supporting a children&#x27;s orchestra and a community choir. Liverpool Philharmonic established In Harmony Liverpool in 2009 – a learning programme which uses orchestral music-making to improve the life chances of children in North Liverpool. Participants take part in ensembles and music lessons which aim to increase their confidence, wellbeing and skills, and offer opportunities to travel, learn, perform and collaborate with professional musicians, international artists and other young people.

Liverpool Philharmonic was previously the principal Higher Education Partner with Liverpool Hope University, supplying members of the orchestra to teach in their music department, and arranging workshops and masterclasses. Students from the Royal Northern College of Music are invited to gain experience by rehearsing and playing with the orchestra and with Ensemble 10:10. Liverpool Philharmonic is also part of the Liverpool Arts Regeneration Consortium.

Liverpool Philharmonic runs a Classical Music Industry MA in partnership with the University of Liverpool for those keen to progress their career in the classical music industry, or enter or develop a career in arts management.

Liverpool Philharmonic established the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra Emerging Musicians Fellowship in 2021. Run annually, the programme immerses four emerging orchestral musicians in the daily life of a professional orchestra, giving them the opportunity to rehearse, perform, train and carry out education programmes alongside the musicians of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 2015, Liverpool Philharmonic established the Christopher Brooks Prize, now known as the Rushworth Composition Prize, which offers an early-career composer of original music the opportunity to work alongside Liverpool Philharmonic. The prize winner takes part in workshops and masterclasses with composers, performers, conductors and other industry professionals associated with Liverpool Philharmonic, and is commissioned to write a new work to be performed by Ensemble 10:10.

===Health===

Since 2008, Liverpool Philharmonic has delivered its Music and Mental Health programme. Encouraging self-expression and skills development, the programme offers anyone experiencing mental ill-health in the local area the opportunity to access and benefit from music to aid their recovery and wellbeing.

Working alongside Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, other NHS partners and mental health charities, the programme has supported over 14,000 service users and their families across a variety of inpatient and community settings since its inception.

The programme sees musicians from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra working with participants across a range of workshops and concerts, including music-making, composition and song writing, improvisation, participant-led group performances, Dementia Friendly and Relaxed concerts, and adult learning opportunities.

==Recordings==
The orchestra society made its earliest recordings before WWII with Moiseiwitsch performing Rachmaninov&#x27;s Piano Concerto No 2 (1937 with Walter Goehr) and Paganini Variations (1938, Basil Cameron) Among the early efforts were in 1943, Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, and the Arthur Bliss&#x27;s Piano Concerto in B-flat, with Solomon as soloist, and conducted by Boult.

In 1998 the orchestra became the first in Britain to own and run its own record label, known as &#x27;RLPO Live&#x27;. This was a company created by the members of the orchestra, using the technical expertise of its own members to create recordings of live performances, with the performers, conductor and soloists being equal shareholders. As a recording orchestra the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra has a varied and critically acclaimed discography throughout the era of recording, the famous Handel Messiah, Mendelsohn Elijah and Elgar Dream of Gerontius early LPs with Sargent and notable first recordings of British works, e.g. Frederick Delius and Arthur Bliss with Groves and Handley, both of whom have left an extensive British recorded repertoire with the orchestra. In particular, and more recently, Libor Pešek made a number of award-winning recordings with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra of Czech composers, including symphonies and orchestral music of Antonín Dvořák and Josef Suk. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s catalogue also includes a complete symphony cycle and other works by Beethoven with Sir Charles Mackerras, Britten, Mahler symphonies with Schwarz, Pešek and Mackerras, as well as many works of Rachmaninov, Smetana and Richard Strauss with those conductors. A full Vaughan Williams symphony cycle and other works with Vernon Handley was also made, several of them receiving &#x27;Best Recording in Category&#x27; of The Gramophone magazine&#x27;s recommendations. Many of these recordings feature the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir. A complete cycle of all six symphonies by the Danish composer Carl Nielsen, in a new edition, has been released by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Douglas Bostock. Petrenko has recorded the complete Shostakovich symphonies. His recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Manfred Symphony&quot; and &quot;The Voyevoda&quot; was Awarded Best Orchestral in the Gramophone Award 2009. and the Shostakovich Symphony No 10 received the same award in 2011. Petrenko has also recorded the Rachmaninov Symphonies and Piano Concertos with Simon Trpčeski and in 2017 completed a Tchaikovsky symphonies cycle achieving the &#x27;Record of the Year 2017&#x27; award for the performance of the 1st, 2nd and 5th from &#x27;BBC Music Magazine&#x27;. The British repertoire is continuing, notably an Alwyn symphony cycle and orchestral works under David Lloyd-Jones; also Petrenko took the Elgar Symphonies and orchestral works and Andrew Manze&#x27;s new Vaughan Williams cycle completed both series in 2019.

Much of this recording legacy is due to the availability of the Hall for recording and rehearsal purposes and is now supplemented by The Friary, rehearsal studio, which is the venue for the outreach programme &#x27;In Harmony&#x27; in the West Everton district of the city.

==Honours and awards==

In 1989 the society and orchestra received an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University and in 1991 they became one of the first organisations to be awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool. The City of Liverpool granted them an honour of Meritorious Service in 1997. In the Classic FM Gramophone Awards 2007, Vasily Petrenko was named Young Artist of the Year. In 2009 the orchestra and Ensemble 10/10 were joint winners of the title Ensemble of the Year in the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards, with Ensemble 10/10 being the winners in the Concert Series of the Year category. The hall won the title of the Best Performing Venue in The Mersey Partnership Annual Tourism Awards in both 2006 and 2009.

==Present day==

Each year the society organises more than 60 concerts of classical music played by the orchestra. It arranges other events in the hall, including performances of pop, rock, folk and jazz music and comedy shows. Films are shown on the Walturdaw screen (which rises from the stage on a counterbalance system), accompanied by Dave Nicholas, the resident cinema organist, prior to the screenings.

The society also arranges concerts in the Concert Room of St George&#x27;s Hall. The orchestra tours to other towns and cities in the UK and abroad. In March 2010 it toured in Switzerland. The hall can be hired for corporate or private events. The orchestra rehearses and makes recordings at the Liverpool Philharmonic at the Friary.

<text>Peer pressure is a direct or indirect influence on peers, i.e., members of social groups with similar interests and experiences, or social statuses. Members of a peer group are more likely to influence a person&#x27;s beliefs, values, religion and behavior. A group or individual may be encouraged and want to follow their peers by changing their attitudes, values or behaviors to conform to those of the influencing group or individual. For the individual affected by peer pressure, this can have both a positive or negative effect on them.

Social groups include both &quot;membership groups&quot; in which individuals hold &quot;formal&quot; membership (e.g. political parties, trade unions, schools) and cliques in which membership is less clearly defined. However, a person does not need to be a member or be seeking membership of a group to be affected by peer pressure. An individual may be in a crowd, a group of many cliques, and still be affected by peer pressure. Research suggests that organizations as well as individuals are susceptible to peer pressure. For example, an organization may base a decision off of the current trends to receive more affection or grow a following group.

Peer pressure can affect individuals of all ethnic groups, genders and ages. Researchers have frequently studied the effects of peer pressure on children and on adolescents, and in popular discourse the term &quot;peer pressure&quot; is used most often with reference to those age-groups. It&#x27;s important to understand that for children of adolescent age, they are faced with finding their identity. Erikson, a sociopsychologist, explains that identity is faced with role confusion, in other words, these children are trying to find a sense of belonging and are the most susceptible to peer pressure as a form of acceptance. For children, the themes most commonly studied are their abilities for independent decision-making. For adolescents, peer pressure&#x27;s relationships to sexual intercourse and substance abuse have been significantly researched. Peer pressure can be experienced through both face-to-face interaction and through digital interaction. Social media offers opportunities for adolescents and adults alike to instill and/or experience pressure every day.

Studies of social networks examine connections between members of social groups, including their use of social media, to better understand mechanisms such as information sharing and peer sanctioning. Sanctions can range from subtle glances that suggest disapproval, to threats and physical violence. Peer sanctioning may enhance either positive or negative behaviors. Whether peer sanctioning will have an effect depends strongly on members&#x27; expectations and the possible sanctions actually being applied. It can also depend on a person&#x27;s position in a social network. Those who are more central in a social network seem more likely to be cooperative, perhaps as a result of how networks form. However, this goes both ways and so they are also more likely to participate in negative behaviors. This may be caused by the repeated social pressures they experience in their networks.

== Childhood and adolescence ==

=== Children ===
Imitation plays a large role in children&#x27;s lives; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life, children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt. In other words, children are influenced by people that are important in their lives, such as friends, parents, celebrities (including YouTubers), singers, dancers, etc. This may explain why children with parents who eat unhealthy or don&#x27;t live active lifestyles can conform to creating habits just like their parents as young adults, and why children try to walk when very young. Children are aware of their position in the social hierarchy from a young age: their instinct is to defer to adults&#x27; judgements and majority opinions. Similar to the Asch conformity experiments, a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one. Each child was handed a book with two sets of images on each page, with a groups of differently sized animals on the left hand page and one animal on the right hand, and each child was asked to indicate the size of the lone animal. All the books appeared the same, but the last child would sometimes get a book that was different. The children reported their size judgements in turn, and the child being tested was asked last. Before the child was to be tested, however, there was a group of children working in conjunction with the researchers. Sometimes, the children who answered before the test subject all gave an incorrect answer. When asked in the presence of the other children, the last child&#x27;s response was often the same as his or her peers. However, when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher, the children proved much more resistant to their peers&#x27; pressure, illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions.

An observation is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers&#x27; behavior through pressure. A study conducted in a remedial kindergarten class, in the Edna A. Hill Child Development Laboratory at the University of Kansas, was designed to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system. After describing a series of tasks to their classroom that included going to the bathroom, cleaning up, and general classroom behavior, teachers and researchers would observe children&#x27;s performance on the tasks. The study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers. They looked at their responses to potential techniques. They utilized the two-part system: first, each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption (e.g. sitting down on a mat for reading time), and if a student reached three points by the end of the day they would receive a prize. The second part brought in peer interaction, where students who reached three points were appointed &quot;peer monitors&quot; whose role was to lead their small groups and assign points at the end of the day. The results were clear-cut, showing that the monitored students&#x27; disruption level dropped when teachers started the points system and monitored them, but when peer monitors were introduced the target students&#x27; disruption dropped to average rates of 1% for student C1, 8% for student C2, and 11% for student C3 (down from 36%, 62%, and 59%, respectively). Even small children, then, are susceptible to pressure from their peers, and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments.

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence, and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience. Children entering this period in life become aware for the first time of the other people around them and realize the importance of perception in their interactions. Peer conformity in young people is most pronounced with respect to style, taste, appearance, ideology, and values. Peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk-taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers. Affiliation with friends who engage in risky behaviors has been shown to be a strong predictor of an adolescent&#x27;s own behavior. Peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior, such as volunteering for charity, excelling in academics, or participating in a service project. The importance of peer approval declines upon entering adulthood.

Even though socially accepted children are more prone to experience higher, more frequent, positive fulfillments and participate in more opportunities, research shows that social acceptance (being in the popular crowd) may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, depending on the norms in the group. Groups of popular children showed an increased propensity to engage in risky, drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups. Peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers, making them more susceptible to group pressures. Gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences: girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns. Additionally, girls and boys reported facing differing amounts of pressures in different areas of their lives, perhaps reflecting a different set of values and priorities for each gender. Both boys and girls are susceptible to peer pressure, but what it revolves around is defining the values, beliefs, or attitudes that their peer groups have or deeply desire. For girls, it typically revolves around their physical appearance, including their fashion choices, such as wearing thong underwear. For boys, it&#x27;s more likely to revolve around typical masculine ideals, such as athleticism or intellect. Either way, peer pressure tends to follow the trends with the current world.

Peer pressure is widely recognized as a major contributor to the initiation of drug use, particularly in adolescents. This has been shown for a variety of substances, including nicotine and alcohol. While this link is well established, moderating factors do exist. For example, parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use; yet when there is little monitoring, adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use, but not during the transition from experimental to regular use. Caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring, and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure. Conversely, some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use.

Peer pressure produces a wide array of negative outcomes. Allen and colleagues showed that susceptibility to peer pressure in 13- and 14-year-olds was predictive of not only future response to peer pressure, but also a wider array of functioning. For example, greater depression symptomatology, decreasing popularity, more sexual behavior, and externalizing behavior were greater for more susceptible teens. Of note, substance use was also predicted by peer pressure susceptibility such that greater susceptibility was predictive of greater alcohol and drug use.

== Peer pressure and adolescent behaviors ==

=== Substance use ===

==== Nicotine use ====
Substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone. Evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence. In a nationally representative sample, adolescents who had a genetic predisposition were more likely to have close friends who were heavy substance users and were furthermore, more likely to be vulnerable to the adverse influence of these friends. Results from specific candidate gene studies have been mixed. For instance, in a study of nicotine use Johnson and colleagues found that peer smoking had a lower effect on nicotine dependence for those with the high risk allele (CHRNA5). This suggests that social contexts do not play a significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well

While tobacco is one of the most widespread forms of nicotine, it is not the only form of nicotine adolescents use. E-cigarette use is on the rise, and over the course of four years, vaporizer use increased ninefold among adolescents. In the United States, youths are commonly introduced to e-cigarettes and vaporizers in their middle and high-school years; almost 6% of students in this age group reported use of some form of e-cigarettes. The mechanisms behind why adolescents adhere to vaping largely relate to social psychology topics such as conformity and acceptance within social groups. Conformity and acceptance can be associated with several factors which are personality and habit-based. Some of the most often cited criteria include a need to belong, alleviation of emotional or physical pain, and curiosity. The onset and continued use of electronic cigarette products are considered normative behaviors within certain social groups, and through behavioral modifications to fit the norms, adolescents and adults gain acceptance and approval from their peers. Additionally, nicotine abuse through social contexts can be traced to individuals and locations where people feel most comfortable. The sites of initiation, or the first location a substance is taken, are most often locations such as schools and homes These locations are familiar spaces for individuals and tend to have low risk of consequences.

==== Alcohol use ====

Though the impact of peer influence in adolescence has been well established, it was unclear at what age this effect begins to diminish. It is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure. Using the Resistance to Peer Influence Scale, Sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-olds. This study also found that girls were generally more resistant to peer influence than boys, particularly at mid-adolescence (i.e. ages 13–15). The higher vulnerability to peer pressure for teenage boys makes sense given the higher rates of substance use in male teens. For girls, increased and positive parental behaviors (e.g. parental social support, consistent discipline) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances.

It is believed that peer pressure relating to alcohol use in college is caused by a variety of factors including: Modeling, social norms, and being offered alcohol. Offering alcohol can be seen as a kind gesture, but in some cases a forceful one. Students may feel like their social position could become compromised if they don&#x27;t follow the actions of their fellow peers. This correlates to modeling, a term used to describe the action of copying/imitating the actions of your peers to fit in. This usually occurs when students give into peer pressure to seem more attractive to the perceived majority. Lastly, you have common, socially acceptable norms that frequently occur in college settings such as substance abuse and drinking. One of the most commonly used excuses among students to which why they drink is because &quot;everyone does it&quot;. Upon entering college, it&#x27;s common to see students begin to increase their alcohol intake, especially for those who do not live at home. Because they have shifted from being influenced by their parents to being influenced by their college peers, it&#x27;s common to see students reflect their peers, most likely due to an increase of modeling to fit in to social settings.

Other substances

Besides the impacts of peer pressure on adolescent alcohol and tobacco use, peer pressure plays a role in the use of other substances, such as marijuana and hard drugs. One contributor to peer pressure with marijuana is legalization efforts; the legalization of recreational marijuana may increase adolescent access and decrease stigma, increasing the likelihood of peer exposure and peer pressure. With legalization comes other challenges, such as deregulation and a lack of control of substances like marijuana and non-medical opioids when it comes to safety concerns. On an international scale, contaminants such as fentanyl are seeping into deregulated opioid markets, which dramatically decreases safety and increases risks for opioid toxicity and death.

Peer pressure and social group selection can create a positive feedback loop with marijuana abuse as well as other substances. Through homophily, the sociological concept in which people connect more with others they are similar to, pro-substance use adolescents and adults self-select with others who share their habits. Similar to nicotine, comfort and familiarity with people and places of first initiation are predictors for whether individuals will use substances. Opioid use is closely linked to peer pressure and comfort, as well as a number of other risk factors which connect with other substance use trends. Opioid use is strongly correlated with tobacco use, and &quot;experimentation,&quot; or trying several different substances during adolescence, is closely tied to long-term abuse. Additionally, delinquent behaviors and peer selection connect closely with opioid use. Opioid use and distribution outside of prescriptions is commonly associated with crime, and if peer groups contain individuals who commit these crimes, the risk of group abuse increases.

==== Prevention ====

Substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure. One major technique is peer influence resistance skills. The known correlational relationship between substance use and relationships with others that use makes resistance skills a natural treatment target. This type of training is meant to help individuals refuse participation with substance use while maintaining their membership in the peer group. Other interventions include normative education approaches (interventions designed to teach students about the true prevalence rates and acceptability of substance use), education interventions that raise awareness of potential dangers of substance use, alcohol awareness training and classroom behavior management. The literature regarding the efficacy of these approaches, however, is mixed. A study in Los Angeles and Orange Counties that established conservative norms and attempted to correct children&#x27;s beliefs about substance abuse among their peers showed a statistically significant decrease in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use, but other studies that systematically reviewed school-based attempts to prevent alcohol misuse in children found &quot;no easily discernible pattern&quot; in both successful and failed programs. A systematic review of intervention programs in schools conducted by Onrust et al. found that programs in elementary school were successful in slightly reducing a student&#x27;s likelihood to abuse drugs or alcohol. However, this effect started to wear off with programs that targeted older students. Programs that targeted students in grades 8–9 reduced smoking, but not alcohol and other drug abuse, and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all.

In a non-substance use context, however, research has shown that decision-making training can produce concrete gains in risk perception and decision-making ability among autistic children. When administered the training in several short sessions that taught the children how to recognize risk from peers and react accordingly, the children demonstrated, through post-training assessments, that they were able to identify potential threats and sources of pressure from peers and deflect them far better than non-autistic adolescents in a control group.

=== Peer pressure and sexual intercourse ===
There is evidence supporting the conclusion that parental attitudes disapproving sex tends to lead toward lower levels of adolescent unplanned pregnancy. These disparities are not due solely to parental disposition but also to communication.

A study completed in Cape Town, South Africa, looked at students at four secondary schools in the region. They found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure: condoms are derided, threats of ridicule for abstinence, and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol (especially for males). The students colloquially call others who choose abstinence as &quot;umqwayito&quot;, which means dried fruit/meat. An important solution for these problems is communication with adults, which the study found to be extremely lacking within adolescent social groups.

Another investigation, completed in 2011, looked at the effect of peer pressure surrounding sexual activities in the youth surrounding US born Mexicans and Mexico born Mexicans. It summarized that US born Mexican youths are more susceptive of peer pressure, specifically towards sexual relations, than Mexico born youths. It has been found that Mexican born youths grow up with stronger familial households than US born Mexico born youths, which leads to why Mexico born youths are more apt to talk with family than with peers. Less interaction with peers means less influence with peers and more trust in family.

Literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyse the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors. A review conducted by Bongardt et al. defined three types of peer norms that led to a person&#x27;s participation in sexual intercourse: descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and outright peer pressure. Descriptive norms and injunctive norms are both observed behaviors and are thus more indirect forms of pressure, but differ in one key aspect: descriptive norms describe peers&#x27; sexual behaviors, but injunctive norms describe peers&#x27; attitudes toward those behaviors (e.g. approval or disapproval). The last norm defined by the study is called &quot;peer pressure&quot; by the authors, and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person&#x27;s peers to engage in sexual behavior.

The review found that indirect norms (descriptive and injunctive) had a stronger effect on a person&#x27;s decision to engage in sexual behavior than direct peer pressure. Between the two indirect norms, descriptive norms had a stronger effect: people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group.

Additionally, studies have found a link between self-regulation and likeliness to engage in sexual behavior. The more trouble an individual had with self-regulation and self-control growing up, the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts. Based on these findings, it may be a good idea to prevent these through either a decision-making program or by targeting adolescents&#x27; ability to self-regulate against possible risks.

== Psychological explanations ==

=== Neurology and physiological psychology ===
From a neurological perspective, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the striatum play an important role in figuring out the value of specific actions. The mPFC is active when determining &quot;socially tagged&quot; objects, which are objects that peers have expressed an opinion about; the striatum is significant for determining the value of these &quot;socially tagged&quot; objects and rewards in general. An experiment performed by Mason et al. utilizing fMRI scans analyzed individuals who were assigned to indicate if a chosen symbol appeared consecutively. The researchers did not tell the subjects the real purpose of the experiment, which was to collect data regarding mPFC and striatum stimulation. Before the actual experiment began, the subjects were subject to a phase of &quot;social&quot; influence, where they learned which symbols were preferred by other subjects who had completed the experiment (while in actuality these other subjects did not exist). Mason et al. found that determining an object&#x27;s social value/significance is dependent on combined information from the mPFC and the striatum [along the lines denoted in the beginning of the paragraph]. Without both present and functional, it would be difficult to determine the value of action based upon social circumstances.

A similar experiment was conducted by Stallen, Smidts, and Sanfrey. Twenty-four subjects were manipulated using a minimal group paradigm approach. Unbeknownst to them, they were all selected as part of the &quot;in-group&quot;, although there was an established &quot;out-group&quot;. Following this socialization, the subjects estimated the number of dots seen on the screen while given information about what an in-group or out-group member chose. Participants were more likely to conform to in-group decisions as compared to out-group ones. The experiment confirmed the importance of the striatum in social influence, suggesting that conformity with the in-group is mediated with a fundamental value signal—rewards. In other words, the brain associates social inclusion with positive reward. The posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which is associated with perspective taking, appeared to be active as well, which correlated with patients&#x27; self-reports of in-group trustworthiness.

In adolescence, risk-taking appears to increase dramatically. Researchers conducted an experiment with adolescent males who were of driving age and measured their risk-taking depending on whether a passenger (a peer of the same age) was in the car. A driving simulation was created, and certain risky scenarios, such as a decaying yellow light as the car was approaching, were modeled and presented to the subjects. Those who were most likely to take risks in the presence of peers (but took fewer risks when there were no passengers) had greater brain activity in the social-cognitive and social-affective brain systems during solo activity (no passengers.) The social-cognitive aspect refers to the ability to gauge what others are thinking and is primarily controlled by the mPFC, right temporal parietal junction, and the posterior cingulate cortex. The social-affective aspect relates to the reward system for committing actions that are accepted or rejected by other people. One side of the reward system is &quot;social pain&quot;, which refers to the emotional pain felt by individual due to group repudiation and is associated with heightened activity in the anterior insula and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex.

=== Social psychology ===
An explanation of how the peer pressure process works, called &quot;the identity shift effect,&quot; was introduced by social psychologist Wendy Treynor, who weaves together Festinger&#x27;s two seminal social-psychological theories (on dissonance, which addresses internal conflict, and social comparison, which addresses external conflict) into a unified whole. According to Treynor&#x27;s original &quot;identity shift effect&quot; hypothesis, the peer pressure process works in the following way: One&#x27;s state of harmony is disrupted when faced with the threat of external conflict (social rejection) for failing to conform to a group standard. Thus, one conforms to the group standard, but as soon as one does, eliminating this external conflict, internal conflict is introduced (because one has violated one&#x27;s own standards). To rid oneself of this internal conflict (self-rejection), an &quot;identity shift&quot; is undertaken, where one adopts the group&#x27;s standards as one&#x27;s own, thereby eliminating internal conflict (in addition to the formerly eliminated external conflict), returning one to a state of harmony. Although the peer pressure process begins and ends with one in a (conflict-less) state of harmony, as a result of conflict and the conflict resolution process, one leaves with a new identity—a new set of internalized standards.

== Social media ==
Social media provides a massive new digital arena for peer pressure and influence. Research suggests there are a variety of benefits from social media use, such as increased socialization, exposure to ideas, and greater self-confidence. However, there is also evidence of negative influences such as advertising pressure, exposure to inappropriate behavior and/or dialogue, and fake news. These versions of digital peer pressure exist between youth, adults and businesses. In some cases, people can feel pressure to make themselves available 24/7 or to be perfect. Within this digital conversation there can be pressure to conform, especially as people are impacted by the frequency of times others hit the like button. In 2014, 39% of the 789 respondents, in ages 13–17, felt pressured to post content for likes and comments. The way others portray themselves on social media might lead to young people trying to mimic those qualities or actions in an attempt to conform. In 2014, 40% of 789 respondents, in ages 13–17, felt the need to only post content to look good to others on social media. It may also lead to a fear of missing out, which can pressure youth into irresponsible actions or decisions. Actions and influence on social media may lead to changes in identity, confidence, or habits in real life for children, adolescents, and adults. Another area in which social media and social network groups influence people is in the purchasing of products. When a person is a part of an online social networking group, they are more likely to purchase a product if it was recommended by another member of that group than if it were recommended by a random person online. Knowledge about brands, opinions of brands, and purchasing behavior are directly influenced by peers and the media; people&#x27;s purchase decisions largely stem from what their friends are purchasing. The effects of social networking groups on purchasing products even translates to subscriptions. If a subscription-based product was given to a member of an online social networking group as a gift by another member of the same group, the person receiving the gift is more likely to adopt the cost of the subscription and keep paying for the service.

=== Peer pressure on social media across cultures ===
Over 3 billion social media users across the world are using a variety of platforms, in turn, the type, frequency, and scope of the resulting peer pressure fluctuates. Some research suggests social media has a greater influence on purchasing decisions for consumers in China than in other countries in the world. In addition, Chinese consumers say that they are more likely to consider buying a product if they see it discussed positively by friends on a social media site. Some countries have a very low usage rate of social media platforms, or have cultures that do not value it as highly. As a result, the power and impact of digital peer pressure may vary throughout the world. Overall, there is limited research on this topic and its global scope.

== Historical examples ==

=== Holocaust ===
The Holocaust is one of the most well-known of genocides. In the 1940s, Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, began a systematic purge against the Jewish people living in Europe, killing around six million Jews by the end of World War II. It is clear that some Germans are culpable for the Holocaust; SS officers and soldiers clearly bought into the Jewish genocide and participated as executioners, jailers, and hunters (for hiding Jews). However, not all Germans wanted to kill the Jews. When bringing the concept of peer pressure into the Holocaust, German culpability is even harder to decide.

The primary issue revolves around collective responsibility and beliefs. As such, there are two positions, most notably held by Christopher Browning and David Goldhagen.

==== Browning&#x27;s &quot;Ordinary Men&quot; ====
Christopher Browning, most known for his book &quot;Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101&quot;, relies on an analysis of the men in Reserve Police Battalion 101. The men of the 101st were not ardent Nazis but ordinary middle-aged men of working-class backgrounds from Hamburg. They were drafted but found ineligible for regular military duty. Their test as an Order Police battalion first came in the form of Jozefow, a Jewish ghetto in Poland. The Battalion was ordered to round up the men in the ghetto and kill all women, children, and elderly on sight. During the executions, a few dozen men were granted release of their execution tasks and were reassigned to guard or truck duty. Others tried to stall as long as possible, trying not to be assigned to a firing squad. After the executions were completed, the men drank heavily, shaken by their ordeal.

At the end of his book, Browning supplies his theory on 101&#x27;s actions: a combination of authoritative and peer pressure was a powerful coercive tool. First, the Nazi leadership wanted to keep the country&#x27;s soldiers psychologically healthy, so soldiers were not forced to commit these murders. Throughout the German ranks, nothing negative happened to the soldiers and policemen who refused to join in on a firing squad or Jewish search party. They would simply be assigned other or additional duties, and perhaps subject to a little verbal abuse deriding their &quot;cowardice&quot;. For the officers, no official sanction was given, but it was well known that being unable to carry out executions was a sign of a &quot;weak&quot; leader, and the officer would be passed for promotions. Second, Major Trapp, the head of Battalion 101, consistently offered protection from committing these actions, even so far as supporting one man who was blatantly and vocally against these practices. He established &quot;ground&quot; rules in which only volunteers were taking on &#x27;Jewish Hunts&quot; and raids.

Browning relies on Milgram&#x27;s experiments on authority to expand his point. Admitting that Trapp was not a particularly strong authority figure, Browning instead points to the Nazi leadership and the orders of the &quot;highest order&quot; that were handed down. Furthermore, according to Browning&#x27;s analysis, one reason so few men separated themselves from their task was peer pressure—individual policemen did not want to &quot;lose face&quot; in front of their comrades. Some argued that it was better to shoot one and quit than to be a coward immediately. Some superior officers treated those who did not want to execute Jews with disdain; on the other hand, those selected for the executions or Jewish hunts were regarded as real &quot;men&quot; and were verbally praised accordingly. For some, refusing their tasks meant that their compatriots would need to carry the burden and the guilt of abandoning their comrades (as well as fear of ostracization) compelled them to kill.

==== Goldhagen&#x27;s &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot; ====
Daniel Goldhagen, disagreeing with Browning&#x27;s conclusion, decided to write his own book, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot;. Its release was highly controversial. He argues that the Germans were always anti-Semitic, engaging in a form of &quot;eliminationism&quot;. Taking photos of the deceased, going on &quot;Jew-Hunts&quot;, death marches near the end of the war, and a general focus on hate (rather than ignorance) are points Goldhagen utilizes in his book.

He does not believe that peer pressure or authoritative pressure can explain why ordinary Germans engaged in these actions. He believes that in order for the policemen in Battalion 101 (and those in similar situations) to kill, they must all be fully committed to the action—no half-heartedness. As he notes,&quot;For that matter, for someone to be pressured into doing something, by peer pressure, everyone else has to want to do it. Peer pressure can, of course, operate on isolated individuals, or small groups, but it depends upon the majority wanting to do it. So the peer pressure argument contradicts itself. If the majority of the people hadn&#x27;t wanted to kill Jews, then there would have been peer pressure not to do it&quot; (37).Instead, he places a significant emphasis on the German people&#x27;s anti-Semitism, to the extent of drawing ire from other historians. Browning notes Goldhagen&#x27;s &quot;uniform portrayal&quot; of Germans, dehumanizing all of the perpetrators without looking at the whole picture. For example, in the town of Niezdow, the Police Battalion executed over a dozen elderly Poles in retaliation for the murder of a German policeman. It is less clear, then, if the Germans in the Police Battalion are antagonistic only towards Jews. The German-Canadian historian Ruth Bettina Birn has—in collaboration with Volker Rieß— checked Goldhagen&#x27;s archival sources from Ludwigsburg. Their findings confirm the arbitrary nature of his selection and evaluation of existing records as opposed to a more holistic combination of primary sources. Furthermore, Konrad Kwiet, a Holocaust historian, argues that Goldhagen&#x27;s narrow focus on German anti-Semitism has blinded him to other considerations. He points to the massacres of non-Jews as an example:&quot;[Goldhagen does not shine light] on the motives of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s willing executioners&quot; in murdering disabled people within the so-called &quot;Euthanasia Program&quot;, in liquidating 2.7 million Soviet prisoners of war, in exterminating Romas or in killing hundreds of thousands of other people classified as enemies of the &quot;German People and Nation&quot;. The emphasis on German responsibility allows Goldhagen to push aside the willingness of genocidal killers of other nationalities [such as Latvians] who, recruited from the vast army of indigenous collaborators, were often commissioned with the task of carrying out the &#x27;dirty work&#x27;, such as the murder of women and children, and who, in many cases, surpassed their German masters in their cruelty and spontaneous brutality&quot;.

=== Rwandan genocide ===
The Rwandan genocide occurred in 1994, with ethnic violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnicities. The primary belligerents were the Hutu; however, as with most ethnic conflicts, not all Hutu wanted to kill Tutsi. A survivor, Mectilde, described the Hutu breakdown as follows: 10% helped, 30% forced, 20% reluctant, and 40% willing. For the willing, a rewards structure was put in place. For the unwilling, a punishment system was in effect. The combination, Professor Bhavnani argues, is a behavioral norm enforced by in-group policing. Instead of the typical peer pressure associated with western high school students, the peer pressure within the Rwandan genocide, where Tutsi and Hutu have inter-married, worked under coercion. Property destruction, rape, incarceration, and death faced the Hutu who were unwilling to commit to the genocide or protected the Tutsi from violence.

When observing a sample community of 3426 in the village of Tare during the genocide, McDoom found that neighborhoods and familial structures are important micro-spaces that helped determine if an individual would participate in violence. Physical proximity increases the likelihood of social interaction and influence. For example, starting at a set point such as the home of a &quot;mobilizing&quot; agent for the Hutu (any individual who planned or led an attack in the village), the proportion of convicts living in a 100m radius of a resident is almost twice as many for convicts (individuals convicted of genocide by the &quot;gacaca&quot;, a local institution of transitional justice that allows villagers to adjudicate on many of the perpetrators&#x27; crimes by themselves) as for non-convicts. As the radius increases, so does the proportion decrease. This data implies that &quot;social influence&quot; was a major factor. Looking at neighborhoods, an individual is 4% more likely to join the genocide for every single percentage point increase in the proportion of convicted perpetrators living within a 100m radius of them. Looking at familial structures, for any individual, each percentage point increase in the proportion of genocide participants in the individual&#x27;s household increased their chances of joining the violence by 21 to 25%.

However, the complete situation is a little more nuanced. The extreme control of citizens&#x27; daily lives by the government in social affairs facilitated the rapidity of the genocide&#x27;s spread and broke down the resolve of some who initially wanted to have no part in the genocide. First, prior to the genocide, Rwandans&#x27; sense of discipline was introduced and reinforced through weekly &quot;umuganda&quot; (collective work) sessions, involving praise for the regime and its leaders and a host of collective activities for the community. Respect for authority and the fear of stepping out of line were strong cultural values of pre-genocide Rwanda and so were included in these activities. Second, their value of social conformity only increased in the decades leading up to the genocide in both social and political manners. Peasants were told exactly when and what to farm and could be fined given any lack of compliance. These factors helped to drive the killing&#x27;s fast pace.

Most importantly, there were already ethnic tensions among the groups for a variety of reasons: conflicts over land allocation (farming versus pasture) and declining prices of Rwanda&#x27;s main export: coffee. These problems combined with a history of previously existing conflict. With the introduction of the Second Republic under Habyarimana, former Tutsis in power were immediately purged, and racism served as an explanation as keeping the majority Hutu in legitimate government power. As a result, when the war came, the Hutu were already introduced to the concept of racism against their very own peers.

The division in Rwanda was reinforced for hundreds of years. King Kigeli IV, a Tutsi, centralized Rwandan power in the 1800s, just as Belgian colonization was taking place. The Belgian furthered the message of distinct races, allowing Tutsi men to remain the leaders in the society.

== Applications ==

=== Leadership tool ===

==== Education ====
Principals who served as strong &quot;instructional&quot; leaders and introduced new curricula and academic programs were able to create a system of peer pressure at the teaching level, where the teachers placed accountability pressure on themselves.

=== Voting ===
Peer pressure can be especially effective (more so than door-to-door visits and telephone calls) in getting people to vote. Gerber, Green, and Larimer conducted a large-scale field experiment involving over 180,000 Michigan households in 2006 and four treatments: one was a reminder to vote, one was a reminder to vote and a note informing them that they were being studied, one that listed the voting records for all potential household individuals, and finally one that listed the voting records for the household individuals and their neighbors. The final treatment emphasized peer pressure within a neighborhood; neighbors could view each other&#x27;s voting habits with the lists, and so the social norm of &quot;voting is best for the community&quot; is combined with the fear that individuals&#x27; peers would judge their lack of voting. Compared to a baseline rate of 29.7% (only the voting reminder), the treatment that utilized peer pressure increased the percentage of household voters by 8.1 percentage points (to 37.8%), which exceeds the value of in-person canvassing and personalized phone calls.

A similar large-scale field experiment conducted by Todd Rogers, Donald P. Green, Carolina Ferrerosa Young, and John Ternovski (2017) studied the impact of a social pressure mailing in the context of a high-salience election, the 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. Social pressure mailers included the line, &quot;We&#x27;re sending this mailing to you and your neighbors to publicize who does and does not vote.&quot; This study found a treatment effect of 1.0 percentage point, a statistically significant but far weaker effect than the 8.1 percentage point effect reported by Gerber, Green, and Larimer. The 2017 study&#x27;s effects were particularly sizable for low-propensity voters.

=== Charitable donations ===
An experiment conducted by Diane Reyniers and Richa Bhalla measured the amount donated by a group of London School of Economics students. The group was split into individual donators and pair donators. The donation amounts were revealed within each pair; then, the pair was given time to discuss their amounts and then revise them as necessary. In general, pair subjects donated an average of 3.64 pounds (Sterling) while individuals donated an average of 2.55 pounds. Furthermore, in pairs where one subject donated significantly more than the other, the latter would on average increase the donation amount by 0.55 pounds. This suggests that peer pressure &quot;shames&quot; individuals for making smaller donations. But when controlling for donation amount, paired subjects were significantly less happy with their donation amount than individual subjects—suggesting that paired subjects felt coerced to donate more than they would have otherwise. This leads to a dilemma: charities will do better by approaching groups of people (such as friends); however, this could result in increased donor discomfort, which would impact their future donations.

Organizational researchers have found a generally similar phenomenon among large corporations: executives and managers of large companies look to similar organizations in their industry or headquarters city to figure out the appropriate level of corporate charitable donations, and those that make smaller donations might be seen as stingy and suffer damage to their reputations.

=== Criminal justice ===
There are a number of applications for peer pressure related to adolescent exposure to the criminal justice and juvenile justice system, which relate to disproportionate minority contact, differential involvement, and topics like codes of the street. Tens of thousands of juveniles offend and make contact with the criminal justice system per day, which has significant impacts within communities and neighborhoods. Neighborhoods and social contexts contribute largely to crime outcomes through social disorganization and connections with communities. There is a significant correlation between a lack of social connection between the individual and their neighborhoods and likelihood of offending / recidivism. Literature is mixed regarding the causality of neighborhood conditions and substance use, but it is more strongly correlated with peer pressure and differential social environments. This can be examined as a partial correlation, where peer pressure is the confound which strongly influences the relationships between social disorganization and negative outcomes like substance use and crime. Risky behaviors and lifestyles are closely related with all types of substance use, seen in the connections between crime and drug possession. Delinquent behaviors and tendencies for crime are most commonly associated with &quot;hard drugs&quot; like opioids and prescription drugs.

<doc id="155712" wikidata="Q106434" url="?curid=155712" title="Max Bruch">
<text>Max Bruch (6 January 1838 – 2 October 1920) was a German Romantic composer, violinist, teacher, and conductor who wrote more than 200 works, including three violin concertos, the first of which has become a staple of the violin repertoire.

== Early life and education ==
Max Bruch was born in 1838 in Cologne to Wilhelmine (), a singer, and August Carl Friedrich Bruch, an attorney who became vice president of the Cologne police. Max had a sister, Mathilde (&quot;Till&quot;). He received his early musical training under the composer and pianist Ferdinand Hiller, to whom Robert Schumann dedicated his Piano Concerto in A minor. The Bohemian composer and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles recognized the aptitude of Bruch.

At the age of nine, Bruch wrote his first composition, a song for his mother&#x27;s birthday. From then on, music was his passion. His studies were enthusiastically supported by his parents. He wrote many minor early works including motets, psalm settings, piano pieces, violin sonatas, a string quartet, and even orchestral works such as the prelude to a planned opera, &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. Few of these early works have survived, and the whereabouts of most of his surviving compositions are unknown.

The first music theory lesson he had was in 1849 in Bonn. It was given by Professor Heinrich Carl Breidenstein, a friend of his father&#x27;s. At this time, Bruch was staying at an estate in Bergisch Gladbach, where he wrote much of his music. The farm belonged to an attorney and notary named Neissen, who lived there with his unmarried sister. Later, the estate was bought by the Zanders family, who owned a large paper mill. In later years, became a friend and patron to Bruch.

The young Bruch was taught French and English conversation by his father, who was very wealthy.

== Career ==
After briefly studying philosophy and art in Bonn (1859), Bruch had a long career as a teacher, conductor, and composer, moving among musical posts in Germany: Mannheim (1862–1864), Koblenz (1865–1867), Sondershausen (1867–1870), Berlin (1870–1872), and Bonn, where he spent 1873–78 working privately. At the height of his career he spent three seasons as conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society (1880–83).

He taught composition at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik from 1890 until his retirement in 1910. His notable students included the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi, American pianist Rudolph Reuter, and the German pianist, composer, and writer Clara Mathilda Faisst (1872–1948). &quot;&quot;

== Personal life and final years ==
Bruch married Clara Tuczek, born in 1854, a singer whom he had met on tour in Berlin, on 3 January 1881. She is believed to have been 26 at the time of the marriage. She belonged to a musical family; her sister was composer Felicia Tuczek. The couple returned to Liverpool where Bruch was conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society (1880–83) and took lodgings in the Sefton Park area. Their daughter, Margaretha, was born in Liverpool in 1882. Their first son, Max Felix Bruch, was born on 31 May 1884 in Breslau and showed great aptitude for music at an early age. They had two further sons, Hans and Ewald.

== Death ==
Bruch died in his home in Berlin-Friedenau in 1920. He was buried next to his wife Clara, who had died on 26 August 1919, at the Old St. Matthäus churchyard at Berlin-Schöneberg. Margaretha Bruch later had carved on the gravestone, &quot;Music is the language of God.&quot;

== Works ==

Bruch&#x27;s complex and well-structured works in the German Romantic musical tradition placed him in the camp of Romantic classicism exemplified by Johannes Brahms, rather than the opposing &quot;New Music&quot; of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. In his time, he was known primarily as a choral composer and often, to his chagrin, was overshadowed by his friend Brahms, who was more popular and widely regarded.

Today, as it was during his life, Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, in G minor, Op. 26 (1866) is one of the most popular Romantic violin concertos. It uses several techniques from Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor, including the linking of movements, as well as omitting the Classical opening orchestral exposition and other conservative formal structural devices of earlier concertos. Joseph Joachim was the main person he referred to while composing and developing his concerto, and it was Joachim&#x27;s revisions which made it to the final version of the piece that was published. Despite these modifications to the conventional Romantic style, Bruch often was considered a conservative composer. 

The two other works of Bruch that still are widely played, also were written for solo string instrument with orchestra: the &quot;Scottish Fantasy&quot; for violin and orchestra, which includes an arrangement of the tune &quot;Hey Tuttie Tatie&quot;, best known for its use in the song &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; by Robert Burns; and the &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;, Op. 47, for cello and orchestra (subtitled &quot;Adagio on Hebrew Melodies for Violoncello and Orchestra&quot;), which begins and ends with the solo cello&#x27;s setting of the Kol Nidre (&quot;All Vows ... &quot;) incantation that opens the Jewish (Ashkenazic) Yom Kippur service. This work may well have inspired Ernest Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Schelomo&quot; (subtitled &quot;Hebrew Rhapsody&quot;) of 1916, an even more passionate and extended one-movement composition, also with a Jewish subject and also for solo cello and orchestra.

The success of &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; led to an assumption by many that Bruch was of Jewish ancestry, although Bruch denied this and there is no evidence that he was Jewish. As far as can be ascertained, none of his ancestors were Jews. Bruch was given the middle name Christian, and was raised Protestant. Indeed, despite repeated denials by his surviving family, so long as the Nazi Party was in power (1933–1945), performance of his music was restricted because he was considered a &quot;possible Jew&quot; for having written music with an openly Jewish theme. As a result, his music was largely forgotten in German-speaking countries.

In the realm of chamber music, Bruch is not well known, although his &quot;Eight Pieces for Clarinet, Viola, and Piano&quot; are occasionally revived, there being very little other music written for this rare combination of instruments. As with Brahms and Weber who produced clarinet compositions with a particular clarinetist in mind, so did Bruch write these trios for a particular clarinettist, his own son Max. These pieces do not stand alone, however, in Bruch&#x27;s output. Nevertheless, he wrote many pieces in the chamber music tradition, of which his septet is noteworthy. His first major pieces, composed at the start of his career, are two string quartets that are similar in tone and intensity to Schumann&#x27;s string quartets (Op. 41). The composition of his second piano quintet is intriguing, as he began the composition while conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society. Although written for amateurs, it is a fair composition and was completed only after Bruch, having left Liverpool, was gently persuaded to finish the last movement.

Sir Donald Tovey wrote &quot;I find myself entirely in agreement with the writer of the article in Grove&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; who says that Bruch&#x27;s greatest mastery lies in the treatment of chorus and orchestra.&quot; Tovey went on to praise in particular &quot;Odysseus: Szenen aus der Odyssee&quot; (&quot;Odysseus: Scenes from The Odyssey&quot;), op. 41, for chorus, soloists and orchestra, and a Kyrie and Sanctus.
In 1918, toward the end of his life, Bruch once more considered smaller ensembles with the composition of two string quintets, of which one served as the basis for a string octet, written in 1920 for four violins, two violas, cello, and a double bass. This octet is somewhat at odds with the innovative style of the decade. While composers such as Schönberg and Stravinsky were part of the forward-looking modern trend, Bruch and others tried to keep composing within the Romantic tradition, avoiding the revolutionary spirit of the era. All three of these late chamber works exhibit a &#x27;concertante&#x27; style in which the first violin part is predominant and contains much of the musical interest. By the time they came to be performed professionally for the first time, in the 1930s, Bruch&#x27;s reputation had deteriorated and he was known only for the famous Concerto.

Bruch&#x27;s other works include his two less well-known concerti for violin and orchestra, No. 2 in D minor (1878) and No. 3 in D minor (1891) (which Bruch regarded as at least as fine as the famous first); as well as a Concerto for Clarinet, Viola, and Orchestra, and many more pieces for violin, viola, or cello, and orchestra. His three symphonies contain distinctive German Romantic melodic writing that is orchestrated effectively.

To this triple output he added three orchestral suites in later life, of which the third has a remarkable history. Its origin can be found in Capri, where Bruch had witnessed a procession in which a tune was played on a tuba that &quot;could very well be the basis of a funeral march&quot;, and would be the basis of this suite, that he finished in 1909. The American Sutro sisters piano duo, Rose and Ottilie Sutro, however, had asked Bruch for a concerto specifically for them, which he produced by arranging this suite into a double piano concerto, but only to be played within the Americas and not beyond. The Concerto in A flat minor for Two Pianos and Orchestra, Op. 88a, was finished in 1912 for the Sutros, but was never played in the original version. They performed the work only twice, in two different versions of their own. The score was withdrawn in 1917 and rediscovered only after Ottilie Sutro&#x27;s death in 1970. The sisters also played a major part in the fate of the manuscript of the Violin Concerto No. 1: Bruch had sent it to them to be sold in the United States, but they kept it and sold it only for their own profit.

Violinists Joseph Joachim and Willy Hess advised Bruch on his writing for that instrument, and Hess premiered some of his works, including the &quot;Concert Piece for Violin and Orchestra&quot;, Op. 84, which was composed for him.

<text>Pyroelectricity (from Greek: &quot;pyr&quot; (πυρ), &quot;fire&quot; and electricity) is a property of certain crystals which are naturally electrically polarized and as a result contain large electric fields. Pyroelectricity can be described as the ability of certain materials to generate a temporary voltage when they are heated or cooled. The change in temperature modifies the positions of the atoms slightly within the crystal structure, so that the polarization of the material changes. This polarization change gives rise to a voltage across the crystal. If the temperature stays constant at its new value, the pyroelectric voltage gradually disappears due to leakage current. The leakage can be due to electrons moving through the crystal, ions moving through the air, or current leaking through a voltmeter attached across the crystal.

== Explanation ==
Pyroelectric charge in minerals develops on the opposite faces of asymmetric crystals. The direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material, but, in some materials, this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field. These materials are said to exhibit ferroelectricity.

All known pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. Despite being pyroelectric, novel materials such as boron aluminum nitride (BAlN) and boron gallium nitride (BGaN) have zero piezoelectric response for strain along the c-axis at certain compositions, the two properties being closely related. However, note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity.

Pyroelectric materials are mostly hard and crystals; however, soft pyroelectricity can be achieved by using electrets.

Pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization (a vector) proportional to a change in temperature. The total pyroelectric coefficient measured at constant stress is the sum of the pyroelectric coefficients at constant strain (primary pyroelectric effect) and the piezoelectric contribution from thermal expansion (secondary pyroelectric effect). Under normal circumstances, even polar materials do not display a net dipole moment. As a consequence, there are no electric dipole equivalents of bar magnets because the intrinsic dipole moment is neutralized by &quot;free&quot; electric charge that builds up on the surface by internal conduction or from the ambient atmosphere. Polar crystals only reveal their nature when perturbed in some fashion that momentarily upsets the balance with the compensating surface charge.

Spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent, so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces. This is the pyroelectric effect. All polar crystals are pyroelectric, so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes. Pyroelectric materials can be used as infrared and millimeter wavelength radiation detectors.

An electret is the electrical equivalent of a permanent magnet.

=== Mathematical description ===
The pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature:
formula_1
where &quot;pi&quot; (Cm−2K−1) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient.

== History ==
The first record of the pyroelectric effect was made in 1707 by Johann Georg Schmidt, who noted that the &quot;[hot] tourmaline could attract the ashes from the warm or burning coals, as the magnet does iron, but also repelling them again [after the contact]&quot;. In 1717 Louis Lemery noticed, as Schmidt had, that small scraps of non-conducting material were first attracted to tourmaline, but then repelled by it once they contacted the stone. In 1747 Linnaeus first related the phenomenon to electricity (he called tourmaline &quot;Lapidem Electricum&quot;, &quot;the electric stone&quot;), although this was not proven until 1756 by Franz Ulrich Theodor Aepinus.

Research into pyroelectricity became more sophisticated in the 19th century. In 1824 Sir David Brewster gave the effect the name it has today. Both William Thomson in 1878 and Woldemar Voigt in 1897 helped develop a theory for the processes behind pyroelectricity. Pierre Curie and his brother, Jacques Curie, studied pyroelectricity in the 1880s, leading to their discovery of some of the mechanisms behind piezoelectricity.

It is mistakenly attributed to Theophrastus (c. 314 BC) the first record of pyroelectricity. The misconception arose soon after the discovery of the pyroelectric properties of tourmaline, which made mineralogists of the time associate the legendary stone &quot;Lyngurium&quot; with it. Lyngurium is described in the work of Theophrastus as being similar to amber, without specifying any pyroelectric properties.

== Crystal classes ==
All crystal structures belong to one of thirty-two crystal classes based on the number of rotational axes and reflection planes they possess that leave the crystal structure unchanged (point groups). Of the thirty-two crystal classes, twenty-one are non-centrosymmetric (not having a centre of symmetry). Of these twenty-one, twenty exhibit direct piezoelectricity, the remaining one being the cubic class 432. Ten of these twenty piezoelectric classes are polar, i.e., they possess a spontaneous polarization, having a dipole in their unit cell, and exhibit pyroelectricity. If this dipole can be reversed by the application of an electric field, the material is said to be ferroelectric. Any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization (electrostatics) when an electric field is applied, but a substance which has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material. Whether or not a material is polar is determined solely by its crystal structure. Only 10 of the 32 point groups are polar. All polar crystals are pyroelectric, so the ten polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes.

Piezoelectric crystal classes: 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4, 422, 4mm, -42m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, -6, 622, 6mm, -62m, 23, -43m

Pyroelectric: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm

===Related effects===

Two effects which are closely related to pyroelectricity are ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Normally materials are very nearly electrically neutral on the macroscopic level. However, the positive and negative charges which make up the material are not necessarily distributed in a symmetric manner. If the sum of charge times distance for all elements of the basic cell does not equal zero the cell will have an electric dipole moment (a vector quantity). The dipole moment per unit volume is defined as the dielectric polarization. If this dipole moment changes with the effect of applied temperature changes, applied electric field, or applied pressure, the material is pyroelectric, ferroelectric, or piezoelectric, respectively.

The ferroelectric effect is exhibited by materials which possess an electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field such that the polarization can be reversed if the electric field is reversed. Since all ferroelectric materials exhibit a spontaneous polarization, all ferroelectric materials are also pyroelectric (but not all pyroelectric materials are ferroelectric).

The piezoelectric effect is exhibited by crystals (such as quartz or ceramic) for which an electric voltage across the material appears when pressure is applied. Similar to pyroelectric effect, the phenomenon is due to the asymmetric structure of the crystals that allows ions to move more easily along one axis than the others. As pressure is applied, each side of the crystal takes on an opposite charge, resulting in a voltage drop across the crystal.

Pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity: In a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity, the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another, and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal. In a typical demonstration of thermoelectricity, one part of the device is kept at one temperature and the other part at a different temperature, and the result is a &quot;permanent&quot; voltage across the device as long as there is a temperature difference. Both effects convert temperature change to electrical potential, but the pyroelectric effect converts temperature change over &quot;time&quot; into electrical potential, while the thermoelectric effect converts temperature change with &quot;position&quot; into electrical potential.

== Pyroelectric materials ==
Although artificial pyroelectric materials have been engineered, the effect was first discovered in minerals such as tourmaline. The pyroelectric effect is also present in bone and tendon.

The most important example is gallium nitride, a semiconductor. The large electric fields in this material are detrimental in light emitting diodes (LEDs), but useful for the production of power transistors.

Progress has been made in creating artificial pyroelectric materials, usually in the form of a thin film, using gallium nitride (GaN), caesium nitrate (CsNO3), polyvinyl fluorides, derivatives of phenylpyridine, and cobalt phthalocyanine. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) is a crystal exhibiting both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties, which has been used to create small-scale nuclear fusion (&quot;pyroelectric fusion&quot;). Recently, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties have been discovered in doped hafnium oxide (HfO2), which is a standard material in CMOS manufacturing.

== Applications ==
Pyroelectric materials, which generate electrical charges in response to temperature fluctuations, have diverse applications due to their ability to convert thermal energy into electricity or detect thermal changes. Key applications include:

=== Heat sensors ===
Very small changes in temperature can produce a pyroelectric potential. Passive infrared sensors are often designed around pyroelectric materials, as the heat of a human or animal from several feet away is enough to generate a voltage.

* Thermal Sensors: Infrared detectors, fire alarms, gas sensors, and motion sensors utilize high voltage/current responsivity. Lead-based materials (e.g., PMN-PT) excel here due to superior figures of merit (FoMs).
* Environmental Monitoring: Detecting temperature changes in chemical processes or respiratory systems (e.g., self-powered breathing sensors).

=== Energy Harvesting and Power Generation ===
A pyroelectric can be repeatedly heated and cooled (analogously to a heat engine) to generate usable electrical power. An example of a heat engine is the movement of the pistons in an internal combustion engine like that found in a gasoline powered automobile.

One group calculated that a pyroelectric in an Ericsson cycle could reach 50% of Carnot efficiency, while a different study found a material that could, in theory, reach 84-92% of Carnot efficiency (these efficiency values are for the pyroelectric itself, ignoring losses from heating and cooling the substrate, other heat-transfer losses, and all other losses elsewhere in the system)

Possible advantages of pyroelectric generators for generating electricity (as compared to the conventional heat engine plus electrical generator) include:

* Harvesting energy from waste-heat:
** Waste Heat Recovery: Harvesting low-grade thermal energy from industrial processes, automotive systems, and electrical appliances using lead-based ceramics (e.g., PZT, PMN-PT), lead-free ceramics (e.g., BNT-BT, KNN), and polymers (e.g., PVDF-TrFE). The Olsen cycle is a prominent thermodynamic method for efficient energy conversion.
* Less bulky equipment:
** Flexible and Wearable Devices: Flexible polymers (e.g., PVDF) and composites power wearable/implantable electronics by leveraging body heat or ambient temperature changes. Examples include self-powered sensors and nanogenerators producing µW to mW/cm³ power densities.
* Fewer moving parts.

Although a few patents have been filed for such a device, such generators do not appear to be anywhere close to commercialization.

=== Nuclear fusion ===
Pyroelectric materials have been used to generate large electric fields necessary to steer deuterium ions in a nuclear fusion process. This is known as pyroelectric fusion.

=== Challenges and Future Directions ===
Despite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges that must be addressed for broader adoption. One key limitation is the trade-off between pyroelectric coefficients, dielectric properties, and thermal stability, which affects overall performance and efficiency. Additionally, the efficiency of pyroelectric energy harvesting is highly dependent on rapid temperature fluctuations, making it challenging to achieve consistent power output in practical applications. Integration into flexible and biocompatible designs for wearable and miniaturized devices also remains a significant hurdle. Ongoing research aims to enhance figures of merit (FoMs), optimize phase transitions near morphotropic boundaries, and develop hybrid systems that combine pyroelectricity with other energy-harvesting mechanisms for multifunctional applications. Despite these challenges, the versatility of pyroelectric materials positions them as critical components for sustainable energy solutions and next-generation sensor technologies.

<text>William Joseph Mayerl (31 May 1902 – 25 March 1959) was an English pianist and composer who built a career in music hall and musical theatre and became an acknowledged master of light music. Best known for his syncopated novelty piano solos, he wrote over 300 piano pieces, many of which were named after flowers and trees, including his best-known composition, &quot;Marigold&quot; (1927). He also ran the successful School of Syncopation for whose members he published hundreds of his own arrangements of popular songs.

He also composed works for piano and orchestra, often in suites with evocative names such as the &#x27;Aquarium Suite&#x27; (1937), comprising &quot;Willow Moss&quot;, &quot;Moorish Idol&quot;, &quot;Fantail&quot;, and &quot;Whirligig&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Mayerl was born in 1902 on London&#x27;s Tottenham Court Road, near the West End theatre district. His father, a violin player, attempted to introduce him to the violin age of four, but failed. After noticing his affinity to the piano, he started him with piano lessons. By age seven he was studying at the Trinity College of Music, paid for with a series of scholarships. His first major concert was at age nine, playing Edvard Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto. In his teens, he supplemented these lessons by accompanying silent movies and playing at dances.

While studying at Trinity College, Mayerl began visiting a local music arcade known as &#x27;Gayland&#x27;, where he first encountered North American ragtime music. After trying his hand at composing it, he was threatened with expulsion from Trinity College if he continued, and it was a decade before his first composition was re-issued as &#x27;The Jazz Master&#x27;.

Attracted to North American popular music, Mayerl joined a Southampton hotel band in 1921. He recorded about 37 piano rolls of popular tunes of the early &#x27;20s for the Echo label in London. He subsequently joined the Savoy Havana Band in London and became a celebrity. In the late 20s he recorded in London a single title, &quot;Eskimo Shivers&quot;, on the Duo-Art player piano system for the Aeolian Company.

==Career==

In 1926, Mayerl left the Savoy and opened his &#x27;School of Syncopation&#x27; which specialised in teaching modern music techniques such as ragtime and stride piano. It led to the long-running correspondence course, &#x27;How to play like Billy Mayerl&#x27;. During this period, he wrote his most famous solo, &#x27;Marigold&#x27;. By the late 1930s his correspondence school was believed to have had over 100 staff members and 30,000 students. It closed in 1957.

On 28 October 1925, Mayerl was the soloist in the London premiere of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. In December 1926, he appeared with Gwen Farrar (1899–1944) in a short film—made in the Lee de Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film process—in which they sang Mayerl&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Sweetie on the Radio&quot;. His song &quot;Miss Up-to-Date&quot; was sung and played by Cyril Ritchard in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s sound film &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929).

In November 1927, his piano styles accompanied the Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce, American Vaudeville vocal harmonizers who first recorded in England.

On 1 October 1929, Billy Mayerl&#x27;s orchestra performed at the opening of the Locarno Dance Hall in Streatham.

In the 1930s Mayerl composed several works for the musical theatre, including three connected with horse racing: &quot;Sporting Love&quot;, opening at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1934; &quot;Twenty to One&quot; (Coliseum 1935); and &quot;Over She Goes&quot; (Saville 1936). In 1938, jazz pianist Marian McPartland joined his group &quot;Mayerl&#x27;s Claviers&quot; under the name Marian Page.

Mayerl stepped in as bandleader for the Grosvenor House Hotel in May 1941, when Sydney Lipton was called up to serve with the Royal Corps of Signals. Lipton returned after the war.

==Death==

Mayerl died in 1959 from a heart attack at his home in Beaconsfield, Marigold Lodge, after a long illness.

He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in north London on 31 March 1959 and his ashes were placed in the Cedar Lawn Rose Bed. His name is listed in the Book of Remembrance.

==Personal life==
In 1923 Mayerl married pianist Ermenegilda (Jill) Bernini, a childhood sweetheart. She later helped him write duet arrangements.

<text>Tiffany Renee Darwish (born October 2, 1971), known mononymously as Tiffany, is an American pop singer. Her 1987 cover of the Tommy James and the Shondells song &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; spent two weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and was released as the second single from her debut studio album &quot;Tiffany&quot;.

Her singles &quot;Could&#x27;ve Been&quot; and &quot;I Saw Him Standing There&quot;, a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; were soon released. The former claimed the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Thanks to an original mall tour, &quot;The Beautiful You: Celebrating The Good Life Shopping Mall Tour &#x27;87&quot;, Tiffany found commercial success; and both her singles and the album peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, respectively.

Tiffany&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Hold an Old Friend&#x27;s Hand,&quot; featured a Top 10 single which charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1988. It achieved platinum status, although it did not replicate the success of her debut album. Two additional releases from Tiffany, 1990&#x27;s &quot;New Inside&quot; and the Asia-exclusive &quot;Dreams Never Die&quot; in 1993, both failed to rekindle significant interest. She returned in 2000 with her first studio album in six years, &quot;The Color of Silence&quot;. Although the album received some minor critical success, it also failed to achieve any significant standing. Since 2000, Tiffany has recorded five additional studio albums, as well as two albums of 1980s cover songs, and she continues to tour.

Outside of music, Tiffany posed nude in &quot;Playboy&quot; and has guest-starred on several reality television shows, including &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, Australia&#x27;s version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;, and has acted in a handful of horror and science fiction films, including &quot;Necrosis&quot; (2009), &quot;Mega Piranha&quot; (2010), and &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Tiffany Renee Darwish was born on October 2, 1971, in Norwalk which is east of Los Angeles, to Janie Wilson and James Robert Darwish, who divorced when she was 14 months old.

In an interview with MLive, Tiffany said, “Most of my family is from Dearborn. They’re from Lebanon. So, I’m Lebanese. A little village. Because of Ford, everybody kind of moved here. Big Dearborn community... all my family.&quot; She is also of Irish, Scottish, German and Cherokee descent.

Tiffany began singing at age four when she learned the words to the Tanya Tucker song &quot;Delta Dawn&quot;. After her parents&#x27; divorce, she lived with her father and went to Norwalk High School in Norwalk as a freshman and sophomore. Then she attended Norwalk&#x27;s Leffingwell Christian High School.

==Music career==
===1980s===
In 1981, Tiffany debuted with country music singer Jack Reeves at a country and western venue, Narods, in Chino, California. She passed a hat among the crowd afterwards, and collected $235 in what were her first career earnings. When Tiffany was singing at the Palomino Club, she was discovered by Hoyt Axton and his mother Mae Axton. Mae took her to sing in Nashville, Tennessee, where she performed on WSMV&#x27;s &quot;The Ralph Emery Show&quot;, singing Juice Newton&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; and Tammy Wynette&#x27;s &quot;Your Good Girl&#x27;s Gonna Go Bad&quot;.

In 1984, Tiffany signed a recording contract with George Tobin after he heard her sing on a demo tape. In 1985, she appeared on &quot;Star Search&quot; with Ed McMahon, where she finished in second place overall. In 1986, she signed a contract that gave Tobin total control over her career, recorded her debut studio album and was signed to an MCA contract. The album, &quot;Tiffany&quot;, was released in 1987, but the first single she released from it, &quot;Danny&quot;, failed to chart. Following the failure of &quot;Danny&quot;, Tobin sent Tiffany on a nationwide tour of shopping malls, &quot;The Beautiful You: Celebrating the Good Life Shopping Mall Tour &#x27;87&quot;. The tour began at the Bergen Mall in Paramus, New Jersey. Her second single, a cover of Tommy James and the Shondells&#x27; hit, &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;, became a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 list. It remains her biggest hit.

Tiffany&#x27;s ballad &quot;Could&#x27;ve Been&quot; also peaked at the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, in February 1988. Tiffany&#x27;s modified version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, retitled &quot;I Saw &quot;Him&quot; Standing There&quot;, peaked at the No. 7 position on the Hot 100. &quot;Feelings of Forever&quot; also had chart success. Tiffany set a record for the youngest female artist to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with a debut album. Later that year, she toured, with boy band New Kids on the Block as her opening act.

In 1988, at the peak of her popularity, Tiffany was embroiled in a conflict in which Tobin fought her mother and stepfather over control of her career and earnings. This led to a court fight in which Tiffany tried to have herself declared an emancipated minor. This was rejected by the court, but the judge did allow her to move out of her mother&#x27;s home, and her grandmother (who sided with Tiffany during the trial) became her temporary guardian. In late 1988, Tiffany released her second studio album, &quot;Hold an Old Friend&#x27;s Hand&quot;, which was less successful than her debut. Although it did not include any number-one hits, the song &quot;All This Time&quot; made the top 10.

Shortly after turning eighteen, Tiffany left Tobin&#x27;s management and signed with Dick Scott and Kim Glover, who managed New Kids on the Block, by then a successful boy band.

===1990s===
Tiffany&#x27;s career suffered as musical tastes changed in the early 1990s, moving away from dance-pop and towards harder-edged rock and rap. Tiffany&#x27;s popularity, however, remained strong in Asia, especially Hong Kong and Southeast Asia; in Hong Kong, her ballads received cover versions in Cantonese from Cantopop artists. Her third studio album, the urban-influenced &quot;New Inside&quot; (1990), received mixed reviews from music critics, and failed to chart, despite several TV appearances to promote it, including on the fantasy sitcom &quot;Out of This World&quot;. In 1991, Tiffany participated in the recording of the song &quot;Voices That Care&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

During a brief early 1990s comeback attempt, Tiffany reunited with Tobin on the album &quot;Dreams Never Die&quot; (1993), which spawned the singles &quot;If Love is Blind&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t You See&quot;. The album, mostly containing ballads, was released on Asian markets and was accompanied by a six-week tour of clubs, shopping malls and radio stations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia; a US release was planned, but it never materialized. She headlined her own show at the Las Vegas Hilton in the summer of 1993, before breaking with Tobin once again.

In 1995, Tiffany moved to Nashville to develop her career as a songwriter, and to attempt a return as a country music artist. In 1998, she appeared on the U2 tribute album &quot;We Will Follow: A Tribute to U2&quot; in a collaboration with Canadian industrial act Front Line Assembly performing &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;.

===2000s===
In 2000, Tiffany released her fifth studio album, &quot;The Color of Silence&quot;, which received favorable reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;one of the best pop albums of the year&quot; and the year&#x27;s &quot;biggest surprise&quot;. Her College Promotional Tour broke attendance records at most tour stops.

Tiffany posed nude for the April 2002 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. Tiffany stated in interviews that she explained to her nine-year-old son that it was no different from posing in &quot;Vogue&quot; or &quot;Elle&quot;, except that it showed more. She added years later that while she had no regrets about posing in &quot;Playboy&quot;, some of her family members disapproved because of how young her son was at the time.

On April 2, 2005, Tiffany was featured on the British TV show &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;, performing the Girls Aloud song &quot;Love Machine&quot; and securing a place in the show&#x27;s finale. She also appeared on the US version of the show on June 2, 2005, losing to hip hop group Arrested Development. Tiffany released her sixth studio album &quot;Dust Off and Dance&quot; on CD Baby in May 2005, followed later as a digital release on iTunes. It was dedicated to her new husband, but recorded as a thank you to her fans (particularly her gay and European fanbase) for reminding her about the fun to be had with her career. The album consisted of Eurodance and Hi-NRG style songs. Singles from &quot;Dust Off and Dance&quot;, included &quot;Ride It&quot;, &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Be with U Tonite&quot;, &quot;Na Na Na&quot;, and &quot;Artificial Girlfriend&quot;.

Tiffany toured with the album, which in September 2006 was nominated for six JPF Awards. She won for best dance song of the year for &quot;Be with U Tonite&quot; and best dance CD of the year on November 4, 2006. In 2007, Tiffany, who had begun to struggle with her weight, was cast for the fifth season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;. The show premiered on April 22, 2007.

The album features updated versions of her first three Top Ten hits from her debut album, as well as cover versions of songs from other artists of the 1980s.

Tiffany&#x27;s music video for &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; is featured in an episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;, and the 2012 film &quot;Ted&quot;. Tiffany in 2007 signed a recording contract with 10 Spot Records, a new division of Water Music Records Group, distributed by Universal Music Group, and released a new album titled &quot;Just Me&quot;. The album contained all-new material in a singer-songwriter format &quot;à la&quot; her earlier album &quot;The Color of Silence&quot; (2000). The first single from the album, &quot;Feels Like Love&quot;, was released on May 1, 2007.

In early August 2007, the dance single &quot;Higher&quot; began showing up online. On October 2, 2007 (Tiffany&#x27;s 36th birthday), it debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart as the number-one breakout, her first &quot;Billboard&quot; chart appearance since 1989. From there, the single climbed the charts to No. 19. In March 2008, Tiffany released &quot;Mimi&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, an album limited to 500 copies and featuring rare demos from age three through the present. It was shipped to fans in a personalized package which also included autographed photos, two autographed CDs, and the &quot;Mimi&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; demo collection. A small subset of the release also included &quot;Playboy&quot; T-shirts.

In late April 2008, a track with the same name as her 2005 dance album &quot;Dust Off and Dance&quot; became available for download on the Internet. The song consisted of Tiffany performing vocals for the dance team Hydra Productions; it is on their album &quot;Liquid&quot;. In early January 2009, the single reached number one on the Hot Club Play Breakout charts. In late July 2008, a new Tiffany dance song remixed by Dave Audé, &quot;Just Another Day&quot;, was released on CD. It peaked at No. 28 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart. On October 18, 2008, Tiffany appeared on the CMT reality show &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;, and was eliminated in the first episode.

===2010s===
On January 14, 2011, Tiffany released the single &quot;Serpentine&quot; on iTunes. The country song was taken from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot;, in which she also starred. Her album &quot;Rose Tattoo&quot;, released on March 1, 2011, was her first professional foray into country music. On April 22, 2011, it was announced that Tiffany would be teaming up with fellow 1980s pop music sensation Debbie Gibson for an upcoming summer concert tour titled &quot;Journey Through the 80&#x27;s&quot;. When asked what material the pair would perform in the concerts, Tiffany said it would be a 1980s retrospective which in addition to their own material, would feature covers by Stevie Nicks, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Reba McEntire.

In December 2012, having opened a clothing boutique of her own, Tiffany appeared on TLC&#x27;s makeover reality show &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;. In January 2014, Tiffany became one of the eight stars competing in season three of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. She won an MVP bonus of $2,500 in the first week of the competition, and ultimately placed third.

Tiffany was a celebrity contestant in 2018 on the fourth season of the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and became the first celebrity eliminated from the series after 16 days in the jungle. On September 21, 2018, Tiffany self-released her tenth studio album, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, via her own label, Go On Then Records. The next month her cover of Logan Lynn’s &quot;Big City Now&quot; was released as part of a multi-media double album titled &quot;My Movie Star&quot; produced by Lynn and Jay Mohr. In April 2019, Tiffany released an updated version of her hit &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; that featured a rock and roll arrangement.

She also released her first original Christmas single &quot;Angels&quot; on December 4 of the same year on streaming services. &quot;Angels&quot; was written and recorded at her home studio in Nashville, Tennessee with Mark Alberici and Margie Hauser. Tiffany said, &quot;The song is about hope and missing family. In my more than 30-year career, I&#x27;ve never recorded an original Christmas song, but it just felt right. It&#x27;s raw and real and that&#x27;s what makes it special to me.&quot;

While struggling through a November 2021 live performance of &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; in Melbourne, Florida, Tiffany yelled an expletive at the crowd. Once media outlets picked up the story, Tiffany&#x27;s representative said that she had lost her voice and was frustrated with her performance. Tiffany then addressed the event herself, apologizing for her actions that she claimed were the result of a combination of voice loss, panic attack, and frustration.

Tiffany&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Shadows&quot;, produced by Alberici, was released on November 25, 2022 via Deko Entertainment and Revolt Artist Management.

==Film and television career==
Tiffany&#x27;s first acting job was providing the voice of Judy Jetson on &quot;&quot;, which was released in 1990. She also contributed three songs to the soundtrack including the single &quot;I Always Thought I&#x27;d See You Again&quot; and the main song &quot;You and Me&quot;. Some controversy resulted from the fact that Janet Waldo, who had voiced the character in all previous &quot;Jetsons&quot; material, had all of her recorded dialogue in the movie replaced because studio executives thought Tiffany would attract a younger audience. The film however was a box-office bomb. In April 2008, Tiffany starred in a national commercial campaign for AT&amp;T titled &quot;Paradise by the GoPhone Light&quot; for AT&amp;T&#x27;s GoPhone, which featured the singer Meat Loaf. The ad, which parodies his &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; was released in two versions, an extended music video version and a short commercial edit.

Also in April 2008, Tiffany made a cameo appearance on the sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; in the episode &quot;Sandcastles in the Sand&quot;. She played herself as a backing vocalist in the 1980s-inspired music video by a fictional teen Canadian pop star who was inspired by real-life singers like Tiffany making a career out of performing in malls. Tiffany starred in the 2008 short film &quot;The Isolationist,&quot; which was screened at several film festivals. Her character, Barbara Newman, is a sexually-aggressive woman unwilling to let a co-worker enjoy some alone time. In 2009, she completed work on her first feature film, &quot;Necrosis&quot;, which was released internationally as &quot;Blood Snow&quot;. &quot;Necrosis&quot; is an independent psychological thriller in which she starred alongside James Kyson and George Stults. In the film, she plays Karen, a fun-loving adrenaline junkie who takes matters into her own hands after a blizzard traps her and her friends in a cabin, when paranoia gets the best of them. &quot;Necrosis&quot; premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Tiffany&#x27;s musical contemporary, Debbie Gibson, had her film &quot;Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus&quot; premiere at Cannes, as well. Tiffany also starred in a film from The Asylum, the mockbuster &quot;Mega Piranha&quot;, directed by Eric Forsberg, which also starred Barry Williams.

Tiffany and Gibson starred together in a Syfy original movie &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot;, which aired January 29, 2011. The movie featured a protracted catfight between Tiffany and Gibson. The 2008 documentary &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; is about two fans of Tiffany who both claim to be in love with Tiffany and have been labeled &quot;stalkers&quot; by the media. While Tiffany did not voluntarily participate in the production, she does appear in the film.

In 2011, Tiffany filmed an episode of the Biography Channel TV series &quot;Celebrity Close Calls&quot;. On the episode first broadcast July 7, 2013, of the reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, she traded places with actress/singer Nia Peeples. Tiffany was the subject in 2013 of the Season 10 premiere episode of &quot;What Not To Wear&quot; on TLC. Later that year she starred in a Miracle Whip commercial alongside other celebrities, including Wynonna Judd, Lance Bass, Susan Boyle, and the Village People. In 2024, Tiffany appeared as Eiffel Tower on the fifth series of the UK edition of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. She finished fourth, narrowly missing out on a place in the finals.

<doc id="155721" wikidata="Q616886" url="?curid=155721" title="Ken Burns">
<text>Kenneth Lauren Burns (born July 29, 1953) is an American filmmaker known for his documentary films and television series, many of which chronicle American history and culture. His work is often produced in association with WETA-TV or the National Endowment for the Humanities and distributed by PBS.

Burns&#x27;s widely known documentary series include &quot;The Civil War&quot; (1990), &quot;Baseball&quot; (1994), &quot;Jazz&quot; (2001), &quot;The War&quot; (2007), &quot;The National Parks: America&#x27;s Best Idea&quot; (2009), &quot;Prohibition&quot; (2011), &quot;The Roosevelts&quot; (2014), &quot;The Vietnam War&quot; (2017), and &quot;Country Music&quot; (2019). He was also executive producer of both &quot;The West&quot; (1996), and &quot;Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies&quot; (2015). Burns&#x27;s documentaries have earned two Academy Award nominations (for 1981&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Statue of Liberty&quot;) and have won several Emmy Awards, among other honors.

==Early life and education==
Burns was born on July 29, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York, to Lyla Smith (née Tupper) Burns, a biotechnician, and Robert Kyle Burns Jr., at the time a graduate student in cultural anthropology at Columbia University in Manhattan. The documentary filmmaker Ric Burns is his younger brother. 

Burns&#x27;s academic family moved frequently. Among places they called home were Saint-Véran, France; Newark, Delaware; and Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father taught at the University of Michigan. Burns describes growing up as &quot;hippies&quot; in Ann Arbor.

Burns&#x27;s mother was found to have breast cancer when he was three, and she died when he was 11, a circumstance that he said helped shape his career; he credited his psychologist father-in-law, Gerald Stechler, with a significant insight: &quot;He told me that my whole work was an attempt to make people long gone come back alive.&quot; Well-read as a child, he absorbed the family encyclopedia, preferring history to fiction.

Upon receiving an 8 mm film movie camera for his 17th birthday, he shot a documentary about an Ann Arbor factory. He graduated from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor in 1971. Turning down reduced tuition at the University of Michigan, he attended Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where students are graded through narrative evaluations rather than letter grades and where students create self-directed academic concentrations instead of choosing a traditional major.

Burns worked in a record store to pay his tuition. Living on as little as $2,500 in two years in Walpole, New Hampshire, Burns studied under photographers Jerome Liebling, Elaine Mayes, and others. He describes Liebling as his &quot;principal mentor.&quot; He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in film studies and design in 1975.

==Florentine Films==
In 1976, Burns, Elaine Mayes, and college classmate Roger Sherman founded a production company called Florentine Films in Walpole, New Hampshire. The company&#x27;s name was borrowed from Mayes&#x27;s hometown of Florence, Massachusetts. Another Hampshire College student, Buddy Squires, was invited to succeed Mayes as a founding member one year later. The trio were later joined by a fourth member, Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Hott. Hott did not actually matriculate at Hampshire, but worked on films there. Hott had begun his career as an attorney, having attended nearby Western New England Law School.

Each member works independently, but releases content under the shared name of Florentine Films. As such, their individual &quot;subsidiary&quot; companies include &quot;Ken Burns Media&quot;, &quot;Sherman Pictures&quot;, and &quot;Hott Productions&quot;. Burns&#x27;s oldest child, Sarah, is also an employee of the company as of 2020.

==Career==
Burns initially worked as a cinematographer for the BBC, Italian television, and others. In 1977, having completed some documentary short films, he began work on adapting David McCullough&#x27;s book &quot;The Great Bridge&quot;, about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Developing a signature style of documentary filmmaking in which he &quot;adopted the technique of cutting rapidly from one still picture to another in a fluid, linear fashion [and] then pepped up the visuals with &#x27;first hand&#x27; narration gleaned from contemporary writings and recited by top stage and screen actors&quot;, Burns made the feature documentary &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; (1981), which was narrated by David McCullough, earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary and ran on PBS in the United States.

Following another documentary, &quot;The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God&quot; (1984), Burns was Oscar-nominated again for &quot;The Statue of Liberty&quot; (1985). Burns frequently collaborates with author and historian Geoffrey C. Ward, notably on documentaries such as &quot;The Civil War&quot;, &quot;Jazz&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, and the 10 part TV series &quot;The Vietnam War&quot; (aired September 2017).

Burns has built a long, successful career directing and producing well-received television documentaries and documentary miniseries. His oeuvre covers diverse subjects including art (&quot;Thomas Hart Benton&quot;, 1988), mass media (&quot;Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio&quot;, 1991), sports (&quot;Baseball&quot;, 1994, updated with &quot;10th Inning&quot;, 2010), political history (&quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot;, 1997), music (&quot;Jazz&quot;, 2001; &quot;Country Music&quot;, 2019), literature (&quot;Mark Twain&quot;, 2001; &quot;Hemingway&quot;, 2021), environmentalism (&quot;The National Parks&quot;, 2009), and war (the 15-hour World War II documentary &quot;The War&quot;, 2007; and the 11-hour &quot;The Civil War&quot;, 1990, which All Media Guide says &quot;many consider his &#x27;chef d&#x27;oeuvre).

In 2007, Burns made an agreement with PBS to produce work for the network well into the next decade. According to a 2017 piece in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Burns and his company, Florentine Films, have selected topics for documentaries slated for release by 2030. These topics include country music, the Mayo Clinic, Muhammad Ali, Ernest Hemingway, the American Revolution, Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack Obama, Winston Churchill, the American criminal justice system, and African-American history from the Civil War to the Great Migration. On April 5, 2021, &quot;Hemingway&quot;, a three-episode, six-hour documentary, a recapitulation of Hemingway&#x27;s life, labors, and loves, debuted on the Public Broadcasting System, co-produced and directed by Burns and Lynn Novick.

==Personal life==
In 1979, Burns moved from Manhattan, New York, New York to Walpole, New Hampshire , where he rented a house that he eventually bought. The original reason was that his rent rose from US$275 to $325 (from US$ to $ in dollars). He has credited the move to small-town America with ultimately jump-starting his later success.

In 1982, Burns married Amy Stechler. The couple had two daughters, Sarah and Lilly. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1993.

, Burns was residing in Walpole, New Hampshire. He and Julie Deborah Brown, daughter of Leslie Mundjer and the Smith Barney senior vice president Richard Brown and stepdaughter of Ellen Brown, married on October 18, 2003. Julie Deborah Brown founded Room to Grow, a non-profit providing aid to babies in poor families. They have two daughters.

Burns is a descendant of Johannes de Peyster Sr. through Gerardus Clarkson, an American Revolutionary War physician from Philadelphia, and he is a distant relative of Scottish poet Robert Burns. In 2014, Burns appeared in Henry Louis Gates&#x27;s &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; where he discovered that he is a descendant of a slave owner from the Deep South, in addition to having a lineage which traces back to Colonial Americans of Loyalist allegiance during the American Revolution.

Burns is an avid quilt collector. About one-third of the quilts from his personal collection were displayed at The International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum at the University of Nebraska from January 19 to May 13, 2018. 

When asked if he would ever make a film regarding his mother Lyla, Burns responded: &quot;All of my films are about her. I don&#x27;t think I could do it directly, because of how intensely painful it is.&quot;

Burns has recounted his devotion to the &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle: &quot;There has not been a day since when I haven&#x27;t done the New York Times crossword puzzle.&quot;

===Politics===
Burns is a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party, describing himself as a “Yellow dog Democrat” and contributing almost $40,000 in political donations. In 2008, the Democratic National Committee chose Burns to produce the introductory video for Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s August 2008 speech to the Democratic National Convention, a video described by &quot;Politico&quot; as a &quot;Burns-crafted tribute casting him [Kennedy] as the modern Ulysses bringing his party home to port.&quot;

In August 2009, Kennedy died, and Burns produced a short eulogy video at his funeral. In endorsing Barack Obama for the U.S. presidency in December 2007, Burns compared Obama to Abraham Lincoln. He said he had planned to be a regular contributor to &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; on Current TV. In 2016, he also gave a commencement speech for Stanford University criticizing Donald Trump.

In 2023, a 2013 photograph of Ken Burns and Clarence Thomas at a Koch Brothers fundraising event was made public in a Pro Publica article about Justice Thomas&#x27; ties to right wing activists. Burns stated that the encounter was a brief social encounter resulting from Charles Koch&#x27;s support of PBS programming.

In 2012, Burns received the Washington University International Humanities Medal.

In 2013, Burns received the John Steinbeck Award, an award presented annually by Steinbeck&#x27;s eldest son, Thomas, in collaboration with the John Steinbeck Family Foundation, San Jose State University, and the Martha Heasley Cox Center for Steinbeck Studies.

In May 2015, Burns gave the commencement address at Washington University in St. Louis and received an honorary doctorate of humanities.

Burns was the Grand Marshal for the 2016 Pasadena Tournament of Roses&#x27; Rose Parade on New Year&#x27;s Day in Pasadena, California. The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Burns to deliver the 2016 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities, on the topic of race in America.

In 2019, he received an honorary degree from Brown University.

In 2022 he served as the commencement speaker at the University of Pennsylvania and received an Honorary Doctor of Arts.

==Style==
Burns frequently incorporates simple musical leitmotifs or melodies. For example, &quot;The Civil War&quot; features a distinctive violin melody throughout, &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot;, which was performed for the film by its composer, fiddler Jay Ungar. One critic noted, &quot;One of the most memorable things about &quot;The Civil War&quot; was its haunting, repeated violin melody, whose thin, yearning notes seemed somehow to sum up all the pathos of that great struggle.&quot;
Burns often gives life to still photographs by slowly zooming out subjects of interest and panning from one subject to another. It has long been used in film production where it is known as the &quot;rostrum camera&quot;. This technique, possible in many professional and home software applications, is now termed the &quot;Ken Burns effect&quot; in Apple&#x27;s iPhoto, iMovie, and Final Cut Pro X software applications.
Burns stated in a 2009 interview that he initially declined to have his name associated with the software because of his stance to refuse commercial endorsements. However, Apple chief Steve Jobs negotiated to give Burns Apple equipment, which Burns donated to nonprofit organizations.

As a museum retrospective noted, &quot;His PBS specials [are] strikingly out of step with the visual pyrotechnics and frenetic pacing of most reality-based TV programming, relying instead on techniques that are literally decades old, although Burns reintegrates these constituent elements into a wholly new and highly complex textual arrangement.&quot;

In a 2011 interview, Burns stated that he admires and is influenced by filmmaker Errol Morris.

<text>Deborah Ann Gibson (born August 31, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She released her debut album &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1987) at age 16, writing and largely producing the material. The album spawned several international hits, later being certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. One of those singles, &quot;Foolish Beat&quot;, made Gibson the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single. Her double-platinum second album &quot;Electric Youth&quot; (1989) gave Gibson another U.S. number-one hit with &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot;. Gibson is the sole songwriter on all of her singles to reach the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She was recognized by ASCAP as Songwriter of the Year, along with Bruce Springsteen, in 1989.

Gibson continued to record and release music throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 2006, she reached number 24 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart with &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, a duet with Jordan Knight, and in 2017 achieved her highest-charting hit in more than 25 years in her duet with Sir Ivan, &quot;I Am Peaceman&quot;. Gibson&#x27;s 2020 single &quot;Girls Night Out&quot; became her first top five and highest-charting hit after 30 years. In addition to music, she then has had starring roles on Broadway and touring musicals including playing Eponine in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and Sandy in &quot;Grease&quot; as well as television and independent film work.

==Early life==
Gibson was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 31, 1970, the third of Diane (née Pustizzi) and Joseph Gibson&#x27;s four daughters. Her father, who enjoyed singing, was originally named Joseph Schultz and was abandoned by his mother as a boy; his biological mother married a man with the surname Gibson before putting Joseph in an orphanage. Debbie Gibson grew up in suburban Merrick, New York, on Long Island. She describes herself as being of &quot;Italian/Sicilian and part German and possibly some Russian&quot; descent. She studied piano under American pianist Morton Estrin. She is a graduate of Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick.

==Music career==

In 1983, Gibson submitted a cassette recording of her original composition &quot;I Come From America&quot; to WOR for the station&#x27;s song contest. After she won a cash prize of 1,000 from the contest, her mother convinced a relative to loan her 10,000 to convert the family garage into a recording studio.

===1986–1989===

After Gibson had written and produced her own material for years, a demonstration tape of hers submitted to a radio personality was eventually shared with an executive at Atlantic Records. Solely on the basis of Gibson&#x27;s original song &quot;Only in My Dreams&quot;, she was signed to a development deal and began a promotional tour of club venues throughout the United States.

For much of 1986 and the beginning of 1987 Gibson built a songwriting catalog, while continuing to play club dates. During her promotional tour, she continued attending classes at Calhoun High School and later graduated as an honor student. Diane Gibson, Debbie&#x27;s mother and manager, accompanied her daughter on many of these track dates. Diane said, &quot;We played dance clubs, straight clubs, and gay clubs.&quot;

The single &quot;Only in My Dreams&quot; was released in December 1986 and landed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart beginning in May 1987, peaking at number four that September. Atlantic Records and Debbie Gibson worked to complete her first album as a result of the good showing by the single. After the success of &quot;Only in My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Love&quot; was released as the follow-up single and reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; top five. The &quot;Shake Your Love&quot; video was choreographed by Paula Abdul and was the first time MTV had visited Gibson on a video shoot.

In 1987, while performing at nightclubs throughout the United States, Gibson recorded her debut album, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. Along with producer Fred Zarr, Gibson wrote, recorded, and produced it in four weeks. Four singles from the album reached the top five of the Hot 100 chart: &quot;Only in My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Love&quot;, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, and the number-one hit &quot;Foolish Beat&quot;, followed by &quot;Staying Together&quot;, which performed more modestly, reaching number 22. &quot;Foolish Beat&quot; set a record, making Gibson at 16 the youngest artist to write, produce, and perform a &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one single, as cited in the 1988 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. She remains the youngest female artist to have done so. &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; became a hit album, and she had success in the UK and Southeast Asia, filling stadiums with her Out of the Blue Tour. By the end of 1988, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; had gone triple platinum.

The music video compilation &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA; the concert tour video was certified double platinum. In October 1988, Gibson sang the national anthem for Game 1 of the Major League Baseball World Series. &quot;Electric Youth&quot; was released in early 1989 and spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard 200. The first single released, &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot;, was number one on the Hot 100 for three weeks, garnering her another achievement as the youngest female to have both an album and single simultaneously at number one. She shared the 1989 ASCAP Songwriter of the Year Award with Bruce Springsteen. Subsequent singles from the album were &quot;Electric Youth&quot; (number 11), &quot;No More Rhyme&quot; (number 17), and &quot;We Could Be Together&quot; (number 71). The &quot;Electric Youth&quot; album was certified double platinum by the RIAA. The successful Electric Youth Tour and &quot;Live Around the World&quot; VHS (double platinum) followed.

===1990–2001===
Gibson recorded two more albums for Atlantic Records: &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; (1990) and &quot;Body, Mind, Soul&quot; (1993). The former&#x27;s title song, co-written with Motown mainstay Lamont Dozier, peaked at number 26 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in 1991. Subsequent singles from &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; failed to chart on the Hot 100, although &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; scored on the Hot Maxi Singles and Hot Dance charts, peaking at numbers 21 and 18, respectively. During that time, she was part of the supergroup that recorded the charity single &quot;Voices That Care&quot;, which peaked at number 11 on the Hot 100 chart. In 1992, she contributed a version of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; to the charity album &quot;A Very Special Christmas 2&quot; which hit #7 on the Billboard album chart and was certified Double Platinum for shipment of two million copies.

In 1995, she signed with EMI&#x27;s SBK Records division and recorded her only album for the label, &quot;Think with Your Heart.&quot; It was an adult contemporary-heavy album consisting of piano and keyboard ballads recorded predominantly with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The album&#x27;s producer, Niko Bolas, who was usually Neil Young&#x27;s co-producer, was producing the reunion album for veteran punk band Circle Jerks and invited Gibson to a recording session for that band&#x27;s album &quot;Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities&quot;. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I Wanna Destroy You&quot;, as well as appearing at and participating in the Circle Jerks&#x27; performance at the punk venue CBGB wearing one of the band&#x27;s T-shirts and sharing a microphone with frontman Keith Morris. In 1998, she sang the song, &quot;I Do&quot;, which is featured on the soundtrack to the film, &quot;The Naked Man&quot;. The lyrics to the song were composed by the co-writer of the film, Ethan Coen. The soundtrack has never been released.

After parting company with EMI, Gibson formed her own record label, Espiritu, to release her original material. Her sixth album, &quot;Deborah&quot; (1997), marked her full return to pop. &quot;Deborah&quot; includes the lead single &quot;Only Words&quot;. &quot;Only Words&quot; (Dance Edit) became a Top-40 Hot Dance Music/Club Play hit. The album&#x27;s other single was the ballad &quot;Naturally&quot;. It only sold 20,000 in the US.

In 2001, she released her seventh album on her new record label, Golden Egg, titled &quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot; It featured three singles: the sensual pop song &quot;What You Want&quot;, the Latin-infused dance-pop song &quot;Your Secret&quot;, and the bass-heavy &quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot; Highlights from the album include the sultry Latin-flavored smooth jazz song &quot;In Blue&quot;, a vintage-style ballad &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Jaded&quot;, and a remix of &quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot; with the background vocals of her two nieces.

===2005–2009===
In 2005, Gibson co-wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Someone You Love&quot; with The O&#x27;Neill Brothers. With the brothers, she released an updated, acoustic version of her number-one hit &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot;. An Emmy-nominated PBS special &quot;The O&#x27;Neill Brothers: Piano for Someone You Love&quot; aired in 2005.

The March 2005 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; featured a nude pictorial of Gibson, coinciding with the release of her single, &quot;Naked&quot;. She has said that the magazine had asked her five times to pose for them since she turned 18. She agreed to pose to revamp her image, describing how one casting call called her agent, not realizing that Gibson had long since outgrown her teenager image. The single peaked at No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Single Sales chart in March 2005. In 2006, Gibson went on tour with the O&#x27;Neill Brothers for the Someone You Love Tour in 2006. &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot; was revamped with an acoustic sound and a song &quot;Someone You Love&quot; was written and performed by Gibson and the O&#x27;Neill Brothers. These two songs also appeared on the O&#x27;Neill Brothers album &quot;Someone You Love&quot;.

She had a resurgence of popularity in niche markets. Her single &quot;Your Secret&quot; came back from its dormant state and became popular on some radio stations, including Super 91.7 WMPH in Wilmington, Delaware. &quot;Your Secret&quot; was on their request show, &quot;Total Control Radio&quot;, for 12 months; it reached No. 1 on its third week on that station&#x27;s chart in May 2006. It charted along with a few of her other singles, &quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot; and &quot;Only Words&quot; (Dance Edit), the Eurodance mix. They all have become recurrent hits on WMPH. The 2006 single, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, featuring dance-pop artist Jordan Knight, made an impression in the Soft AC and Hot AC radio formats, becoming the third-most added single during the summer of 2006. It debuted at number 35 on the Hot Contemporary chart, peaking at number 24 in early September. The same year, Gibson appeared in the independent film &quot;Coffee Date&quot; with Wilson Cruz and Jonathan Silverman and provided a soundtrack song called &quot;Sounds Like Love&quot;.

On November 14, 2006, Gibson released the song &quot;Famous&quot; on her official website. The song was written by Gibson and Tiziano Lugli and was produced by Lugli. 
In September 2007, Gibson considered creating a camp on the West Coast. She is the founder and creator of Camp Electric Youth, a children&#x27;s summer day camp, which ran from July 7–18, 2008. It claims to be the first camp of its kind in the Los Angeles area. The camp was reportedly attended by &quot;over 120 talented singers, actors, and dancers&quot; from around the world.

Gibson was a judge for the online talent competition, &quot;Total Pop Star&quot;, along with Andrew Van Slee (producer and judge) and Joey Lawrence (from &quot;Blossom&quot;). The first season ran from November 12, 2007 – May 30, 2008, though it was later extended to June. The show ended abruptly during its second season. In May 2008, Gibson performed her 1980s hits, along with her Broadway role songs, during a three-run week at Harrah&#x27;s in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

She later appeared on the April 2008 cover of &quot;Lavender Magazine&quot; (an LGBT magazine in Minnesota) and was interviewed about her career and upcoming projects. Then on the 24th, Gibson hosted and performed on Spotlightlive &#x27;80s Karaoke Experience in New York singing songs such as &quot;Only in My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, &quot;Love Shack&quot; (an original hit for the B-52&#x27;s) and &quot;9 to 5&quot;. She performed with Samantha Fox, Tiffany, and Rick Astley at the Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City, Canada, on April 10, 2009.

On March 9, 2009, Gibson released a new song called &quot;Already Gone&quot; on her official website and ReverbNation, written by Gibson and produced by Fred Coury. It was accompanied by a music video, released on March 13, 2009, produced by Guy Birtwhistle and directed by John Knowles, which starred Birtwhistle, Gibson, and Steve Valentine.

===2010–present===
In January 2010, an unofficial clip named &quot;Cougar&quot; was uploaded on YouTube. She also became a spokesperson for Murad&#x27;s Resurgence Skin Care and plays piano and sings a line of the song called &quot;Cougar&quot;. Gibson&#x27;s song &quot;Rise&quot;, from the documentary &quot;3 Billion and Counting&quot;, was included on the shortlist for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2010. In the summer of 2011, she released &quot;Rise&quot; on iTunes, and also performed it on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in New York. Gibson performed as Mother Nature in Cirque Dreams&#x27; &quot;Jungle Fantasy&quot; at Foxwoods Resort Casino from July 27 to September 1, 2010.

In 2010, the album &quot;Ms. Vocalist&quot;, released via Sony Japan, reached the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard Japan&quot; chart. Gibson covered J-pop tunes for the album that were originally sung by Japanese artists such as Chage and Aska (&quot;Say Yes&quot;), Yutaka Ozaki (&quot;I love you&quot;), Miho Nakayama and WANDS (Sekaijū no Dare Yori Kitto) among others, plus a Japanese/English version of her number-one hit &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot; and a duet with Eric Martin. The first single from the album, &quot;I Love You&quot;, hit No. 1 on the international cable radio chart on November 3, 2010.

In January 2011, Gibson wrote, performed, and produced the song &quot;Snake Charmer&quot; for the film &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot;. During the summer of 2011, Gibson toured with fellow 1980s pop princess Tiffany. In June 2011, Gibson appeared in Katy Perry&#x27;s music video &quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot; alongside several other guest stars. On August 27, 2016, Gibson starred in an original Hallmark Channel film, &quot;Summer of Dreams&quot;, about a former pop star, trying to make a comeback, who finds herself better suited as a school&#x27;s choir director. She also recorded a song titled &quot;Wonderland&quot; for the film.

In June 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; Gibson achieved her highest-charting hit in more than 25 years in her duet with Sir Ivan on &quot;I Am Peaceman&quot;, which hit number 26 on the &quot;Billboard &quot;Dance Club chart. In June 2018, Gibson appeared in the music video of American heavy-metal band Voices of Extreme&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Foolish Beat&quot;. In March 2019, Gibson hosted a special program on SiriusXM Radio&#x27;s &#x27;80s on 8 channel to celebrate the 30th anniversary of her &quot;Electric Youth&quot; album, during which she played each song from the album in sequence, accompanied by personal stories surrounding each song.

On May 2, the Mixtape Tour commenced in Cincinnati, Ohio. Performers on this tour included Gibson, Tiffany, Salt-N-Pepa, and Naughty by Nature, with New Kids on the Block billed as the headline performers. The tour grossed $53.2 million and sold 662,911 tickets over 55 dates. On June 7, 2019, Gibson released a new pop anthem &quot;Girls Night Out&quot;. The music video for &quot;Girls Night Out&quot; was shot in Las Vegas, Nevada. The song peaked at number four on the&quot; Billboard&quot; Dance Club chart. On August 20, 2021, Gibson released the album &quot;The Body Remembers&quot;, her first studio recording of original songs since &quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot;. It contained a new version of &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot; with Joey McIntyre.

Gibson performed at the 2025 Rose Parade singing &quot;Electric Youth&quot; as part of the Grand Finale presented by the Mansion Entertainment Group with Betty Who and the Debbie Allen Dance Academy dancers.

==Theater==
Gibson debuted on Broadway in 1992, playing Éponine Thénardier in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. She then went to London and starred as Sandy Dombroski in &quot;Grease&quot;—a role for which 800 other people tried out before producers chose Gibson—in a West End production. The show broke box office sales records. The single version of &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;, a duet with Craig McLachlan, taken from the original cast recording, reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1993.

After returning to the United States, she appeared in the Broadway touring production, this time playing Rizzo. She played Fanny Brice in a revamped &quot;Funny Girl&quot; tour. She has had many successful theatre credits; she was among the many actresses who took the starring role of Belle in the Broadway production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. She replaced Kerry Butler in September 1997 and was in the show until June 1998, when Kim Huber then succeeded her. She also starred in the critically lauded production of &quot;&quot; (in a production staged at the Paper Mill Playhouse). Gibson starred as Louise Hovick opposite Broadway legend Betty Buckley. She participated in the national tour of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, where she played the Narrator, and starred as Cinderella in the national tour of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s musical with Eartha Kitt as the Fairy Godmother. In October 2002, she starred as Velma Kelly in the Boston production of &quot;Chicago&quot;. In 2003, she played Sally Bowles in the Broadway revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot;. From March to April 2004, she played the role of Marta in the UCLA Reprise! production of &quot;Company&quot;.

Gibson starred as Anna Leonowens in Cabrillo Music Theatre&#x27;s production of the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical &quot;The King and I&quot;, which began October 17, 2008, in the Kavli Theatre at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza and ran through October 26.

==Film and television==
Gibson co-hosted Nickelodeon&#x27;s first Kids&#x27; Choice Awards in 1988, alongside Tony Danza, Brian Robbins, and Dan Schneider. She co-starred with actor Lorenzo Lamas in the low-budget action/adventure film &quot;Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus&quot;, produced by The Asylum and released on May 19, 2009. The film drew in two million viewers on Syfy in 2009. Its trailer became a viral hit, scoring over one million hits on MTV.com and YouTube. The film premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Gibson&#x27;s former music rival Tiffany had her film &quot;Necrosis&quot; (or &quot;Blood Snow&quot;) premiere at Cannes that year as well. Gibson and Tiffany starred in a Syfy original movie entitled &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot;, aired on January 29, 2011. The pairing was suggested by Tiffany, who wanted to play off their supposed rivalry. Gibson reprised her role as Emma McNeil in the 2014 film &quot;Mega Shark Versus Mecha Shark&quot;.

She starred in the Up TV movie &quot;The Music in Me&quot; alongside Gloria Reuben in 2015. The film also featured an original song called &quot;Promises&quot;, written and performed by Gibson. In mid-2003, Gibson was a judge on the &quot;American Idol&quot; spin-off &quot;American Juniors&quot;, which lasted one season. In January 2006, she joined the cast of &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot; on Fox Television, partnered with Canadian former world-champion figure skater Kurt Browning. She was voted out in the third episode. She competed on the fifth season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, which began airing on February 19, 2012. On the fourth task, she won $50,000 for her charity, Children International. Gibson was fired on April 1, 2012, in the seventh task because she had brought in the least amount of money between her teammates in the boardroom, Dayana Mendoza and Teresa Giudice. While both Mendoza and Giudice were arguably weaker candidates going forward, given that Mendoza was cited as the women&#x27;s weakest link and Giudice had failed the task as project manager, Gibson was fired, instead.

In 2017, Gibson was one of the celebrities competing on the 25th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was paired with first-time pro-dancer, Alan Bersten. On September 26, 2017, Gibson and Bersten were the second couple eliminated coming in 12th place. In September 2018, Gibson starred in the Hallmark Channel film &quot;Wedding of Dreams,&quot; a sequel to 2016&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Dreams.&quot; In 2019 and 2020, Gibson was a judge on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Most Musical Family&quot;.

Gibson made a guest appearance on season 5 episode 10 of the Netflix series &quot;Lucifer&quot;, which premiered on May 28, 2021. In the episode titled &quot;Bloody Celestial Karaoke Jam&quot;, she plays a mother who sings &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; with Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis) in an interrogation room. In 2023, she competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Night Owl&quot;. She was eliminated on &quot;ABBA Night&quot; alongside Howie Mandel as &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;.

==Image and influence==
In tandem with her second album &quot;Electric Youth&quot; (1989), she created a perfume called Electric Youth that was distributed by Revlon, as well as other makeup essentials for young girls that were distributed nationwide through Natural Wonder Cosmetics. The 1989 song &quot;Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child&quot; by Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper was released as a single; MTV refused to air the accompanying video, which starred Winona Ryder as Gibson. The song peaked at No. 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Gibson&#x27;s fashion trademark was her hats, usually a black pork-pie style. She also made popular wearing tight, rolled-up jeans, vests over a T-shirt, friendship bracelets and two Swatch watches as on the back cover of her album &quot;Electric Youth&quot; and in her music video &quot;Staying Together&quot;. Her influences were Madonna and Olivia Newton-John, though she has often stated she admires Elton John and Billy Joel as favorite artists and was asked to sing and perform live with both at the former&#x27;s Madison Square Garden concert, which she did. Gibson appeared on the covers of numerous teen magazines such as &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gibson had a history of panic attacks beginning when she was 16.

Over the years, Gibson has been the target of stalkers. Robert Bardo, who was convicted of murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer in 1989, had a wall in his house adorned with pictures of Gibson and Tiffany Darwish. In May 1998, Michael Falkner, a disgruntled fan from Eau Claire, Wisconsin was arrested outside Manhattan&#x27;s Palace Theatre, where Gibson was performing in the live-musical adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. That was after Gibson received threatening letters, emails, and faxes from Falkner who used the alias &#x27;Starcade&#x27;. In 2008, Gibson filed for a restraining order against Spanish taxi driver Jorge Puigdollers, who had stalked her since 2002. However, a temporary restraining order was not issued and a court date was set to determine if a restraining order was appropriate. The proceeding was dismissed when Gibson failed to show up for the hearing.

Gibson was in an engagement to music executive Jonathan Kanterman, called off in 2003, and was in a relationship with Rutledge Taylor from 2008 to 2019. Gibson has never married and has no children, a choice she admitted to considering before being diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2013. The infectious disease made her lose substantial weight. In 2014, in response to fans&#x27; concern about her weight loss, Gibson said that she had developed symptoms of Lyme disease in early 2013. In 2016, she appeared on &quot;&quot;, where she spoke out about her drug use in the past, after the death of singer Prince:

I really feel like I haven&#x27;t fully articulated it till now and really spoke candidly till now... When I heard the news about Prince and the fact that it might have been prescription drug-related, I really had a moment of, like, &#x27;That&#x27;s awful and that&#x27;s sad–and I can relate.&#x27; ...unfortunately, 90% of the entertainment community can relate. I remember being on the road at, like, 25, touring with theater and doing my own cocktail of Tylenol PM and Xanax. It&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, I found a way to make the Xanax last longer with the Tylenol PM... it&#x27;s as simple as that, and that is how performers get in so much trouble.&quot;

<text>Sodium bicarbonate (IUPAC name: sodium hydrogencarbonate), commonly known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda, is a chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is a salt composed of a sodium cation (Na+) and a bicarbonate anion (HCO3−). Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite, although it is more commonly found as a component of the mineral trona.

As it has long been known and widely used, the salt has many different names such as baking soda, bread soda, cooking soda, brewing soda and bicarbonate of soda and can often be found near baking powder in stores. The term &quot;baking soda&quot; is more common in the United States, while &quot;bicarbonate of soda&quot; is more common in Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Abbreviated colloquial forms such as &quot;sodium bicarb&quot;,&quot; bicarb soda&quot;, &quot;bicarbonate&quot;, and &quot;bicarb&quot; are common.

The prefix &quot;bi-&quot; in &quot;bicarbonate&quot; comes from an outdated naming system predating molecular knowledge. It is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate (CO32-) per sodium in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as there is in sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The modern chemical formulas of these compounds now express their precise chemical compositions which were unknown when the name &quot;bi-carbonate of potash&quot; was coined (see also: bicarbonate).

==Uses==

===Cooking===
In cooking, baking soda is primarily used in baking as a leavening agent. When it reacts with acid or is heated, carbon dioxide is released, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in cakes, quick breads, soda bread, and other baked and fried foods. When an acid is used, the acid–base reaction can be generically represented as follows:

:NaHCO3 + H+ → Na+ + CO2 + H2O

Acidic materials that induce this reaction include hydrogen phosphates, cream of tartar, lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa, and vinegar. Baking soda may be used together with sourdough, which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acidic taste. Since the reaction occurs slowly at room temperature, mixtures (cake batter, etc.) can be allowed to stand without rising until they are heated in the oven.

Heat can also by itself cause sodium bicarbonate to act as a raising agent in baking because of thermal decomposition, releasing carbon dioxide at temperatures above , as follows:

: 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2

When used this way on its own, without the presence of an acidic component (whether in the batter or by the use of a baking powder containing acid), only half the available CO2 is released (one CO2 molecule is formed for every two equivalents of NaHCO3). Additionally, in the absence of acid, thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate also produces sodium carbonate, which is strongly alkaline and gives the baked product a bitter, soapy taste and a yellow color.

==== Baking powder ====

Baking powder, also sold for cooking, contains around 30% of bicarbonate, and various acidic ingredients that are activated by the addition of water, without the need for additional acids in the cooking medium. Many forms of baking powder contain sodium bicarbonate combined with calcium acid phosphate, sodium aluminium phosphate, or cream of tartar. Baking soda is alkaline; the acid used in baking powder avoids a metallic taste when the chemical change during baking creates sodium carbonate.

===Food additive===
It is often used in conjunction with other bottled water food additives to add taste. Its European Union E number is E500.

===Pyrotechnics===
Sodium bicarbonate is one of the main components of the common &quot;black snake&quot; firework. The effect is caused by the thermal decomposition, which produces carbon dioxide gas to produce a long snake-like ash as a combustion product of the other main component, sucrose. Sodium bicarbonate also delays combustion reactions through the release of carbon dioxide and water, both of which are flame retardants, when heated.

===Mild disinfectant===
It has weak disinfectant properties and it may be an effective fungicide against some organisms. As baking soda will absorb musty smells, it has become a reliable method for used booksellers when making books less malodorous.

===Fire extinguisher===
Sodium bicarbonate can be used to extinguish small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers as an alternative to the more corrosive monoammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens.

Sodium bicarbonate has several fire-extinguishing mechanisms that act simultaneously. It decomposes into water and carbon dioxide when heated, an endothermic reaction that deprives the fire of heat. In addition, it forms intermediates that can scavenge the free radicals which are responsible for the propagation of fire. With grease fires specifically, it also has a mild saponification effect, producing a soapy foam that can help smother the fire.

===Neutralization of acids ===
Sodium bicarbonate reacts spontaneously with acids, releasing CO2 gas as a reaction product. It is commonly used to neutralize unwanted acid solutions or acid spills in chemical laboratories. It is not appropriate to use sodium bicarbonate to neutralize base even though it is amphoteric, reacting with both acids and bases.

===Sports supplement===
Sodium bicarbonate is taken as a sports supplement to improve muscular endurance. Studies conducted mostly in males have shown that sodium bicarbonate is most effective in enhancing performance in short-term, high-intensity activities.

===Agriculture===
Sodium bicarbonate can prevent the growth of fungi when applied on leaves, although it will not kill the fungus. Excessive amounts of sodium bicarbonate can cause discolouration of fruits (two percent solution) and chlorosis (one percent solution). Sodium bicarbonate is also commonly used as a free choice dietary supplement in sheep to help prevent bloat.

===Medical uses and health===

Sodium bicarbonate mixed with water can be used as an antacid to treat acid indigestion and heartburn. Its reaction with stomach acid produces salt, water, and carbon dioxide:
:NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + H2O + CO2(g)

A mixture of sodium bicarbonate and polyethylene glycol such as PegLyte, dissolved in water and taken orally, is an effective gastrointestinal lavage preparation and laxative prior to gastrointestinal surgery, gastroscopy, etc.

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate in an aqueous solution is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions are in the blood. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left, and thus raises the pH. For this reason, sodium bicarbonate is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is markedly low (&lt; 7.1–7.0).

HCO3− is used for treatment of hyperkalemia, as it will drive K+ back into cells during periods of acidosis. Since sodium bicarbonate can cause alkalosis, it is sometimes used to treat aspirin overdoses. Aspirin requires an acidic environment for proper absorption, and a basic environment will diminish aspirin absorption in cases of overdose. Sodium bicarbonate has also been used in the treatment of tricyclic antidepressant overdose. It can also be applied topically as a paste, with three parts baking soda to one part water, to relieve some kinds of insect bites and stings (as well as accompanying swelling).

Some alternative practitioners, such as Tullio Simoncini, have promoted baking soda as a cancer cure, which the American Cancer Society has warned against due to both its unproven effectiveness and potential danger in use. Edzard Ernst has called the promotion of sodium bicarbonate as a cancer cure &quot;one of the more sickening alternative cancer scams I have seen for a long time&quot;.

Sodium bicarbonate can be added to local anaesthetics, to speed up the onset of their effects and make their injection less painful. It is also a component of Moffett&#x27;s solution, used in nasal surgery.

It has been proposed that acidic diets weaken bones. One systematic meta-analysis of the research shows no such effect. Another also finds that there is no evidence that alkaline diets improve bone health, but suggests that there &quot;may be some value&quot; to alkaline diets for other reasons.

Antacid (such as baking soda) solutions have been prepared and used by protesters to alleviate the effects of exposure to tear gas during protests.

Similarly to its use in baking, sodium bicarbonate is used together with a mild acid such as tartaric acid as the excipient in effervescent tablets: when such a tablet is dropped in a glass of water, the carbonate leaves the reaction medium as carbon dioxide gas (HCO3− + H+ → H2O + CO2↑ or, more precisely, HCO3− + H3O+ → 2 H2O + CO2↑). This makes the tablet disintegrate, leaving the medication suspended and/or dissolved in the water together with the resulting salt (in this example, sodium tartrate).

====Personal hygiene====
Sodium bicarbonate is also used as an ingredient in some mouthwashes. It has anticaries and abrasive properties. It works as a mechanical cleanser on the teeth and gums, neutralizes the production of acid in the mouth, and also acts as an antiseptic to help prevent infections. Sodium bicarbonate in combination with other ingredients can be used to make a dry or wet deodorant. Sodium bicarbonate may be used as a buffering agent, combined with table salt, when creating a solution for nasal irrigation.

It is used in eye hygiene to treat blepharitis. This is done by adding a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate to cool water that was recently boiled followed by gentle scrubbing of the eyelash base with a cotton swab dipped in the solution.

====Veterinary uses====
Sodium bicarbonate is used as a cattle feed supplement, in particular as a buffering agent for the rumen.

===Cleaning agent===
Sodium bicarbonate is used in a process to remove paint and corrosion called sodablasting. As a blasting medium, sodium bicarbonate is used to remove surface contamination from softer and less resilient substrates such as aluminium, copper, or timber that could be damaged by silica sand abrasive media.

A manufacturer recommends a paste made from baking soda with minimal water as a gentle scouring powder. Such a paste can be useful in removing surface rust because the rust forms a water-soluble compound when in a concentrated alkaline solution. Cold water should be used since hot-water solutions can corrode steel. Sodium bicarbonate attacks the thin protective oxide layer that forms on aluminium, making it unsuitable for cleaning this metal. A solution in warm water will remove the tarnish from silver when the silver is in contact with a piece of aluminium foil. Baking soda is commonly added to washing machines as a replacement for water softener and to remove odors from clothes. When diluted with warm water, it is also almost as effective in removing heavy tea and coffee stains from cups as sodium hydroxide.

During the Manhattan Project to develop the nuclear bomb in the early 1940s, the chemical toxicity of uranium was an issue. Uranium oxides were found to stick very well to cotton cloth and did not wash out with soap or laundry detergent. However, the uranium would wash out with a 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate. Clothing can become contaminated with toxic dust of depleted uranium (DU), which is very dense, hence it is used for counterweights in a civilian context and in armour-piercing projectiles. DU is not removed by normal laundering; washing with about of baking soda in 2 gallons (7.5 L) of water will help wash it out.

===Odor control===

It is often claimed that baking soda is an effective odor remover and recommended that an open box be kept in the refrigerator to absorb odor. This idea was promoted by the leading U.S. brand of baking soda, Arm &amp; Hammer, in an advertising campaign starting in 1972. Though this campaign is considered a classic of marketing, leading within a year to more than half of American refrigerators containing a box of baking soda, there is little evidence that it is effective in this application.

=== Education ===
An educational science experiment known as the &quot;Baking Soda and Vinegar Volcano&quot; uses the acid-base reaction with vinegar acid to mimic a volcanic eruption. The rapid production of CO2 causes the liquid to foam up and overflow its container. Other ingredients such as dish soap and food coloring can be added to enhance the visual effect. If this reaction is performed inside of a closed vessel (such as a bottle) with no way for gas to escape, it can cause an explosion if the pressure is high enough.

==Chemistry==

Sodium bicarbonate is an amphoteric compound. Aqueous solutions are mildly alkaline due to the formation of carbonic acid and hydroxide ion:

:HCO + H2O → + OH−

Sodium bicarbonate can sometimes be used as a mild neutralization agent and a safer alternative to strong bases like sodium hydroxide. Reaction of sodium bicarbonate and an acid produces a salt and carbonic acid, which readily decomposes to carbon dioxide and water:

:NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + H2O+CO2
:H2CO3 → H2O + CO2(g)

Sodium bicarbonate reacts with acetic acid (found in vinegar), producing sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide:

:NaHCO3 + CH3COOH → CH3COONa + H2O + CO2(g)

Sodium bicarbonate reacts with bases such as sodium hydroxide to form carbonates:

:NaHCO3 + NaOH → Na2CO3 + H2O

===Thermal decomposition===
At temperatures from , sodium bicarbonate gradually decomposes into sodium carbonate, water, and carbon dioxide. The conversion is faster at :

: 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2

Most bicarbonates undergo this dehydration reaction. Further heating converts the carbonate into the oxide (above ):

: Na2CO3 → Na2O + CO2

The generation of carbon dioxide and water partially explain the fire-extinguishing properties of NaHCO3, although other factors like heat absorption and radical scavenging are more significant.

== Natural occurrence ==
In nature, sodium bicarbonate occurs almost exclusively as either nahcolite or trona. Trona is more common, as nahcolite is more soluble in water and the chemical equilibrium between the two minerals favors trona. Significant nahcolite deposits are in the United States, Botswana and Kenya, Uganda, Turkey, and Mexico. The biggest trona deposits are in the Green River basin in Wyoming.

Nahcolite is sometimes found as a component of oil shale.

==Stability and shelf life==
If kept cool (room temperature) and dry (an airtight container is recommended to keep out moist air), sodium bicarbonate can be kept without a significant amount of decomposition for at least two or three years.

==History==
The word &quot;natron&quot; has been in use in many languages throughout modern times (in the forms of &quot;anatron&quot;, &quot;natrum&quot; and &quot;natron&quot;) and originated (like Spanish, French and English &quot;natron&quot; as well as &#x27;sodium&#x27;) via Arabic &quot;naṭrūn&quot; (or &quot;anatrūn&quot;; cf. the Lower Egyptian “Natrontal” Wadi El Natrun, where a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate for the dehydration of mummies was used ) from Greek &quot;nítron (νίτρον)&quot; (Herodotus; Attic &quot;lítron (λίτρον)&quot;), which can be traced back to ancient Egyptian &quot;ntr&quot;. The Greek &quot;nítron&quot; (soda, saltpeter) was also used in Latin &quot;(sal) nitrum&quot; and in German &quot;Salniter&quot; (the source of &quot;Nitrogen&quot;, &quot;Nitrat&quot; etc.). The word &quot;saleratus&quot;, from Latin &quot;sal æratus&quot; (meaning &quot;aerated salt&quot;), was widely used in the 19th century for both sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate.

In 1791, French chemist Nicolas Leblanc produced sodium carbonate (also known as soda ash). Pharmacist Valentin Rose the Younger is credited with the discovery of sodium bicarbonate in 1801 in Berlin. In 1846, two American bakers, John Dwight and Austin Church, established the first factory in the United States to produce baking soda from sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide.

&quot;Saleratus&quot;, potassium or sodium bicarbonate, is mentioned in the novel &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; by Rudyard Kipling as being used extensively in the 1800s in commercial fishing to prevent freshly caught fish from spoiling.

In 1919, US Senator Lee Overman declared that bicarbonate of soda could cure the Spanish flu. In the midst of the debate on 26 January 1919, he interrupted the discussion to announce the discovery of a cure. &quot;I want to say, for the benefit of those who are making this investigation,&quot; he reported, &quot;that I was told by a judge of a superior court in the mountain country of North Carolina they have discovered a remedy for this disease.&quot; The purported cure implied a critique of modern science and an appreciation for the simple wisdom of simple people. &quot;They say that common baking soda will cure the disease,&quot; he continued, &quot;that they have cured it with it, that they have no deaths up there at all; they use common baking soda, which cures the disease.&quot;

==Production==
Sodium bicarbonate is produced industrially from sodium carbonate:
:Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 NaHCO3
It is produced on the scale of about 100,000 tonnes/year (as of 2001) with a worldwide production capacity of 2.4 million tonnes per year (as of 2002). Commercial quantities of baking soda are also produced by a similar method: soda ash, mined in the form of the ore trona, is dissolved in water and treated with carbon dioxide. Sodium bicarbonate precipitates as a solid from this solution.

Regarding the Solvay process, sodium bicarbonate is an intermediate in the reaction of sodium chloride, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. The product however shows low purity (75pc).

: NaCl + CO2 + NH3 + H2O → NaHCO3 + NH4Cl

Although of no practical value, NaHCO3 may be obtained by the reaction of carbon dioxide with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide:
:CO2 + NaOH → NaHCO3

===Mining===
Naturally occurring deposits of nahcolite (NaHCO3) are found in the Eocene-age (55.8–33.9 Mya) Green River Formation, Piceance Basin in Colorado. Nahcolite was deposited as beds during periods of high evaporation in the basin. It is commercially mined using common underground mining techniques such as bore, drum, and longwall mining in a fashion very similar to coal mining.

It is also produced by solution mining, pumping heated water through nahcolite beds and crystallizing the dissolved nahcolite through a cooling crystallization process.

Since nahcolite is sometimes found in shale, it can be produced as a co-product of shale oil extraction, where it is recovered by solution mining.

==In popular culture==

Sodium bicarbonate, as &quot;bicarbonate of soda&quot;, was a frequent source of punch lines for Groucho Marx in Marx Brothers movies. In &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, Marx plays the leader of a nation at war. In one scene, he receives a message from the battlefield that his general is reporting a gas attack, and Groucho tells his aide: &quot;Tell him to take a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda and a half a glass of water.&quot; In &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Groucho&#x27;s character addresses the opening night crowd at an opera by saying of the lead tenor: &quot;Signor Lassparri comes from a very famous family. His mother was a well-known bass singer. His father was the first man to stuff spaghetti with bicarbonate of soda, thus causing and curing indigestion at the same time.&quot;

In the Joseph L. Mankewicz classic &quot;All About Eve&quot;, the Max Fabian character (Gregory Ratoff) has an extended scene with Margo Channing (Bette Davis) in which, suffering from heartburn, he requests and then drinks bicarbonate of soda, eliciting a prominent burp. Channing promises to always keep a box of bicarb with Max&#x27;s name on it.
