<text>Northern California (commonly shortened to NorCal) is a geographic and cultural region that comprises the northern portion of the U.S. state of California, spanning the northernmost 48 of the state&#x27;s 58 counties. Northern California in its largest definition is determined by dividing the state into two regions, the other being Southern California. The main northern population centers include the San Francisco Bay Area (anchored by the cities of San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland), the Greater Sacramento area (anchored by the state capital Sacramento), the Redding, California, area south of the Cascade Range, and the Metropolitan Fresno area (anchored by the city of Fresno). Northern California also contains redwood forests, along with most of the Sierra Nevada, including Yosemite Valley and part of Lake Tahoe, Mount Shasta (the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range after Mount Rainier in Washington), and most of the Central Valley, one of the world&#x27;s most productive agricultural regions. Northern California is also home to Silicon Valley, the global headquarters for some of the most powerful tech and Internet-related companies in the world, including Meta, Apple, Google, and Nvidia.

The Northern California Megaregion, one of the 11 megaregions of the United States is centered in Northern California, and extends from Metropolitan Fresno north to Greater Sacramento, and from the Bay Area east across the Nevada state line to encompass the entire Lake Tahoe–Reno area.

Evidence of Native American habitation in the area dates from at least 19,000 years ago and successive waves of arrivals led to one of the most densely populated areas of pre-Columbian North America. The arrival of European explorers from the early 16th to the mid-18th centuries did not establish European settlements in northern California. In 1770, the Spanish mission at Monterey was the first European settlement in the area, followed by other missions along the coast—eventually extending as far north as Sonoma County.

== Description ==
===North–south divisions of California===

California experienced a population boom during its gold rush (1848–1855), bringing more than 300,000 new residents, with very few of these settling in the southern part of the state. The northern two-thirds of the state was seen as the main part, and was often referred to as simply &quot;California&quot;, while the southern third was called &quot;Southern California&quot;. At that time, the state was profoundly divided by the Tehachapi Mountains which were a barrier to travelers before highways were built, and remain a bioregion barrier. This geographical barrier curves from Point Conception at the Pacific Ocean eastward through the Transverse Ranges including Mount Pinos and Tejon Pass, continuing through the Tehachapi Mountains including Tehachapi Pass, then cutting northward through the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range to Mount Patterson and the Nevada border. The Mojave Desert and the Great Basin Desert are separated from Northern California by mountain ranges in this definition of bioregions. Southern California in the 1850s was a backwater of mainly Spanish-speaking Californios who resented paying state taxes without receiving state projects.

In 1859, as proposed by the Californio politician Andrés Pico, the California State Legislature passed the Pico Act aiming to divide the state and create a new territory in the south. The border between the two parts was to be a straight line set at a latitude of six standard parallels south of Mount Diablo—meaning 144 miles south of Mount Diablo at the latitude of 35°45&#x27;N, currently the border between Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties. The new southern portion was to be called the Territory of Colorado because much of its eastern border was the Colorado River. This legislation was signed by Governor John B. Weller and sent to the United States Congress for ratification, but it never came to a vote. Congress was too divided with tensions which would soon break out into the American Civil War, and despite the efforts of Senator Milton Latham, the bill died. However, the proposed east-west line continued to define one of the views of north–south division of the state.

&quot;Northern California&quot; may refer to the state&#x27;s northernmost 48 counties, using the line established by the Pico Act, or it may refer to the portion north of the geographic barrier formed by the Transverse Ranges, the Tehachapi Mountains, and the Southern Sierras. Because of California&#x27;s large size and diverse geography, the state can be subdivided in other ways as well. For example, the Central Valley is a region that is distinct both culturally and topographically from coastal California, though in northern versus southern California divisions, the Sacramento Valley and most of the San Joaquin Valley are usually placed in northern California. Some observers describe three partitions of California, with north and south sections separated by Central California.

Technically, California&#x27;s exact north–south midway division is around 37°N, near the latitude of Morgan Hill and Chowchilla. The geographic center of California is at near North Fork, northeast of Fresno. 

The state is often considered as having an additional division north of the urban areas of the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento metropolitan areas. Extreme northern residents have felt under-represented in state government and, in 1941, attempted to form a new state with southwestern Oregon to be called Jefferson, or more recently to introduce legislation to split California into two or three states.

===Popular usage===
The coastal area north of the Bay Area is often referred to as the North Coast, touching the counties of Mendocino, Lake, Humboldt, and Del Norte. The interior region north of Sacramento metropolitan area is referred to by locals as the Northstate, consisting of about 20 counties.

&quot;Northern California&quot; was used by Tim Draper as the name of the northernmost state to be created by splitting California into three new states. The bill, Cal 3, was prevented from appearing on the 2018 California ballot because of a constitutional review by the Supreme Court of California.

== Significance ==
Since the events of the California Gold Rush, Northern California has been a leader on the world&#x27;s economic, scientific, and cultural stages. From the development of gold mining techniques and logging practices in the 19th century that were later adopted around the world, to the development of world-famous and online business models (such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Google, Yahoo!, and eBay), northern California has been at the forefront of new ways of doing business. In science, advances range from being the first to isolate and name fourteen transuranic chemical elements, to breakthroughs in microchip technology. Cultural contributions include the works of Ansel Adams, George Lucas, and Clint Eastwood, as well as beatniks, the Summer of Love, winemaking, the cradle of the international environmental movement, and the open, casual workplace first popularized in the Silicon Valley dot-com boom and now widely in use around the world. Other examples of innovation across diverse fields range from Genentech (development and commercialization of genetic engineering) to CrossFit as a pioneer in extreme human fitness and training.
It is also home to one of the largest Air Force Bases on the West Coast, and the largest in California by square meters, Travis Air Force Base.
== Cities ==
Northern California&#x27;s largest metropolitan area is the San Francisco Bay Area which consists of 9 counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties. The Bay Area consists of the major cities of San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, and their many suburbs. Although not a part of the Bay Area, in recent years the Bay Area has drawn more commuters from as far as Central Valley cities such as Sacramento, Stockton, Fresno, Turlock and Modesto. These cities in the central part of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills may be viewed as part of a single megalopolis. The 2010 U.S. Census showed that the Bay Area grew at a faster rate than the Greater Los Angeles Area while Greater Sacramento had the largest growth rate of any metropolitan area in California.

The state&#x27;s larger inland cities are considered part of Northern California in cases when the state is divided into two parts. Key cities in the region which are not in major metropolitan areas include Eureka on the far North Coast, Redding, at the northern end of the Central Valley, Chico, and Yuba City in the mid-north of the Central Valley, as well as Fresno and Visalia on the southern end. Though smaller in each case, with the notable exception of Fresno, than the larger cities of the general region, these smaller regional centers are often of historical and economic importance for their respective size, due to their locations, which are primarily rural or otherwise isolated.

== History ==
=== Prehistory to 1847 ===
Inhabited for millennia by Native Americans, from the Shasta tribe in the north, to the Miwoks in the central coast and Sierra Nevada, to the Yokuts of the southern Central Valley, northern California was among the most densely populated areas of pre-Columbian North America.

==== European explorers ====
The first European to explore the coast was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, sailing for the Spanish Crown; in 1542, Cabrillo&#x27;s expedition sailed perhaps as far north as the Rogue River in today&#x27;s Oregon. Beginning in 1565, the Spanish Manila galleons crossed the Pacific Ocean from Mexico to the Spanish Philippines, with silver and gemstones from Mexico. The Manila galleons returned across the northern Pacific, and reached North America usually off the coast of northern California, and then continued south with their Asian trade goods to Mexico.

In 1579, northern California was visited by the English explorer Sir Francis Drake who landed north of today&#x27;s San Francisco and claimed the area for England. In 1602, the Spaniard Sebastián Vizcaíno explored California&#x27;s coast as far north as Monterey Bay, where he went ashore. Other Spanish explorers sailed along the coast of northern California for the next 150 years, but no settlements were established.

==== Spanish era ====
The first European inhabitants were Spanish missionaries, who built missions along the California coast. The mission at Monterey was first established in 1770, and at San Francisco in 1776. In all, ten missions stretched along the coast from Sonoma to Monterey (and still more missions to the southern tip of Baja California). In 1786, the French signaled their interest in the northern California area by sending a voyage of exploration to Monterey.

The first twenty years of the 19th century continued the colonization of the northern California coast by Spain. By 1820, Spanish influence extended inland approximately 25 to from the missions. Outside of this zone, perhaps 200,000 to 250,000 Native Americans continued to lead traditional lives. The Adams-Onís Treaty, signed in 1819 between Spain and the young United States, set the northern boundary of the Spanish claims at the 42nd parallel, effectively creating today&#x27;s northern boundary of northern California.

==== Russian presence ====
In 1812, the Russian state-sponsored Russian-American Company established Fort Ross, a fur trading outpost on the coast of today&#x27;s Sonoma County. Fort Ross was the southernmost Russian settlement, located some north of Spanish colonies in San Francisco. In 1839, the settlement was abandoned due to its inability to meet resource demands, and the increasing Mexican and American presence in the region.

==== Mexican era ====
After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico continued Spain&#x27;s missions and settlements in northern California as well as Spain&#x27;s territorial claims. The Mexican &quot;Californios&quot; (Spanish-speaking Californians) in these settlements primarily traded cattle hides and tallow with American and European merchant vessels.
In 1825, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a major trading post just north of today&#x27;s Portland, Oregon. British fur trappers and hunters then used the Siskiyou Trail to travel throughout northern California. The leader of a further French scientific expedition to northern California, Eugene Duflot de Mofras, wrote in 1840 &quot;&quot;...it is evident that California will belong to whatever nation chooses to send there a man-of-war and two hundred men&quot;.&quot; By the 1830s, a significant number of non-&quot;Californios&quot; had immigrated to northern California. Chief among these was John Sutter, a European immigrant from Switzerland, who was granted centered on the area of today&#x27;s Sacramento.

==== American interest ====
American trappers began entering northern California in the 1830s. In 1834, American visionary Ewing Young led a herd of horses and mules over the Siskiyou Trail from missions in northern California to British and American settlements in Oregon. Although a small number of American traders and trappers had lived in northern California since the early 1830s, the first organized overland party of American immigrants to arrive in northern California was the Bartleson-Bidwell Party of 1841 via the new California Trail. Also in 1841, an overland exploratory party of the United States Exploring Expedition came down the Siskiyou Trail from the Pacific Northwest. In 1846, the Donner Party earned notoriety as they struggled to enter northern California.

==== Californian independence and beginning of the United States era ====
When the Mexican–American War was declared on May 13, 1846, it took almost two months (mid-July 1846) for word to get to California. On June 14, 1846, some 30 non-Mexican settlers, mostly Americans, staged a revolt and seized the small Mexican garrison in Sonoma. They raised the &quot;Bear Flag&quot; of the California Republic over Sonoma. The &quot;Bear Flag Republic&quot; lasted only 26 days, until the U.S. Army, led by John Frémont, took over on July 9. The California state flag today is based on this original Bear Flag, and continues to contain the words &quot;California Republic.&quot;

Commodore John Drake Sloat ordered his naval forces to occupy Yerba Buena (present San Francisco) on July 7 and within days American forces controlled San Francisco, Sonoma, and Sutter&#x27;s Fort in Sacramento. The treaty ending the Mexican–American War was signed on February 2, 1848, and Mexico formally ceded Alta California (including all of present-day northern California) to the United States.

=== Gold Rush and California statehood ===
The California Gold Rush took place almost exclusively in northern California from 1848 to 1855. It began on January 24, 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter&#x27;s Mill in Coloma. News of the discovery soon spread, resulting in some 300,000 people coming to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. San Francisco grew from a tiny hamlet, home to about 1,000 Californios into a boomtown of over 50,000 people in the 12 years between 1848 and 1860. New roads, churches, and schools were built, and new towns sprung up, aided in part by the development of new methods of transportation such as steamships which came into regular service and railroads which now connected the coasts. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: American colonists chose to use genocide as a tool to remove the Indigenous people so that they could look for gold on their land.

The Gold Rush also increased pressure to make California a U.S. state. Pro-slavery politicians initially attempted to permanently divide northern and southern California at 36 degrees, 30 minutes, the line of the Missouri Compromise. But instead, the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state.

=== Population and agricultural expansion (1855–1899) ===

The decades following the Gold Rush brought dramatic expansion to northern California, both in population and economically – particularly in agriculture. The completion of the First transcontinental railroad in 1869, with its terminus in Sacramento (and then later, Oakland), meant that northern California&#x27;s agricultural produce (and some manufactured goods) could now be shipped economically to the rest of the United States. In return, immigrants from the rest of the United States (and Europe) could comfortably come to northern California. A network of railroads spread throughout northern California, and in 1887, a rail link was completed to the Pacific Northwest. Almost all of these railways came under the control of the Southern Pacific Railroad, headquartered in San Francisco, and San Francisco continued as a financial and cultural center.

Substantial tensions during this era included nativist sentiments (primarily against Chinese immigrants), tensions between the increasing power of the Southern Pacific Railroad and small farmers, and the beginnings of the labor union movement.

== Economy ==

Northern California&#x27;s economy is noted for being the de facto world leader in high-tech industry (software, semiconductor/micro-electronics, biotechnology and medical devices/instruments), as well as being known for clean power, biomedical, government, and finance. Other significant industries include tourism, shipping, manufacturing, and agriculture. Its economy is diverse, though more concentrated in high technology. It is home to the state capital, as well as several Western United States regional offices in San Francisco, such as the Federal Reserve and 9th Circuit Court.

== Climate ==

Northern California has a warm or mild to cool climate, in which the Sierra mountains gets snow in the late fall through winter and occasionally into spring. Summers are mild along the coast and generally warm and dry, while winters are cool and usually wet. The high temperatures range from 50s °F (10–15 °C) to 30s °F (−1 – +4 °C) in the winters while summers temperature range is 90s °F (32–37 °C) to 60s °F (15–20 °C) or 50s °F (10–15 °C), with highs well into the 100s °F (37–42 °C) for the Sacramento region. Snow covers the mountains (generally above ) in mid January through February. Fog occurs infrequently or occurs normally in the west and coast, especially in the summer, creating some of the coolest summer conditions in North America. Since the first decade of the 21st century, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency as a consequence of climate change.

== Population ==
The population of the forty-eight counties of northern California has shown a steady increase over the years.

The largest percentage increase outside the Gold Rush era (52%) came during the 1940s, as the region was the destination of many post-War veterans and their families, attracted by the greatly expanding industrial base and (often) by their time stationed in northern California during World War II. The largest absolute increase occurred during the 1980s (over 2.1 million person increase), attracted by job opportunities in part by the expansion taking place in Silicon Valley and the Cold War–era expansion of the defense industry. Since the 2000 U.S. Census, Northern California has grown at a faster rate than Southern California due to the strong economic performances of the Bay Area and Sacramento.
== Parks and other protected areas ==
=== National Park System ===

The U.S. National Park System controls a large and diverse group of parks in northern California. The best known is Yosemite National Park, which is displayed on the reverse side of the California state quarter. Other prominent parks are the Kings Canyon-Sequoia National Park complex, Redwood National Park, Pinnacles National Park, Lassen Volcanic National Park and the largest in the contiguous forty-eight states, Death Valley National Park.

=== National Monuments and other federally protected areas ===

Other areas under federal protection include Muir Woods National Monument, Giant Sequoia National Monument, Devils Postpile National Monument, Lava Beds National Monument, Point Reyes National Seashore, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and the Cordell Bank and Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuaries (both off the coast of San Francisco). Included within the latter National Marine Sanctuary is the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge; this National Wildlife Refuge is one of approximately twenty-five such refuges in northern California. National forests occupy large sections of northern California, including the Shasta–Trinity, Klamath, Modoc, Lassen, Mendocino, Eldorado, Tahoe, and Sequoia national forests, among others. Included within (or adjacent to) national forests are federally protected wilderness areas, including the Trinity Alps, Castle Crags, Granite Chief, and Desolation wilderness areas.

In addition, the California Coastal National Monument protects all islets, reefs, and rock outcroppings from the shore of northern California out to a distance of , along the entire northern California coastline. In addition, the National Park Service administers protected areas on Alcatraz Island, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Whiskeytown–Shasta–Trinity National Recreation Area, and the Smith River National Recreation Area. The NPS also administers the Manzanar National Historic Site in Inyo County, the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond, and the Tule Lake National Monument outside of Tulelake.

<text>Jaguar (, ) is the sports car and luxury vehicle brand of Jaguar Land Rover, a British multinational car manufacturer with its headquarters in Whitley, Coventry, England. Jaguar Cars was the company that was responsible for the production of Jaguar cars until its operations were fully merged with those of Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover on 1 January 2013.

Jaguar&#x27;s business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under the ownership of SS Cars, the business extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Company, many bearing &quot;Jaguar&quot; as a model name. The company&#x27;s name was changed from SS Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975.

Jaguar was spun off from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984 until it was acquired by Ford in 1990. Since the late 1970s, Jaguar manufactured cars for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the most recent prime ministerial car delivery being an XJ (X351) in May 2010. The company also held royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III.

Ford owned Jaguar Cars, also buying Land Rover in 2000, until 2008 when it sold both to Tata Motors. Tata created Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company. At operating company level, Jaguar Cars was merged in 2013 with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover as the single design, manufacture, sales company, and brand owner for both Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.

Since the Ford ownership era, Jaguar and Land Rover have used joint design facilities in engineering centres at Whitley in Coventry and Gaydon in Warwickshire and Jaguar cars have been assembled in plants at Castle Bromwich and Solihull. On 15 February 2021, Jaguar Land Rover announced that all cars made under the Jaguar brand will be fully electric by 2025.
==History==
===Founding===
The Swallow Sidecar Company was founded in 1922 by two motorcycle enthusiasts, William Lyons and William Walmsley. In 1934, Walmsley elected to sell-out and in order to buy the Swallow business (but not the company which was liquidated) Lyons formed SS Cars, finding new capital by issuing shares to the public.

Jaguar first appeared in September 1935 as a model name on an SS 2½-litre sports saloon. A matching open two seater sports model with a 3½-litre engine was named SS Jaguar 100.

On 23 March 1945, the S. S. Cars shareholders in general meeting agreed to change the company&#x27;s name to Jaguar Cars Limited. Said chairman William Lyons &quot;Unlike S. S. the name Jaguar is distinctive and cannot be connected or confused with any similar foreign name.&quot;

Though five years of pent-up demand ensured plenty of buyers production was hampered by shortage of materials, particularly steel, issued to manufacturers until the 1950s by a central planning authority under strict government control. Jaguar sold Motor Panels, a pressed steel body manufacturing company bought in the late 1930s, to steel and components manufacturer Rubery Owen, and Jaguar bought from John Black&#x27;s Standard Motor Company the plant where Standard built Jaguar&#x27;s six-cylinder engines. From this time Jaguar was entirely dependent for their bodies on external suppliers, in particular then independent Pressed Steel and in 1966 that carried them into BMC, BMH and British Leyland.


Jaguar made its name by producing a series of successful eye-catching sports cars, the Jaguar XK120 (1948–54), Jaguar XK140 (1954–57), Jaguar XK150 (1957–61), and Jaguar E-Type (1961–75), all embodying Lyons&#x27; mantra of &quot;value for money&quot;. The sports cars were successful in international motorsport, a path followed in the 1950s to prove the engineering integrity of the company&#x27;s products.

Jaguar&#x27;s sales slogan for years was &quot;Grace, Space, Pace&quot;, a mantra epitomised by the record sales achieved by the MK VII, IX, Mks I and II saloons and later the XJ6. During the time this slogan was used, but the exact text varied.

The core of Bill Lyons&#x27; success following the Second World War was the twin-cam straight six engine, conceived pre-war and realised while engineers at the Coventry plant were dividing their time between fire-watching and designing the new power plant. It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with valves inclined from the vertical; originally at 30 degrees (inlet) and 45 degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.

As fuel octane ratings were relatively low from 1948 onwards, three piston configuration were offered: domed (high octane), flat (medium octane), and dished (low octane).

The main designer, William Heynes, assisted by Walter Hassan, was determined to develop the Twin OHC unit. Bill Lyons agreed over misgivings from Hassan. It was risky to take what had previously been considered a racing or low-volume and cantankerous engine needing constant fettling and apply it to reasonable volume production saloon cars.

The subsequent engine (in various versions) was the mainstay powerplant of Jaguar, used in the XK 120, Mk VII Saloon, Mk I and II Saloons and XK 140 and 150. It was also employed in the E Type, itself a development from the race winning and Le Mans conquering C and D Type Sports Racing cars refined as the short-lived XKSS, a road-legal D-Type.


Few engine types have demonstrated such ubiquity and longevity: Jaguar used the Twin OHC &quot;XK Engine&quot;, as it came to be known, in the Jaguar XJ6 saloon from 1969 through 1992, and employed in a J60 variant as the power plant in such diverse vehicles as the British Army&#x27;s Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) family of vehicles, as well as the Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle, the Ferret Scout Car, and the Stonefield four-wheel-drive all-terrain lorry. Properly maintained, the standard production XK Engine would achieve 200,000 miles of useful life.

Two of the proudest moments in Jaguar&#x27;s long history in motor sport involved winning the Le Mans 24 hours race, firstly in 1951 and again in 1953. Victory at the 1955 Le Mans was overshadowed by it being the occasion of the worst motorsport accident in history. Later in the hands of the Scottish racing team Ecurie Ecosse two more wins were added in 1956 and 1957.

In spite of such a performance orientation, it was always Lyons&#x27; intention to build the business by producing world-class sporting saloons in larger numbers than the sports car market could support. Jaguar secured financial stability and a reputation for excellence with a series of elegantly styled luxury saloons that included the 3-litre and 3½ litre cars, the Mark VII, VIII, and IX, the compact Mark I and 2, and the XJ6 and XJ12. All were deemed very good values, with comfortable rides, good handling, high performance, and great style.

Combined with the trend-setting XK 120, XK 140, and XK 150 series of sports car, and nonpareil E-Type, Jaguar&#x27;s elan as a prestige motorcar manufacturer had few rivals. The company&#x27;s post-War achievements are remarkable, considering both the shortages that drove Britain (the Ministry of Supply still allocated raw materials) and the state of metallurgical development of the era.

===Daimler===
In 1950, Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in Browns Lane, Allesley, Coventry, which at the time was being used by Daimler and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months. Jaguar purchased Daimler, not to be confused with Daimler-Benz or Daimler AG, in 1960 from BSA. From the late 1960s, Jaguar used the Daimler marque as a brand name for their most luxurious saloons.

=== An end to independence (1965–1984) ===
Pressed Steel Company Limited made all Jaguar&#x27;s (monocoque) bodies leaving provision and installation of the mechanicals to Jaguar. In mid-1965 British Motor Corporation (BMC), the Austin-Morris combine, bought Pressed Steel. Lyons became concerned about the future of Jaguar, partly because of the threat to ongoing supplies of bodies, and partly because of his age and lack of an heir. He therefore accepted BMC&#x27;s offer to merge with Jaguar to form British Motor (Holdings) Limited. At a press conference on 11 July 1965 at the Great Eastern Hotel in London, Lyons and BMC chairman George Harriman announced, &quot;Jaguar Group of companies is to merge with The British Motor Corporation Ltd., as the first step towards the setting up of a joint holding company to be called British Motor (Holdings) Limited&quot;. In due course BMC changed its name to British Motor Holdings at the end of 1966.

BMH was pushed by the Government to merge with Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, manufacturer of Leyland bus and truck, Standard-Triumph and, since 1967, Rover vehicles. The result was British Leyland Motor Corporation, a new holding company which appeared in 1968, but the combination was not a success. A combination of poor decision making by the board along with the financial difficulties of, especially, the Austin-Morris division (previously BMC) led to the Ryder Report and to effective nationalisation in 1975.

=== Temporary return to independence (1984–1989) ===
Over the next few years it became clear that because of the low regard for many of the group&#x27;s products insufficient capital could be provided to develop and begin manufacture of new models, including Jaguars, particularly if Jaguar were to remain a part of the group.

In July 1984, Jaguar was floated off as a separate company on the London Stock Exchange – one of the Thatcher government&#x27;s many privatisations– to create its own track record.

Installed as chairman in 1980, Sir John Egan is credited for Jaguar&#x27;s unprecedented prosperity immediately after privatisation. In early 1986 Egan reported he had tackled the main problems that were holding Jaguar back from selling more cars: quality control, lagging delivery schedules, poor productivity. He laid off about one third of the company&#x27;s roughly 10,000 employees to cut costs. Commentators later pointed out he exploited an elderly model range (on which all development costs had been written off) and raised prices. He also intensified the effort to improve Jaguar&#x27;s quality. In the US the price increases were masked by a favourable exchange rate.

=== Ford era (1989–2008) ===
Ford made offers to Jaguar&#x27;s US and UK shareholders to buy their shares in November 1989; Jaguar&#x27;s listing on the London Stock Exchange was removed on 28 February 1990. In 1999 it became part of Ford&#x27;s new Premier Automotive Group along with Aston Martin, Volvo Cars and, from 2000, Land Rover. Under Ford&#x27;s ownership, Jaguar never made a profit.

Under Ford&#x27;s ownership Jaguar expanded its range of products with the launch of the S-Type in 1999 and X-type in 2001. After PAG acquired Land Rover in May 2000 purchase by Ford, the brand became closely associated with Jaguar. In many countries they shared a common sales and distribution network (including shared dealerships), and some models shared components, although the only shared production facility was Halewood Body &amp; Assembly – which manufactured the technically related X-Type and the Freelander 2. Operationally the two companies were effectively integrated under a common management structure within Ford&#x27;s PAG.

On 11 June 2007, Ford announced that it planned to sell Jaguar, along with Land Rover and retained the services of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and HSBC to advise it on the deal. The sale was initially expected to be announced by September 2007, but was delayed until March 2008. Private equity firms such as Alchemy Partners of the UK, TPG Capital, Ripplewood Holdings (which hired former Ford Europe executive Sir Nick Scheele to head its bid), Cerberus Capital Management and One Equity Partners (owned by JPMorgan Chase and managed by former Ford executive Jacques Nasser) of the US, Tata Motors of India and a consortium comprising Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (an automobile manufacturer from India) and Apollo Management all initially expressed interest in purchasing the marques from Ford.

Before the sale was announced, Anthony Bamford, chairman of British excavator manufacturer JCB had expressed interest in purchasing the company in August 2006, but backed out upon learning that the sale would also involve Land Rover, which he did not wish to buy. On Christmas Eve of 2007, Mahindra and Mahindra backed out of the race for both brands, citing complexities in the deal.

=== Tata Motors era (2008–present) ===

On 1 January 2008, Ford announced Tata as the preferred bidder. Tata Motors also received endorsements from the Transport And General Worker&#x27;s Union (TGWU)-Amicus combine as well as from Ford. According to the rules of the auction process, this announcement would not automatically disqualify any other potential suitor. However, Ford (as well as representatives of Unite) would now be able to enter into detailed discussions with Tata concerning issues ranging from labour concerns (job security and pensions), technology (IT systems and engine production) and intellectual property, as well as the final sale price. Ford would also open its books for a more comprehensive due diligence by Tata. On 18 March 2008, Reuters reported that American bankers Citigroup and JP Morgan would finance the deal with a US$3 billion loan.

On 26 March 2008, Ford announced that it had agreed to sell its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors of India, and that they expected to complete the sale by the end of the second quarter of 2008. Included in the deal were the rights to three other British brands, Jaguar&#x27;s own Daimler, as well as two dormant brands Lanchester and Rover. On 2 June 2008, the sale to Tata was completed at a cost of £1.7 billion.

On 18 January 2008, Tata Motors, a part of the Tata Group, established Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) as a British-registered and wholly owned subsidiary. The company was to be used as a holding company for the acquisition of the two businesses from Ford – Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover. That acquisition was completed on 2 June 2008. On 1 January 2013, the group, which had been operating as two separate companies (Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover), although on an integrated basis, underwent a fundamental restructuring. The parent company was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC, Jaguar Cars Limited was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Limited and the assets (excluding certain Chinese interests) of Land Rover were transferred to it. The consequence was that Jaguar Land Rover Limited became responsible in the UK for the design, manufacture and marketing of both Jaguar and Land Rover products.

Sales in 2013 amounted to 76,668 units, an increase of 42% compared to 2012. The most significant growth was observed in Germany and the United States.

In 2020, the former CEO of the French company Renault, Thierry Bolloré, replaced Ralf Speth as the head of Jaguar Land Rover.

In 2023, JLR announced plans to move Jaguar further upmarket, following years of zero-profitability and poor sales. The holding company detailed its plans to downsize Jaguar into a lower volume brand, competing closer to the likes of Bentley and Porsche. In June 2024, the company stopped production of every model except for the F-Pace, aligning goals to fully electrify the marque by 2025. Instead, three brand new electric models will be introduced on the new JEA platform, starting with a four-door electric grand tourer in 2025.

=== Electrification (2025–present) ===
On 19 November 2024, Jaguar unveiled an advertisement showcasing its new logo and branding ahead of its relaunch in 2026 as an electric-only brand. The rebrand marked the introduction of a new typeface, colour palette, as well as new device mark, in a direction the company referred to as &#x27;exuberant modernism&#x27;. 

The change was markedly controversial, being met with criticism online, notably including that from Elon Musk, American comedian Stephen Colbert, and British right wing politician Nigel Farage. Critics pointed out the rebrand&#x27;s alienation of Jaguar&#x27;s traditional customers, accusing the brand of &#x27;going woke&#x27;. Others have instead commended the rebrand as marketing &#x27;genius&#x27;, having captured mainstream attention for the brand worldwide online and on mainstream media.

On 4 December 2024, Jaguar revealed the Type 00 concept car at Miami Art Week, a non-production model which showcases the brand&#x27;s design direction for its future electric cars. Like its rebrand a couple weeks prior, the car was met with a similarly polarised reception, inviting both derision and praise.

== Plants ==

From 1922 the Swallow Sidecar company (SSC) was located in Blackpool. The company moved to Holbrook Lane, Coventry in 1928 when demand for the Austin Swallow became too great for the factory&#x27;s capacity. The company started using the &quot;Jaguar&quot; name whilst based in Holbrooks Lane.

In 1951, having outgrown the original Coventry site they moved to Browns Lane, which had been a wartime &quot;shadow factory&quot; run by The Daimler Company. The Browns Lane plant ceased trim and final operations in 2005, the X350 XJ having already moved to Castle Bromwich two years prior, with the XK and S-Type following. The Browns Lane plant, which continued producing veneer trim for a while and housed the Jaguar Daimler Heritage centre until it moved to the British Motor Museum site, has now been demolished and is being redeveloped.

Jaguar acquired the Whitley engineering centre from Peugeot in 1986, the facility having been part of Chrysler Europe which the French firm had owned since the late 1970s. The decision to offload the site to Jaguar came as Peugeot discontinued the Talbot brand for passenger cars. In 2016, Jaguar also moved into part of the old Peugeot/Chrysler/Rootes site in Ryton-on-Dunsmore which closed a decade earlier – this now is the home of Jaguar Land Rover&#x27;s classic restoration operation.

Jaguar&#x27;s Radford plant, originally a Daimler bus plant but later a Jaguar engine and axle plant, was closed by Ford in 1997 when it moved all Jaguar engine production to its Bridgend facility.

In 2000, Ford turned its Halewood plant over to Jaguar following the discontinuation of its long running Escort that year for Jaguar&#x27;s new X-Type model. It was later joined by the second-generation Land Rover Freelander 2, from 2007. Jaguars ceased being produced at Halewood in 2009 following the discontinuation of the X-Type; Halewood now becoming a Land Rover-only plant.

Since Jaguar Land Rover was formed following the merger of Jaguar Cars with Land Rover, facilities have been shared across several JLR sites, most of which are used for work on both the Jaguar and Land Rover brands.

==Current cars==
===F-Pace===

The F-Pace is a compact luxury crossover SUV – the first SUV from Jaguar. It was unveiled at the International Motor Show Germany in Frankfurt in September 2015. The F-Pace will remain in production until early 2026, ahead of the brand&#x27;s electric relaunch.

==Car models discontinued in 2024==
With the exception of the F-Pace, Jaguar has ceased production of all internal combustion cars as of December 2024.

===E-Pace===

The Jaguar E-Pace is a compact SUV, officially revealed on 13 July 2017. Production of the E-Pace, which was outsourced to Magna Styr in Graz, Austria, stopped in December 2024.
===F-Type===

The F-Type convertible was launched at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, following its display at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June 2012, and is billed as a successor to the legendary E-Type. In fact, the Series III E-Type already had a successor, in the form of the XJS, which was in turn replaced by the XK8 and XKR. The F-Type nevertheless returns to the 2-seat plan that was lost with the introduction of the Series III E-Type, which was available only in a 2+2-seat configuration. It was developed following the positive reaction to Jaguar&#x27;s C-X16 concept car at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show. Sales began in 2013 with three engine choices; two variants of the AJ126 V6 petrol engine and the AJ133 V8 petrol engine. Production ended in June 2024, by which time 87,731 examples had been built.

===I-Pace===

The Jaguar I-Pace is an electric SUV, officially revealed on 1 March 2018. It is Jaguar&#x27;s first electric car. Amid slowing sales and a change in corporate vision, Jaguar has announced that the I-Pace will be discontinued by 2025. Production of the I-Pace ended in December 2024.

===XE===
The XE is the first compact executive Jaguar since the 2009 model year X-Type and is the first of several Jaguar models to be built using Jaguar&#x27;s new modular aluminium architecture, moving the company away from the Ford derived platforms that were used in the past for the X-Type and XF. The use of Jaguar&#x27;s own platform allows the XE to feature either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations, and it is the first car in its segment with an aluminium monocoque structure. Originally announced at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show with sales scheduled for 2015. Production of the XE ceased in mid 2024.
===XF===
The Jaguar XF is a mid-size executive car introduced in 2008 to replace the S-Type. In January 2008, the XF was awarded the &quot;What Car?&quot; &#x27;Car of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Executive Car of the Year&#x27; awards. The XF was also awarded Car of the Year 2008 from &quot;What Diesel?&quot; magazine. Engines available in the XF are 2.2-litre I4 and 3.0-litre V6 diesel engines, or 3.0 litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 petrol engines. The 5.0 Litre engine is available in supercharged form in the XFR. From 2011, the 2.2-litre diesel engine from the Land Rover Freelander was added to the range as part of a facelift. Production of the XF ceased in mid 2024.

==R and SVR models==

Jaguar began producing R models in 1995 with the introduction of the first XJR, and the first XKR was introduced in 1997. Jaguar R, R-S and SVR models are designated to compete with the likes of Mercedes-AMG, BMW M and Audi S and RS.
==Historic car models==

The company changed its name from SS Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945, but between 1935 and 1945 the cars had the marque ‘SS Jaguar’ on them. During this period they produced the SS90 and the SS100. From 1945 the renamed Jaguar company started production of the pre-war 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5-litre models, which used engines designed by the Standard Motor Company. The 1.5-litre four-cylinder engine was still supplied by Standard but the two larger six-cylinder ones were made in house. These cars have become known unofficially as Mark IVs.

The first post-war model was the September 1948 Mark V available with either 2.5 or 3.5-litre engines. It had a slightly more streamlined appearance than pre-war models, but more important was the change to torsion bar independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes. In the spring of 1948 Lyons had returned from USA reporting Jaguar&#x27;s individuality and perceived quality attracted the admiration of American buyers accustomed to the virtual uniformity of their home-grown vehicles.

The first big breakthrough was the launch in October 1948 of their new record-breaking engine design in their XK120 sportscar to replace the prewar SS Jaguar 100. It was powered by a new twin overhead camshaft (DOHC) 3.5-litre hemi-head six-cylinder engine designed by William Heynes, Walter Hassan and Claude Baily. The XK100 4-cylinder 2-Litre version had broken records in Belgium travelling at 177 mph. This XK engine had been designed at night during the war when they would be on fire watch in the factory. After several attempts a final design was achieved. That is until owner William Lyons said &quot;make it quieter&quot;.

The sportscar bearing its prefix X had originally been intended as a short production model of about 200 vehicles. A test bed for the new engine until its intended home, the new Mark VII saloon, was ready.
The second big breakthrough was the large Mark VII saloon in 1950, a car especially conceived for the American market, Jaguar was overwhelmed with orders. The Mark VII and its successors gathered rave reviews from magazines such as &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; and &quot;The Motor&quot;. In 1956 a Mark VII won the prestigious Monte Carlo Rally. The XK120&#x27;s exceptional reception was followed in 1954 by an improved XK140 then in May 1957 a fully revised XK150.

In 1955, the &quot;Two-point-four&quot; or 2.4-litre saloon (named by enthusiasts 2.4 Mark 1) was the first monocoque (unitary) car from Jaguar. Its 2.4-litre short-stroke version of the XK engine provided performance. In 1957, the 3.4-litre version with disk brakes, wire wheels and other options was introduced, with a top speed of . In October 1959, an extensively revised version of the car with wider windows and 2.4, 3.4, and 3.8-litre engine options became the Mark 2. The 3.8 Mark 2 was popular with British police forces for its small size and performance.

The Mark VIII of 1956 and Mark IX of 1958 were essentially updates of the Mark VII, but the oversize Mark X of 1961 was a completely new design of large saloon with all round independent suspension and unitary construction. Jaguar launched the E-Type in 1961.

The independent rear suspension from the Mark X was incorporated in the 1963 S-Type, a Mark 2 lengthened to contain the complex rear suspension, and in 1967 the Mark 2 name was dropped when the small saloons became the 240/340 range. The 420 of 1966, also sold as the Daimler Sovereign, put a new front onto the S-type, although both cars continued in parallel until the S-Type was dropped in 1968. The slow-selling Mark X became the 420G in 1966 and was dropped at the end of the decade. Jaguar was saved by its new equally capacious but very much trimmer new XJ6.

Of the more recent saloons, the most significant is the XJ (1968–1992). From 1968 on, the Series I XJ saw minor changes, first in 1973 (to Series II), 1979 (Series III), a complete redesign for 1986/1987 in XJ40, further modifications in 1995 (X300), in 1997 with V8-power (X308), and a major advance in 2003 with an industry-first aluminium monocoque-chassis (X350). The most luxurious XJ models carried either the Vanden Plas (US) or Daimler (rest of world) nameplates. In 1972, the 12-cylinder engine was introduced in the XJ, while simultaneously being offered in the E Type. There was a production run of two-door XJ coupés with a pillarless hardtop body called the XJ-C which was built between 1975 and 1977, in addition to about 2,000 Daimler-badged examples. 
1992 saw the introduction of the mid-engined, twin-turbo XJ220, powered by a V6 engine. The XJ220 was confirmed the fastest production car in the world at the time after Martin Brundle recorded a speed of on the Nardo track in Italy.

Over the years many Jaguar models have sported the famous chrome plated Leaping Jaguar, traditionally forming part of the radiator cap. Known as &quot;The Leaper&quot;, this iconic mascot has been the subject of controversy in recent times when banned for safety reasons from cars supplied to Europe whilst it continued to be fitted on cars destined for the United States, Middle East and Far East. It has now been dropped from all the latest Jaguar models, although some customers add it to their car as a customization.
The Jaguar S-Type, first appeared in 1999 and stopped production in 2008. It has now been replaced by the Jaguar XF. Early S-Types suffered from reliability problems but those were mostly resolved by the 2004 model year.

The Jaguar X-Type was a compact executive car launched in 2001, while the company was under Ford ownership, sharing its platform with the Ford Mondeo. X-Type production ended in 2009.

The Jaguar XK was a luxury grand tourer introduced in 2006, where it replaced the XK8. The XK introduced an aluminium monocoque bodyshell, and was available both as a two-door coupé and two-door cabriolet/convertible. Production ceased in 2014.
The Jaguar XJ was a full-size luxury saloon. The model was in production since 1968, with production ceasing in 2019, with the first generation being the last Jaguar car to have creative input by the company&#x27;s founder, Sir William Lyons, although this is disputed as some Jaguar historians claim that the second generation XJ – the XJ40 series – was the last car which Lyons had influenced. The XJ40 originally launched in 1986 and went through two major revamps in 1994 (X300) and 1997 (X308) for a total production run of 17 years.

In early 2003, the third generation XJ – the X350 – arrived in showrooms and while the car&#x27;s exterior and interior styling were traditional in appearance, the car was completely re-engineered. Its styling attracted much criticism from many motoring journalists who claimed that the car looked old-fashioned and barely more modern than its predecessor, many even citing that the &#x27;Lyons line&#x27; had been lost in the translation from XJ40 into X350 XJ, even though beneath the shell lay a highly advanced aluminium construction that put the XJ very near the top of its class.
Jaguar responded to the criticism with the introduction of the fourth generation XJ, launched in 2009. Its exterior styling is a departure from previous XJs, with a more youthful, contemporary stance, following the design shift that came into effect previously with the company&#x27;s XF and XK models. The 5-litre V8 engine in the XJ Supersport can accelerate the car from in 4.7 seconds, and has a UK emission rating of 289 g/km. To cater to the limousine market, all XJ models are offered with a longer wheelbase (LWB) as an option, which increases the rear legroom.

In 2024, Jaguar relaunched its brand with a new logo, motto and concept car. The revealed &quot;Jaguar Type 00&quot; at the Miami Art Show was controversial on both online reactions and wider media coverage. The Jaguar Type 00 name (spoken as &quot;zero-zero&quot;) draws inspiration from the iconic Jaguar Type series of the past, particularly the renowned E-Type, as well as other premium cars such as those from Bentley and Rolls Royce. The first &quot;zero&quot; represents the car&#x27;s zero-emissions electric powertrain, while the second &quot;zero&quot; is supposedly in reference to the beginning of an &quot;whole new lineage of Jaguars&quot;. While only a concept car, it is the first Jaguar car to display the new logo and badge, and the company has stated that it is a representation the direction the company will go with its future design style.

==Motorsport==


Jaguar has had major success in sports car racing, particularly in the Le Mans 24 Hours. Victories came in and with the C-Type, then in , and with the D-Type. The manager of the racing team during this period, Lofty England, later became CEO of Jaguar in the early 1970s. Although the prototype XJ13 was built in the mid-1960s it was never raced, and the famous race was then left for many years.

In 1982, a successful relationship with Tom Walkinshaw Racing commenced with the XJ-S competing in the European Touring Car Championship, which it won in 1984. A TWR XJ-S won the 1985 Bathurst 1000. In the mid-1980s TWR started designing and preparing Jaguar V12-engined Group C cars for World Sports Prototype Championship races. The team started winning regularly from 1987, and won Le Mans in 1988 and 1990 with the XJR series sports cars. The Jaguar XJR-14 was the last of the XJRs to win, taking the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

In 1999, Ford decided that Jaguar would be the corporation&#x27;s Formula One entry. Ford bought out the Milton Keynes-based Stewart Grand Prix team and rebranded it as Jaguar Racing for the 2000 season. The Jaguar F1 program was not a success however, achieving only two podium finishes in five seasons of competition between and . At the end of 2004, with costs mounting and Ford&#x27;s profits dwindling, the F1 team was seen as an unneeded expense and was sold to Red Bull and rebranded Red Bull Racing.

On 15 December 2015, it was announced that Jaguar would return to motorsport for the third season of Formula E.

On 15 June 2018, Jaguar Vector Racing broke the world speed record for an electric battery powered boat. The Jaguar Vector V20E recorded an average speed of 88.61 mph across the two legs of the 1 km course on Coniston Water, England.

Jaguar has committed to Formula E until 2030. As of July 2024, Jaguar has recorded 16 wins in Formula E, one Teams&#x27; Championship and one Manufacturers&#x27; Trophy. Also the team&#x27;s powertrain allowed customer outfit Envision to claim the teams&#x27; title in the 2022-23 season.

<text>Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 – September 3, 1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of unique musical instruments. He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales, alongside Lou Harrison. He built his own instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described the method behind his theory and practice in his book &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; (1947).

Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. To play his music, Partch built many unique instruments, with such names as the Chromelodeon, the Quadrangularis Reversum, and the Zymo-Xyl. Partch described his music as &quot;corporeal&quot; (emphasizing its physical/visceral elements), and distinguished it from abstract music, which he perceived as the dominant trend in Western music since the time of J.S. Bach, whose seminal book of preludes and fugues called The Well-tempered Clavier (in German, Das wohltemperierte Klavier) is often cited as the pivot point beyond which older mean-tone and ancient just intonation tunings were abandoned (in the late-18th century) and the then-future of Western Classical (and popular) instruments were (and most are still) based, for exploitation of all 24 theoretical key signatures. Partch&#x27;s earliest compositions were small-scale pieces to be intoned with simple folkloric-like string instrumental backing; his later works were large-scale (like a fusion of theater and music decidedly related to but quite apart from Wagnerian opera), they were integrated theater productions in which he expected each of the performers to sing, dance, speak, and play instruments in a &quot;corporeal apotheosis&quot;. Ancient Greek theatre and Japanese Noh and kabuki heavily influenced Harry Partch&#x27;s music theatre.

Encouraged by his mother, Partch learned several instruments at a young age. By fourteen, he was composing, and in particular took to setting dramatic situations. He dropped out of the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Music in 1922, dissatisfied with the quality of his teachers. He took to self-study in San Francisco&#x27;s libraries, where he discovered Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;Sensations of Tone&quot;, which convinced him to devote himself to music based on scales tuned in just intonation. In 1930, he burned all his previous compositions in a rejection of the European concert tradition. Partch frequently moved around the US. Early in his career, he was a transient worker, and sometimes a hobo; later he depended on grants, university appointments, and record sales to support himself. In 1970, supporters created the Harry Partch Foundation to administer Partch&#x27;s music and instruments.

==Personal history==
===Early life (1901–1919)===

On June 24, 1901, Partch was born in Oakland, California. His parents were Virgil Franklin Partch (1860–1919) and Jennie (née Childers, 1863–1920). The Presbyterian couple were missionaries, serving in China from 1888 to 1893, and again from 1895 to 1900, when they fled the Boxer Rebellion.

Partch moved with his family to Arizona for his mother&#x27;s health. His father worked for the Immigration Service there, and they settled in the small town of Benson. It was still the Wild West there in the early twentieth century, and Partch recalled seeing outlaws in town. Nearby, there were native Yaqui people, whose music he would hear. His mother sang to him in Mandarin Chinese, and he heard and sang songs in Spanish. His mother encouraged her children to learn music, and he learned the mandolin, violin, piano, reed organ, and cornet. His mother taught him to read music.

In 1913, the family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Partch began to study the piano seriously. He obtained work playing keyboards for silent films while he was in high school. By 14, he was composing for the piano. He developed an early interest in writing music for dramatic situations, and cited his lost composition &quot;Death and the Desert&quot; (1916) as an early example.

In 1919, Partch graduated from high school.

===Early experiments (1919–1947)===

The family moved to Los Angeles in 1919 following the death of Partch&#x27;s father. There, his mother was killed in a trolley accident in 1920. He enrolled in the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Music in 1920, but was dissatisfied with his teachers and left after the summer of 1922. He moved to San Francisco and studied books on music in the libraries there and continued to compose. In 1923 he came to reject the standard twelve-tone equal temperament of Western concert music when he discovered a translation of Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;Sensations of Tone&quot;. The book pointed Partch towards just intonation as an acoustic basis for his music. Around this time, while working as an usher for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he had a romantic relationship with the actor Ramon Novarro, then known by his birth name Ramón Samaniego; Samaniego broke off the affair when he started to become successful in his acting career.

By 1925, Partch was putting his theory into practice by developing paper coverings for violin and viola with fingerings in just intonation, and wrote a string quartet using such tunings. He put his theories in words in May 1928 in the first draft for a book, then called &quot;Exposition of Monophony&quot;. He supported himself during this time doing a variety of jobs, including teaching piano, proofreading, and working as a sailor. In New Orleans in 1930, he resolved to break with the European tradition entirely, and burned all his earlier scores in a potbelly stove.

Partch had a New Orleans violin maker build a viola with the fingerboard of a cello. He used this instrument, dubbed the Adapted Viola, to write music using a scale with twenty-nine tones to the octave. Partch&#x27;s earliest work to survive comes from this period, including works based on Biblical verse and Shakespeare, and &quot;Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po&quot; based on translations of the Chinese poetry of Li Bai. In 1932, Partch performed the music in San Francisco and Los Angeles with sopranos he had recruited. A February 9, 1932, performance at Henry Cowell&#x27;s New Music Society of California attracted reviews. A private group of sponsors sent Partch to New York in 1933, where he gave solo performances and won the support of composers Roy Harris, Charles Seeger, Henry Cowell, Howard Hanson, Otto Luening, Walter Piston, and Aaron Copland.

Partch unsuccessfully applied for Guggenheim grants in 1933 and 1934. The Carnegie Corporation of New York granted him $1500 so he could do research in England. He gave readings at the British Museum and traveled in Europe. He met W. B. Yeats in Dublin, whose translation of Sophocles&#x27; &quot;King Oedipus&quot; he wanted to set to his music; he studied the spoken inflection in Yeats&#x27;s recitation of the text. He built a keyboard instrument, the Chromatic Organ, which used a scale with forty-three tones to the octave. He met musicologist Kathleen Schlesinger, who had recreated an ancient Greek kithara from images she found on a vase at the British Museum. Partch made sketches of the instrument in her home, and discussed ancient Greek music theory with her.
Partch returned to the U.S. in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression, and spent a transient nine years, often as a hobo, often picking up work or obtaining grants from organizations such as the Federal Writers&#x27; Project. For the first eight months of this period, he kept a journal which was published posthumously as &quot;Bitter Music&quot;. Partch included notation on the speech inflections of people he met in his travels. He continued to compose music, build instruments, and develop his book and theories, and make his first recordings. He had alterations made by sculptor and designer friend Gordon Newell to the Kithara sketches he had made in England. After taking some woodworking courses in 1938, he built his first Kithara at Big Sur, California, at a scale of roughly twice the size of Schlesinger&#x27;s. In 1942 in Chicago, he built his Chromelodeon—another 43-tone reed organ. He was staying on the eastern coast of the U.S. when he was awarded a Guggenheim grant in March 1943 to construct instruments and complete a seven-part &quot;Monophonic Cycle&quot;. On April 22, 1944, the first performance of his &quot;Americana&quot; series of compositions was given at Carnegie Chamber Music Hall put on by the League of Composers.

===University work (1947–1962)===
Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;. &quot;Genesis&quot; was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.

In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin into a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and made recordings, primarily of his &quot;Eleven Intrusions&quot; (1949–1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch&#x27;s recordings. In early 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of &quot;King Oedipus&quot; at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of &quot;King Oedipus&quot; in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats&#x27;s translation of Sophocles&#x27;s play.

In February 1953, Partch founded a studio, named Gate 5, in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch&#x27;s three &quot;Plectra and Percussion Dances&quot;, &quot;Ring Around the Moon&quot; (1949–1950), &quot;Castor and Pollux&quot;, and &quot;Even Wild Horses&quot;, premiered on Berkeley&#x27;s KPFA radio in November 1953.

After completing &quot;The Bewitched&quot; in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch&#x27;s heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, &quot;The Bewitched&quot; was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais&#x27;s interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot&#x27;s film &quot;Windsong&quot;, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of &quot;Revelation in the Courthouse Park&quot; in 1961 and &quot;Water! Water!&quot; in 1962. Though these two works were based, as &quot;King Oedipus&quot; had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California.

===Later life in California (1962–1974)===
Partch set up a studio in late 1962 in Petaluma, California, in a former chick hatchery. There he composed &quot;And on the Seventh Day, Petals Fell in Petaluma&quot;. He left northern California in summer 1964, and spent his remaining decade in various cities in southern California. He rarely had university work during this period, and lived on grants, commissions, and record sales. A turning point in his popularity was the 1969 Columbia LP &quot;The World of Harry Partch&quot;, the first modern recording of Partch&#x27;s music and his first release on a major record label.

His final theater work was &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot;, which incorporated music from &quot;Petaluma&quot;, and was first produced at the University of California in early 1969. In 1970, the Harry Partch Foundation was founded to handle the expenses and administration of Partch&#x27;s work. His final completed work was the soundtrack to Betty Freeman&#x27;s &quot;The Dreamer that Remains&quot;. He retired to San Diego in 1973, where he died after suffering a heart attack on September 3, 1974. The same year, a second edition of &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; was published with extra chapters about work and instruments Partch made since the book&#x27;s original publication.

In 1991, Partch&#x27;s journals from June 1935 to February 1936 were discovered and published—journals that Partch had believed to have been lost or destroyed. In 1998, musicologist Bob Gilmore published a biography of Partch.

==Personal life==
Partch was first cousins with gag cartoonist Virgil Partch (1916–1984). Partch believed he was sterile due to childhood mumps, and he had a romantic relationship with the film actor Ramon Novarro.

==Legacy==

Partch met Danlee Mitchell while he was at the University of Illinois; Partch made Mitchell his heir, and Mitchell serves as the executive director of the Harry Partch Foundation. Dean Drummond and his group Newband took charge of Partch&#x27;s instruments, and performed his repertoire. After Drummond&#x27;s death in 2013, Charles Corey, a former doctoral student of Drummond, assumed responsibility for the instruments.

The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music in Urbana, Illinois, holds the Harry Partch Estate Archive, 1918–1991, which consists of Partch&#x27;s personal papers, musical scores, films, tapes and photographs documenting his career as a composer, writer, and producer. It also holds the Music and performing Arts Library Harry Partch Collection, 1914–2007, which consists of books, music, films, personal papers, artifacts and sound recordings collected by the staff of the Music and Performing Arts Library and the University of Illinois School of Music documenting the life and career of Harry Partch, and those associated with him, throughout his career as a composer and writer.

Partch&#x27;s notation is an obstacle, as it mixes a sort of tablature with indications of pitch ratios. This makes it difficult for those trained in traditional Western notation, and gives no visual indication as to what the music is intended to sound like.

Paul Simon used Partch&#x27;s instruments in the creation of songs for his 2016 album &quot;Stranger to Stranger&quot;.

===Recognition===
In 1974, Partch was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Percussive Arts Society, a music service organization promoting percussion education, research, performance and appreciation. In 2004, &quot;U.S. Highball&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Preservation Board as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Music==
===Theory===

Partch made public his theories in his book &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; (1947). He opens the book with an overview of music history, and argues that Western music began to suffer from the time of Bach, after which twelve-tone equal temperament was adopted to the exclusion of other tuning systems, and abstract, instrumental music became the norm. Partch sought to bring vocal music back to prominence, and adopted tunings and scales he believed more suitable to singing.

Inspired by &quot;Sensations of Tone&quot;, Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s book on acoustics and the perception of sound, Partch based his music strictly on just intonation. He tuned his instruments using the overtone series, and extended it up to the eleventh partial. This allowed for a larger number of smaller, unequal intervals than found in the Western classical music tradition&#x27;s twelve-tone equal temperament. Partch&#x27;s tuning is often classed as microtonality, as it allowed for intervals smaller than 100 cents, though Partch did not conceive his tuning in such a context. Instead, he saw it as a return to pre-Classical Western musical roots, in particular to the music of the ancient Greeks. By taking the principles he found in Helmholtz&#x27;s book, he expanded his tuning system until it allowed for a division of the octave into 43 tones based on ratios of small integers.

Partch uses the terms Otonality and Utonality to describe chords whose pitch classes are the harmonics or subharmonics of a given fixed tone. These six-tone chords function in Partch&#x27;s music much the same that the three-tone major and minor chords (or triads) do in classical music. The Otonalities are derived from the overtone series, and the Utonalities from the undertone series.

&quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; has been influential on later generations of composers interested in new intonational systems, such Ben Johnston and James Tenney (both of whom worked with Partch in the 1950s).

===Style===

Partch rejected the Western concert music tradition, saying that the music of composers such as Beethoven &quot;has only the feeblest roots&quot; in Western culture. His non-Western orientation was particularly pronounced—sometimes explicitly, as when he set to music the poetry of Li Bai, or when he combined two Noh dramas with one from Ethiopia in &quot;The Delusion of the Fury&quot;.

Partch believed that Western music of the 20th century suffered from over-specialization. He objected to the theatre of the day, which he believed had divorced music and drama, and he strove to create complete, integrated theatre works, in which he expected each performer to sing, dance, play instruments, and take on speaking parts. Partch used the words &quot;ritual&quot; and &quot;corporeal&quot; to describe his theatre works—musicians and their instruments were not hidden in an orchestra pit or offstage, but were a visual part of the performance.

===Rhythmic range===
Partch&#x27;s approach to rhythm ranged from unspecified to complex. In &quot;Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po&quot; for the Adapted Viola, Partch &quot;doesn&#x27;t bother with rhythmic notation at all, but simply directs performers to follow the natural rhythms of the poem.&quot; His rhythmic structures that were specified in &quot;Castor and Pollux&quot; were far more structured: &quot;Each of the duets last 234 beats. In the first half (Castor) the music alternates between 4 and 5 beats to a bar, and there&#x27;s usually a rest on the eighth of the nine beats. In the second half (Pollux) the rhythm&#x27;s a bit more complicated, with six bars of 7 beats alternating with six bars of 9 beats until 234 beats are reached.&quot;

===Instruments===
Partch called himself &quot;a philosophic music-man seduced into carpentry&quot;. The path towards Partch&#x27;s use of various unique instruments was gradual. He began in the 1920s using traditional instruments, and wrote a string quartet in just intonation (now lost). He had his first specialized instrument built for him in 1930—the Adapted Viola, a viola with a cello&#x27;s neck fitted on it.

Most of Partch&#x27;s works exclusively used the instruments he had created. Some works made use of unaltered standard instruments such as clarinet or cello; &quot;Revelation in the Courtyard Park&quot; (1960) used an unaltered small wind band, and &quot;Yankee Doodle Fantasy&quot; (1944) used unaltered oboe and flute.

In 1991, Dean Drummond became the custodian of the original Harry Partch instrument collection until his death in 2013. In 1999 Drummond brought the instruments to Montclair State University in Montclair, New Jersey, where they resided until November 2014, when they were moved to the University of Washington, Seattle. They are currently under the care of Charles Corey, Drummond&#x27;s former PhD student.

In 2012 a complete set of replicas was built by Thomas Meixner under commission by Ensemble Musikfabrik and used in performances of Partch&#x27;s work including &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot;.

==Works==

Partch&#x27;s later works were large-scale, integrated theater productions in which he expected each of the performers to sing, dance, speak, and play instruments.

Partch described the theory and practice of his music in his book &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;, which he had published first in 1947, and in an expanded edition in 1974. A collection of essays, journals, and librettos by Partch was published as posthumously as &quot;Bitter Music&quot; 1991.

Partch partially supported himself with the sales of recordings, which he began making in the late 1930s. He published his recordings under the Gate 5 Records label beginning in 1953. On recordings such as the soundtrack to &quot;Windsong&quot;, he used multitrack recording, which allowed him to play all the instruments himself. He never used synthesized or computer-generated sounds, though he had access to such technology. Partch scored six films by Madeline Tourtelot, starting with 1957&#x27;s &quot;Windsong&quot;. He has been the subject of a number of documentary films.

<doc id="147685" wikidata="Q130011" url="?curid=147685" title="Geomagnetic storm">
<text>A geomagnetic storm, also known as a magnetic storm, is a temporary disturbance of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave.

The disturbance that drives the magnetic storm may be a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) or (much less severely) a corotating interaction region (CIR), a high-speed stream of solar wind originating from a coronal hole. The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the sunspot cycle. During solar maxima, geomagnetic storms occur more often, with the majority driven by CMEs.

The increase in the solar wind pressure initially compresses the magnetosphere. The solar wind&#x27;s magnetic field interacts with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and transfers an increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions cause an increase in plasma movement through the magnetosphere (driven by increased electric fields inside the magnetosphere) and an increase in electric current in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, electric current in the magnetosphere creates a magnetic force that pushes out the boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind.

Several space weather phenomena tend to be associated with geomagnetic storms. These include solar energetic particle (SEP) events, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC), ionospheric storms and disturbances that cause radio and radar scintillation, disruption of navigation by magnetic compass and auroral displays at much lower magnetic latitudes than normal.

The largest recorded geomagnetic storm, the Carrington Event in September 1859, took down parts of the recently created US telegraph network, starting fires and electrically shocking telegraph operators. In 1989, a geomagnetic storm energized ground induced currents that disrupted electric power distribution throughout most of Quebec and caused aurorae as far south as Texas.

==Definition==
A geomagnetic storm is defined by changes in the Dst (disturbance – storm time) index. The Dst index estimates the globally averaged change of the horizontal component of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at the magnetic equator based on measurements from a few magnetometer stations. Dst is computed once per hour and reported in near-real-time. During quiet times, Dst is between +20 and −20 nano-Tesla (nT).

A geomagnetic storm has three phases: initial, main and recovery. The initial phase is characterized by Dst (or its one-minute component SYM-H) increasing by 20 to 50 nT in tens of minutes. The initial phase is also referred to as a storm sudden commencement (SSC). However, not all geomagnetic storms have an initial phase and not all sudden increases in Dst or SYM-H are followed by a geomagnetic storm. The main phase of a geomagnetic storm is defined by Dst decreasing to less than −50 nT. The selection of −50 nT to define a storm is somewhat arbitrary. The minimum value during a storm will be between −50 and approximately −600 nT. The duration of the main phase is typically 2–8 hours. The recovery phase is when Dst changes from its minimum value to its quiet time value. The recovery phase may last as short as 8 hours or as long as 7 days.

The size of a geomagnetic storm is classified as moderate (−50 nT &gt; minimum of Dst &gt; −100 nT), intense (−100 nT &gt; minimum Dst &gt; −250 nT) or super-storm (minimum of Dst &lt; −250 nT).

== Measuring intensity ==

Geomagnetic storm intensity is reported in several different ways, including:
* K-index
* A-index
* The G-scale used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which rates the storm from G1 to G5 (i.e. G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 in order), where G1 is the weakest storm classification (corresponding to a Kp value of 5), and G5 is the strongest (corresponding to a Kp value of 9).

== History of the theory ==
In 1930, Sydney Chapman and Vincenzo C. A. Ferraro wrote an article, &quot;A New Theory of Magnetic Storms&quot;, that sought to explain the phenomenon. They argued that whenever the Sun emits a solar flare it also emits a plasma cloud, now known as a coronal mass ejection. They postulated that this plasma travels at a velocity such that it reaches Earth within 113 days, though we now know this journey takes 1 to 5 days. They wrote that the cloud then compresses the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and thus increases this field at the Earth&#x27;s surface. Chapman and Ferraro&#x27;s work drew on that of, among others, Kristian Birkeland, who had used recently-discovered cathode-ray tubes to show that the rays were deflected towards the poles of a magnetic sphere. He theorised that a similar phenomenon was responsible for auroras, explaining why they are more frequent in polar regions.

==Occurrences==

The first scientific observation of the effects of a geomagnetic storm occurred early in the 19th century: from May 1806 until June 1807, Alexander von Humboldt recorded the bearing of a magnetic compass in Berlin. On 21 December 1806, he noticed that his compass had become erratic during a bright auroral event.

On September 1–2, 1859, the largest recorded geomagnetic storm occurred. From August 28 until September 2, 1859, numerous sunspots and solar flares were observed on the Sun, with the largest flare on September 1. This is referred to as the solar storm of 1859 or the Carrington Event. It can be assumed that a massive coronal mass ejection was launched from the Sun and reached the Earth within eighteen hours—a trip that normally takes three to four days. The horizontal field was reduced by 1600 nT as recorded by the Colaba Observatory. It is estimated that Dst would have been approximately −1760 nT. Telegraph wires in both the United States and Europe experienced induced voltage increases (emf), in some cases even delivering shocks to telegraph operators and igniting fires. Aurorae were seen as far south as Hawaii, Mexico, Cuba and Italy—phenomena that are usually only visible in polar regions. Ice cores show evidence that events of similar intensity recur at an average rate of approximately once per 500 years.

Since 1859, less severe storms have occurred, notably the aurora of November 17, 1882 and the May 1921 geomagnetic storm, both with disruption of telegraph service and initiation of fires, and 1960, when widespread radio disruption was reported.

In early August 1972, a series of flares and solar storms peaks with a flare estimated around X20 producing the fastest CME transit ever recorded and a severe geomagnetic and proton storm that disrupted terrestrial electrical and communications networks, as well as satellites (at least one made permanently inoperative), and spontaneously detonated numerous U.S. Navy magnetic-influence sea mines in North Vietnam.

The March 1989 geomagnetic storm caused the collapse of the Hydro-Québec power grid in seconds as equipment protection relays tripped in a cascading sequence. Six million people were left without power for nine hours. The storm caused auroras as far south as Texas and Florida. The storm causing this event was the result of a coronal mass ejected from the Sun on March 9, 1989. The minimum Dst was −589 nT.

On July 14, 2000, an X5 class flare erupted (known as the Bastille Day event) and a coronal mass was launched directly at the Earth. A geomagnetic super storm occurred on July 15–17; the minimum of the Dst index was −301 nT. Despite the storm&#x27;s strength, no power distribution failures were reported. The Bastille Day event was observed by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, thus it is the farthest out in the Solar System that a solar storm has been observed.

Seventeen major flares erupted on the Sun between 19 October and 5 November 2003, including perhaps the most intense flare ever measured on the GOES XRS sensor—a huge X28 flare, resulting in an extreme radio blackout, on 4 November. These flares were associated with CME events that caused three geomagnetic storms between 29 October and 2 November, during which the second and third storms were initiated before the previous storm period had fully recovered. The minimum Dst values were −151, −353 and −383 nT. Another storm in this sequence occurred on 4–5 November with a minimum Dst of −69 nT. The last geomagnetic storm was weaker than the preceding storms, because the active region on the Sun had rotated beyond the meridian where the central portion CME created during the flare event passed to the side of the Earth. The whole sequence became known as the Halloween Solar Storm. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was offline for approximately 30 hours due to the storm. The Japanese ADEOS-2 satellite was severely damaged and the operation of many other satellites were interrupted due to the storm.

== Interactions with planetary processes ==

The solar wind also carries with it the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field. This field will have either a North or South orientation. If the solar wind has energetic bursts, contracting and expanding the magnetosphere, or if the solar wind takes a southward polarization, geomagnetic storms can be expected. The southward field causes magnetic reconnection of the dayside magnetopause, rapidly injecting magnetic and particle energy into the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere.

During a geomagnetic storm, the ionosphere&#x27;s F2 layer becomes unstable, fragments, and may even disappear. In the northern and southern pole regions of the Earth, auroras are observable.

== Instruments ==
Magnetometers monitor the auroral zone as well as the equatorial region. Two types of radar, coherent scatter and incoherent scatter, are used to probe the auroral ionosphere. By bouncing signals off ionospheric irregularities, which move with the field lines, one can trace their motion and infer magnetospheric convection.

Spacecraft instruments include:

* Magnetometers, usually of the flux gate type. Usually these are at the end of booms, to keep them away from magnetic interference by the spacecraft and its electric circuits.
* Electric sensors at the ends of opposing booms are used to measure potential differences between separated points, to derive electric fields associated with convection. The method works best at high plasma densities in low Earth orbit; far from Earth long booms are needed, to avoid shielding-out of electric forces.
* Radio sounders from the ground can bounce radio waves of varying frequency off the ionosphere, and by timing their return determine the electron density profile—up to its peak, past which radio waves no longer return. Radio sounders in low Earth orbit aboard the Canadian Alouette 1 (1962) and Alouette 2 (1965), beamed radio waves earthward and observed the electron density profile of the &quot;topside ionosphere&quot;. Other radio sounding methods were also tried in the ionosphere (e.g. on IMAGE).
* Particle detectors include a Geiger counter, as was used for the original observations of the Van Allen radiation belt. Scintillator detectors came later, and still later &quot;channeltron&quot; electron multipliers found particularly wide use. To derive charge and mass composition, as well as energies, a variety of mass spectrograph designs were used. For energies up to about 50 keV (which constitute most of the magnetospheric plasma) time-of-flight spectrometers (e.g. &quot;top-hat&quot; design) are widely used.

Computers have made it possible to bring together decades of isolated magnetic observations and extract average patterns of electrical currents and average responses to interplanetary variations. They also run simulations of the global magnetosphere and its responses, by solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a numerical grid. Appropriate extensions must be added to cover the inner magnetosphere, where magnetic drifts and ionospheric conduction need to be taken into account. At polar regions, directly linked to the solar wind, large-scale ionospheric anomalies can be successfully modeled, even during geomagnetic super-storms. At smaller scales (comparable to a degree of latitude/longitude) the results are difficult to interpret, and certain assumptions about the high-latitude forcing uncertainty are needed. 

== Geomagnetic storm effects ==

=== Disruption of electrical systems ===

It has been suggested that a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the solar storm of 1859 today would cause billions or even trillions of dollars of damage to satellites, power grids and radio communications, and could cause electrical blackouts on a massive scale that might not be repaired for weeks, months, or even years. Such sudden electrical blackouts may threaten food production.

==== Main electrical grid ====

When magnetic fields move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, a geomagnetically induced current is produced in the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms (the same mechanism also influenced telephone and telegraph lines before fiber optics, see above) on all long transmission lines. Long transmission lines (many kilometers in length) are thus subject to damage by this effect. Notably, this chiefly includes operators in China, North America, and Australia, especially in modern high-voltage, low-resistance lines. The European grid consists mainly of shorter transmission circuits, which are less vulnerable to damage.

The (nearly direct) currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially transformers—inducing core saturation, constraining their performance (as well as tripping various safety devices), and causing coils and cores to heat up. In extreme cases, this heat can disable or destroy them, even inducing a chain reaction that can overload transformers. Most generators are connected to the grid via transformers, isolating them from the induced currents on the grid, making them much less susceptible to damage due to geomagnetically induced current. However, a transformer that is subjected to this will act as an unbalanced load to the generator, causing negative sequence current in the stator and consequently rotor heating.

A 2008 study by Metatech corporation concluded that a storm with a strength comparable to that of 1921 would destroy more than 300 transformers and leave over 130 million people without power in the United States, costing several trillion dollars. The extent of the disruption is debated, with some congressional testimony indicating a potentially indefinite outage until transformers can be replaced or repaired. These predictions are contradicted by a North American Electric Reliability Corporation report that concludes that a geomagnetic storm would cause temporary grid instability but no widespread destruction of high-voltage transformers. The report points out that the widely quoted Quebec grid collapse was not caused by overheating transformers but by the near-simultaneous tripping of seven relays. In 2016, the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adopted NEARC rules for equipment testing for electric utilities. Implementation of any upgrades needed to protect against the effects of geomagnetic storms was required within four years, and the regulations also directed further research.

Besides the transformers being vulnerable to the effects of a geomagnetic storm, electricity companies can also be affected indirectly by the geomagnetic storm. For instance, Internet service providers may go down during geomagnetic storms (and/or remain non-operational long after). Electricity companies may have equipment requiring a working Internet connection to function, so during the period the Internet service provider is down, the electricity too may not be distributed.

By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings (e.g. by the Space Weather Prediction Center; via Space Weather satellites as SOHO or ACE), power companies can minimize damage to power transmission equipment, by momentarily disconnecting transformers or by inducing temporary blackouts. Preventive measures also exist, including preventing the inflow of GICs into the grid through the neutral-to-ground connection.

==== Communications ====

High frequency (3–30 MHz) communication systems use the ionosphere to reflect radio signals over long distances. Ionospheric storms can affect radio communication at all latitudes. Some frequencies are absorbed and others are reflected, leading to rapidly fluctuating signals and unexpected propagation paths. TV and commercial radio stations are little affected by solar activity, but ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, shortwave broadcast and amateur radio (mostly the bands below 30 MHz) are frequently disrupted. Radio operators using HF bands rely upon solar and geomagnetic alerts to keep their communication circuits up and running.

Military detection or early warning systems operating in the high frequency range are also affected by solar activity. The &quot;over-the-horizon radar&quot; bounces signals off the ionosphere to monitor the launch of aircraft and missiles from long distances. During geomagnetic storms, this system can be severely hampered by radio clutter. Also some submarine detection systems use the magnetic signatures of submarines as one input to their locating schemes. Geomagnetic storms can mask and distort these signals.

The Federal Aviation Administration routinely receives alerts of solar radio bursts so that they can recognize communication problems and avoid unnecessary maintenance. When an aircraft and a ground station are aligned with the Sun, high levels of noise can occur on air-control radio frequencies. This can also happen on UHF and SHF satellite communications, when an Earth station, a satellite and the Sun are in alignment. In order to prevent unnecessary maintenance on satellite communications systems aboard aircraft AirSatOne provides a live feed for geophysical events from NOAA&#x27;s Space Weather Prediction Center. allows users to view observed and predicted space storms. Geophysical Alerts are important to flight crews and maintenance personnel to determine if any upcoming activity or history has or will have an effect on satellite communications, GPS navigation and HF Communications.

Telegraph lines in the past were affected by geomagnetic storms. Telegraphs used a single long wire for the data line, stretching for many miles, using the ground as the return wire and fed with DC power from a battery; this made them (together with the power lines mentioned below) susceptible to being influenced by the fluctuations caused by the ring current. The voltage/current induced by the geomagnetic storm could have diminished the signal, when subtracted from the battery polarity, or to overly strong and spurious signals when added to it; some operators learned to disconnect the battery and rely on the induced current as their power source. In extreme cases the induced current was so high the coils at the receiving side burst in flames, or the operators received electric shocks. Geomagnetic storms affect also long-haul telephone lines, including undersea cables unless they are fiber optic.

Damage to communications satellites can disrupt non-terrestrial telephone, television, radio and Internet links. The National Academy of Sciences reported in 2008 on possible scenarios of widespread disruption in the 2012–2013 solar peak. A solar superstorm could cause large-scale global months-long Internet outages. A study describes potential mitigation measures and exceptions – such as user-powered mesh networks, related peer-to-peer applications and new protocols – and analyzes the robustness of the current Internet infrastructure.

==== Navigation systems ====

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), and other navigation systems such as LORAN and the now-defunct OMEGA are adversely affected when solar activity disrupts their signal propagation. The OMEGA system consisted of eight transmitters located throughout the world. Airplanes and ships used the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system gave navigators information that was inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators had been alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm was in progress, they could have switched to a backup system.

GNSS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere, causing the satellite signals to scintillate (like a twinkling star). The scintillation of satellite signals during ionospheric disturbances is studied at HAARP during ionospheric modification experiments. It has also been studied at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory.

One technology used to allow GNSS receivers to continue to operate in the presence of some confusing signals is Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), used by GPS. However, RAIM is predicated on the assumption that a majority of the GPS constellation is operating properly, and so it is much less useful when the entire constellation is perturbed by global influences such as geomagnetic storms. Even if RAIM detects a loss of integrity in these cases, it may not be able to provide a useful, reliable signal.

=== Satellite hardware damage ===

Geomagnetic storms and increased solar ultraviolet emission heat Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, causing it to expand. The heated air rises, and the density at the orbit of satellites up to about increases significantly. This results in increased drag, causing satellites to slow and change orbit slightly. Low Earth orbit satellites that are not repeatedly boosted to higher orbits slowly fall and eventually burn up. Skylab&#x27;s 1979 destruction is an example of a spacecraft reentering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere prematurely as a result of higher-than-expected solar activity. During the great geomagnetic storm of March 1989, four of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s navigational satellites had to be taken out of service for up to a week, the U.S. Space Command had to post new orbital elements for over 1000 objects affected, and the Solar Maximum Mission satellite fell out of orbit in December the same year.

The vulnerability of the satellites depends on their position as well. The South Atlantic Anomaly is a perilous place for a satellite to pass through, due to the unusually weak geomagnetic field at low Earth orbit.

=== Pipelines ===

Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can produce geomagnetically induced currents in pipelines. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can transmit erroneous flow information and the corrosion rate of the pipeline can be dramatically increased.

=== Radiation hazards to humans ===

Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but astronauts are subject to potentially lethal radiation poisoning. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells can cause chromosome damage, cancer and other health problems. Large doses can be immediately fatal. Solar protons with energies greater than 30 MeV are particularly hazardous.

Solar proton events can also produce elevated radiation aboard aircraft flying at high altitudes. Although these risks are small, flight crews may be exposed repeatedly, and monitoring of solar proton events by satellite instrumentation allows exposure to be monitored and evaluated, and eventually flight paths and altitudes to be adjusted to lower the absorbed dose.

Ground level enhancements, also known as ground level events or GLEs, occur when a solar particle event contains particles with sufficient energy to have effects at ground level, mainly detected as an increase in the number of neutrons measured at ground level. These events have been shown to have an impact on radiation dosage, but they do not significantly increase the risk of cancer.

===Effect on animals===

There is a large but controversial body of scientific literature on connections between geomagnetic storms and human health. This began with Russian papers, and the subject was subsequently studied by Western scientists. Theories for the cause include the involvement of cryptochrome, melatonin, the pineal gland, and the circadian rhythm.

Some scientists suggest that solar storms induce whales to beach themselves. Some have speculated that migrating animals which use magnetoreception to navigate, such as birds and honey bees, might also be affected.

<text>Stevland Hardaway Morris (; Judkins; born May 13, 1950), known professionally as Stevie Wonder, is an American-Ghanaian singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Wonder is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include R&amp;B, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder&#x27;s use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of contemporary R&amp;B. He also helped drive such genres into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown&#x27;s Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name Little Stevie Wonder.

Wonder&#x27;s single &quot;Fingertips&quot; was a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1963, when he was 13, making him the youngest solo artist ever to top the chart. Wonder&#x27;s critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His &quot;classic period&quot; began in 1972 with the releases of &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; and &quot;Talking Book&quot;, the latter featuring &quot;Superstition&quot;, which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works &quot;Innervisions&quot; (1973), &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot; (1974) and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his &quot;commercial period&quot; in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.

Wonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a male solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his political activism, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday a federal holiday in the United States. In 2009, Wonder was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

== Early life ==
Wonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950, the third of five children born to Lula Mae Hardaway, and the second of Hardaway&#x27;s two children with Calvin Judkins. Wonder was born six weeks premature, a condition that, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity, a disease that aborts eye growth and often causes the retinas to detach, which left him blind.

When Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved with her three children to Detroit. Wonder attended Whitestone Baptist Church, where he sang in the choir and became a soloist at age eight. His mother later rekindled her relationship with her first child&#x27;s father (whose surname was also coincidentally Hardaway), changed her name back to Lula Hardaway, and had two more children.

Wonder began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners and occasionally at parties and dances. When Stevie was signed by Motown in 1961, his surname was legally changed to Morris, which (according to Lula Mae Hardaway&#x27;s authorized biography) was an old family name. Berry Gordy was responsible for creating the stage name of &quot;Little Stevie Wonder&quot;.

Wonder attended Fitzgerald Elementary School in Detroit. After his first album was released, &quot;The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie&quot; (1962), he enrolled in Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, Michigan.

== Career ==
=== 1960s: Singles as a youth ===
In 1961, at the age of 11, Wonder sang his own composition, &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, to Ronnie White of the Miracles; White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition at Motown, where CEO Berry Gordy signed Wonder to Motown&#x27;s Tamla label. Before signing, producer Clarence Paul gave him the name Little Stevie Wonder. Because of Wonder&#x27;s age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21. He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 () per week, and a private tutor was provided when Wonder was on tour.

Wonder was put in the care of producer and songwriter Clarence Paul, and for a year they worked together on two albums. &quot;Tribute to Uncle Ray&quot; was recorded first, when Wonder was still 11 years old. Mainly covers of Ray Charles&#x27;s songs, the album included a Wonder and Paul composition, &quot;Sunset&quot;. &quot;The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie&quot; was recorded next, an instrumental album consisting mainly of Paul&#x27;s compositions, two of which, &quot;Wondering&quot; and &quot;Session Number 112&quot;, were co-written with Wonder. Feeling Wonder was now ready, a song, &quot;Mother Thank You&quot;, was recorded for release as a single, but then pulled and replaced by the Berry Gordy song &quot;I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues&quot; as his début single; released summer 1962, it almost broke into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100, spending one week of August at 101. Two follow-up singles, &quot;Little Water Boy&quot; and &quot;Contract on Love&quot;, both had no success, and the two albums, released in reverse order of recording—&quot;The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie&quot; in September 1962 and &quot;Tribute to Uncle Ray&quot; in October 1962—also met with little success.

At the end of 1962, when Wonder was 12 years old, he joined the Motortown Revue, touring the &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot; of theatres across America that accepted black artists. At the Regal Theater, Chicago, his 20-minute performance was recorded and released in May 1963 as the album &quot;Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius&quot;. A single, &quot;Fingertips&quot;, from the album was also released in May, and became a major hit. The song, featuring a confident and enthusiastic Wonder returning for a spontaneous encore that catches out the replacement bass player, who is heard to call out &quot;What key? What key?&quot;, was a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 when Wonder was aged 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. The single was simultaneously No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, the first time that had occurred. His next few recordings were not successful; his voice was changing as he got older, and some Motown executives were considering cancelling his recording contract. During 1964, Wonder appeared in two films as himself, &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot; and &quot;Bikini Beach&quot;, but these were not successful either. Sylvia Moy persuaded label owner Berry Gordy to give Wonder another chance.

Dropping the &quot;Little&quot; from his name, Moy and Wonder worked together to create the hit &quot;Uptight (Everything&#x27;s Alright)&quot;, and Wonder went on to have a number of other hits during the mid-1960s, including &quot;With a Child&#x27;s Heart&quot;, and &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, a Bob Dylan song, co-sung by his mentor, producer Clarence Paul. He also began to work in the Motown songwriting department, composing songs both for himself and his label mates, including &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot;, a No. 1 hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles (it was first released in 1967, mostly unnoticed as the last track of their &quot;Make It Happen&quot; LP, but eventually became a major success when re-released as a single in 1970, which prompted Robinson to reconsider his intention of leaving the group).
In 1968, Wonder recorded an album of instrumental soul/jazz tracks, mostly harmonica solos, under the title &quot;Eivets Rednow&quot;, which is &quot;Stevie Wonder&quot; spelled backward. The album failed to get much attention, and its only single, a cover of Burt Bacharach&#x27;s and Hal David&#x27;s &quot;Alfie&quot;, only reached number 66 on the U.S. Pop charts and number 11 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary charts. Nonetheless, he managed to score several hits between 1967 and 1970 such as &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot;, &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; and &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I&#x27;m Yours&quot;. A number of Wonder&#x27;s early hits, including &quot;My Cherie Amour&quot;, &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot;, and &quot;Uptight (Everything&#x27;s Alright)&quot;, were co-written with Henry Cosby. The hit single &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I&#x27;m Yours&quot; was his first-ever self-produced song.

In 1969, Wonder participated in the Sanremo Music Festival with the song &quot;Se tu ragazzo mio&quot;, in conjunction with Gabriella Ferri. Between 1967 and 1970, he recorded four 45 rpm singles and an Italian LP.

=== 1970s: Classic albums period ===

In September 1970, at the age of 20, Wonder married Syreeta Wright, a songwriter and former Motown secretary. Wright and Wonder worked together on the next album, &quot;Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot; (1971), Wonder writing the music, and Wright helping with the lyrics. Around this time, Wonder became interested in utilizing synthesizers after hearing albums by electronic group Tonto&#x27;s Expanding Head Band. Wonder and Wright wanted to &quot;touch on the social problems of the world&quot;, and for the lyrics &quot;to mean something&quot;. The album was released at around the same time as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. As both albums had similar ambitions and themes, they have been compared; in a contemporaneous review by Vince Aletti in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gaye&#x27;s was seen as successful, while Wonder&#x27;s was seen as failing due to &quot;self-indulgent and cluttered&quot; production, &quot;undistinguished&quot; and &quot;pretentious&quot; lyrics, and an overall lack of unity and flow. Also in 1970, Wonder co-wrote (and played numerous instruments on) the hit &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot; for fellow Motown act the Spinners. His contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with Gordy about creative autonomy. Reaching his 21st birthday on May 13, 1971, Wonder allowed his Motown contract to expire.

During this period, Wonder independently recorded two albums and signed a new contract with Motown Records. The 120-page contract was a precedent at Motown and gave Wonder a much higher royalty rate. He returned to Motown in March 1972 with &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;. Unlike most previous albums on Motown, which usually consisted of a collection of singles, B-sides and covers, &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; was a full-length artistic statement with songs flowing together thematically. Wonder&#x27;s lyrics dealt with social, political, and mystical themes as well as standard romantic ones, while musically he began exploring overdubbing and recording most of the instrumental parts himself. &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; marked the beginning of a long collaboration with Tonto&#x27;s Expanding Head Band (Robert Margouleff and Malcolm Cecil), and with lyricist Yvonne Wright.

Released in late 1972, Wonder&#x27;s album &quot;Talking Book&quot; featured the No. 1 hit &quot;Superstition&quot;, which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. &quot;Talking Book&quot; also featured &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;, which also peaked at No. 1. During the same time as the album&#x27;s release, Wonder began touring with the Rolling Stones to alleviate the negative effects from being pigeonholed as an R&amp;B artist in America. His touring with the Stones was also a factor behind the success of both &quot;Superstition&quot; and &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;. Between them, the two songs won three Grammy Awards. On an episode of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot; that aired in April 1973, Wonder and his band performed &quot;Superstition&quot;, as well as an original called &quot;Sesame Street Song&quot;, which demonstrated his abilities with television.

Wonder&#x27;s studio album &quot;Innervisions&quot;, released in 1973, featured &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (No. 4 on the pop charts) as well as the trenchant &quot;Living for the City&quot; (No. 8). Both songs reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts. Popular ballads such as &quot;Golden Lady&quot; and &quot;All in Love Is Fair&quot; were also present, in a mixture of moods that nevertheless held together as a unified whole. &quot;Innervisions&quot; generated three more Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The album is ranked No. 34 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Wonder had become the most influential and acclaimed black musician of the early 1970s.

On August 6, 1973, Wonder was injured in a serious automobile accident while on tour in North Carolina, when a car in which he was riding hit the back of a truck. This left him in a coma for four days and resulted in a partial loss of his sense of smell and a temporary loss of sense of taste. Despite orders from his doctor to refrain from performing, Wonder performed at a homecoming benefit for Shaw University in Raleigh, in November 1973. Shaw was facing financial difficulties, so Wonder, who was a member of the university&#x27;s board of trustees, rallied other acts including Exuma, LaBelle, and the Chambers Brothers to join the concert, which raised more than $10,000 for the school&#x27;s scholarship fund.

Wonder embarked on a European tour in early 1974, performing in France at the Midem convention in Cannes, in England at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and on the German television show &quot;Musikladen&quot;. On his return to the United States, he played a sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden in March 1974, highlighting both up-tempo material and long, building improvisations on mid-tempo songs such as &quot;Living for the City&quot;. The album &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot; appeared in July 1974 and set two hits high on the pop charts: the No. 1 &quot;You Haven&#x27;t Done Nothin&#x27;&quot; and the Top Ten &quot;Boogie on Reggae Woman&quot;. The Album of the Year was again one of three Grammys won.

The same year, Wonder took part in a Los Angeles jam session with ex-Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney that would become known as the bootleg album &quot;A Toot and a Snore in &#x27;74&quot;. He also co-wrote and produced the 1974 Syreeta Wright album &quot;Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta&quot;.

On October 4, 1975, Wonder performed at the historic &quot;Wonder Dream Concert&quot; in Kingston, Jamaica, a benefit for the Jamaican Institute for the Blind. In 1975, he played harmonica on two tracks on Billy Preston&#x27;s album &quot;It&#x27;s My Pleasure&quot;.

By 1975, at the age of 25, Wonder had won two consecutive Grammy Awards: in 1974 for &quot;Innervisions&quot; and in 1975 for &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot;. In 1976, when Paul Simon won the Album of the Year Grammy for his &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;, he wryly noted: &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank Stevie Wonder, who didn&#x27;t make an album this year.&quot;

The double album-with-extra-EP, &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;, was released in September 1976. Sprawling in style and sometimes lyrically difficult to fathom, the album was hard for some listeners to assimilate, yet is regarded by many as Wonder&#x27;s crowning achievement and one of the most recognizable and accomplished albums in pop music history. The album became the first by an American artist to debut straight at No. 1 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, where it stood for 14 non-consecutive weeks. Two tracks became No. 1 Pop/R&amp;B hits: &quot;I Wish&quot; and &quot;Sir Duke&quot;. The baby-celebratory &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Lovely?&quot; was written about his newborn daughter Aisha, while songs such as &quot;Love&#x27;s in Need of Love Today&quot; and &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot; reflected a far more pensive mood. &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; won Album of the Year and two other Grammys. The album ranks 4th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Also in 1976, Wonder heard about the demonstration of the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the first multi-font reading machine for the blind, on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and later became the user of the first production unit, beginning a long-term association between himself and Ray Kurzweil.

Until 1979&#x27;s &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot;, his only further 1970s release was the retrospective three-disc album &quot;Looking Back&quot; (1977), an anthology of his early Motown period.

=== 1980s: Commercial albums period ===
The mainly instrumental soundtrack album &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; (1979), was composed using an early music sampler called a Computer Music Melodian. It was also his first digital recording, and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings. Wonder toured briefly with an orchestra in support of the album, and used a Fairlight CMI sampler onstage. In this year Wonder also wrote and produced the dance hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serious&quot;, performed by Jermaine Jackson and ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the No. 1 R&amp;B single of 1980.

&quot;Hotter than July&quot; (1980) became Wonder&#x27;s first platinum-selling single album, and its single &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; was a successful vehicle for his campaign to establish Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday as a national holiday. The album also included &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Stand for It&quot;, and the sentimental ballad, &quot;Lately&quot;.

In 1982, Wonder released a retrospective of his 1970s work with &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Original Musiquarium&quot;, which included four new songs: the ten-minute funk classic &quot;Do I Do&quot; (which featured Dizzy Gillespie), &quot;That Girl&quot; (one of the year&#x27;s biggest singles to chart on the R&amp;B side), &quot;Front Line&quot;, a narrative about a soldier in the Vietnam War that Wonder wrote and sang in the first person, and &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot;, one of his many classic compositions. He also gained a No. 1 hit that year in collaboration with Paul McCartney in their paean to racial harmony, &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;.

Also in 1982, Wonder invited Raymond Kurzweil to his Los Angeles recording studio, Wonderland, and asked if &quot;we could use the extraordinarily flexible computer control methods on the beautiful sounds of acoustic instruments?&quot; In response, and with Wonder as musical advisor, Kurzweil founded Kurzweil Music Systems, which unveiled the Kurzweil K250 in 1984.

In 1983, Wonder performed the song &quot;Stay Gold&quot;, the theme to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s film adaptation of S. E. Hinton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. Wonder wrote the lyrics. In 1983, he scheduled an album to be entitled &quot;People Work, Human Play&quot;. The album never surfaced and instead 1984 saw the release of Wonder&#x27;s soundtrack album for &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;. The lead single, &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot;, was a No. 1 pop and R&amp;B hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was placed 13th in the list of best-selling singles in the UK published in 2002. It went on to win an Academy award for best song in 1985. Wonder accepted the award in the name of Nelson Mandela and was subsequently banned from all South African radio by the Government of South Africa.

Incidentally, on the occasion of his 35th birthday, Stevie Wonder was honored by the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid for his stance against racism in South Africa that same year (1985). The album also featured a guest appearance by Dionne Warwick, singing the duet &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot; with Stevie and a few songs of her own. Following the success of the album and its lead single, Wonder made an appearance on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, in the episode &quot;A Touch of Wonder&quot;, where he demonstrated his ability to sample.

The following year&#x27;s &quot;In Square Circle&quot; featured the No. 1 pop hit &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot;. The album also has a Top 10 Hit with &quot;Go Home&quot;. It also featured the ballad &quot;Overjoyed&quot;, which was originally written for &quot;Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot;, but did not make the album. He performed &quot;Overjoyed&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when he was the host. He was also featured in Chaka Khan&#x27;s cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;I Feel For You&quot;, alongside Melle Mel, playing his signature harmonica. In roughly the same period he was also featured on harmonica on Eurythmics&#x27; single &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot; and Elton John&#x27;s &quot;I Guess That&#x27;s Why They Call It the Blues&quot;.

Wonder was in a featured duet with Bruce Springsteen on the all-star charity single for African Famine Relief, &quot;We Are the World&quot;, and he was part of another charity single the following year (1986), the AIDS-inspired &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. He played harmonica on the album &quot;Dreamland Express&quot; by John Denver in the song &quot;If Ever&quot;, a song Wonder co-wrote with Stephanie Andrews; wrote the track &quot;I Do Love You&quot; for the Beach Boys&#x27; 1985 self-titled album; and played harmonica on &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; That Man&quot; on &quot;The Broadway Album&quot; by Barbra Streisand.

In 1987, Wonder appeared on Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; album, on the duet &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;. Jackson also sang a duet with him entitled &quot;Get It&quot; on Wonder&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Characters&quot;. This was a minor hit single, as were &quot;Skeletons&quot; and &quot;You Will Know&quot;. Wonder played harmonica on a remake of his own song, &quot;Have a Talk with God&quot; (from &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; in 1976), on Jon Gibson&#x27;s album &quot;Body &amp; Soul&quot; (1989).

=== 1990s: &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; and 1996 Olympics ===
Wonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace. He recorded a soundtrack album for Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; in 1991. From this album, singles and videos were released for &quot;Gotta Have You&quot;, &quot;Fun Day&quot; (remix only), &quot;These Three Words&quot; and &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;. The B-side to the &quot;Gotta Have You&quot; single was &quot;Feeding Off The Love of the Land&quot;, which was played during the end credits of the movie &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; but was not included on the soundtrack. A piano and vocal version of &quot;Feeding Off The Love of the Land&quot; was also released on the &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child: Romanian Angel Appeal&quot; compilation. &quot;Conversation Peace&quot; and the live album &quot;Natural Wonder&quot; were released in the 1990s.

In 1992, Wonder went to perform at Panafest, a new international festival of music held biennially in Ghana; it was during this trip that he composed many of the songs featured on &quot;Conversation Peace&quot;, and he would describe in a 1995 interview the powerful impact his visit to that country had: &quot;I&#x27;d only been there for 18 hours when I decided I&#x27;d eventually move there permanently.&quot; In 1994, as co-chair of Panafest that year, he headlined a concert at the National Theatre in Accra, capital city of Ghana.

Among his other activities, Wonder played harmonica on the track &quot;Deuce&quot; (sung by Lenny Kravitz) for the 1994 tribute album &quot;Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved&quot;; sang at the 1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremony; collaborated in 1997 with Babyface on &quot;How Come, How Long&quot;, a song about domestic violence that was nominated for a Grammy Award; and played harmonica on Sting&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Brand New Day&quot;. In early 1999, Wonder performed in the Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show.

In May 1999, Rutgers University presented Wonder with an honorary doctorate degree in fine arts. In December 1999, Wonder announced that he was interested in pursuing an intraocular retinal prosthesis to partially restore his sight.

=== Into the 21st century: Later career and collaborations ===
In 2000, Wonder contributed two new songs to the soundtrack for Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Bamboozled&quot; album (&quot;Misrepresented People&quot; and &quot;Some Years Ago&quot;). Wonder continues to record and perform; though mainly occasional appearances and guest performances, he did do two tours, and released one album of new material, 2005&#x27;s &quot;A Time to Love&quot;. In June 2006, Wonder made a guest appearance on Busta Rhymes&#x27; album &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, on the track &quot;Been through the Storm&quot;. He sings the refrain and plays the piano on the Dr. Dre- and Sha Money XL–produced track. He appeared again on the last track of Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot;, &quot;Conversations&quot;. The song is a remake of &quot;Have a Talk with God&quot; from &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. In 2006, Wonder staged a duet with Andrea Bocelli on the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Amore&quot;, offering harmonica and additional vocals on &quot;Canzoni Stonate&quot;. Wonder also performed at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s 2006 &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot; celebration.

His other key appearances include performing at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City, the 2005 Live 8 concert in Philadelphia, the pre-game show for Super Bowl XL in 2006, the Obama Inaugural Celebration in 2009, and the opening ceremony of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece.

Wonder&#x27;s first new album in 10 years, &quot;A Time to Love&quot;, was released in October 2005 to lower sales than previous albums, and lukewarm reviews—most reviewers appearing frustrated at the end of the long delay to get an album that mainly copied the style of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot; without doing anything new. The first single, &quot;So What the Fuss&quot;, was released in April. A second single, &quot;From the Bottom of My Heart&quot;, was a hit on adult-contemporary R&amp;B radio. The album also featured a duet with India Arie on the title track &quot;A Time to Love&quot;.

Wonder did a 13-date tour of North America in 2007, starting in San Diego on August 23; this was his first U.S. tour in more than 10 years. On September 8, 2008, he started the European leg of his Wonder Summer&#x27;s Night Tour, the first time he had toured Europe in more than a decade. His opening show was at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, in the English Midlands. During the tour, he played eight UK gigs; four at the O2 Arena in London (filmed in HD and subsequently released as a live-in-concert release on DVD and Blu-Ray, &quot;Live At Last&quot;), two in Birmingham and two at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester.

Wonder&#x27;s other stop in the tour&#x27;s European leg also found him performing in the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Sweden (Stockholm), Germany (Cologne, Mannheim and Munich), Norway (Hamar), France (Paris), Italy (Milan) and Denmark (Aalborg). Wonder also toured Australia (Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane) and New Zealand (Christchurch, Auckland and New Plymouth) in October and November. His 2010 tour included a two-hour set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, a stop at the Hard Rock Calling festival in Hyde Park, London, and appearances at England&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival, Rotterdam&#x27;s North Sea Jazz Festival, a concert in Bergen, Norway, and a concert in Dublin, Ireland, at The O2 on June 24.

Wonder&#x27;s harmonica playing can be heard on the 2009 Grammy-nominated &quot;Never Give You Up&quot;, featuring CJ Hilton and Raphael Saadiq.

Wonder sang at the Michael Jackson memorial service in 2009, at Etta James&#x27; funeral, in 2012, a month later at Whitney Houston&#x27;s memorial service, and at the funeral of Aretha Franklin in 2018.

Wonder appeared on singer Celine Dion&#x27;s studio album &quot;Loved Me Back to Life&quot;, performing a cover of his 1985 song &quot;Overjoyed&quot;. The album was released in October 2013. He was also featured on two tracks on Mark Ronson&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Uptown Special&quot;, and the track &quot;Stop Trying to Be God&quot; on Travis Scott&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Astroworld&quot;.

In October 2020, Wonder announced that he had a new vanity label released via Republic Records, So What the Fuss Records, marking the first time his music was not released through Motown Records. The announcement was paired with the release of two singles: &quot;Can&#x27;t Put It in the Hands of Fate&quot;, a &quot;socially-conscious&quot; funk track, and &quot;Where Is Our Love Song&quot;, whose proceeds will go towards the organization Feeding America.

In June 2021, Wonder appeared in the documentary &quot;Summer of Soul&quot;, directed by Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson, showing the Harlem Cultural Festival of 1969. In never-before-seen footage, a young 19-year-old Stevie Wonder is seen performing in front of thousands of people in Harlem. His performance shown in the documentary included &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; by the Isley Brothers and a drum solo. Wonder talks about the turning point made in his career during this time and how this helped him get out of being seen as just a child star.

In October 2022, Wonder celebrated his 50th anniversary of his project &quot;Talking Book&quot;.

On August 30, 2024, Wonder released his first new song in four years, &quot;Can We Fix Our Nation&#x27;s Broken Heart&quot;.

=== Future projects ===
By June 2008, Wonder was working on two projects simultaneously: a new album called &quot;The Gospel Inspired by Lula&quot;, which will deal with the various spiritual and cultural crises facing the world, and &quot;Through the Eyes of Wonder&quot;, an album he has described as a performance piece that will reflect his experience as a blind man. Wonder was also keeping the door open for a collaboration with Tony Bennett and Quincy Jones concerning a rumored jazz album. Bennett and Wonder recorded a rendition of &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; which earned them a Grammy for best pop collaboration with vocals in 2006; Bennett died in 2023.

In 2013, Wonder revealed that he had been recording new material for two albums, &quot;When the World Began&quot; and &quot;Ten Billion Hearts&quot;, in collaboration with producer David Foster, to be released in 2014. The albums have not seen release.

In October 2020, while promoting his two recent singles, Wonder mentioned both &quot;Through the Eyes of Wonder&quot; and &quot;The Gospel Inspired by Lula&quot; as projects in development (the former as an album that may feature both singles, and the latter as a future album he may record with his former label Motown).

== Legacy ==
Wonder is one of the most notable popular music figures of the second half of the 20th century. He is one of the most successful songwriters and musicians. Virtually a one-man band during his peak years, his use of synthesizers and further electronic musical instruments during the 1970s helped expand the sound of R&amp;B. He is also credited as one of the artists who helped drive R&amp;B into the album era, by crafting his LPs as cohesive, consistent statements with complex sounds. His &quot;classic period&quot;, which culminated in 1976, was marked by his funky keyboard style, personal control of production, and use of integrated series of songs to make concept albums. In 1979, Wonder used Computer Music Inc.&#x27;s early music sampler, the Melodian, on his soundtrack album &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot;. This was his first digital recording and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings.

Wonder recorded several critically acclaimed albums and hit singles, and also wrote and produced songs for many of his label mates and outside artists as well. In his childhood, he was best known for his harmonica work, but today he is better known for his keyboard skills and vocal ability. He plays the piano, synthesizer, harmonica, congas, drums, bongos, organ, melodica and Clavinet. Wonder has been credited as a pioneer and influence to musicians of various genres, including pop, rhythm and blues, soul, funk and rock.

Wonder&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot; is generally agreed to be between 1972 and 1976. Some observers see aspects of 1971&#x27;s &quot;Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot; as certain indications of the beginning of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot;, such as its new funky keyboard style that Wonder used throughout the classic period. Some determine Wonder&#x27;s first &quot;classic&quot; album to be 1972&#x27;s &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;, on which he attained personal control of production, and on which he programmed a series of songs integrated with one another to make a concept album. Others skip over early 1972 and determine the beginning of the classic period to be in late 1972 with &quot;Talking Book&quot;, the album on which Wonder &quot;hit his stride&quot;.

Wonder&#x27;s albums during his &quot;classic period&quot; were considered very influential in the music world: the 1983 &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; said they &quot;pioneered stylistic approaches that helped to determine the shape of pop music for the next decade&quot;; in 2005, American recording artist Kanye West said of his own work: &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to compete with what&#x27;s out there now. I&#x27;m really trying to compete with &quot;Innervisions&quot; and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. It sounds musically blasphemous to say something like that, but why not set that as your bar?&quot; &quot;Slate&quot; magazine&#x27;s pop critic, Jack Hamilton, said: &quot;Most Americans follow up their 21st birthdays with a hangover; Stevie Wonder opted for arguably the greatest sustained run of creativity in the history of popular music. Wonder&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot;—the polite phrase for when Stevie spent five years ferociously dunking on the entire history of popular music with the releases of &quot;Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Innervisions, Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale,&quot; and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; [...] We&#x27;ve never heard anything like it since, and barring another reincarnation, we never will again.&quot;

Wonder has recorded more than 30 U.S. top-ten hits, including ten U.S. number-one hits on the pop charts, well as 20 R&amp;B number one hits. He has sold over 100 million records, 19.5 million of which are albums; he is one of the top 60 best-selling music artists with combined sales of singles and albums. Wonder was the first Motown artist and second African-American musician to win an Academy Award for Best Original Song, which he won for his 1984 hit single &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot; from the movie &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;. Wonder won 25 Grammy Awards (the most ever won by a solo artist), as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award. His albums of the &quot;classic period&quot;, &quot;Innervisions&quot; (1973), &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot; (1974) and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; (1976), all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. He has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Rock Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame, and has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has also been awarded the Polar Music Prize. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the seventh greatest singer and fifteenth greatest artist of all time. In 2024, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him the fifth greatest keyboard player of all time. In June 2009, he became the fourth artist to receive the Montreal Jazz Festival Spirit Award.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list included &quot;Innervisions&quot; at number 23, &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; at number 56 (promoted to number 4 for the 2020 edition), &quot;Talking Book&quot; at number 90 (promoted to number 59 for the 2020 edition), and &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; at number 284. In 2004, on their &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Superstition&quot; at number 74 (promoted to number 12 for the 2020 edition), &quot;Living for the City&quot; at number 104, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; at number 261 (promoted to number 113 for the 2020 edition), and &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; at number 281 (promoted to number 183 for the 2020 edition); additionally, &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I&#x27;m Yours)&quot; was included in the 2020 edition at number 203.

Wonder is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday a federal holiday in the United States. On October 21, 1974, with the Boston busing desegregation underway, Wonder spoke and led students in song at a lounge at the University of Massachusetts Boston the day after he performed at the Boston Garden.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===
Wonder has been married three times. He was married to Motown singer-songwriter and frequent collaborator Syreeta Wright from 1970 until their amicable divorce in 1972, after which their musical collaboration continued (she sang on 1995&#x27;s &quot;Conversation Peace&quot;). From 2001 until 2012, he was married to fashion designer Kai Millard. In October 2009, Wonder and Millard separated; Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012. In 2017, he married Tomeeka Bracy.

Wonder has nine children with five women. Two were born to Yolanda Simmons, whom Wonder met when she applied for a job as secretary for his publishing company. Simmons gave birth to Wonder&#x27;s daughter Aisha Morris on February 2, 1975. After Aisha was born, Wonder said &quot;she was the one thing that I needed in my life and in my music for a long time&quot;. Aisha was the inspiration for Wonder&#x27;s hit single &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Lovely?&quot; She is now a singer who has toured with her father and accompanied him on recordings, including his 2005 album &quot;A Time to Love&quot;. Wonder and Simmons also had a son, Keita, in 1977.

In 1983, Wonder had a son named Mumtaz Morris with Melody McCulley. Wonder also has a daughter, Sophia, and a son, Kwame, with a woman whose identity has not been publicly disclosed. Wonder has two sons with second wife Kai Millard Morris. The elder is named Kailand, and he occasionally performs as a drummer on stage with his father. The younger son, Mandla Kadjay Carl Stevland Morris, was born on May 13, 2005 (his father&#x27;s 55th birthday).

Wonder&#x27;s ninth child, his second with Tomeeka Robyn Bracy, was born in December 2014, amid rumors that he would be the father to triplets. This turned out not to be the case, and the couple named their new daughter Nia, meaning &quot;purpose&quot; (one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa).

=== Family and health ===
On May 31, 2006, Wonder&#x27;s mother Lula Mae Hardaway died in Los Angeles at the age of 76. During his September 8, 2008, UK concert in Birmingham, he spoke of his decision to begin touring again following his loss: &quot;I want to take all the pain that I feel and celebrate and turn it around.&quot;

At a concert in London&#x27;s Hyde Park on July 6, 2019, Wonder announced that he would be undergoing a kidney transplant in September.

=== Religion and politics ===
Wonder has been a longtime Baptist affiliated with black churches. He was introduced to Transcendental Meditation through his marriage to Syreeta Wright. Consistent with that spiritual vision, Wonder became vegetarian, and later a vegan, singing about it in October 2015 on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; during the show&#x27;s &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; segment.

Wonder joined Twitter on April 4, 2018, and his first tweet was a five-minute video honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Dozens of famous personalities were rounded up in the video, which was titled &quot;The Dream Still Lives&quot;. Each person involved shared their dream, calling back to King&#x27;s popular speech in 1963. Wonder&#x27;s first tweet took the Internet by storm, and he also encouraged viewers to share their own videos about their dreams with the hashtag #DreamStillLives.

On August 21, 2024, Wonder performed &quot;Higher Ground&quot; at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election. Wonder also briefly spoke at the convention, saying: “This is a moment to tell your children where you were and what you did. When we stand between history&#x27;s pain and tomorrow&#x27;s promises, we must choose courage over complacency.&quot;

=== Ghanaian citizenship ===
On May 13, 2024, Wonder&#x27;s 74th birthday, Ghana&#x27;s President Nana Akufo-Addo conferred Ghanaian citizenship on him. Wonder took the Oath of Allegiance and received his Certificate of Citizenship at Jubilee House in Accra.

== Awards and recognition ==
=== Grammy Awards ===
Wonder has won 25 Grammy Awards, as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. He is one of only four artists and groups who have won the Grammy for Album of the Year three times as the main credited artist, along with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon, and Taylor Swift. Wonder is the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases.

=== Other awards and recognition ===
Wonder has been given a range of awards, both for his music and for his civil rights work, including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Civil Rights Museum, being named one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace, and earning a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2014, presented at a ceremony in the White House on November 24 that year.

In December 2016, the City of Detroit recognized Wonder&#x27;s legacy by renaming a portion of his childhood street, Milwaukee Avenue West, between Woodward Avenue and Brush Street, as &quot;Stevie Wonder Avenue&quot;. He was also awarded an honorary key to the city, presented by Mayor Mike Duggan on the day of the unveiling of the new street sign.

In 2023, Wonder was awarded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, conferred in recognition of his campaign to establish a U.S. national holiday for the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., who in November 1967 had received an honorary degree from Newcastle University.

In May 2024, Wonder was a recipient (alongside Misty Copeland) of the George Peabody Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Music and Dance in America, the highest honor awarded by the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University.

=== Honorary degrees ===

<text>Timothy Wayne Alexander (born April 10, 1965), also credited as &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander, is an American retired musician best known as the drummer for the rock band Primus. Prior to Primus, Alexander was the drummer for Arizona&#x27;s Major Lingo from 1985-1990. Alexander has been in Primus across three stints; he initially left the band in 1996 and rejoined in 2003 before leaving again in 2010 and re-joining in 2013, again departing in October 2024. Alexander has played in several projects with Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan including the bands Puscifer and A Perfect Circle. He earned the nickname &quot;Herb&quot; from his Primus bandmates after carrying a fanny pack full with herbs like ginseng that he would distribute.

== Biography ==
Alexander joined Primus by replacing Jay Lane (along with Larry LaLonde who replaced Todd Huth) in 1988, and lasted until 1996. Les Claypool spoke of Alexander&#x27;s playing in an interview with &quot;Bass Player&quot;: &quot;[He] is a very precise player. Even when we&#x27;re really stretching on something, you can rarely tell that we&#x27;re still a band that doesn&#x27;t rehearse much. And a huge part of that is because of Tim&quot;. Alexander has played on the majority of Primus&#x27;s discography, including some of the band&#x27;s most well known albums such as &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; (1990), &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; (1991), &quot;Pork Soda&quot; (1993) and &quot;Tales from the Punchbowl&quot; (1995). On April 21st, 2024 he released an album titled &quot;All That Syncs Must Diverge&quot; with saxophonist Skerik and bassist Timm Mason, under the name Sound Cipher. The album was recorded at Studio Litho and released through Royal Potato Family Records. 

Following Alexander&#x27;s departure from Primus, he went on to form his own group, Laundry, which released on Claypool&#x27;s label Prawn Song Records. They put out two albums and were based in the Bay area of San Francisco. On September 25, 2013, Rolling Stone announced via an interview with Claypool that Alexander would be rejoining Primus, with a possible recording session taking place as early as November. Previous drummer Jay Lane would be moving on to other projects including his former band Ratdog.

Alexander has been hailed for his &quot;polyrhythmic&quot; playing. On July 18, 2014, Alexander had a heart attack, and underwent open heart surgery. He had another heart attack in 2016. Alexander operated a cider company based in Bellingham, Washington, called Herb&#x27;s Cider.

Tim has stated that his reasons for leaving Primus again, while on tour in October of 2024, were due to ongoing health issues and to be closer to his family.

<text>A is a Japanese-style single-portion take-out or home-packed meal, often for lunch, typically including rice and packaged in a box with a lid (often a segmented box with different parts of the meal placed in different sections). Outside Japan, similar meals are common in other East and Southeast Asian culinary styles, especially within Chinese, Korean, Singaporean, Taiwanese cuisines and more, as rice is a common staple food in the region. The term &quot;bento&quot; is derived from the Chinese term &quot;biandang&quot; (, ), which means &quot;convenient&quot; or &quot;convenience&quot;.

A traditional &quot;bento&quot; typically includes rice or noodles with fish or some other meat, often with pickled and cooked vegetables in a box. Containers range from mass-produced disposable containers to hand-crafted lacquerware. Dividers are often used to separate ingredients or dishes, especially those with strong flavors, to avoid them affecting the taste of the rest of the meal. A typical divider is green plastic &#x27;sushi grass&#x27;, known as &quot;baran&quot; in Japan, which also works to slow the growth of bacteria.

&quot;Bento&quot; are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including convenience stores, , railway stations, and department stores. However, Japanese homemakers often spend time and energy on carefully prepared &quot;bento&quot; for their spouses, children, or themselves. Outside Japan, the term bento box may be used (e.g., on English menus for Japanese restaurants). &quot;Bento&quot; can be elaborately arranged in styles called &quot;kyaraben&quot; (&quot;character &quot;bento&quot;&quot;, typically decorated to look like popular characters from anime, manga, or video games) or &quot;oekakiben&quot; (&quot;picture &quot;bento&quot;&quot;, decorated to look like people, animals, buildings and monuments, or items such as flowers and plants). Contests are often held where &quot;bento&quot; arrangers compete for the most aesthetically attractive arrangements.

There are comparable forms of boxed lunches in other Asian countries such as in China, Taiwan and other Sinophone communities, known as &quot;héfàn&quot; (盒饭) or &quot;biàndāng&quot; in Mandarin, &quot;piān-tong&quot; in Taiwanese Hokkien, and in Korea as &quot;dosirak&quot;. Other Asian countries would either just use &quot;bento&quot; as a loanword or &quot;hokben&quot;, which means &quot;steaming &quot;bento&quot;. There has also been discussion regarding what &quot;bento&quot; means for Japanese society and what it represents. Analyses range from a simple semiotic approach to one that outlines the deeper ideological meanings behind &quot;bento&quot;.

==Etymology==
In Japan, &quot;bento&quot;&quot; is written in kanji as (Kyūjitai: 辨當). The word itself originates from the Chinese Song dynasty slang term (, ), meaning &quot;convenient&quot; or &quot;convenience&quot; (this sense is still used in Wu dialects such as Shanghainese). When the word was imported to Japan, it was written with the ateji and . In modern times, the term is commonly used in East and Southeast Asia. In mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, &quot;bento&quot; remains written as the original name (). In other Sinophone communities, both &quot;biandang&quot; and &quot;bento&quot; are often interchangeably used.

==History==
The increased popularity of bento can be traced back to the 12th century during the Kamakura period, when meals of cooked and dried rice called &quot;hoshi-ii&quot; ( or , literally &quot;dried meal&quot;) were developed to be carried to work. A &quot;hoshi-ii&quot; can be eaten as-is or boiled with water to make cooked rice, and is stored in a small bag. By the 16th century, wooden lacquered boxes were produced, and bento would be eaten during &quot;hanami&quot; or a tea party.
In the Edo period (1603–1867), &quot;bento&quot; culture spread and became more refined. Travelers and sightseers would carry a simple &quot;koshibentō&quot; (, &quot;waist &quot;bento&quot;&quot;), consisting of several &quot;onigiri&quot; wrapped with bamboo leaves or in a woven bamboo box. One of the most popular styles of &quot;bento&quot;, called &quot;makunouchi bentō&quot; (&quot;between-act &quot;bento&quot;&quot;), was first made during this period. Viewers of &quot;Noh&quot; and &quot;kabuki&quot; performances ate specially prepared bento between &quot;maku&quot; (acts). Numerous cookbooks were published detailing how to cook, how to pack, and what to prepare for occasions like &quot;hanami&quot; and &quot;Hinamatsuri&quot;.

In the Meiji era (1868–1912), the first &quot;ekibentō&quot; or &quot;ekiben&quot; ( or , &quot;[train] station bento&quot;) was sold. There are several records that claim where ekiben was first sold, but it is believed that it was sold on 16 July 1885 at Utsunomiya Station in the northern Kantō region of Japan, and contained two onigiri and a serving of &quot;takuan&quot; (pickled radish) wrapped in bamboo leaves. As early schools did not provide lunch, students and teachers carried bento, as did many employees.

In the Taishō era (1912–1926), the aluminium bento box became a luxury item because of its ease of cleaning and its silver-like appearance. Also, a move to abolish the practice of bento in school became a social issue. Disparities in wealth spread during this period after an export boom during World War I and subsequent crop failures in the Tōhoku region. A student&#x27;s bento too often reflected their wealth, and many wondered if this had an unfavorable influence on children both physically, from lack of adequate diet, and psychologically, from a clumsily made bento or the richness of food. After World War II, the practice of bringing bento to school gradually declined and was replaced by uniform meals provided for all students and teachers.
Bento regained popularity in the 1980s with the help of the microwave oven and the proliferation of convenience stores. In addition, the expensive wood and metal boxes have been replaced at most bento shops with inexpensive, disposable polystyrene boxes. However, even handmade bento has made a comeback, and they are once again a common, although not universal, sight at Japanese schools. Bento are still used by workers as a packed lunch, and by families on day trips, school picnics, and sports days. Homemade bento are wrapped in a furoshiki cloth, which acts as both a carrying bag and a table mat.

==Culture==
In Japan, it is common for mothers to make bento for their children to take to school. Because making bento can take a while, some mothers will prepare the ingredients the night before, and then assemble and pack everything the following morning before their children go to school. It is often a social expectation of mothers to provide bento for their children, to create both a nutritionally balanced and aesthetically pleasing meal. This activity is expected of the mother and emphasized by society at large, and is common in nursery school institutions.

The traditional bento that is eaten at school or at work is most often prepared by the mother or the wife. However, bento can also be bought at &quot;konbini&quot; (convenience stores) or from street vendors who appear on street corners at lunchtime. For those in a hurry who spend their lunch time aboard Shinkansen bullet trains, &quot;ekiben&quot; are available in train stations.

&quot;Osechi&quot;, an assortment of foods eaten around the Japanese New Year, is typically arranged in a multi-tiered &quot;jūbako&quot; box, similarly to bento.

The slang term &quot;hayaben&quot; (), literally &quot;early bento&quot;, refers to eating a bento before lunch and having another lunch afterward.

==In other countries==

=== China ===
The Chinese word for boxed meals is &quot;héfàn&quot; (盒饭), though &quot;biàndāng&quot; as a re-borrowing from Japanese may also be used. There are numerous regional styles, ranging from Northeastern Chinese boxed meals to the Hong Kong &quot;two dishes with rice&quot; boxed meal. Packed meals would traditionally be carried in boxes known as &quot;shíhé&quot; (食盒, &quot;food box&quot;). &quot;Shíhé&quot; ranged from basic styles to elaborate, multi-tiered designs.

=== Taiwan ===
The &quot;bento&quot; made its way to Taiwan in the first half of the 20th century during the Japanese colonial period and remains popular to the present day. The Japanese name was borrowed into Taiwanese (&quot;piān-tong&quot;) and Hakka (&quot;phien-tông&quot;). A modern Taiwanese bento always includes protein, such as a crispy fried chicken leg or a piece of grilled mackerel and marinated pork chop, as well as side dishes. Taiwan Railway Bento is a well known bento dish manufactured and distributed by the Taiwan Railways Administration at major railway stations and in train cars. It is estimated that, with five million boxed meals sold per year, annual revenue from bento distribution amounts to 370 million NTD (approx. 10 million USD).
=== Korea ===
In Korea, similar packed lunch boxes are called &quot;dosirak&quot;, and they may be homemade or store-bought. They are similar to Chinese and Japanese variations. &quot;Dosirak&quot; is usually made with a few different vegetable and meat side dishes, often including a type of kimchi.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, such packed lunch boxes are often acculturated and localised with cuisines slightly different to Japan. These may include roasted pork (similar to char siu) and soy eggs, as well as fried rice. It has been a common method of meal preparation within Singaporean cuisine as early as the start of the 20th century, intensifying during the Japanese occupation and cultural influences in subsequent decades with Japanese-style bento also being common in the country today.

In 2021, the Singapore Food Tech Event showcased how bento of the future might look like for a sustainable food system.

==Types==


===By ingredients===
* &quot;Hinomaru bentō&quot; (), named and patterned after the flag of Japan (&quot;Hinomaru&quot;), is the name for a &quot;bento&quot; consisting of plain white rice with an &quot;umeboshi&quot; in the centre. Pure &quot;Hinomaru bento&quot; only consists of rice and an &quot;umeboshi&quot; to flavor the rice, without any other side dishes. The metal &quot;bento&quot; boxes once popular in Japan were often corroded by the acid from the &quot;umeboshi&quot;, eventually making a hole in the middle of the lid.
* &quot;Noriben&quot; () is &quot;nori&quot; dipped in soy sauce covering cooked rice.
* &quot;Sake bentō&quot; () is a simple &quot;bento&quot; with a slice of broiled salmon as the main dish.
* &quot;Tori bento&quot; () consists of pieces of chicken cooked in sauce served over rice. It is a popular bento in Gunma Prefecture.

===By style or container===
* &quot;Kamameshi bentō&quot; () are cooked and served in clay pots and sold at train stations in Nagano Prefecture. After eating, the pot becomes a souvenir item.
* &quot;Kyaraben&quot; (キャラ弁) are &quot;bento&quot; with the contents arranged to look like popular characters from anime, manga, or video games.
* &quot;Makunouchi bentō&quot; () is a classic style of bento with rice, &quot;umeboshi&quot;, a slice of broiled salmon, and a rolled egg.
* &quot;Shōkadō bentō&quot; () is a traditional black-lacquered bento box. It inspired IBM&#x27;s ThinkPad design.
* &quot;Wappameshi&quot; () is a meal served in a special round wooden bento-styled container.
* &quot;Shikaeshiben&quot; (仕返し弁) is &quot;revenge&quot; bento made by wives to get back at their husbands. Insults are written in the food, or it is made inedible.

===By origin===
* &quot;Ekiben&quot; () is &quot;bento&quot; sold at railway stations or onboard trains. There are many kinds of &quot;ekiben&quot;; most are inexpensive and filling.
* &quot;Hokaben&quot; () is any kind of &quot;bento&quot; bought at take-out &quot;bento&quot; shops. Freshly cooked hot () rice is usually served with freshly prepared side dishes. The name was popularized after a pioneering take-out &quot;bento&quot; franchise in the field, Hokka Hokka Tei.
* &quot;Shidashi bentō&quot; () is made in a restaurant and delivered during lunch. This &quot;bento&quot; is often eaten at a gathering, such as a funeral or a party. It is usually packed with traditional Japanese foods like tempura, rice and pickled vegetables. A &quot;shidashi bento&quot; packed with European-style food is also available.
* &quot;Soraben&quot; () is &quot;bento&quot; sold at airports.

== Scholarship ==
Many scholars have written about the bento since the late 20th century. The foundation of their approach is based on the idea that food can carry many different meanings.

In the 1970s, Chie Nakane used ekiben as a metaphor for group organization in Japan. By comparing this variant of bento to groups in Japan, she considered how different organizations in Japanese society often include identical components so as not to depend on any other groups for their success. In 1984, Ŏ-ryŏng Yi used bento to present tendencies towards reductionism in Japanese culture; due to it being Japanese food, as it naturally lends itself to being tightly packed. Roland Barthes, on the other hand, used a symbolic approach to describe the lack of a centrepiece in Japanese food. He described the distinct contents of a bento box as a multitude of fragments or ornaments that are combined to beautify each other. Joseph Jay Tobin in 1992 discussed how the meticulous assembly of individual bento boxes has been aided by the reinterpretation of Western goods, practices, and ideas through a process he classified as domestication.

<doc id="147697" wikidata="Q498577" url="?curid=147697" title="Castle in the Sky">
<text>, also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was produced by Isao Takahata, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by Toei. The film stars the voices of Mayumi Tanaka, Keiko Yokozawa, Kotoe Hatsui, and Minori Terada. In the film, orphans Sheeta and Pazu are pursued by government agent Muska, the army, and a group of pirates. They seek Sheeta&#x27;s crystal necklace, the key to accessing Laputa, a legendary flying castle hosting advanced technology.

&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; is the first film to be animated by Studio Ghibli. Its production team included many of Miyazaki&#x27;s longtime collaborators, who would continue to work with the studio for the following three decades. The film was partly inspired by Miyazaki&#x27;s trips to Wales, where he witnessed the aftermath of the 1984–1985 coal miners&#x27; strike. The island of Laputa is used to highlight the theme of environmentalism, exploring the relationships between humanity, nature, and technology, a reflection of Miyazaki&#x27;s ecological philosophy. The young protagonists also provide a unique perspective on the narrative, as a result of Miyazaki&#x27;s desire to portray &quot;the honesty and goodness of children in [his] work.&quot; Many aspects of the film&#x27;s retrofuturistic style – the flying machines in particular – are influenced by nineteenth-century approaches, which has earned the film a reputation in the modern steampunk genre.

The film was released in Japanese theaters on August 2, 1986. It underperformed expectations at the box office, but later achieved commercial success through rereleases, earning over as of 2021. An English dub commissioned by Tokuma Shoten was distributed in North America by Streamline Pictures, and another dub was produced by Disney in 1998, released internationally by Buena Vista in 2003. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who would become a close collaborator of Miyazaki&#x27;s; Hisaishi also composed a reworked soundtrack for the 2003 English dub. The film was generally acclaimed by critics, though the English dubs received mixed reviews. It was well received by audiences, being voted as one of the greatest animated films in polls conducted by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and Oricon. The film also received several notable accolades, including the Ōfuji Noburō Award at the Mainichi Film Awards and the Anime Grand Prix from &quot;Animage&quot;. &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; has since earned &quot;cult status&quot;, and has influenced several notable artists working in multiple media.

== Plot summary ==

An airship carrying Sheeta – an orphan girl abducted by government agent Muska – is attacked by air pirate Dola and her gang, who seek Sheeta&#x27;s crystal necklace. Attempting to escape, Sheeta falls from the airship but is saved by the magic of the now-glowing crystal, which lowers her gently. Pazu, an orphan working as a mechanic in a 19th-century mining town, catches Sheeta and takes her to his home to recover. The next morning, Pazu shows Sheeta a picture his father took of Laputa, a mythical castle on a flying island, which Pazu now seeks. Dola&#x27;s gang and Muska&#x27;s soldiers shortly arrive looking for Sheeta. Pazu and Sheeta are chased through the town and fall into a mine shaft, but are saved again by the crystal. In the tunnels, they meet Uncle Pom, who shows them deposits of the glowing mineral Aetherium, the same material as Sheeta&#x27;s crystal.

Sheeta reveals to Pazu that she has a secret name tying her to Laputa, proving the myth is real. The army captures and detains the two in a fortress. Muska shows Sheeta a dead robot that fell from the sky, bearing the same insignia as on Sheeta&#x27;s crystal, and reveals she is the heiress to the Laputan throne. Muska releases Pazu in exchange for Sheeta guiding the army to Laputa. Returning home, Pazu is captured by Dola&#x27;s gang, who prepare to take the crystal from the fortress. Pazu joins the gang in an attempt to save Sheeta. In the fortress, Sheeta recites an ancient phrase her mother taught her and inadvertently activates the crystal&#x27;s magic, reanimating the robot. The robot protects Sheeta from the army and destroys the fortress with its weapons, but is destroyed in turn by the military airship &quot;Goliath&quot;. In the chaos, Pazu and Dola rescue Sheeta. However, Sheeta&#x27;s crystal is left behind, its magic still active, which allows Muska to use it to navigate to Laputa.

Sheeta, having seen the crystal&#x27;s directions and being able to navigate to Laputa, helps Pazu convince Dola to take them there in exchange for temporarily joining her crew. That night, Sheeta and Pazu keep watch from the crow&#x27;s nest as &quot;Goliath&quot; suddenly attacks Dola&#x27;s airship. Dola detaches the crow&#x27;s nest, which also functions as a glider attached to the ship with a line. Pazu spots a massive storm, wherein he believes his father saw Laputa. Dola attempts to steer into the clouds, but is halted by violent winds. &quot;Goliath&quot; destroys the airship, severing the line connecting it to the glider. Sheeta and Pazu pass through the turbulent lightning storm.

They land safely on Laputa, which they find deserted but for some fauna and one peaceful robot. The castle is in ruins, and a giant tree now grows out of the top of the island. The army arrives and begins looting the castle, having taken Dola&#x27;s gang captive. Muska and his accomplices betray the army, destroying their communication systems, and take Sheeta into the castle&#x27;s core. Pazu frees Dola&#x27;s gang from their bindings and pursues Muska. The castle&#x27;s core is the center of Laputa&#x27;s ancient knowledge and weapons, which Muska activates using Sheeta&#x27;s crystal, revealing to her that he is also a descendant of the Laputan royal line. Demonstrating Laputa&#x27;s power by causing a massive explosion over the ocean and by destroying &quot;Goliath&quot;, Muska plans to use Laputa to destroy humanity, believing them inferior to himself and Sheeta. A horrified Sheeta takes back the crystal and flees, but Muska intercepts her in Laputa&#x27;s throne room.

Pazu infiltrates the throne room and bargains for a brief truce. Sheeta teaches Pazu another ancient phrase, the spell of destruction. The spell sends Muska falling to his death, with the giant tree shielding Sheeta and Pazu from Laputa&#x27;s destruction. The rest of the castle – along with Dola&#x27;s glider – is preserved by the giant tree, and the island rises into space. Sheeta, Pazu, and Dola&#x27;s gang escape, and briefly reunite before flying away.

== Development ==

=== Beginnings of Studio Ghibli ===
Following the commercial success of Miyazaki&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984), Miyazaki was eager to begin work on an old-fashioned adventure film that would be a &quot;pleasure&quot; to watch. His first proposal for an animated feature film was based on a research trip to Yanagawa, tentatively titled &quot;Blue Mountains&quot;. The film was never produced, but it inspired Miyazaki&#x27;s longtime collaborator Isao Takahata to create &quot;The Story of Yanagawa&#x27;s Canals&quot; (1987), a documentary on the environmental effects of industry on the local waterways. As Miyazaki was financing the project in large part through his personal office, &quot;Animage&quot; editor Toshio Suzuki recommended that he direct another film to recover the expense, to which Miyazaki immediately agreed. He quickly developed a concept for the film based on an idea he had in elementary school. In 2014, Suzuki reflected on the events, saying &quot;If Takahata had made his movie on schedule, [&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;] wouldn&#x27;t have been born.&quot;

On June 15, 1985, Miyazaki and Takahata founded Studio Ghibli, with support from Suzuki and his publishing company Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki chose the name himself, referencing both the Arabic term for a warm wind from the Sahara, as well as the Caproni Ca.309 &quot;Ghibli&quot;, an aircraft used by the Italian military during the Second World War. The intent behind the creation of the studio was to &quot;blow a whirlwind&quot; into a stagnating Japanese animation industry by creating original, high-quality feature films. In a speech at the 1995 Annecy International Animation Film Festival, Suzuki said &quot;The idea was to dedicate full energy into each piece of work with sufficient budget and time, never compromising on the quality or content.&quot;

=== Trips to Wales ===

Miyazaki first visited Wales on a research trip in 1985, when &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; was in the early stages of production. He decided to take inspiration from the architecture of the region, and as a result, some of the structures seen in the film resemble Welsh mining towns. Miyazaki also witnessed the aftermath of the coal miners&#x27; strike. Their ultimate failure to preserve the industry left a lasting impact on Miyazaki, who viewed the event as an attack by those in power on the miners&#x27; way of life and the hard-working spirit of the people. His experiences are reflected in several supporting characters in the film, who despite laboring through poverty in the mines, enthusiastically protect the protagonists from multiple aggressors. Susan J. Napier argues that this depiction reveals Miyazaki&#x27;s yearning for a simpler way of life, and a desire to create a story based on optimism. Animation scholar Helen McCarthy writes &quot;It seems that &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; also contains echoes of the struggle of the Welsh people for nationhood and freedom.&quot; Miyazaki would visit Wales once more in 1986, ahead of the release of the film. In 2005, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;I admired those men, I admired the way they battled to save their way of life, just as the coal miners in Japan did. Many people of my generation see the miners as a symbol; a dying breed of fighting men. Now they are gone.&quot;

=== Production ===

Certain special effects from the film use a combination of cel and film techniques. Takahata, who produced the film, insisted that the highest quality be maintained in spite of the production expense. Napier argues that the production of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; &quot;established a new industry standard&quot;. Miyazaki stated in the original project proposal that is a project to bring animation back to its roots.&quot;

Many of Miyazaki&#x27;s old colleagues as well as much of the production crew of &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; were employed once again to work on &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; at Studio Ghibli&#x27;s inception. The film had a reported production budget of , equivalent to in 2023. Several animation studios such as Doga Kobo and Oh! Production provided support for the in-between animation.

== Themes ==

=== Roles of nature and technology ===

&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; contains a strong theme of environmentalism, questioning humanity&#x27;s relationship with nature and the role of technology. McCarthy interprets the giant tree of Laputa as a &quot;metaphor for the reviving and life-giving power of nature.&quot; However, in contrast with the more optimistic conclusions of Miyazaki&#x27;s previous works, Napier notes that the film ends with an &quot;unsettling view&quot; of the castle flying away, suggesting that humanity may not deserve to exist in the natural world. Literary scholar Anthony Lioi interprets Laputa as an ecological utopia that demonstrates the peace that can be established between nature and advanced technology, but also serves as a criticism of modernity when &quot;[the] peace is shattered by human violence.&quot; Lioi notes that this outlook differs from dominant Western ideas, eschewing the extremes of capitalism and industrialism, as well as radical environmentalism and conservationism.

Critics note the philosophical ambiguity of the castle; while Laputa initially appears to be an ideal union of nature and technology, it is later revealed to have a much harsher and more oppressive underside; Napier writes that Laputa is &quot;deeply paradoxical&quot;. Laputa itself takes direct inspiration from the island of the same name from &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726), and film scholar Cristina Cardia claims that, like its namesake, the island is introduced with benign intentions but is ultimately &quot;exploited for perverse ends, in this case war.&quot; Lioi argues that Laputa is used as a means to comment on the ethics of contemporary culture, based on Ildney Cavalcanti&#x27;s observation that such a utopia also &quot;must contain an overtly dystopian element, such that the implicit critique in utopian discourse becomes explicit.&quot; However, he interprets the ultimate destruction of the castle&#x27;s weapons as a demonstration that &quot;violence is not the heart of the city&quot;, and that the dystopic elements of modernity can be healed.

The film also presents an ambiguous view on the usage of technology. The robots from Laputa provide an example of this view, as they are introduced in the film as a violent force capable of extreme destruction. However, when the protagonists next meet a robot, it is entirely peaceful, tending to the gardens and fauna on Laputa. Lioi argues that the robots, as a representation of Laputan technology, are caretakers by default and only become destructive in response to human brutality. McCarthy argues that &quot;this is not a comment on technology but on man&#x27;s inability to use it wisely.&quot; Odell and Le Blanc conclude that &quot;technology... is not necessarily a bad thing, but we must consider how it&#x27;s used and to what extent.&quot; The duality of nature and technology is further explored in Miyazaki&#x27;s later film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; (1997).

=== Innocence of children ===

Like many other films by Miyazaki, &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; features young children as protagonists. Miyazaki values the portrayal of children as good-hearted, confident in their own agency, and resilient and upbeat in response to adversity. He criticized reviewers of his television series &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978) who described the titular character as &quot;too much of a goody-two-shoes&quot;, admitting he was tempted to retort &quot;So you want to see &#x27;bad characters&#x27;, you fool?&quot; Film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc argue that creating a film with younger protagonists generates perspectives that an adult would not perceive, saying &quot;the children in Ghibli&#x27;s films are a liberating force that allows anything to be possible.&quot;

The lack of parental oversight of the protagonists is an element Miyazaki feels to be important in promoting children&#x27;s independence. The protagonists of his films are, like Sheeta and Pazu, often orphaned, or in some way parted from their parents. Miyazaki believes that &quot;one of the essential elements of most classical children&#x27;s literature is that the children in the stories actually fend for themselves.&quot; The presence of parents, in his opinion, would stifle the children&#x27;s autonomy. The limitations that children have in their abilities are also explored in the film; for example, Pazu comes close to forsaking Sheeta and his quest for Laputa. Additionally, unlike Miyazaki&#x27;s previous works, the protagonists do not succeed at convincing the antagonists of their wrongdoing, which offers a more pessimistic view on children&#x27;s ability to educate others.

Napier proposes that Miyazaki&#x27;s insistence on showing the freedom of children in &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; can be credited to the influence of &quot;Panda and the Magic Serpent&quot; (1958). Miyazaki first watched the film at age 17, and it moved him to pursue a career in animation. At a lecture given in 1982 at Waseda University, he said &quot;When I saw &quot;Panda and the Magic Serpent&quot;, it was as if the scales fell from my eyes; I realized that I should depict the honesty and goodness of children in my work.&quot; He considers this a focal point in his endeavors. The theme of innocence is explored further in Miyazaki&#x27;s succeeding film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988).

== Style ==

Miyazaki&#x27;s affinity for flight is repeatedly displayed in &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, a motif that continues throughout the feature films of his career. A variety of fictional flying machines appear across the film, including the island of Laputa, the airships, and the pirates&#x27; ornithopters; Sheeta&#x27;s crystal also allows her to float through the air. However, many of the other flying machines in the film are retrofuturistic, influenced by nineteenth-century stylistic approaches. Additionally, Miyazaki was inspired by the literature of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson when considering the style of the film.

Another stylistic trait that Miyazaki drew from nineteenth-century influences is the depiction of machines that &quot;still possess the inherent warmth of handcrafted things.&quot; Literary scholars Jeff VanderMeer and S. J. Chambers argue that Pazu&#x27;s enthusiasm to build and work with flying machines gives the film&#x27;s airships &quot;a realistic physicality.&quot; Commenting on the mecha anime popular at the time, Miyazaki expressed his hatred for shows that glorified machines without portraying the characters struggling to build or maintain them. Animation scholar Thomas Lamarre argues that the film provides an &quot;alternative to our received technologies&quot; and thus a critique of more contemporary technologies and society&#x27;s perception of them.

Boyes felt that many of these elements subsequently influenced the steampunk genre. Napier writes that Verne&#x27;s impact on the film&#x27;s style was instrumental in evoking imagined nostalgia for a time when &quot;machines were still fun&quot;, in Miyazaki&#x27;s words. While the other machines are presented as joyful, Laputa&#x27;s underside is used exclusively as an instrument of destruction. Miyazaki stated that, as a child, he was attracted to the design and power of military planes, a view that has since been replaced with revulsion for the indiscriminate acts of violence that the machines have been used for. Miyazaki further explores the beauty of flying machines as well as their innate destructive potential in his later film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013).

== Release ==

The film was released in Japan on August 2, 1986, by Toei. At the Japanese box office, the film sold about 775,000 tickets, somewhat lower than the performance of &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. Miyazaki and Suzuki expressed their disappointment with the film&#x27;s box office figures. The film was promoted with a tie-in fruit soda brand which animation scholar Rayna Denison described as an &quot;economic failure&quot;.

The film later earned a significant additional amount through rereleases; as of 2021, it has grossed approximately in box office, home video, and soundtrack sales. In the United Kingdom, it was 2019&#x27;s eighth-best-selling foreign language film on home video, below five other Studio Ghibli films. The film has sold approximately 1.1million tickets in Europe as of 2023. Multiple international theatrical rescreenings between 2003 and 2023 have earned the film approximately .

=== English dubs ===

The first English dub of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; was produced by an unknown party, and was first screened in Hong Kong on June 26, 1987. It was licensed between 1989 and 1991 by the then-new Streamline Pictures for distribution in North American markets. An edited version of this dub briefly aired on UK television. In addition to distribution rights, Streamline would go on to dub two other Studio Ghibli films in-house: &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1989).

The English dub produced by Disney was recorded in 1998 and planned for release on video in 1999, but the release was postponed after &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; did not perform well in North American theaters. The film premiered at the New York International Children&#x27;s Film Festival on February 2, 2000. It was released on home video in North America on April 15, 2003, alongside a rerelease of &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; and &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001). Due to the possible confusion of the title with the Spanish phrase – literally &#x27;the whore&#x27; – the film was released as simply &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; in North America. The film was released by Buena Vista on Blu-ray in North America on May 22, 2012. Shout! Factory and GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 31, 2017. Both the original Japanese version and the 2003 English dub were made available for streaming when the rights to Studio Ghibli&#x27;s filmography were acquired by Netflix in 2020.

== Music ==

As with &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. Miyazaki and Hisaishi went on to become close collaborators, and Hisaishi has since provided the music for all of Miyazaki&#x27;s feature films. Three months before the film&#x27;s theatrical release, the image album – a collection of demos and musical sketches that serve as a precursor to the finished score – was published by Tokuma on compact disc. A third version of the soundtrack, rearranged for full symphony orchestra and recorded by the Tokyo City Philharmonic, released in 1987 on compact disc.

For the English dub produced by Disney in 1998, Hisaishi was called upon to rewrite the soundtrack to be more suitable for audiences in America. The new soundtrack was recorded by the Seattle Symphony and featured in the 2003 English dub released by Buena Vista. Hisaishi was advised by Disney staff that non-Japanese audiences prefer comparatively more music in films. As a result, the American soundtrack is much longer, while the original Japanese version featured just an hour of music for a film exceeding two hours in length. Though Hisaishi felt that American film scores used an overly simplistic compositional approach, he commented &quot;But when I redid the music of &quot;Laputa&quot; this way, I learned a lot.&quot;

The credits sequence of the film features an original vocal song titled &quot;Carrying You&quot; performed by Azumi Inoue, with music by Hisaishi and lyrics by Miyazaki. The song was released in 1988 as a compact disc single, featuring an additional chorus version performed by the Suginami Children&#x27;s Choir.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===

&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; has been generally acclaimed by film critics in the years since its release. In 2001, &quot;Animage&quot; ranked &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; 44th in their list of top 100 anime. Animation critic and writer Raz Greenberg calls &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; &quot;one of the greatest adventure films ever made&quot;, and critic Manabu Murase names it &quot;quite possibly the most entertaining anime that Miyazaki ever made&quot;. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rate of 96% from 28 critics, with an average rating of 7.6 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critic consensus reads, &quot;With a storytelling palette as rich and brilliant as its animation, &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; thrillingly encapsulates Studio Ghibli&#x27;s unique strengths.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on seven critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

While multiple reviewers felt that the film&#x27;s two-hour runtime would turn audiences away, &quot;The New York Times&quot; Caryn James commenting that it is &quot;liable to strain patiences of adults and the attention spans of children&quot;, others argued that the film had the appeal to keep audiences entertained. &quot;IGN&quot; Jeremy Conrad felt the characters are &quot;so likable that you never get bored, you always want to see what adventure is next for them&quot;. Reviewers were split over the 1987 English dub, with the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; Terry Lawson calling it &quot;the film&#x27;s weakest element&quot;, while &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; David Lyman felt the dubbing into English had been done &quot;superbly&quot;. The 2003 dub similarly received mixed reviews, with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Tasha Robinson calling Disney&#x27;s recordings &quot;almost comically bland&quot;, and Conrad expressing his appreciation for Anna Paquin as Sheeta and Mark Hamill&#x27;s performance as Muska. Many critics also praised the animation, the &quot;Asheville Times&quot; Tom Sabulis considering it &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; Steven Rea naming it &quot;masterful&quot;. However, some felt the motions lacked fluidity, with Lyman describing it as &quot;stiff-limbed&quot;.

Most reviewers highlighted the imaginative capacity that Miyazaki displays in the film. &quot;Slant&quot; Chuck Bowen noted the subtle details included in the film, which he felt lends it &quot;texture and originality&quot;. A review in the &quot;Weekly Asahi&quot; highlighted the film&#x27;s dynamism, favorably comparing its flying sequences with &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953). Several reviewers praised the use of color, which made the film &quot;a joy to watch&quot; according to James. A reviewer for &quot;City Road&quot; noted that the film could present themes that were critical of modern society while still maintaining a &quot;warm and caring&quot; view of humanity. Several reviewers noted the film&#x27;s strong ecological theme, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Richard Harrington appreciating the &quot;moral duality&quot; of Laputa&#x27;s technology, and the &quot;Asahi Journal&quot; Yomota Inuhiko praising the depiction of Laputa as a utopia which gradually developed dystopic elements. Critics and scholars also noted the film&#x27;s connections to Miyazaki&#x27;s previous works; Greenberg felt that the film is &quot;deeply rooted within Miyazaki&#x27;s filmography of the two decades that preceded it&quot;, and Denison called it a &quot;compendium of Miyazaki&#x27;s previous interests as an animator&quot;.

=== Audience response ===

In a 2006 poll by Japan&#x27;s Agency for Cultural Affairs conducted at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival, the film was rated the third-best animation of all time, after &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; (1995). In a 2008 audience poll conducted by Oricon in Japan, &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; was voted the best animation of all time.

=== Accolades ===

== Legacy ==

&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; is considered by some scholars and writers to be an important work in the modern steampunk and dieselpunk styles. Along with &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, Philip Boyes of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; considers &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; a major contributor to the genres&#x27; popularity in Japan, introducing audiences to stylistic features such as airships which were otherwise mostly prevalent in Europe. According to McCarthy, &quot;its mix of epic action-adventure and techno-ecological theme has since earned [&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;] cult status.&quot;

Several notable artists in the anime and manga industries have cited &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; as a major influence on their works. &quot;&quot; (1990), by &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; director Hideaki Anno, is noted for its similarities in premise with &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. Anno had previously worked with Miyazaki on the production of &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, and has stated that &quot;Nadia&quot; was based in part on one of Miyazaki&#x27;s concepts. &quot;D.Gray-man&quot; (2004) author Katsura Hoshino was moved to pursue a career in animation after watching the film, ultimately becoming a manga artist. &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (1995) director Mamoru Oshii and &quot;Your Name&quot; (2016) director Makoto Shinkai named &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; among their favorite animations. Additionally, VanderMeer and Chambers argue that &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; forms the stylistic foundation for several of Miyazaki&#x27;s later films, including &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; (1992) and &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004).

John Lasseter, former chief creative officer at Pixar and Disney Animation, often cited Miyazaki and his works to be his &quot;greatest inspiration&quot;. When asked about some of his favorite films, Lasseter expressed his admiration for &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. Lasseter has worked with Miyazaki on the English dubs of several of his films, and notes this as an influence on his work with his colleagues. At a speech delivered at the 2014 Tokyo International Film Festival, Lasseter said &quot;Whenever we get stuck at Pixar or Disney, I put on a Miyazaki film sequence or two, just to get us inspired again.&quot; Napier argues that the protagonist of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), a robot left to care for a world abandoned by humans, &quot;may have its roots in &quot;Laputa&quot; nurturing robot.&quot; The creators of &quot;The Wild Robot&quot;(2024) also cited the film as an influence on their work.

&quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; has influenced numerous video games, particularly in Japan, with its success leading to a wave of steampunk video games. Game designer Hironobu Sakaguchi cited &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; as an inspiration behind his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series, particularly citing it as an influence on the series&#x27; airships. According to Boyes, &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; also influenced the airships in the &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Civilization&quot; franchises. The Iron Golem from &quot;Minecraft&quot; (2011) takes inspiration from the robots in the film. Several games from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series are noted to have been influenced by &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, particularly &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; (2023), which features a flying castle and several thematic parallels with the film.

On December 9, 2011, during an airing of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; on Japanese television, fans posting to Twitter set a new record for the platform by causing a peak of 25,088 tweets per second. The record was later surpassed during another airing on August 2, 2013, with a figure of 143,199 per second.

<text>Laundry is the washing of clothing and other textiles, and, more broadly, their drying and ironing as well. Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship.

Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized solutions to laundry work, notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer. Laundry, like cooking and child care, is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.

The word &quot;laundry&quot; may refer to the clothing itself, or to the place where the cleaning happens. An individual home may have a laundry room; a utility room includes, but is not restricted to, the function of washing clothes. An apartment building or student hall of residence may have a shared laundry facility such as a &quot;tvättstuga&quot;. A stand-alone business is referred to as a self-service laundry (launderette in British English or laundromat in North American English).

==History==
=== Watercourses ===
Laundry was first done in watercourses, letting the water carry away the materials which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done this way in the rural regions of poor countries. Agitation helps remove the dirt, so the laundry was rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. One name for this surface is a beetling-stone, related to beetling, a technique in the production of linen; one name for a wooden substitute is a battling-block. The dirt was beaten out with a wooden implement known as a washing paddle, battling stick, bat, beetle or club. Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply were gradually replaced by portable rub boards, eventually factory-made corrugated glass or metal washboards.

Once clean, the clothes were wrung out — twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clothes lines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass, bushes, or trees.

=== Washhouses ===

Before the advent of the washing machine, laundry was often done in a communal setting.

Villages across Europe that could afford it built a wash-house, sometimes known by the French name of &quot;lavoir&quot;. Water was channelled from a stream or spring and fed into a building, possibly just a roof with no walls. This wash-house usually contained two basins – one for washing and the other for rinsing – through which the water was constantly flowing, as well as a stone lip inclined towards the water against which the wet laundry could be beaten. Such facilities were more comfortable and convenient than washing in a watercourse. Some lavoirs had the wash-basins at waist height, although others remained on the ground. The launderers were protected to some extent from rain, and their travel was reduced, as the facilities were usually at hand in the village or at the edge of a town. These facilities were public and available to all families, and usually used by the entire village. Many of these village wash-houses are still standing, historic structures with no obvious modern purpose.

The job of doing the laundry was reserved for women, who washed all their family&#x27;s laundry. Washerwomen (laundresses) took in the laundry of others, charging by the piece. As such, wash-houses were an obligatory stop in many women&#x27;s weekly lives and became a sort of institution or meeting place. It was a women-only space where they could discuss issues or simply chat (cf the concept of the village pump). Indeed, this tradition is reflected in the Catalan idiom &quot;fer safareig&quot; (literally, &quot;to do the laundry&quot;), which means to gossip.

European cities also had public wash-houses. The city authorities wanted to give the poorer population, who would otherwise not have access to laundry facilities, the opportunity to wash their clothes. Sometimes these facilities were combined with public baths, see for example Baths and wash houses in Britain. The aim was to foster hygiene and thus reduce outbreaks of epidemics.

Sometimes large metal cauldrons (a &quot;wash copper&quot;, even when not made of that metal), were filled with fresh water and heated over a fire, as hot or boiling water is more effective than cold in removing dirt. A posser could be used to agitate clothes in a tub. A related implement called a washing dolly is &quot;a wooden stick or mallet with an attached cluster of legs or pegs&quot; that moves the cloth through the water.

=== Washing machines and other devices ===


The Industrial Revolution completely transformed laundry technology. Christina Hardyment, in her history from the Great Exhibition of 1851, argues that it was the development of domestic machinery that led to women&#x27;s liberation.

The mangle (or &quot;wringer&quot; in American English) was developed in the 19th century — two long rollers in a frame and a crank to revolve them. A laundry-worker took sopping wet clothing and cranked it through the mangle, compressing the cloth and expelling the excess water. The mangle was much quicker than hand twisting. It was a variation on the box mangle used primarily for pressing and smoothing cloth.

Meanwhile, 19th-century inventors further mechanized the laundry process with various hand-operated washing machines to replace tedious hand rubbing against a washboard. Most involved turning a handle to move paddles inside a tub. Then some early-20th-century machines used an electrically powered agitator. Many of these washing machines were simply a tub on legs, with a hand-operated mangle on top. Later the mangle too was electrically powered, then replaced by a perforated double tub, which spun out the excess water in a spin cycle.

Laundry drying was also mechanized, with clothes dryers. Dryers were also spinning perforated tubs, but they blew heated air rather than water.

=== Chinese laundries in North America ===

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Chinese immigrants to the United States and to Canada were well represented as laundry workers. Discrimination, lack of English-language skills, and lack of capital kept Chinese immigrants out of most desirable careers. Around 1900, one in four ethnic Chinese men in the U.S. worked in a laundry, typically working 10 to 16 hours a day.

Chinese people in New York City were running an estimated 3,550 laundries at the beginning of the Great Depression. In 1933, the city&#x27;s Board of Aldermen passed a law clearly intended to drive the Chinese out of the business. Among other things, it limited ownership of laundries to U.S. citizens. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association tried fruitlessly to fend this off, resulting in the formation of the openly leftist Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance (CHLA), which successfully challenged this provision of the law, allowing Chinese laundry workers to preserve their livelihoods. The CHLA went on to function as a more general civil rights group; its numbers declined strongly after it was targeted by the FBI during the Second Red Scare (1947–1957).

===South Africa===
From 1850 to 1910, Zulu men took on the task of laundering the clothes of Europeans, both Boers and British. &quot;Laundering recalled the specialist craft of hide-dressing in which Zulu males engaged as izinyanga, a prestige occupation that paid handsomely.&quot; They created a guild structure, similar to a union, to guard their conditions and wages, evolving into &quot;one, if not indeed the most, powerful group of African work-men in nineteenth-century Natal&quot;.

===India===
In India, laundry was traditionally done by men. A washerman was called a &quot;dhobiwallah&quot;, and &quot;dhobi&quot; became the name of their caste group.

A laundry-place is generally called a &quot;dhobi ghat&quot;; this has given rise to place names where they work or worked, including Mahalaxmi Dhobi Ghat in Mumbai, Dhoby Ghaut in Singapore and Dhobi Ghaut in Penang, Malaysia.

=== Philippines ===

Until the early 1980s, when washing machines became more affordable in the country, much of the laundry work in the Philippines was done manually, and this role was generally assigned to women. A professional laundrywoman was called a &quot;labandera.&quot;

===Ancient Rome===
The workers in ancient Rome who cleaned the cloth were called &quot;fullones&quot;, singular &quot;fullo&quot; (cf fulling, a process in wool-making, and Fuller&#x27;s earth, used to clean). Clothes were treated in small tubs standing in niches surrounded by low walls, known as treading or fulling stalls. The tub was filled with water and a mixture of alkaline chemicals (sometimes including urine). The fuller stood in the tub and trampled the cloth, a technique known elsewhere as posting. The aim of this treatment was to apply the chemical agents to the cloth so that they could do their work, the resolving of greases and fats. These stalls are so typical of these workshops that they are used to identify &quot;fullonicae&quot; in the archaeological remains.

==Laundry processes==

Laundry processes include washing (usually with water containing detergents or other chemicals), agitation, rinsing, drying, pressing (ironing), and folding. The washing will sometimes be done at a temperature above room temperature to increase the activities of any chemicals used and the solubility of stains, and high temperatures kill micro-organisms that may be present on the fabric. However, it is advised that cotton be washed at a cooler temperature to prevent shrinking. Many professional laundry services are present in the market which offers at different price range.

Agitation helps remove dirt which is usually mobilised by surfactants from between fibres, however, due to the small size of the pores in fibres, the &#x27;stagnant core&#x27; of the fibres themselves see virtually no flow. The fibres are nevertheless rapidly cleaned by diffusiophoresis carrying dirt out into the clean water during the rinsing process.

===Chemicals===
Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in soaproot or yucca-root used by Native American tribes, or the ash lye (usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) once widely used for soaking laundry in Europe. Soap, a compound made from lye and fat, is an ancient and common laundry aid. Modern washing machines typically use synthetic powdered or liquid laundry detergent in place of more traditional soap.

===Cleaning or dry cleaning===
Dry cleaning refers to any process which uses a chemical solvent other than water. The solvent used is typically tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), which the industry calls &quot;perc&quot;. It is used to clean delicate fabrics that cannot withstand the rough and tumble of a washing machine and clothes dryer; it can also obviate labor-intensive hand washing.

== Shared laundry rooms ==

In some parts of the world, including North America, apartment buildings and dormitories often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a coin slot.

In other parts of the world, including Europe, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial self-service laundry (laundromat, laundrette) or a laundry shop, such as 5àsec.

== Right to dry movement==
Some American communities forbid their residents from drying clothes outside, and citizens protesting this have created a &quot;right to dry&quot; movement. Many homeowners&#x27; associations and other communities in the United States prohibit residents from using a clothesline outdoors, or limit such use to locations that are not visible from the street or to certain times of day. Other communities, however, expressly prohibit rules that prevent the use of clotheslines. Some organizations have been campaigning against legislation which has outlawed line-drying of clothing in public places, especially given the increased greenhouse gas emissions produced by some types of electrical power generation needed to power electric clothes dryers, since driers can constitute a considerable fraction of a home&#x27;s total energy usage.

Florida (&quot;the Sunshine State&quot;) is the only state to expressly guarantee a right to dry, although Utah and Hawaii have passed solar rights legislation. A Florida law explicitly states: &quot;No deed restrictions, covenants, or similar binding agreements running with the land shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting solar collectors, clotheslines, or other energy devices based on renewable resources from being installed on buildings erected on the lots or parcels covered by the deed restrictions, covenants, or binding agreements.&quot; No other state has such clearcut legislation. Vermont considered a &quot;Right to Dry&quot; bill in 1999, but it was defeated in the Senate Natural Resources &amp; Energy Committee. The language has been included in a 2007 voluntary energy conservation bill, introduced by Senator Dick McCormack. Legislation making it possible for thousands of American families to start using clotheslines in communities where they were formerly banned was passed in Colorado in 2008. In 2009, clothesline legislation was debated in the states of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Oregon, Virginia, and Vermont.

Similar measures have been introduced in Canada - in particular, the province of Ontario.

== Common problems ==
Novice users of modern laundry machines sometimes experience accidental shrinkage of garments, especially when applying heat. For wool garments, this is due to scales on the fibers, which heat and agitation cause to stick together. Other fabrics (like cotton) have their fibers stretched by mechanical force during production, and can shrink slightly when heated (though to a lesser degree than wool). Some clothes are &quot;pre-shrunk&quot; to avoid this problem.

Another common problem is color bleeding from dyed articles to white or pale-colored ones. Many laundry guides suggest washing whites separately from colored items. Sometimes only similar colors are washed together to avoid this problem, which is lessened by cold water and repeated washings. Sometimes this blending of colors is seen as a selling point, as with madras cloth.

Laundry symbols are included on many clothes to help consumers avoid these problems.

Synthetic fibers in laundry can also contribute to microplastic pollution.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;laundry&quot; comes from Middle English lavendrye, laundry, from Old French &quot;lavanderie&quot;, from lavandier.

==In culture==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Princess Nausicaa and her handmaidens are washing laundry by the shore when they see and rescue the ship-wrecked Ulysses.

<text>Japanese festivals, or , are traditional festive occasions often celebrated with dance and music in Japan. The origin of the word &quot;matsuri&quot; is related to the ; there are theories that the word &quot;matsuri&quot; is derived from meaning &quot;to wait (for the &quot;kami&quot; to descend)&quot;, meaning &quot;to make offerings to the &quot;kami&quot;&quot;, and meaning &quot;to obey the &quot;kami&quot;&quot;. The theory that it is derived from &quot;matsurau&quot; is the most popular.

It is estimated that there are between 100,000 and 300,000 festivals across Japan, generating an annual economic impact of 530 billion yen as of 2019. As of 2024, 33 of these festivals have been registered as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists as &quot;Yama, Hoko, Yatai, float festivals in Japan&quot;. Various folk dances, costume processions, &quot;kagura&quot;, &quot;dengaku&quot;, &quot;bugaku&quot;, and &quot;noh&quot; performed at festivals are also registered as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. For example, 41 folk dances including &quot;bon odori&quot; from various regions of Japan are registered as &quot;&quot;Furyu-odori&quot; and 10 costume processions including &quot;namahage&quot; are registered as &quot;Raihō-shin&quot;&quot;.

Japanese festivals reflect the unique religious beliefs of the Japanese people, who worship and violent &quot;kami&quot;, based on the background of Japan&#x27;s frequent natural disasters. Based on the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism, Japanese people worship not only the spirits that inhabit all things and the souls of their ancestors, but also terrifying &quot;onryō&quot; and violent &quot;kami&quot; that protect people from epidemics and natural disasters. For example, Gion Matsuri, Tenjin Matsuri, and Kanda Matsuri, which are considered the three major festivals in Japan, worship the &quot;onryō&quot; of Gozu Tennō, Sugawara no Michizane, and Taira no Masakado, respectively, and pray for good health and protection from natural disasters. Since these festivals are held in urban areas, each attracts hundreds of thousands to over a million spectators each year. On the other hand, Gion Matsuri, Aoi Matsuri, and Jidai Matsuri are considered the three major festivals in Kyoto. Gion Matsuri attracts huge crowds to see the procession of huge and , while Aoi Matsuri and Jidai Matsuri attract crowds to see the procession of people dressed in period costumes.

The Aomori Nebuta Matsuri and the Tokushima Awa Odori are large, historic festivals in local cities that attract more than 2 million visitors each year, and more than 1 million visitors each year, respectively. According to a 2022 survey, they ranked first and second, respectively, in recognition in Japan, with the Gion Matsuri in third place.

There are also many Japanese festivals in which the &quot;kami&quot; are prayed to for a good harvest of rice and other crops. In agricultural festivals, different ceremonies are held in each of the four seasons, and festivals are classified into different types, such as and , according to their significance. In general, festivals held in the spring pray for a good harvest for the year, festivals held in the summer pray for rice and crops to be free from pests and storm damage, festivals held in the fall offer gratitude for the harvest, and festivals held in the winter pray for a good harvest in the new year.

Many secular and modern festivals are also held, with the Sapporo Snow Festival attracting 2.73 million visitors in 2019.

== Festivals (&quot;matsuri&quot;) related to agriculture ==
There are many Japanese festivals in which the &quot;kami&quot; are prayed to for a good harvest of rice and other crops. These festivals are divided into various types according to their significance and ritual practices, the most representative of which are as follows. Typical spring festival practices are and . In &quot;minakuchi-sai&quot;, on the day of planting, soil is piled at the water intake of the rice field , seasonal flowers and twigs are placed, and sake and baked rice are offered to the mountain &quot;kami&quot;. During &quot;otaue-matsuri&quot;, young women called () enter the rice field to plant rice seedlings and pray for a good harvest. Typical summer festival practices are and . In &quot;mushi okuri&quot;, torches are lit at night and straw dolls with pests tied to them are floated or thrown into the river to pray for the repulsion of pests, while in &quot;amagoi&quot;, dances are dedicated to &quot;kami&quot; and fires are lit to pray for rain. The typical fall festival practices are and . In &quot;niiname-sai&quot;, new grains are offered to the &quot;kami&quot; at the imperial court and at Shinto shrines throughout Japan to thank them for the harvest, and in &quot;aki-matsuri&quot;, farmers in rural villages thank the &quot;kami&quot; of the rice fields and send the &quot;kami&quot; back to the mountains. The typical winter festival practices are and . In &quot;sagicho&quot; or &quot;dondoyaki&quot;, and other New Year&#x27;s decorations are burned and &quot;mochi&quot; are roasted and eaten over the flames, and in &quot;tasaburi&quot;, farm work is simulated in the Shinto shrine to pray for the next year&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot; harvest.

==Local festivals (&quot;matsuri&quot;)==
 is the Japanese word for a festival or holiday. In Japan, festivals are usually sponsored by a local shrine or temple, though they can be secular.

Festivals are often based around one event, with food stalls, entertainment, and carnival games to keep people entertained. Some are based around temples or shrines, others hanabi (fireworks), and still others around contests where the participants sport loin cloths (see: Hadaka Matsuri).

There are no specific matsuri days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon. Almost every locale has at least one matsuri in late summer/early autumn, usually related to the paddy harvest.

Notable matsuri often feature processions which may include elaborate floats. Preparation for these processions is usually organized at the level of neighborhoods, or machi. Prior to these, the local kami may be ritually installed in mikoshi and paraded through the streets.

One can always find in the vicinity of a matsuri booths selling souvenirs and food such as takoyaki, and games, such as Goldfish scooping. Karaoke contests, sumo matches, and other forms of entertainment are often organized in conjunction with matsuri. If the festival is next to a lake, renting a boat is also an attraction.

Favorite elements of the most popular matsuri, such as the Nada no Kenka Matsuri of Himeji or the Neputa Matsuri of Hirosaki, are often broadcast on television for the entire nation to enjoy.

===List of famous &quot;matsuri&quot;===

Information: New Year observances are the most elaborate of Japan&#x27;s annual events. Before the New Year, homes are cleaned, debts are paid off, and osechi (food in lacquered trays for the New Year) is prepared or bought. Osechi foods are traditional foods which are chosen for their lucky colors, shapes, or lucky-sounding names in hopes of obtaining good luck in various areas of life during the new year. Homes are decorated and the holidays are celebrated by family gatherings, visits to temples or shrines, and formal calls on relatives and friends. The first day of the year (ganjitsu) is usually spent with members of the family.

People try to stay awake and eat toshikoshi soba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor performs the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers for the well-being of the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor&#x27;s birthday (February 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year&#x27;s are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year&#x27;s greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed one on top of the other, with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).

A later New Year&#x27;s celebration, Koshōgatsu, literally means &quot;Small New Year&quot; and starts with the first full moon of the year (around January 15). The main events of Koshōgatsu are rites and practices praying for a bountiful harvest.

Some main things people do during this event are games, folk songs, folk dance, flower displays, rides, parades, concerts, kimono shows, booths with food and other things, beauty pageant, and religious ceremonies.

Lion dancing is also a major tradition practiced during Buddha&#x27;s Birthday and has become associated with the festival in Japan.
Date: July 7 / August 5–8 (Sendai)

Other Names: The Star Festival

It was named Tanabata after a weaving maiden from a Japanese legend, named Orihime who was believed to make clothes for the gods. People often write wishes and romantic aspirations on long, narrow strips of colored paper and hang them on bamboo branches along with other small ornaments.
Date: July 19

Small paper lanterns containing a burning flame are either set afloat to a river, lake or sea or they are let go and float away into the night.

The welcoming fire (&quot;mukaebi&quot;) built on the 13th and the send-off fire (&quot;okuribi&quot;) built on the 15th and 16th are intended to guide the ancestor&#x27;s spirits back to their permanent dwelling place.

Date: November 15

Information: Three- and seven-year-old girls and five-year-old boys are taken to the local shrine to pray for their safe and healthy future. This festival started because of the belief that children of certain ages were especially prone to bad luck and hence in need of divine protection. Children are usually dressed in traditional clothing for the occasion and after visiting the shrine many people buy &quot;chitose-ame&quot; (&quot;thousand-year candy&quot;) sold at the shrine.

===Preparation for the New Year and Year-end fair===
Date: late December

Other Names: , 

Information: Preparations for seeing in the new year were originally undertaken to greet the toshigami, or deity of the incoming year. These begin on December 13, when the house was given a thorough cleaning; the date is usually nearer the end of the month now. The house is then decorated in the traditional fashion: A sacred rope of straw (shimenawa) with dangling white paper strips (shide) is hung over the front door to prevent evil spirits from entering and to show the presence of the toshigami. It is also customary to place kadomatsu, an arrangement of tree sprigs, beside the entrance way. A special altar, known as toshidana (&quot;year shelf&quot;), is piled high with kagamimochi (flat, round rice cakes), sake (rice wine), persimmons, and other foods in honor of the toshigami. A fair is traditionally held in late December at shrines, temples or in local neighborhoods. This is in preparation for the new year holidays. Decorations and sundry goods are sold at the fair. Originally these year-end fairs provided opportunities for farmers, fisherfolk and mountain dwellers to exchange goods and buy clothes and other necessities for the coming year.
Date: December 31 (New Year&#x27;s Eve)

Information: People do the general house cleaning (Ōsōji) to welcome coming year and not to keep having impure influences. Many people visit Buddhist temples to hear the temple bells rung 108 times at midnight (joya no kane). This is to announce the passing of the old year and the coming of the new. The reason they are rung 108 times is because of the Buddhist belief that human beings are plagued by 108 earthly desires or passions (bonnō). With each ring one desire is dispelled. It is also a custom to eat toshikoshi soba in the hope that one&#x27;s family fortunes will extend like the long noodles.

<text>Psychedelic trance, psytrance, or psy is a subgenre of trance music characterized by arrangements of rhythms and layered melodies created by high tempo riffs. The genre offers variety in terms of mood, tempo, and style. Some examples include full on, darkpsy, forest, minimal (Zenonesque), hitech psy, progressive, suomi, psy-chill, psycore (fusion of psychedelic trance and hardcore), psybient (fusion of psychedelic trance and ambient), psybreaks, or &quot;adapted&quot; tracks from other music genres. Goa trance preceded psytrance; when digital media became more commonly used, psytrance evolved. Goa continues to develop alongside the other genres.

==History==
===Origins===

The first hippies who arrived in Goa, India (a former Portuguese colony) in the mid-1960s were drawn there for many reasons, including the beaches, the low cost of living, the friendly locals, the Indian religious and spiritual practices and the readily available Indian cannabis, which, until the mid-1970s, was legal. During the 1970s, the first Goa DJs were generally playing psychedelic rock bands such as the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd and The Doors. In 1979, the beginnings of electronic dance music could occasionally be heard in Goa in the form of tracks by artists such as Kraftwerk, but it was not until 1983 that DJs Laurent and Fred Disko, closely followed by Goa Gil, began switching the Goa style over to electro-industrial/EBM which was now flooding out of Europe from artists such as Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb as well as Eurobeat.

The tracks were remixed, removing the lyrics, looping the melodies and beats and generally manipulating the sounds in all manner of ways before the tracks were finally presented to the dancers as custom Goa-style mixes.
By 1990–91, Goa was beginning to attract attention and had become a popular destination for partying. As the scene grew bigger, Goa-style parties spread like a diaspora all over the world from 1993. Parties like Pangaea and Megatripolis in the UK helped spawn a multitude of labels in various countries (U.K., Australia, Japan, Germany and Israel) to promote psychedelic electronic music that reflected the ethos of Goa parties, Goa music, and Goa-specific artists, producers, and DJs. Goa Trance as commercial scene began gaining global traction in 1994. The golden age of the first wave of Goa psy trance as a generally agreed upon genre was between 1994 and 1997.

===Development===

By 1992, the Goa trance scene had a pulse of its own, though the term &quot;Goa trance&quot; did not become the characterization of the genre until around 1994. The Goa trance sound, which, by the late 1990s, was being used interchangeably with the term psychedelic trance, retained its popularity at outdoor raves and festivals, but also permanent psytrance nightclubs emerged such as Natraj Temple in Munich. New artists were appearing from all over the world and it was in this year that the first Goa trance festivals began, including the Gaia Festival in France and the still-running VooV festival in Germany.

In 1993, the first 100% Goa trance album was released, &quot;Project II Trance&quot;, featuring tracks by Man With No Name and Hallucinogen, to name two. Goa trance enjoyed its commercial peak between 1996 and 1997 with media attention and some recognized names in the DJ scene joining the movement. This hype did not last long and once the attention had died down, so did the music sales, resulting in the failure of record labels, promotion networks and also some artists. This &quot;commercial death of Goa trance&quot; was marked musically by Matsuri Productions in 1997 with the release of the compilation &quot;Let it RIP&quot;. On the back sleeve of the album at the bottom of the notes, “R.I.P : Mother Theresa, Princess Diana, William Burroughs &amp; Goa Trance” was written.

While the psytrance genre began in the Goa trance scene, it went on to proliferate globally. Its impact was felt in western Europe, Middle East, North America, Australia, Japan and South Africa. Psytrance is linked to other music genres such as big beat, electroclash, grime and 2-step. The genre evolved in conjunction with the multimedia psychedelic arts scene.

==Characteristics==


Psychedelic trance has a distinctive, energetic sound that tends to be faster than other forms of trance or techno music with tempos generally ranging from 125 to 150 BPM. It uses a very distinctive bass beat that pounds constantly throughout the song and overlays the bass with varying rhythms drawn from funk, techno, dance, acid house, eurodance and trance using drums and other instruments. The different leads, rhythms and beats generally change every eight bars. Layering is used to create effect in psychedelic trance, with new musical ideas being added at regular intervals, often every four to eight bars. New layers will continue to be added until a climax is reached, and then the song will break down and start a new rhythmic pattern over the constant bass line. Psychedelic trance tracks tend to be six to ten minutes long. This includes a developed and atmospheric introduction, and a breakdown in the middle of the track of around 30 seconds to over a minute.

==Subgenres==
===Dark psytrance===
Dark psytrance (also known as dark psychedelic trance, dark psy, darkpsy or dark trance) is the heavier end of the psychedelic trance spectrum with tempos starting from around 150 bpm, but may often go faster. Characterized by having obscure, deep, and more eschatological background that leads into profound meditation of death, night, and transcendence, often with dismal sounds and heavy basslines. The subgenre often samples horror films in contrast to the science fiction film samples more regularly used in &quot;normal&quot; psytrance. Dark psytrance emerged as a recognizable genre after 2003 in Germany and Russia, with Brazilian, German and Russian artists dominating the scene. The German artist Xenomorph (Mark Petrick) is credited as an artist who first brought dark occult aesthetic into psytrance, with his album &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; released in 1998 being a major influence on the subgenre; X-Dream&#x27;s &quot;Radio&quot; is another 1998 album cited as an early influence.

===Full-on===
Full-on is a psychedelic trance style which has high energy for peak moments, often having melodic, energetic, and crisp basslines with a fast tempo (usually 140–148 bpm). There are some related styles that are derived from this style and are distinguished as different varieties of Full-On: twilight and night full-on (or dark full-on), having bolder and lower notes in their basslines, morning (light and kind of happy), and uplifting. Artists working in the genre include Ajja, Burn in Noise, Dickster, Tristan and mitanef.

===Suomisaundi===

Suomisaundi () is a variety originating in Finland during the mid-1990s.

==Derivations==
===Psybient===
&quot;Psybient&quot;, also known as &quot;psychedelic ambient&quot; or &quot;ambient psy&quot;, is a genre of electronic music that contains elements of ambient, downtempo, psychedelic trance, dub, world music, new wave, ethereal wave, and IDM. The genre is also known for different alternative names used in different time periods. The earliest developments of the genre within ambient house and chill-out music scenes were known as &quot;psychill&quot;, &quot;psychedelic chillout&quot;, &quot;psy chillout&quot;, the later works within goa trance and psychedelic trance scenes are known as &quot;ambient psytrance&quot; or &quot;ambient goa&quot;. The dub derived developments are known as psydub and &quot;psystep&quot;.

Psybient pieces are structured to generate vast soundscapes or a &quot;musical journey&quot;. Like psytrance, it emphasizes ongoing rhythm, but due to its ambient and atmospheric sections, it focuses less on beatmatching and allows for a myriad of tempo changes.

==Festivals==

In general, large psytrance festivals are culturally and musically diverse.

Earthdance, the world&#x27;s largest synchronized music and dance festival for peace, arose from the psychedelic trance culture.

At the 2004 Glastonbury Festival in the United Kingdom, psytrance was given an entire day on the Glade stage.

The Alien Safari, Vortex, and Synergy festivals are just a few of South Africa&#x27;s many recurring and long-running psytrance festivals.

Rainbow Serpent Festival, Strawberry Fields, and Earthcore (now discontinued) are just a few of Australia&#x27;s long-running psytrance festivals, dubbed &quot;doofs&quot;.

The Boom Festival in Portugal began as a psytrance festival but has since expanded to include world music. It is held in summer every other year and combines social activism with cultural and spiritual elements.

The Ozora Festival in Hungary is an arts-focused event that emphasizes connecting with nature and oneself. Psytrance is still very popular at this festival.

==Cultural research==
In 2007, research was conducted on the global psytrance scene. 600 people from 40 countries provided detailed information via an online questionnaire. The results were published as &quot;Beyond Subculture and Post-subculture? The Case of Virtual Psytrance&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Youth Studies&quot;.

In 2012, Graham St. John published &quot;Global Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance&quot;, Equinox. ().

<doc id="147709" wikidata="Q81534" url="?curid=147709" title="Kimigayo">
<text>is the national anthem of Japan. The lyrics are from a &quot;&quot; poem written by an unnamed author in the Heian period (794–1185), and the current melody was chosen in 1880, replacing an unpopular melody composed by John William Fenton in 1869. While the title &quot;Kimigayo&quot; is usually translated as &quot;His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Reign&quot;, no official translation of the title or lyrics have been established in law.

From 1888 to 1945, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; served as the national anthem of the Empire of Japan. When the Empire accepted the Potsdam Declaration and came under Allied occupation, Emperor Shōwa retained the throne, and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; remained the de facto national anthem to preserve the Japanese monarchy. The passage of the Act on the National Flag and Anthem in 1999 officially recognized it as both the national and imperial anthem.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Kimi&quot; has been used to indicate the Emperor of Japan or one&#x27;s lord (i.e., master) since at least the Heian period. For example, the protagonist of &quot;the Tale of Genji&quot; is also called . Before the Nara period, the emperor was often called &quot;&quot;ohkimi&quot; (great lord); so it is controversial whether or not the word &quot;kimi&quot; in &quot;kimigayo&quot;&quot; had meant &quot;emperor&quot; originally.
&quot;Kimi&quot; also means &quot;my dear&quot; as female emperor Genmei wrote about her lover in a poem in Manyoshu (vol.1 no.78).

In the Kamakura period, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was used as a festive song among samurai, and then became popular among the people in the Edo period. In the later part of the Edo period, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was used in the Ōoku (harem of Edo Castle, current Tokyo Imperial Palace) and Satsuma-han (current Kagoshima Prefecture) as a common festive new year song. In those contexts, &quot;kimi&quot; never meant the emperor, but only the Tokugawa shōgun, the Shimazu clan as rulers of the Satsuma-han, guests of honor, or all members of a festive drinking party. After the Meiji Restoration, samurai from Satsuma-han controlled the Imperial Japanese government, and they adopted &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the national anthem of Japan. From this time until the Japanese defeat at the end of World War II, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was understood to mean the long reign of the Emperor. With the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947, the Emperor became no longer a sovereign who ruled by divine right, but a human who is a symbol of the state and of the unity of the people as a constitutional monarch. The Ministry of Education did not give any new meanings for &quot;Kimigayo&quot; after the war; this allowed the song to mean the Japanese people. The Ministry also did not formally renounce the pre-war meaning of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;.

In 1999, during the deliberations of the Act on National Flag and Anthem, the official definition of &quot;Kimi&quot; or &quot;Kimi-ga-yo&quot; was questioned repeatedly. The first suggestion, which was given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, stated that &quot;kimi&quot; meant the &quot;Emperor as the symbol of Japan&quot;, and that the entire lyrics wish for the peace and prosperity of Japan. He referred to the new status of emperor as established in Article 1 of the Constitution of Japan as the main reason for these suggestions. During the same session, Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi (Obuchi Cabinet) confirmed this meaning with a statement on 29 June 1999:

&quot;Kimi&quot; indicates the Emperor, who is the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people, and whose position is derived from the consensus-based will of Japanese citizens, with whom sovereign power resides. And, the phrase &quot;Kimigayo&quot; indicates our State, Japan, which has the Emperor enthroned as the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people by the consensus-based will of Japanese citizens. And it is reasonable to take the lyric of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; to mean the wish for the lasting prosperity and peace of such country of ours.

Parties opposed to the Liberal Democratic Party, which was in control of the government during Obuchi administration, strongly objected to the government&#x27;s meaning of &quot;kimi&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. Lawmakers of the Democratic Party of Japan objected on the grounds that there was a lack of any historical ties to the meaning. The strongest critic was Kazuo Shii, the chairman of the Communist Party of Japan, who strongly claimed that &quot;Japan&quot; could not be derived from &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, because the lyrics only mention wishing for the emperor to have a long reign. Shii also objected to the use of the song as the national anthem, saying that for a democratic nation, an anthem about the emperor was not appropriate.

== History ==
=== Empire of Japan (1868–1945) ===
The lyrics first appeared in the , a poetry anthology published in ca.920, as an anonymous poem. The poem was included in many anthologies, and was used in a later period as a celebration song of a long life by people of all social statures. Unlike the form used for the current national anthem, the poem originally began with &quot;&quot;Waga Kimi wa&quot; (&#x27;my lord&#x27;) instead of &quot;Kimiga Yo wa&quot;&quot; (&#x27;my lord&#x27;s reign&#x27;). The first lyrics were changed during the Kamakura period, while the rest of the lyrics stayed the same. Because the lyrics were sung on informal occasions, such as birthdays, there was no sheet music for it until the 19th century.

In 1869, John William Fenton, a visiting British military band leader, realized that there was no national anthem in Japan, and suggested to Iwao Ōyama, an officer of the Satsuma Clan, that one be created. Ōyama agreed, and selected the lyrics. The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem, due to Fenton&#x27;s influence. After selecting the anthem&#x27;s lyrics, Ōyama then asked Fenton to create the melody. After being given just two to three weeks to compose the melody, and only a few days to rehearse, Fenton debuted the anthem before the Japanese Emperor in 1870. This was the first version of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. This was discarded because the melody &quot;lacked solemnity&quot;, according to the Japanese government, although others believe it is because the melody was actually &quot;unsingable&quot; for the Japanese. However, this version is still performed annually at the &quot;Myōkōji&quot; temple in Yokohama, where Fenton served as a military band leader. &quot;Myōkōji&quot; serves as a memorial to him.
In 1880, the Ministry of the Imperial Household (current Imperial Household Agency) adopted a new melody composed by Yoshiisa Oku and Akimori Hayashi. The composer is often listed as Hiromori Hayashi, who was their supervisor and Akimori&#x27;s father. Akimori was also one of Fenton&#x27;s pupils. Although the melody is based on a traditional mode of Japanese court music, it is composed in a mixed style influenced by Western hymns, and uses some elements of the Fenton arrangement. The German musician Franz Eckert applied the melody with Western style harmony, creating the second and current version of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. The government formally adopted &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the national anthem in 1888 and had copies of the music and lyrics sent overseas for diplomatic ceremonies. By 1893, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was included in public school ceremonies due to the efforts of the then Ministry of Education.
Kōzō Yoshimoto (吉本光蔵, 1863–1907) ja] composed the Kimigayo March (君が代行進曲) ja] based on the anthem and another composition called &quot;Defense of the Japanese Empire&quot; (皇国の守り) by Isawa Shūji. The march is still performed by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force band.

At the turn of the 20th century, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; was beginning to be closely associated with the idea of honoring the Emperor. It was also associated as a part of Japanese education. However, opinions expressed in an Osaka paper in 1904 calls &quot;Kimigayo&quot; a song for the imperial family and not the state as a whole. Uchimura Kanzo, a Christian leader in Japan, stated at the turn of the 20th century that &quot;Kimigayo&quot; is not the anthem of Japan by saying the song&#x27;s purpose is to praise the emperor. According to Kanzo, a national anthem should express the feelings of the people, and not of the divine emperor. The Japanese were not familiar with &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as the anthem until there was a surge of celebrations after victories in the First Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. Previously, papers were critical of fellow Japanese who could not sing &quot;Kimigayo&quot; properly at ceremonies overseas.

During World War II, the Japanese Empire ordered that schoolchildren, both from its homeland and its colonies, were to sing the &quot;Kimigayo&quot; anthem and salute Emperor Hirohito every morning.

=== Postwar Japan (1945–present) ===
==== 1945 to 1999 ====
During the Allied occupation of Japan (led mainly by the United States), there were no directives by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to restrict the use of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; by the Japanese government. This was different from the regulations issued that restricted the use of the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; flag. Along with the encouragement to use &quot;Kimigayo&quot; in the schools to promote defense education and patriotism, the national broadcaster NHK began to use the song to announce the start and ending of its programming.

==== Since 1999 ====

The &quot;Act on National Flag and Anthem&quot; was passed on 13 August 1999, choosing both the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as Japan&#x27;s national symbols. The passage of the law stemmed from a suicide of a school principal in Hiroshima who could not resolve a dispute between his school board and his teachers over the use of the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot;.

Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi, President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided to draft legislation to make the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation to be completed by the 10th anniversary of the coronation of Akihito as Emperor. This is not the first time legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa Prefecture to Japan from the U.S. and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka hinted at a law being passed legalizing both symbols.

The main supporters of the bill were governing parties, the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (JCP), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The JCP was further opposed for not allowing the issue to be decided by the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. President of the DPJ and future prime minister, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools.

Before the vote, there were calls for the bills to be separated at the National Diet. Waseda University professor Norihiro Kato stated that &quot;Kimigayo&quot; is a separate issue more complex than the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; flag. Attempts to designate only the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9. It was enacted into law on August 13.

== Protocol ==
The lyrics and musical notation of the anthem are given in the second appendix of the Act on National Flag and Anthem. As for the sheet music itself, it displays a vocal arrangement with no mention of tempo and all of the lyrics in hiragana. The anthem is composed in 4/4 (common time) in the Dorian mode. The Act on National Flag and Anthem does not detail how one should show respect during performances of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. In a statement made by Prime Minister Obuchi, the legislation will not impose new regulations on the Japanese people when it comes to respecting the flag or anthem. However, local government bodies and private organizations sometimes suggest or demand certain protocols be followed. For example, an October 2003 directive by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government required teachers to stand during the national anthem at graduation ceremonies. While standing, the teachers are required to sing &quot;Kimigayo&quot; while facing the &quot;Hinomaru&quot;. The Act on National Flag and Anthem also does not dictate when or where &quot;Kimigayo&quot; should be played. The anthem, however, is commonly played at sporting events inside of Japan, or at international sporting events where Japan has a competing team. At &quot;sumō&quot; tournaments, &quot;Kimigayo&quot; is played before the awards ceremony.

=== Public schools ===
Since the end of World War II, the Ministry of Education has issued statements and regulations to promote the usage of both the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; at schools under their jurisdiction. The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. The Ministry not only took great measures to explain that both symbols are not formally established by law, they also referred to &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as a song and refused to call it the national anthem. It was not until 1977 that the Ministry referred to as the of Japan. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect must be given to it and to &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms.

The 1999 curriculum guideline issued by the Ministry of Education after the passage of the &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem&quot; decrees that &quot;on entrance and graduation ceremonies, schools must raise the flag of Japan and instruct students to sing the &quot;Kimigayo&quot; (national anthem), given the significance of the flag and the song.&quot; Additionally, the ministry&#x27;s commentary on 1999 curriculum guideline for elementary schools note that &quot;given the advance of internationalization, along with fostering patriotism and awareness of being Japanese, it is important to nurture school children&#x27;s respectful attitude toward the flag of Japan and &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as they grow up to be respected Japanese citizens in an internationalized society.&quot; The ministry also stated that if Japanese students cannot respect their own symbols, then they will not be able to respect the symbols of other nations.

== Present-day perception ==
According to a survey conducted by TV Asahi, most Japanese people perceived &quot;Kimigayo&quot; as an important, yet a controversial song even before the passage of the &quot;Act on National Flag and Anthem&quot; in 1999. However, a poll in the same year, conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun, found that most respondents opposed legislation that make it the national anthem, or thought that the Diet should take more time in passing such a law. Many Japanese students, who must sing the song at entrance and graduation ceremonies, say they cannot understand the old and obsolete language of the lyrics and are not educated on its historical uses. Controversies surrounding the use of the anthem in school events still remain.

== Controversies ==
Japan&#x27;s national anthem is controversial due to its post-war history. Schools have been the center of controversy over both it and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education requires the use of both &quot;Kimigayo&quot; and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. In 1999, several teachers in Hiroshima refused to put up the anthem while the Hiroshima Education Board demanded that they do so. As the tension arose between them, a vice-principal killed himself. A similar incident in Osaka in 2010 also occurred, with 32 teachers refusing to sing the song in a ceremony. In 2011, nine more teachers joined the rebellion, along with another eight in 2012. Hashimoto Toru, the mayor of Osaka, stated that &quot;[i]t was good that criminals who are intent on breaking the rules have risen to the surface&quot;. Some have protested that such rules violate the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the &quot;freedom of thought, belief and conscience&quot; clause in the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Governor of Tokyo Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honour the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; and &quot;Kimigayo&quot;. After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and national anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.

In 2006, Katsuhisa Fujita, a retired teacher in Tokyo, was threatened with imprisonment and fined 200,000 yen (roughly 2,000 US dollars) after he was accused of disturbing a graduation ceremony at Itabashi Senior High School by urging the attendees to remain seated during the playing of the national anthem. At the time of Fujita&#x27;s sentence, 345 teachers had been punished for refusing to take part in anthem related events, though Fujita is the only man to have been convicted in relation to it. On 21 September 2006, the Tokyo District Court ordered the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to pay compensation to the teachers who had been subjected to punishment under the directive of the Tokyo Board of Education. The then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi commented, &quot;It is a natural idea to treat the national anthem importantly&quot;. The ruling was appealed by the Metropolitan Government. From 23 October 2003 to 2008, 410 teachers and school workers were punished for refusing to stand and sing the anthem as ordered by school principals. Teachers can also be punished if their students do not stand while &quot;Kimigayo&quot; is played during school ceremonies.

On 30 May 2011 and 6 June 2011, two panels of the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that it was constitutional to require teachers to stand in front of the Hinomaru and sing the Kimigayo during school ceremonies. In making the ruling, the panels ratified the decision of the Tokyo High Court in ruling against 13 teachers who had asked for court relief after being disciplined between 2003 and 2005 for refusing to stand and sing the anthem.

Outside of the school system, there was a controversy regarding &quot;Kimigayo&quot; soon after the passage of the 1999 law. A month after the law&#x27;s passage, a record containing a performance of &quot;Kimigayo&quot; by Japanese rock musician Kiyoshiro Imawano was removed by Polydor Records from his album &quot;Fuyu no Jujika&quot; (冬の十字架, &quot;Cross in Winter&quot;). Polydor did not want to attract harassment from far-right groups. In response, Imawano re-released the album through an independent label with the track in question.

<text>Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O&#x27;Brien (16 April 1939 – 2 March 1999), better known by her stage name Dusty Springfield, was an English singer. With her distinctive mezzo-soprano voice, she was a popular singer of blue-eyed soul, pop and dramatic ballads, with French chanson, country, and jazz also in her repertoire. During her 1960s peak, she ranked among the most successful British female performers on both sides of the Atlantic. Her image–marked by a peroxide blonde bouffant/beehive hairstyle, heavy makeup (thick black eyeliner and eye shadow) and evening gowns, as well as stylised, gestural performances–made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties.

Born in West Hampstead in London to a family that enjoyed music, Springfield learned to sing at home. In 1958, she joined her first professional group, the Lana Sisters. Two years later, with her brother Dion O&#x27;Brien (&quot;Tom Springfield&quot;) and Tim Feild, she formed the folk-pop vocal trio the Springfields. Two of their five 1961–63 Top 40 UK hits – &quot;Island of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Say I Won&#x27;t Be There&quot;–reached No. 5 on the charts, both in the spring of 1963. In 1962, they also achieved success in the United States with their cover of &quot;Silver Threads and Golden Needles&quot;. Her solo career began in late 1963 with the upbeat pop record &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;—a UK No. 4 hit, and the first of her six transatlantic Top 40 hits in the 1960s, along with &quot;Stay Awhile&quot; (1964), &quot;All I See Is You&quot; (1966), &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Anything&quot; (1967), and two releases which are now considered her signature songs: &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot; (1966 UK No. 1/US No. 4) and &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; (1968/69 UK No. 9/US No. 10). The latter is featured on the 1968 pop and soul album &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot;, one of Springfield&#x27;s defining works. In March 2020, the US Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry, which preserves audio recordings considered to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Between 1964 and 1969, Springfield enjoyed success in her native United Kingdom with several singles which in America either failed to chart or were not released, among them being &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; (the biggest of her many Burt Bacharach/Hal David covers), &quot;In the Middle of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Some of Your Lovin, &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;, and &quot;I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten&quot;. Conversely, she charted in the US (but not in the UK) with hits including &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;, &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, and &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;. From 1971 to 1986, she failed to register a hit from five album releases (aside from a minor 1979 UK chart appearance), but her 1987 collaboration with UK synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;, took her back near the top of the charts, reaching No. 2 on both the UK Singles Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The collaboration yielded two 1989 UK Top 20 hits: &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot; and &quot;In Private&quot;. In 1990, Springfield charted with &quot;Reputation&quot;–the last of 25 UK Top 40 hits in which she features. 

A fixture on British television, Springfield presented many episodes of the popular 1963–66 British TV music series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and, between 1966 and 1969, hosted her own series on the BBC and ITV. In 1966, she topped popularity polls, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s &quot;Best International Vocalist&quot;, and was the first UK singer to top the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; readers&#x27; poll for best female singer. She has been inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the UK Music Hall of Fame. Multiple critics and polls have lauded Springfield as one of the greatest female singers in popular music.

== Early life ==

Springfield was born Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O&#x27;Brien on 16 April 1939 in West Hampstead, the second child of Gerard Anthony &#x27;OB&#x27; O&#x27;Brien (1904–1979) and Catherine Anne &#x27;Kay&#x27; O&#x27;Brien (&quot;née&quot; Ryle; 1900–1974), both Irish immigrants. Springfield&#x27;s elder brother, Dionysius Patrick O&#x27;Brien (2 July 1934 – 27 July 2022) was later known as Tom Springfield. Her father grew up in British India and worked as a tax accountant and consultant. Her mother came from an Irish family originally from Tralee, County Kerry, that included a number of journalists.

Dusty Springfield grew up in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire living there until the early 1950s and later in Ealing in West London. She attended St Anne&#x27;s Convent School in Northfields, a traditional all-girl school in London. The comfortable middle-class upbringing was disturbed by dysfunctional tendencies in the family: her father&#x27;s perfectionism and her mother&#x27;s frustrations sometimes resulted in food-throwing incidents. Springfield and her brother were both prone to food-throwing as adults. She was given the nickname &quot;Dusty&quot; because she played football with boys in the street; she was described as being a tomboy.

Springfield grew up in a music-loving family. Her father tapped out rhythms on the back of her hand and encouraged her to guess which musical piece had the beat. She listened to a wide range of music including George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Glenn Miller. A fan of American jazz and the vocalists Peggy Lee and Jo Stafford, she wished to sound like them. At age 12 she recorded herself performing the Irving Berlin song &quot;When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabama&quot; at a record shop in Ealing.

==Career==
=== 1958–1963: Career beginnings ===

After leaving school, Springfield sang with Tom, her brother, in local folk clubs. In 1957, the pair worked together at holiday camps. The next year, Springfield responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; to join The Lana Sisters, an &quot;established sister act&quot;, with Iris &#x27;Riss&#x27; Long (also known as Riss Lana, Riss Chantelle) and Lynne Abrams (a.k.a. Lynne Lana), who were not actually sisters. Dusty adopted the stage name &quot;Shann Lana&quot; and &quot;cut her hair, lost the glasses, experimented with makeup, (and) fashion&quot; becoming one of the &#x27;sisters&#x27;.

As a member of the pop vocal trio, Dusty Springfield developed skills in harmonizing and microphone technique; she recorded, performed on television, and played at live shows in the United Kingdom and at United States Air Force bases in continental Europe. In 1960, she left the Lana Sisters and formed a folk-pop trio, The Springfields, with Tom and Reshad Feild (both had been in The Kensington Squares), the latter of whom Mike Hurst replaced in 1962. The trio chose their name while rehearsing in a field in Somerset in the springtime and took the stage names Dusty, Tom, and Tim Springfield. Intending to make an authentic US album, the group travelled to Nashville to record &quot;Folk Songs from the Hills&quot;. The music Springfield heard during their visit–but particularly the Exciters&#x27; &quot;Tell Him&quot;, while in New York City–influenced her shift from folk and country towards pop rooted in rhythm and blues. The band was voted the Top British Vocal Group in a &quot;New Musical Express&quot; poll in 1961 and 1962, although their two biggest hits were in 1963: &quot;Island of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Say I Won&#x27;t Be There&quot;, both peaking at number five within five weeks of each other. The group appeared on the hip ITV music series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, which Springfield often presented in the earlier days of its run.

Dusty left the band after their final concert in October 1963. After the break-up of the Springfields, Tom continued songwriting and producing for other artists, notably Australian folk-pop group The Seekers, producing, writing, and/or co-writing their four defining mid-1960s hits &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot;, &quot;A World of Our Own&quot;, &quot;The Carnival is Over&quot;, and &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;. He also wrote additional songs for Dusty–most famously her 1964 UK hit &quot;Losing You&quot;, with Clive Westlake–and released his own solo material.

=== 1963–1966: Early solo career ===
Dusty Springfield released her first solo single, &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;, co-written and arranged by Ivor Raymonde, in November 1963. The record was produced by Johnny Franz in a manner similar to Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;; it included rhythm-and-blues features like horn sections, backing singers, and double-tracked vocals along with strings, recalling Springfield&#x27;s influences such as the Exciters and the Shirelles. In January 1964, the single peaked at no. 4 on the UK charts during a lengthy (for the time) 18-week run. In December 1963, New York disc jockey &quot;Dandy&quot; Dan Daniel of WMCA nominated the single as a &quot;Sure Shot&quot; pick of records not yet charted, preceding Beatlemania. The single debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 on the chart dated 25 January 1964, a week after the debut of the Beatles&#x27; first hit &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and in the same week as the debut of &quot;She Loves You&quot;, positioning Springfield at the forefront of the British Invasion. &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; peaked at no. 12 during its ten-week chart run, and ranked 48 in the year-end Top 100 of New York radio station WABC. The BBC&#x27;s 1964–2006 weekly chart-based music programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; debuted on 1 January 1964, with &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; as the show&#x27;s kick-off record. The single was certified gold in the UK, and its B-side, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, was written by Springfield.

Springfield&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;A Girl Called Dusty&quot;–featuring mostly covers of her favourite songs–was released on 17 April 1964 in the UK (but not in America). Tracks included &quot;Mama Said&quot;, &quot;When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;, and &quot;Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa&quot;. In May 1964, the album reached no. 6 in the UK–one of only two of her Top Ten non-hits albums. After &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;, she had five more singles chart in 1964, with just &quot;Stay Awhile&quot; registering as a transatlantic success (UK no. 13/US no. 38). Its B-side, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Special&quot;, was written by Springfield, later described as &quot;a first-rate Springfield original&quot; by AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger. She was quoted as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t really see myself as a songwriter. I don&#x27;t really like writing... I just don&#x27;t get any good ideas and the ones I do get are pinched from other records. The only reason I write is for the money–oh mercenary creature!&quot; The highest-charting of Springfield&#x27;s 1964 releases were both Burt Bacharach-Hal David songs: &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;&quot;–a US no. 6 hit which featured on &quot;A Girl Called Dusty&quot;–and &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot;, which in July peaked at no. 3 on the UK singles chart (behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot;). The dramatic and emotive &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; set the standard for much of her later material. In the autumn of 1964, Springfield peaked at no. 41 in the United States with &quot;All Cried Out&quot;, but in her native Britain she hit big with &quot;Losing You&quot; (UK no. 9/US no. 91), which peaked in December–the same month in which the singer&#x27;s tour of South Africa, with her group The Echoes, was terminated following a controversial performance before an integrated audience at a theatre near Cape Town, in defiance of the government&#x27;s segregation policy. Springfield was deported. Her contract specifically excluded segregated performances, making her one of the first British artists to do so. In the same year, she was voted the year&#x27;s top British Female Singer in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; readers&#x27; poll, ahead of Lulu, Sandie Shaw, and Cilla Black. Springfield received the award again for the next three years.

In 1965, Springfield reached the UK Top 40 with three hit singles: &quot;Your Hurtin&#x27; Kinda Love&quot; (no. 37), &quot;In the Middle of Nowhere&quot; (no. 8) and the Gerry Goffin/Carole King-penned &quot;Some of Your Lovin (no. 8), though none was included on her next UK album recorded with The Echoes, &quot;Ev&#x27;rything&#x27;s Coming Up Dusty&quot;. Released in October 1965, the LP featured songs by Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley, Rod Argent and Randy Newman, and a cover of the traditional Mexican song &quot;La Bamba&quot;. In November 1965, the album peaked at no. 6 on the UK chart. Springfield&#x27;s one appearance on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in 1965 was &quot;Losing You&quot;, which stalled at 91.

From 28 to 30 January 1965, Springfield took part in the Italian Song Festival in San Remo, reaching a semi-final with &quot;Tu che ne sai?&quot; (English: &quot;What Do You Know?&quot;) while failing to qualify for the final. During the competition, she heard the song &quot;Io Che Non Vivo (Senza Te)&quot;, performed by one of its composers, Pino Donaggio, and separately by US country music singer Jody Miller. An English-language version, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot;, would feature lyrics newly written by Springfield&#x27;s friend (and future manager) Vicki Wickham and another future manager, Simon Napier-Bell. Springfield&#x27;s dramatic recording of the ballad was released in March 1966 and reached number one in the UK in its fifth week on the singles chart. Success followed in the US, where in July it reached no. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100, ranking 21 for the year. Springfield called it &quot;good old schmaltz&quot;, and it became her signature song. In 1967, Springfield was nominated for the Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Solo Vocal Performance – Male or Female award at the 9th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Paul McCartney for &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. In 1999, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot; featured in an all-time Top 100 of songs as voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 2.

In 1966, Springfield scored with three other UK hits, all varying in style: the snappy &quot;Little By Little&quot; (no. 17), a cover of Gerry Goffin and Carole King&#x27;s poignant and reflective &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; (no. 10), and the sweeping dramatic ballad &quot;All I See Is You&quot; (no. 9), co-written by Ben Weisman and Clive Westlake. The last peaked at no. 20 in the United States. In August and September 1966, she hosted &quot;Dusty&quot;, a six-part BBC TV music/talk show series. A compilation of her singles, &quot;Golden Hits&quot;, released in November 1966, peaked at no. 2 in the UK (behind the soundtrack to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;). From the mid-1960s onward Springfield used the pseudonym &quot;Gladys Thong&quot; when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair, together with Lesley Duncan, co-wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot; , the B-side of &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;.

During this period, Springfield was also known for her love of Motown. She introduced the Motown sound to a wider UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for the Temptations, the Supremes, Martha &amp; The Vandellas, the Miracles and Stevie Wonder in a special edition of the 1963–66 British TV music series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, produced by Vicki Wickham. &quot;The Sound of Motown&quot; was broadcast by Associated-Rediffusion/ITV on 28 April 1965, with Springfield opening each half accompanied by Martha and the Vandellas and Motown&#x27;s in-house band, the Funk Brothers. The associated touring Tamla-Motown Revue–featuring the Supremes, the Miracles and Stevie Wonder–had started in London in March and was, according to the Supremes&#x27; Mary Wilson, a flop: &quot;It&#x27;s always... disheartening when you go out there and you see the house is half-full... but once you&#x27;re on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500.&quot; Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; special and enlisted Springfield to host it.

=== 1967–68 ===
As with Springfield&#x27;s chart success in the previous three years, there was minimal agreement in 1967 and 1968 between UK and US releases. The closest Springfield got to a transatlantic hit during this period was the spirited &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Anything&quot;, which charted in the spring of 1967 (UK no. 13/US no. 40). The follow-up single, &quot;Give Me Time&quot;–the singer&#x27;s last traditional-sounding sweeping ballad–peaked outside the UK Top 20 (no. 24) and stalled at 76 in the United States. However, the single&#x27;s B-side – the smokey-sultry Bacharach-David song &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, recorded for the James Bond parody film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;–emerged as one of Springfield&#x27;s five defining US 1960s hits.
For &quot;one of the slowest-tempo hits&quot; of the sixties, Bacharach created the &quot;sultry&quot; feel by the use of &quot;minor-seventh and major-seventh chord changes&quot;, while Hal David&#x27;s lyrics &quot;epitomised longing and, yes, lust.&quot; The song was recorded in two versions at the Philips Studios in London. The soundtrack version was released on 29 January 1967. The single version charted briefly in July, then re-entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in early September, peaking at no. 22. However, it reached the Top Ten in several markets across the US, reaching number one in San Francisco (KFRC and KYA) and San Jose, California (KLIV) as well as no. 2 in Boston (WBZ), among other cities. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song.

In August and September 1967, Springfield headlined the second season of her BBC TV series &quot;Dusty&quot; (also known as &quot;The Dusty Springfield Show&quot;), in which she welcomed guests and performed songs, among them a rendition of &quot;Get Ready&quot; and her then-recent hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Anything&quot;. The series attracted a healthy audience but was seen as not keeping up with changes in pop music. Springfield&#x27;s next LP &quot;Where Am I Going?&quot; (October 1967)–her first album of new material since 1965–experimented with various styles including a &quot;jazzy&quot;, orchestrated version of &quot;Sunny&quot; and an acclaimed cover of Jacques Brel&#x27;s &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; (&quot;If You Go Away&quot;). Though critically appreciated, the album peaked at 40 in the UK and failed to chart in the US. In November 1968, a similar fate befell &quot;Dusty... Definitely&quot;, which was not issued in the US, though it reached no. 30 in the UK during a six-week chart run. Material ranged from the rolling &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sun Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; to the achingly emotive cover of Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Gonna Rain Today&quot;. Also in 1968, Springfield scored with one of her biggest UK hits of the decade: the dramatic &quot;I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten&quot;, written by Clive Westlake. The single peaked at no. 4 in August 1968. Its flip side, &quot;No Stranger Am I&quot;, was co-written by American singer-songwriter Norma Tanega–known for her transatlantic 1966 Top 30 folk-pop hit &quot;Walkin&#x27; My Cat Named Dog&quot;–and Norma Kutzer. By late 1966, Springfield was in a domestic relationship with Tanega. Springfield&#x27;s 1968 TV series &quot;It Must Be Dusty&quot; was broadcast on ITV in May and June; episode six featured a duet performance of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; with singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix, fronting his band the Experience.

=== 1968–69: &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; ===

By the late 1960s, Carole King–who with Gerry Goffin co-wrote &quot;Some of Your Lovin, &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; and four songs on the &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; album–had embarked on a solo singing career. At the same time, Springfield&#x27;s relationship with the high-charting Bacharach-David partnership was floundering. Her status in the music industry was further complicated by a &quot;progressive&quot; music revolution which dictated an uncomfortable dichotomy: underground/&quot;fashionable&quot; vs. pop/&quot;unfashionable&quot;. Her performing career was limited to the UK touring circuit of working men&#x27;s clubs, hotels and cabarets. Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, she signed with Atlantic Records, the label of her idol Aretha Franklin. (She signed with the label only in the United States; in her native United Kingdom she remained under contract with Philips.)

The Memphis sessions at the American Sound Studio were produced by Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd, and Arif Mardin; the back-up vocal band Sweet Inspirations; and the instrumental band Memphis Boys. They were led by guitarist Reggie Young and bass guitarist Tommy Cogbill. The producers recognized that Springfield&#x27;s natural soul voice should be placed at the forefront, rather than competing with full string arrangements. At first, she felt anxious when compared with the soul greats who had recorded in the same studios. She had never worked with just a rhythm track, and it was her first time with outside producers; many of her previous recordings had been self-produced, while not being credited. Wexler felt Springfield had a &quot;gigantic inferiority complex&quot;, and due to her pursuit of perfection, her vocals were re-recorded later, in New York. In November 1968, during the Memphis sessions, Springfield suggested to Wexler (one of the heads of Atlantic Records) that he should sign the newly formed UK band Led Zeppelin. She knew their bass guitarist, John Paul Jones, from his session work on her earlier albums. Without ever having seen them and partly on her advice, Wexler signed Led Zeppelin to a $200,000 deal with Atlantic–the biggest such contract for a new band until then.

The album &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; received excellent reviews on its initial releases both in the UK and US. Greil Marcus of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;most of the songs... have a great deal of depth while presenting extremely direct and simple statements about love... Dusty sings around her material, creating music that&#x27;s evocative rather than overwhelming... Dusty is not searching–she just shows up, and she, and we, are better for it.&quot;

Commercial and chart success did not follow. The album failed to chart in the UK, and in April 1969 it stalled at no. 99 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart, with sales of 100,000 copies. However, by 2001, the album had received the Grammy Hall of Fame award and was listed among the greatest albums of all time by US music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and in polls conducted by VH1, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; and UK TV network Channel 4. In November 1968, the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;, was issued. It was written by John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins. Credited as &quot;Son-of-a Preacher Man&quot; on UK, US and other releases, it became an international hit, reaching no. 9 in the UK singles chart and no. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in January 1969. In continental Europe, the single reached the Top Ten in the Austrian, Dutch and Swiss charts. In 1970, Springfield was nominated for the Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female award at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; by Peggy Lee, whom Springfield often cited as an influence. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed the single at no. 77 in its critics&#x27; list The 100 Best Singles of the Last 25 Years. In 2002, the record ranked 43 in the 100 Greatest Singles of All Time, as voted for by &quot;New Musical Express&quot; critics. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 240 in its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; found a new audience when it was included on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The soundtrack reached no. 21 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Billboard 200 album chart and at the time went platinum (100,000 units) in Canada alone. It is thought that &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; contributed to the sales of the soundtrack album, which sold more than 2 million copies in the US.

During September and October 1969, Springfield hosted her third and final BBC musical variety series (her fourth variety series overall), &quot;Decidedly Dusty&quot; (co-hosted by Valentine Dyall). All eight episodes were later wiped from the BBC archives, and to date the only surviving footage consists of domestic audio recordings.

Until her 1987 comeback with Pet Shop Boys, 1969 marked the last year in which Springfield achieved any notable singles chart presence. In Britain, following &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;, she charted with only &quot;Am I the Same Girl&quot; (no. 43), while on the US Hot 100 she charted with the double A-side &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Me&quot; (no. 64)/&quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot; (no. 91), a cover of &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot; (no. 31), &quot;Willie &amp; Laura Mae Jones&quot; (no. 78) and A Brand New Me (no. 24). Springfield&#x27;s 1960s repertoire also is noted for interpretations of songs associated primarily with other artists. Those which have appeared on Springfield EPs and compilations include &quot;Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;, &quot;La Bamba&quot;, &quot;If You Go Away&quot; (released on the 1968 Philips EP &quot;If You Go Away&quot;, which also featured tracks such as &quot;Magic Garden&quot; and &quot;Sunny&quot;), &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; (released as &quot;Take Another Little Piece of My Heart&quot;), &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Gonna Rain Today&quot;, &quot;Spooky&quot; and &quot;Yesterday When I Was Young&quot;.

Springfield was one of the best-selling UK singers of the 1960s. She was voted the Top Female Singer (UK) by the readers of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in 1964 to 1966 and Top Female Singer in 1965 to 1967 and 1969.

=== 1970s ===

By the beginning of the 1970s, Springfield was a major star, though her record sales were declining. Her partner, Norma Tanega, had returned to the US after their relationship had become stressful, and Springfield was spending more time in the US herself. In January 1970, her second and final album on Atlantic Records, &quot;A Brand New Me&quot; (re-titled &quot;From Dusty... With Love&quot; in the UK), was released; it featured tracks written and produced by Gamble and Huff. The album and related singles only sold moderately; Springfield was unhappy with both her management and record company. She sang backing vocals with her friend Madeline Bell on two tracks on Elton John&#x27;s 1971 hit album &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;. Springfield recorded some songs with producer Jeff Barry in early 1971, which were intended for an album to be released by Atlantic Records. However, her new manager Alan Bernard negotiated her out of the Atlantic contract; some of the tracks were used on the UK-only album &quot;See All Her Faces&quot; (November 1972) and the 1999 release &quot;Dusty in Memphis-Deluxe Edition&quot;. She signed a contract with ABC Dunhill Records in 1972, and &quot;Cameo&quot; was issued in February 1973 to respectable reviews, though poor sales.

In 1973, Springfield recorded the theme song for the TV series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, which was used for two of its film-length episodes: &quot;Wine, Women &amp; War&quot; and &quot;The Solid Gold Kidnapping&quot;. Her second ABC Dunhill album was given the working title &quot;Elements&quot; and was then scheduled for release in late 1974 as &quot;Longing&quot;. However, the recording sessions were abandoned, although part of the material, including tentative and incomplete vocals, was issued on the 2001 posthumous compilation &quot;Beautiful Soul&quot;. In the mid-1970s she sang background vocals on Elton John&#x27;s album &quot;Caribou&quot; (June 1974), including his single &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot;; and on Anne Murray&#x27;s album &quot;Together&quot; (November 1975). By 1974, Springfield put her solo musical career on hold and lived as a recluse in the US avoiding scrutiny by UK tabloids. In the 1960s and early 1970s, gay or bisexual performers &quot;knew that being &#x27;out&#x27; would lead to prurient media attention, loss of record contracts... the tabloids became obsessively interested in the contents of celebrity closets&quot;. Springfield would not record again until the Summer of 1977, when she began recording &quot;It Begins Again&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Springfield released two albums on United Artists Records. The first was &quot;It Begins Again&quot;, issued in 1978 and produced by Roy Thomas Baker. The album peaked in the UK top 50 and was well received by critics. Her next album, &quot;Living Without Your Love&quot; (1979), did not reach the top 50. In early 1979, Springfield played club dates in New York City. In London, she recorded two singles with David Mackay for her UK label, Mercury Records (formerly Philips Records). The first was the disco-influenced &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, co-written by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, which reached no. 61 in the UK. The second, &quot;Your Love Still Brings Me to My Knees&quot;, released in January 1980, was Springfield&#x27;s final single for Mercury Records; she had been with the label for nearly 20 years. On 3 December 1979, Springfield performed a charity concert for a full house at the Royal Albert Hall, in the presence of Princess Margaret.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Springfield sang &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot;, the theme song from the movie &quot;The Stunt Man&quot;. She signed a US deal with 20th Century Records, which resulted in the single &quot;It Goes Like It Goes&quot;, a cover of the Oscar-winning song from the film &quot;Norma Rae&quot;. Springfield was uncharacteristically proud of her 1982 album &quot;White Heat&quot;, which was influenced by new wave music. She tried to revive her career in 1985 by returning to the UK and signing to Peter Stringfellow&#x27;s Hippodrome Records label. This resulted in the single &quot;Sometimes Like Butterflies&quot; and an appearance on Terry Wogan&#x27;s TV chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;. None of Springfield&#x27;s singles from 1971 to 1986 charted on the UK Top 40 or &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1987, she accepted an invitation from Pet Shop Boys to duet with their lead singer, Neil Tennant, on the single &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;. Tennant cites &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; as one of his favourite albums, and he leapt at the suggestion of using Springfield&#x27;s vocals for &quot;What Have I Done To Deserve This?&quot;. She also appeared on the promotional video. The single rose to no. 2 on both the US and UK charts. It appeared on the Pet Shop Boys album &quot;Actually&quot;, and on both artists&#x27; greatest-hits collections. Springfield sang lead vocals on the Richard Carpenter song &quot;Something in Your Eyes&quot;. &quot;Something in Your Eyes&quot; was featured on Carpenter&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Time&quot; (October 1987); released as a single, it became a US no. 12 adult contemporary hit. Springfield recorded a duet with B. J. Thomas, &quot;As Long as We Got Each Other&quot;, which was used as the opening theme for the US sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; in season 4 (1988–89). (Thomas had collaborated with Jennifer Warnes on the original version, which was neither re-recorded with Warnes nor released as a single.) It was issued as a single and reached no. 7 on the Adult Contemporary Singles Chart. In 1988, a new compilation, &quot;The Silver Collection&quot;, was issued. Springfield returned to the studio with the Pet Shop Boys, who produced her recording of their song &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot;, commissioned for the soundtrack of the 1989 drama film &quot;Scandal&quot;. Released as a single in February 1989, it gave Springfield her fifteenth UK Top 20 hit. In November its follow-up, the upbeat &quot;In Private&quot;, also written and produced by Pet Shop Boys, peaked at no. 14.

=== 1990s ===
Springfield&#x27;s 1990 album, &quot;Reputation&quot;, was her third UK Top 20 studio album. The writing and production credits for half the album, which included the two recent hit singles, went to Pet Shop Boys, while the album&#x27;s other producers included Dan Hartman. By 1988 Springfield had left California and other than when recording tracks for &quot;Reputation&quot;, she returned to the UK to live. In 1993, she recorded a duet with her former 1960s professional rival and friend, Cilla Black. In October, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; was released as a single and, in September it had appeared on Black&#x27;s album, &quot;Through the Years&quot;. Springfield&#x27;s next album, provisionally titled &quot;Dusty in Nashville&quot;, was started in 1993 with producer, Tom Shapiro, but was issued as &quot;A Very Fine Love&quot; in June 1995. Though originally intended by Shapiro as a country music album, the track selection by Springfield pushed the album into pop music with an occasional country feel.

The last studio track Springfield recorded was George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s song &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; in London in 1995 for an insurance company TV ad. It was included on &quot;Simply Dusty&quot; (2000), an anthology that she had helped plan. Her final live performance was on &quot;The Christmas with Michael Ball&quot; special in December 1995.

According to Australian film director Emma-Kate Croghan, Springfield personally approved the use of her recording of &quot;The Look of Love&quot; in the 1999 film &quot;Strange Planet&quot; just days before her death in March 1999.

=== Musical style ===
Influenced by US pop music, Dusty Springfield created a distinctive blue-eyed soul sound. BBC News noted &quot;[h]er soulful voice, at once strident and vulnerable, set her apart from her contemporaries... She was equally at home singing Broadway standards, blues, country or even techno-pop&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny described her:
Most responses to her voice emphasise her breathy sensuality. Another powerful feature was the sense of longing, in songs such as &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;. The uniqueness of Springfield&#x27;s voice was described by Bacharach: &quot;You could hear just three notes and you knew it was Dusty&quot;. Wexler declared, &quot;[h]er particular hallmark was a haunting sexual vulnerability in her voice, and she may have had the most impeccable intonation of any singer I ever heard&quot;. Greil Marcus of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; captured Springfield&#x27;s technique as &quot;a soft, sensual box (voice) that allowed her to combine syllables until they turned into pure cream&quot;. She had a finely tuned musical ear and extraordinary control of tone. She sang in a variety of styles, mostly pop, soul, folk, Latin, and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. Being able to wrap her voice around difficult material, her repertoire included songs that their writers ordinarily would have offered to black vocalists. In the 1960s, on several occasions, she performed as the only white singer on all-black bills. Her soul orientation was so convincing that early in her solo career, US listeners who had only heard her music on radio or records sometimes assumed that she was black. Later, a considerable number of critics observed that she sounded black and American or made a point of saying she did not.

Springfield consistently used her voice to upend commonly held beliefs on the expression of social identity through music. She did this by referencing a number of styles and singers, including Martha Reeves, Carole King, Aretha Franklin, Peggy Lee, Astrud Gilberto, and Mina. Springfield instructed UK backup musicians to capture the spirit of US musicians and copy their instrumental playing styles. However, the fact that she could neither read nor write music made it hard to communicate with session musicians. In the studio she was a perfectionist. Despite producing many tracks, she did not take credit for doing so. During extensive vocal sessions, she repeatedly recorded short phrases and single words. When recording songs, headphones were typically set as high in volume as possible–at a decibel level &quot;on the threshold of pain&quot;.

The Philips Record company&#x27;s studio was slated as &quot;an extremely dead studio&quot;, where it felt as though it had turned the treble down: &quot;There was no and it was like singing in a padded cell. I had to get out of there&quot;. Springfield wound up recording in the ladies&#x27; toilets because of superior acoustics. Another example of refusal to use the studio is &quot;I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten&quot;–recorded at the end of a corridor.

== Personal life ==
Springfield&#x27;s parents, Catherine and Gerard, lived in Hove, East Sussex from 1962. Catherine died in a nursing home there in 1974 of lung cancer. In 1979, Gerard died of a heart attack in Rottingdean, East Sussex.

A recurring theme amongst journalists and Springfield&#x27;s biographers is that she had two personalities: shy, quiet Mary O&#x27;Brien and the public face she had created as Dusty Springfield. An editorial review at &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; of Valentine and Wickham&#x27;s 2001 biography, &quot;Dancing with Demons&quot;, finds that &quot;the confidence [Springfield] exuded on vinyl was a façade masking severe insecurities, addictions to drink and drugs, bouts of self-harm and fear of losing her career if exposed as a lesbian&quot;. 

Simon Bell, one of Springfield&#x27;s session singers, disputed the twin personality description: &quot;It&#x27;s very easy to decide there are two people, Mary and Dusty, but they were the one person. Dusty was most definitely Dusty right to the end.&quot; In her early career, much of her odd behaviour was seen as more or less in fun, described as a &quot;wicked&quot; sense of humour, including her food fights and hurling crockery down stairs. She had a great love for animals, particularly cats, and became an advocate for animal protection groups. She enjoyed reading maps and would intentionally get lost to navigate her way out. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Springfield&#x27;s alcoholism and drug addiction affected her musical career. She was hospitalised several times for self-harm and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Springfield was never reported to be in a heterosexual relationship; it meant the issue of her sexual orientation was raised frequently during her life. From mid-1966 to the early 1970s, Springfield lived in a domestic partnership with fellow singer Norma Tanega. In September 1970, Springfield told Ray Connolly of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;:

By the standards of 1970, that was a bold statement. Three years later, she told Chris Van Ness of the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot;:

In the 1970s and 1980s, Springfield became involved in several romantic relationships with women in Canada and the United States that were not kept secret from the gay and lesbian community. From 1972 to 1978, she had an &quot;off and on&quot; domestic relationship with Faye Harris, an American photojournalist. In 1981, Springfield had a six-month relationship with singer-musician Carole Pope of the rock band Rough Trade. During periods of psychological and professional instability, Springfield&#x27;s involvement in some intimate relationships, influenced by addiction, resulted in episodes of personal injury. 

She met an American actress, Teda Bracci, at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in 1982 and they moved in together in April 1983. Seven months later they exchanged vows at a wedding ceremony, which was not recognised under California law. The pair had a &quot;tempestuous&quot; relationship which led to an altercation with both hospitalised. Bracci hit Springfield in the mouth with a saucepan and knocked out her teeth, necessitating plastic surgery. The pair separated within two years.

== Death==
In January 1994, while recording her album, &quot;A Very Fine Love&quot;, in Nashville, Springfield began to feel ill. When she returned to England a few months later, her physicians diagnosed her with breast cancer. She received months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and the cancer was found to be in remission. In 1995, in apparent good health, she set about to promote the album, which was released that year. By mid-1996, the cancer had returned, and despite vigorous treatments, Springfield died on 2 March 1999, aged 59, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

Springfield&#x27;s funeral service was attended by hundreds of fans and people from the music business, including Elvis Costello, Lulu, and the Pet Shop Boys. It was held at the Anglican St Mary the Virgin church in Henley-on-Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_3/10/1999&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A marker dedicated to her memory was placed in the church graveyard. In accordance with Springfield&#x27;s wishes, she was cremated and some of her ashes were buried at Henley, while the rest were scattered by her brother, Tom Springfield, at the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland.

==Legacy==
She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame two weeks after her death. Her friend Elton John helped induct her into the Hall of Fame declaring, &quot;I&#x27;m biased but I just think she was the greatest white singer there ever has been... every song she sang, she claimed as her own&quot;.

Of the female singers of the British Invasion, Springfield made one of the biggest impressions on the US market, scoring 18 singles in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 from 1964 to 1970 including six in the top 20. Quentin Tarantino caused a revival of interest in her music in 1994 by including &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; on the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; soundtrack, which sold over three million copies. In the same year in the documentary &quot;Dusty Springfield: Full Circle&quot;, guests of her 1965 &quot;Sound of Motown&quot; show credited her efforts with helping to popularise US soul music in the UK. In 2008, country/blues singer-songwriter Shelby Lynne recorded a tribute album featuring ten of Springfield&#x27;s songs as well as one original. The album, titled &quot;Just a Little Lovin&#x27;&quot;, featured two tracks selected from Springfield&#x27;s debut, four from &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; and four from her back catalogue. Lynne&#x27;s album received critical acclaim, charted at number 41 on the US Billboard Charts and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album (Non-Classical).

Springfield was popular in Europe and performed at the Sanremo Music Festival. Recordings were released in French, German, and Italian. Her French works include a 1964 four-track extended play with &quot;Demain tu peux changer&quot; (also known as &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot;), &quot;Je ne peux pas t&#x27;en vouloir&quot; (&quot;Losing You&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;été est fini&quot; (&quot;Summer is Over&quot;), and &quot;Reste encore un instant&quot; (&quot;Stay Awhile&quot;). German recordings include the July 1964 single, &quot;Warten und hoffen&quot; (&quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin) backed with &quot;Auf dich nur wart&#x27; ich immerzu&quot; (&quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;). Italian recordings include &quot;Tanto so che poi mi passa&quot; (&quot;Every Day I Have to Cry&quot;) issued as a single. Her entries at the Sanremo festival were &quot;Tu che ne sai&quot; and &quot;Di fronte all&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;I Will Always Want You&quot;). Springfield is known to have brought many little-known soul singers to the attention of a wider UK record-buying audience. In April 1965, she hosted a special Motown edition of the hugely popular British TV music series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, featuring the first national TV performances of many top-selling Motown artists. Although her music was not directly associated with the British music/dance movement northern soul, her efforts were seen as a contributing factor in the formation of the genre.

Springfield is a cultural icon of the Swinging Sixties, where she &quot;was an instantly recognisable celebrity&quot;. In public and on stage, she developed a joyful image supported by her peroxide-blonde bouffant hairstyle, evening gowns and heavy make-up that included her much-copied &quot;panda eye&quot; mascara. She borrowed elements of her look from blonde glamour queens such as Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve and pasted them together according to her own taste. By the 1990s, she had become a camp icon, especially with her ultra-glamorous look and this, combined with her emotive vocal performances, won her a powerful and enduring following in the gay community. Besides being a prototypical female for drag queens, she was presented in the roles of the &#x27;Great White Lady&#x27; of pop and soul and the &#x27;Queen of Mods&#x27;.

== Awards and tributes ==
Springfield is an inductee of the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), the UK Music Hall of Fame (2006), and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame (2023). She was named among the top 25 female artists of all time by readers of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine (May 1999), editors of &quot;Q&quot; magazine (January 2002), and a panel of artists on VH1 TV channel (August 2007). In 2008, she appeared at No. 35 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In the 1960s she topped a number of popularity polls, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Best International Vocalist for 1966; in 1965 she was the first British singer to top the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; readers&#x27; polls for Female Singer topping that poll again in 1966, 1967, and 1969 as well as getting the most votes in the British Singer category from 1964 to 1966. Her album &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; has been listed among the greatest albums of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and in polls by VH1 artists, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; readers, and the Channel 4 viewers; in 2001 she received the Grammy Hall of Fame award.

In March 1999, Springfield was scheduled to receive her award at Buckingham Palace as an officer of the Order of the British Empire, given for &quot;services to popular music&quot;. Due to the recurrence of the singer&#x27;s breast cancer, officials of Queen Elizabeth II gave permission for the medal to be collected earlier in January, by Wickham and it was presented to Springfield in hospital with a small group of friends and relatives attending. She died on the day that she would otherwise have collected her award from the Palace. Various films and stage musicals have been created or proposed to commemorate her life. On 12 January 2006 an Australian stage musical, &quot;Dusty – The Original Pop Diva&quot;, received its world premiere at the State Theatre of the Victorian Arts Centre in Melbourne. In May 2008, actress Nicole Kidman was announced as the star and producer of a biographical film, but in July 2012 it had yet to surface. Another reported candidate for a role as Springfield was Madonna in a TV film project. Universal Pictures scheduled a biopic with Kristin Chenoweth in the starring role. However, according to Chenoweth in January 2012, the project&#x27;s status was in limbo and the &quot;script… needed a lot of work&quot;.

In 1970, US jazz singer-pianist Blossom Dearie recorded a tribute song, &quot;Dusty Springfield&quot;, on her album &quot;That&#x27;s Just the Way I Want to Be&quot;–it was co-written by Dearie, Tanega (Springfield&#x27;s then-partner), and Jim Council. UK singer-songwriter David Westlake on his 2002 release, &quot;Play Dusty for Me&quot;, &quot;fêted [Springfield] in both the album title and opening title track&quot;. US singer-songwriter Shelby Lynne&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Just a Little Lovin&#x27;&quot; (2008), was issued as a tribute. In 2012, a biographical jukebox musical titled &quot;Forever Dusty&quot; opened Off-Broadway in New York City at New World Stages. The production starred Kirsten Holly Smith as Springfield; Smith also co-wrote the book of the musical. In 2015, Springfield was named by Equality Forum as being one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month. On 8 November 2022, she was honoured with a Google Doodle to celebrate her life and career.

<text>SST Records is an American independent record label formed in 1978 in Long Beach, California by musician Greg Ginn. The company was first founded in 1966 by Ginn at age 12 as Solid State Transmitters, a small business through which he sold electronics equipment. Ginn repurposed the company as a record label to release material by his band Black Flag.

Music writer Michael Azerrad wrote, &quot;Ginn took his label from a cash-strapped, cop-hassled store-front operation to easily the most influential and popular underground indie of the Eighties&quot;. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, Epitaph, Alternative Tentacles, and Dischord, SST helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. SST initially focused on releasing material by hardcore punk groups from Southern California. As many of the bands on the label sought to expand beyond the limitations of the hardcore genre, SST released many key albums that were instrumental in the development of American alternative rock, including releases by the Minutemen, Hüsker Dü, the Meat Puppets, Bad Brains, Soundgarden, Sonic Youth, and Dinosaur Jr. After a peak release schedule in the late 1980s, SST began venturing into jazz releases. SST is now based in Taylor, Texas. Sonic Youth, Soundgarden, Dinosaur Jr., and the Meat Puppets have reclaimed the rights to their respective SST material after leaving the label.

==History==

===Early years===
Greg Ginn created Solid State Tuners (SST) at the age of 12. SST was a mail-order business that sold modified World War II surplus radio equipment. The business was small but thrived well into Ginn&#x27;s early adulthood.

In 1976 Ginn formed the punk rock band Panic. Panic recorded eight songs in January 1978, but no labels were interested in releasing the music aside from Los Angeles, California record label Bomp! Records. By late 1978 Bomp! had still not formally agreed to release the music on record, so Ginn decided he had enough business experience with SST to release it himself. Pressing records turned out to be a simple matter; &quot;I just looked in the phone book under record pressing plants and there was one there&quot;, Ginn recalled, &quot;and so I just took it to them and I knew about printing because I had always done catalogs.&quot; SST Records released the music recorded by Ginn&#x27;s band (now named Black Flag) as the &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; EP in January 1979.

Many early Black Flag shows ended in violence, often involving the Los Angeles Police Department. As a result, the police tapped the label&#x27;s phones and kept the SST office under surveillance. Ginn claims undercover police posing as homeless people sat close to SST&#x27;s front door. The band were unable to hire a lawyer because of a lack of money; Ginn later explained: &quot;I mean, we were thinking about skimping on our meals. … There was no place to go&quot;. By 1980, L.A. clubs had begun to ban hardcore punk shows, adding to SST&#x27;s troubles.

SST issued the Minutemen&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Paranoid Time&quot; as its second release in 1980. The songs were recorded and mixed in a single night for $300. Minutemen bassist Mike Watt recalled, &quot;It was at that point we realized all you had to do was pay for the pressings, that records weren&#x27;t a gift from Mount Olympus . . . Maybe it was from Greg&#x27;s experience with ham radios, but he believed if you try, you can get things beyond your little group.&quot; Facing hostility towards hardcore punk, SST groups like Black Flag and the Minutemen played wherever they could, mainly at house parties and in basements early on. Black Flag began traveling up the California coast to play Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, making seven trips in total. SST house record producer Spot went along as sound-man and tour manager, a job he would perform for several years, along with helping to record much of the label&#x27;s music.

SST sold its releases to small distributors at a deliberately low price; however, since the distributors typically sold import records, the records usually ended up in specialty shops where they would sell for high prices. Ginn decided to release the first Black Flag album &quot;Damaged&quot; (1981) via a mainstream distributor. SST struck a deal with MCA Records to co-release &quot;Damaged&quot; on Unicorn Records, a smaller label distributed by MCA. Just prior to the album&#x27;s release, MCA decided not to release &quot;Damaged,&quot; citing its &quot;anti-parent&quot; subject matter. SST sued Unicorn claiming the label did not pay rightful royalties and expenses for the album. Unicorn countersued and obtained an injunction preventing Black Flag from releasing further material until the case was settled. When SST released the Black Flag compilation &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;, Unicorn took SST to court in July 1983. Ginn and Black Flag bassist Chuck Dukowski (who had become a co-owner of SST) were found in violation of the injunction and were sent to the Los Angeles County Jail for five days. Late in 1983 Unicorn went bankrupt and Black Flag was able to release records again.

===Expansion and diversification===
Despite its legal troubles, SST continued to release records by artists including Minutemen, Saccharine Trust, and Meat Puppets. In 1982 Minneapolis hardcore group Hüsker Dü became the label&#x27;s first non-West Coast signing. Following the resolution of the debacle with Unicorn Records, SST released four Black Flag albums in 1984. The multiple Black Flag albums, along with the double album releases &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; and &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; by Hüsker Dü and the Minutemen, respectively, stretched the label&#x27;s resources. While SST believed &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; would be a sizable underground hit, pressings of over 5,000 copies were unknown territory for the label, so it erred on the side of caution and did not print over that number in its initial pressing. Awarded critical acclaim by several mainstream media outlets, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; sold out quickly and remained out of print for months. Ginn decided to cut the promotional costs of the Black Flag albums by issuing them in quick succession and having the band tour solidly behind the releases.

During the mid-1980s Hüsker Dü became SST&#x27;s star attraction, their strong songwriting and increasingly melodic music becoming the key link between hardcore and the developing sound of college rock. The steady recording and release of records by the band (which released three albums over the course of 1984 and 1985) created an influx of income for the label and afforded it leverage to gather payment from distributors for other releases. However, the band felt that SST did not devote enough attention to its releases; Hüsker Dü drummer Grant Hart said after the band left the label, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a little reluctance on their part to let anything get a little more attention than Black Flag.&quot; In 1985, Hüsker Dü wanted to self-produce its third studio album, &quot;New Day Rising&quot;. Ignoring the band&#x27;s wishes, SST assigned Spot to supervise the sessions. Grant Hart later explained: &quot;We had no other choice but to work with him. SST &quot;made&quot; us work with him&quot;. Aware of the tension, Spot &quot;had to do what the record company wanted&quot;. &quot;New Day Rising&quot;, as a result, became one of the last recordings Spot did for the label, and the band soon signed to major label Warner Bros. Records.

SST&#x27;s roster was further diminished by the 1985 demise of the Minutemen (the result of the death of guitarist D. Boon) and the 1986 breakup of Black Flag. The label replaced these bands with new signings Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, and Bad Brains. Sonic Youth mentioned SST often in interviews and in music writer Michael Azerrad&#x27;s estimation, &quot;seemed to be actively campaigning to get signed to the indie powerhouse&quot;; in turn, Sonic Youth was instrumental in getting SST to sign Dinosaur Jr. Gerard Cosloy, manager of Dinosaur Jr&#x27;s previous label Homestead Records, said, &quot;SST was the label everyone wanted to be on [. . .] Everyone&#x27;s favorite bands were on the label; SST was funnier and cooler and it also had the machinery.&quot;

In 1986, Ginn bought New Alliance Records from Mike Watt, who had founded the label with D. Boon. Ginn and SST proceeded to reissue some of New Alliance&#x27;s key releases—albums by Descendents, Hüsker Dü&#x27;s &quot;Land Speed Record&quot;, and all of the Minutemen&#x27;s non-SST releases—on SST. He then converted New Alliance to a label based around unusual jazz, rock, and spoken word releases.

In the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s, Ginn started two SST-distributed sub-labels. The first, Cruz Records, which started in 1987, released three solo records by Ginn in the space of a year, and also released records by ALL, Big Drill Car, and Chemical People. The second, the short-lived Issues Records, concentrated on spoken-word releases, including a double album by former NBA player Bill Walton with music by Ray Manzarek.

===Decline in prominence===
Several artists left SST in the late 1980s. By 1987, just a year after signing with the label, Sonic Youth had grown disenchanted with it. Guitarist Thurston Moore said, &quot;SST&#x27;s accounting was a bit suspect to us&quot;, and the group&#x27;s other guitarist Lee Ranaldo criticized the label&#x27;s &quot;stoner administrative quality&quot;. The band was also dissatisfied with Ginn&#x27;s newer signings. Unhappy that income from their records was ultimately helping to fund &quot;lame-ass records&quot;, Sonic Youth acrimoniously left the label and signed with Enigma Records in 1988. Dinosaur Jr left SST for Blanco y Negro Records in 1990. Frontman J Mascis said, &quot;I like Greg Ginn and stuff, but they wouldn&#x27;t pay you.&quot;

In 1987 SST released over 80 titles, a &quot;ridiculous amount even by major label standards&quot;, according to Azerrad. SST&#x27;s prestige declined and by 1990 Seattle-based indie label Sub Pop had upstaged SST. SST&#x27;s reputation was damaged severely when sound collage group Negativland fought a long legal battle with SST in the wake of its sampling lawsuit over their notorious &quot;cover&quot; of U2&#x27;s hit &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;, on the 1991 &quot;U2&quot; single. The case was settled when Ginn and SST agreed to fully release most of Negativland&#x27;s masters (mainly their &quot;Over The Edge&quot; series of cassettes) in exchange for completing work on a live album that had been planned long before their legal battles began, as well as keeping Negativland&#x27;s three SST releases on the label for a short period (the copyright in those has since reverted to Negativland). This entire battle was later the basis for Negativland&#x27;s 1995 book/CD, &quot;Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2&quot;. (One bit of detournement took the bumper sticker &quot;SST: Corporate Rock Still Sucks&quot; and made it into &quot;Corporate SST Still Sucks Rock&quot;.)

SST went into near-hibernation in the mid-90s, deleting much of its jazz output, and releasing little new material apart from Ginn&#x27;s projects (including Confront James, Mojack), but still keeping the catalogs of Black Flag, the Minutemen, Firehose, Hüsker Dü, the Descendents, and Bad Brains in print. Several artists formerly on the label, including Sonic Youth and the Meat Puppets, sued SST to reclaim their master recordings, claiming unpaid royalties. The label had ceased releasing any material by the end of the 1990s. Ginn blamed this on the bankruptcy of the label&#x27;s distributor, DNA. The label eventually resumed releasing new material in the mid-2000s. However, these new releases have been restricted to Ginn-related projects like Gone, Hor, Jambang, and Greg Ginn and the Taylor Texas Corrugators.

In 2002, Ginn signed a new distribution deal with Koch Records and announced a series of new releases from his various projects. In 2006, independent digital music distributor The Orchard announced that 94 titles from SST&#x27;s back catalog would become available on digital services like eMusic and the iTunes Music Store.

<doc id="147719" wikidata="Q483027" url="?curid=147719" title="Paolo Maldini">
<text>Paolo Cesare Maldini (; born 26 June 1968) is an Italian football executive and former professional footballer who played as a left-back or as a centre-back for AC Milan and the Italy national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time. As the Milan and Italy captain for many years, he was nicknamed &quot;Il Capitano&quot;. Maldini held the record for appearances in Serie A (647), until he was surpassed by Gianluigi Buffon in 2020. He also holds the joint-record for most European Cup/UEFA Champions League final appearances (8) alongside Paco Gento. From 2018 to 2023 he worked at AC Milan as sporting director and is a co-owner of USL Championship club Miami FC.

Maldini spent all 25 seasons of his playing career in Serie A with Milan and retired at the age of 41 in 2009. He won 26 trophies with Milan: the European Cup/UEFA Champions League five times, seven Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana titles, five European/UEFA Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups, and one FIFA Club World Cup. Maldini won the Best Defender award at the UEFA Club Football Awards at the age of 39, as well as the Serie A Defender of the Year Award in 2004. Following his retirement, Milan retired his number 3 shirt.

Maldini made his debut for Italy in 1988 and played for 14 years before retiring in 2002 with 7 goals and 126 caps. He held the record for appearances with Italy, until he was surpassed by Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon. Maldini captained Italy for eight years and held the record for appearances as Italy&#x27;s captain (75), until he was again surpassed by Cannavaro and Buffon. With Italy, Maldini took part in four FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships. Although he did not win a tournament, he reached the final of the 1994 World Cup and Euro 2000 and the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup and Euro 1988. He was elected into the all-star teams for all of these tournaments.

Maldini came second to George Weah for FIFA World Player of the Year in 1995. He also came third in the Ballon d&#x27;Or rankings in 1994 and 2003. In 2002, he was named in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team. In 2004, Pelé named him in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. He was ranked 21st in &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century. He was also named in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team in 2020. Maldini held the record for most appearances in UEFA Club competitions, with 174, until he was surpassed by Iker Casillas in 2017. He holds the record for appearances with Milan (902) and is one of the few players to have made over 1,000 career appearances. In December 2012, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

==Club career==
===1978–1987: Youth career, AC Milan senior debut and early professional career===
In 1978, at the age of 10, Maldini had his first tryout for AC Milan youth academy. Prior to that, he had only played street football. He successfully played the test game as a right midfielder or winger in the 4–4–2 formation and was accepted into his age group&#x27;s squad. He would continue playing in this position until the age of 14, when he was moved to right full-back. Due to him being good on the ball with both of his feet, he would sometimes be fielded on the left side as well.

Maldini won the Coppa Italia Primavera with the Milan Youth side during the 1984–85 season, and he made his league debut for Milan under manager Nils Liedholm during the same season on 20 January 1985, replacing the injured Sergio Battistini in a match against Udinese at age 16. It was his only league appearance of the campaign, but he was immediately made a member of the starting eleven the following season, at age 17, at right-back, being handed the number 3 shirt, which had previously also belonged to his father, Cesare. Maldini also made his Coppa Italia debut in 1985, on 21 August, while his debut in European competition also came later that same year, on 18 September. He scored the first of his 29 goals in Serie A on 4 January 1987 in a 1–0 win against Como.

===1987–1991: Domestic and international success with &quot;The immortals&quot;===
The 1987–88 &quot;Scudetto&quot; under Arrigo Sacchi marked Maldini&#x27;s first trophy, and the first of seven league titles, with the club. Nicknamed &quot;The Immortals&quot;, Sacchi&#x27;s Milan side is remembered for including the Dutch trio of Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten, as well as the Italian midfielders Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Donadoni (and later Demetrio Albertini), and a strong defensive lineup. Under Sacchi and later Fabio Capello, Maldini formed with long-timers Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, as well as Filippo Galli, Stefano Nava and later Christian Panucci, one of football&#x27;s strongest defensive quartets of all time. During the 1987–88 Serie A season, Milan only conceded 14 goals, finishing with the best defence in Italy, as they went on to win the Serie A title. Maldini went on to win the 1988 Supercoppa Italiana with Milan the following season, and followed up this trophy with back to back European Cup titles in 1988–89 and 1989–90, while Milan finished in third and in second place in Serie A during those respective seasons. On 19 February 1989, Maldini made his 100th appearance in Serie A.

Milan reached the final of the 1989–90 Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus. Milan also managed to capture successive European Super Cup titles in 1989 and 1990, as well as successive Intercontinental Cup titles, once again 1989 and 1990. The following season, in Sacchi&#x27;s final season with the club, Milan were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the European Cup by eventual finalists Marseille, and finished second in Serie A, behind Sampdoria, once again with the best defence in the league, conceding only 19 goals. Milan reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual champions Roma. In 1989, Maldini was awarded the Bravo Award, as the best under-23 player in European Competitions.

===1991–1996: Continued success with &quot;The invincibles&quot;===
Under Sacchi&#x27;s replacement, Fabio Capello, Milan continued to be a dominant force in Italy and in Europe. Maldini was also part of Milan&#x27;s undefeated Serie A team, which won the championship in the 1991–92 season; in total, Milan went unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 league matches, earning the nickname &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. This championship was Milan&#x27;s first of three consecutive Serie A titles under Capello in the early 1990s. Maldini helped Milan defend the Serie A title the following season, and reach the first of three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals. Milan lost the 1993 Champions League final in a 1–0 defeat to Marseille. That season, Maldini scored his first goal in European Competitions on 21 October 1992 in a 1–0 Champions League win against Slovan Bratislava, and also made his 200th appearance in Serie A on 4 October of the same year. The following season, Milan captured their third consecutive Serie A title, finishing with the best defence in Italy, conceding just 15 goals. Maldini also helped lead Milan to a second consecutive Champions League final, where he helped his team defeat Barcelona. Due to Alessandro Costacurta&#x27;s suspension and injuries sustained to Franco Baresi, Jean-Pierre Papin and Marco van Basten, Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;, coached by Johan Cruyff, were heavy favourites to win the trophy, with the formidable attacking duo of Romário and Hristo Stoichkov. Despite their key absences, Maldini helped the Milan defence keep a clean sheet and overcome Barcelona 4–0 in the final, with two goals from Daniele Massaro and one each from Dejan Savićević and Marcel Desailly.

After winning his third Champions League title and reaching the 1994 World Cup final, Maldini became the first defender ever to win &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual World Player of the Year Award. During his acceptance speech, Maldini called his milestone &quot;a particular matter of pride because defenders generally receive so much less attention from fans and the media than goalscorers. We are more in the engine room rather than taking the glory&quot;. He then singled out Milan captain Franco Baresi as a player who &quot;really [deserved] to receive the sort of award I have received&quot;. Maldini also placed third in the 1994 Ballon d&#x27;Or, behind Stoichkov and compatriot Roberto Baggio, and fifth in the FIFA World Player of the Year Award.

The following season, Milan and Maldini captured their third consecutive Supercoppa Italiana under Capello, and won the European Super Cup, missing out on the Intercontinental Cup. After three consecutive titles, Milan were unable to retain their Serie A title, although they reached their third consecutive Champions League final, where they were defeated 1–0 by Ajax. Maldini came second behind future teammate George Weah in the 1995 FIFA World Player of the Year Award for his performances. On 17 February 1995, he made his 300th appearance in Serie A. Maldini was able to capture his fifth Serie A title, and his fourth under Capello, the following season.

===1996–2001: Assuming the captaincy, struggles, and 1999 Serie A title===
Following Capello&#x27;s departure, and the aging and retirement of several key players, Milan suffered disappointing results during the next few seasons, undergoing several managerial changes. Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana to Fiorentina in 1996, and failed to qualify for European competitions for two consecutive seasons, as well as suffering a group stage elimination in the 1996–97 Champions League. Following Franco Baresi&#x27;s and Mauro Tassotti&#x27;s retirement after the 1996–97 season, Maldini was appointed Milan&#x27;s captain. Despite the difficulties Milan encountered during this period, through Maldini&#x27;s leadership, they reached the Coppa Italia final in 1998, losing to Lazio, and won the 1998–99 Serie A title under Alberto Zaccheroni, finishing one point ahead of Lazio. He made his 400th Serie A appearance on 25 April 1999. In the 1999–2000 season, Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana against Parma, finished third in Serie A and finished bottom of their Champions League group. Milan were eliminated in the second round of the Champions League the next season and finished in sixth place in Serie A, failing to qualify for the Champions League, and participated in the UEFA Cup the following season.

===2001–2007: New era of success===
Milan again became a dominant force in Italy and in Europe under Carlo Ancelotti. In the 2001–02 season, Milan finished in fourth place, qualifying for the Champions League, and also reached their best ever finish in the UEFA Cup, losing in the semi-finals. In 2002, Maldini was awarded the Premio Nazionale Carriera Esemplare &quot;Gaetano Scirea&quot;, for his career achievements and personality. The following season, Maldini lined up with Alessandro Nesta, Alessandro Costacurta and Cafu, who, along with Jaap Stam during the 2004–05 season, formed a formidable defensive lineup in Italy and in Europe. Milan finished third in Serie A, but Maldini won the first Coppa Italia of his career, defeating Roma in the final. On 15 March 2003, he made his 500th appearance in Serie A.

Milan won the 2002–03 Champions League with Maldini as their captain for the first time in his career, in the first all-Italian final, against Juventus, on 28 May 2003 at Old Trafford. Maldini helped Milan keep a clean sheet, as they defeated Juventus 3–2 on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock following extra time. On that day, it was exactly 40 years since his father, Cesare, had also lifted the European Cup trophy as Milan&#x27;s captain, also in England. He and his father are only one of three other father-son pairs to have also done so; the others being Manuel and Manolo Sanchís of Real Madrid, and Carles and Sergio Busquets of Barcelona. Maldini was elected Man of the Match and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the first time in his career.

The following season, Milan were defeated by Juventus on penalties in the Supercoppa Italiana, and in the Intercontinental Cup final by Boca Juniors, once again on penalties, but managed to defeat Porto to capture yet another UEFA Super Cup. Maldini placed third in the 2003 Ballon d&#x27;Or for the second time in his career. Maldini went on to captain Milan to win the Serie A title that season, with a record 82 points, whilst Milan were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia by Lazio, and in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo de La Coruña. In April 2004, Maldini placed tenth on the &quot;UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll&quot;, an online UEFA survey, which was organised to commemorate the best European footballers of the past 50 years. Maldini was the second-highest placed Italian after Dino Zoff. Maldini was also included in the FIFA 100 list in 2004, which was a selection of the 125 greatest living footballers, chosen by Pelé. Following his Series A-winning performances, Maldini was elected to be the Serie A Defender of the Year in 2004 at the Italian footballing Awards.

Maldini began the next season by lifting the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana as captain after Milan defeated Lazio. Milan finished second in Serie A to Juventus that season, and reached the Champions League final, only to lose out on penalties to Liverpool, although Maldini opened the scoring in the first minute. In 2005, Maldini was elected to be a part of the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career, and was also elected to be the part of the FIFPro World XI for the first time in his career. The following season, Milan finished second behind Juventus in Serie A once again, and reached the Champions League semi-finals, only to be defeated by eventual champions Barcelona. Both Juventus and Milan were later deducted points for being involved in the 2006 &quot;Calciopoli&quot; matchfixing scandal, and the title was awarded to Internazionale, while Juventus were relegated, with Milan finishing in third place after the point deduction. During the season, Maldini scored his first and only double of his career, against Reggina. On 25 September 2005, Maldini broke Dino Zoff&#x27;s Serie A appearance record after playing his 571st league match against Treviso; seven days earlier, he had played his 800th game in all competitions for Milan.

The following season, Maldini helped to captain Milan to a fourth-place finish, despite their point deduction, leading them to obtain a crucial Champions League qualifying spot. Maldini played his 600th Serie A match on 13 May 2007 in a 1–1 draw at Catania. That season, Maldini captained Milan to their third Champions League final in six years, leading them to a 2–1 victory over Liverpool in the final on 23 May 2007 in Athens, avenging their defeat from 2005. At age 38, Maldini became the oldest captain to lift the Champions League trophy. Maldini participated in eight Champions League finals during his career, which is equalled only by Francisco Gento of Real Madrid; Maldini lifted the trophy five times, twice as captain. In an interview with ESPN aired prior to the 2007 final, Maldini labeled the 2005 Champions League final as the worst moment of his career. A match where he scored the fastest-ever goal in a European Cup final after 51 seconds and became the oldest player ever to score in a final, Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after leading 3–0 at half-time. Maldini was elected the UEFA Club Defender of the Year for his 2007 performances.

In 2007, after Milan won the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla (although Maldini did not appear in the match), Maldini became the first European captain to lift the FIFA Club World Cup after defeating Boca Juniors on 16 December. He announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2007–08 season, saying that he would do so with &quot;no regrets&quot;. Following Milan&#x27;s elimination from the Champions League by Arsenal in March, however, Maldini stated that he would possibly delay his retirement for at least a further year. He signed an extension on 6 June that kept him at Milan for the 2008–09 season.

===2008–2009: Final years and retirement===

On 16 February 2008, in a match against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, Maldini came on for defender Marek Jankulovski to make his 1,000th professional career appearance, of which 861 were with Milan, 12 with the Italy under-21 side, 1 with the Italian Olympic team and 126 with the Italy senior team. In European football, only the English goalkeeper Peter Shilton had collected more appearances at the time: 1,390 between 1966 and 1997. Maldini played his last game in the Champions League on 4 March 2008, a 2–0 loss at the San Siro in the last 16 against Arsenal which eliminated Milan from the 2007–08 Champions League. In 2008, Maldini was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit, as well as the Premio Internazionale Giacinto Facchetti, which is awarded to a player who was demonstrated both skill and fair play throughout his career.

On 18 April 2009, Maldini announced that he would retire at the end of the 2008–09 season. On 17 May 2009, in the Stadio Friuli, Maldini played his 900th official match for Milan in a league game against Udinese. Maldini&#x27;s last match in San Siro was on 24 May, a 3–2 loss against Roma, and was given a standing ovation by the fans. There was a small controversy, however, when the Milan Ultras fans known as &quot;Brigate Rossonere&quot; protested against Maldini as he said goodbye. His last appearance for Milan, and his last game as an active player, was a 2–0 win against Fiorentina on 31 May 2009 in the last match of the Serie A season. This win meant Milan finished in third place and qualified for the following season&#x27;s Champions League. Maldini was once again given a standing ovation by the fans. As they had previously done with Franco Baresi&#x27;s number 6 shirt, Milan retired Maldini&#x27;s number 3 shirt, but stated that it will be bequeathed to one of his sons if one of them were to make the club&#x27;s senior team.

On 28 August 2009 in Monte Carlo, Maldini was awarded a prize for his career by UEFA during the draw for the group stage of the 2009–10 Champions League. On 17 November 2009, Spanish sports newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; awarded Maldini the &quot;Marca Leyenda&quot; prize for his career and achievements.

==International career==
===Early career and 1990 World Cup===

In 1986, Maldini was called up by his father Cesare Maldini to the Italian under-21 national team, and made his debut for the team on 12 November of that year, in a 0–0 draw against Austria; he earned 12 caps and scored five goals in two years with the &quot;azzurrini&quot;, with his first goal coming on 11 February 1987, in a 2–1 win against Portugal. Maldini was also member of the under-21 team that finished runners-up to Spain in the 1986 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Two years later, he also featured for the under-21 team that was eliminated in the first round against eventual winners France in the 1988 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

Maldini made his senior debut for the Italy senior team at age 19 on 31 March 1988 in a 1–1 friendly draw against Yugoslavia in Split, and made one appearance for the Italy Olympic squad on 28 October 1987, although he was not part of the team that finished in fourth place at the 1988 Olympics. Maldini featured in all four of Italy&#x27;s games at UEFA Euro 1988, where they reached the semi-finals, losing to the Soviet Union. In the opening match of the tournament on 10 June, a 1–1 draw against hosts West Germany, he became the youngest player ever to feature for Italy at the UEFA European Championship, at the age of 19 years and 350 days.

Maldini participated in his first World Cup in 1990 on home soil, appearing in all seven Italy matches. He helped Italy to win five consecutive games and was a starting member of the defence that kept a FIFA World Cup record of five consecutive clean sheets. The Italian defence eventually conceded an equalising goal in the semi-final match against Carlos Bilardo&#x27;s Argentina, after going a World Cup record total of 518 minutes without conceding. Following two periods of extra time, in which neither team was able to score, Italy lost out to Argentina on penalties. Italy eventually placed third after defeating England 2–1 in the third-place final match, and finishing the tournament with the best defence having conceded two goals throughout the entire World Cup. Maldini was elected to be part of the Team of the Tournament.

===1994 World Cup final and appointment to captaincy===
Maldini&#x27;s first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2–0 friendly win over Mexico in Florence on 20 January 1993. Maldini was part of the Italy squad that participated in the 1992 U.S. Cup, finishing in second place in the friendly tournament, behind the host nation. Italy failed to qualify for Euro 1992, finishing second in their group, but qualified for the 1994 World Cup, where Maldini was named vice-captain for Italy. During the 1994 World Cup, Maldini played in all seven of Italy&#x27;s matches, and deputised for the injured Franco Baresi in the matches against Mexico, Nigeria, Spain and Bulgaria, keeping a clean sheet in the group match against Norway. Maldini led the Italian defence to the final, playing both as a centre-back and as a full-back, due to the absences of his Milan and Italy defensive teammates Baresi, due to injury, Mauro Tassotti, due to suspension after the quarter-finals, and Alessandro Costacurta, who was suspended for the final. Maldini helped Italy keep a clean sheet in the final against favourites Brazil as the team eventually lost on penalties. As in 1990, Maldini was named in the Team of the Tournament, 32 years after his father Cesare received the same honour at the 1962 World Cup.
After Franco Baresi&#x27;s international retirement in 1994, Maldini was appointed the team&#x27;s full-time captain. A disappointing Euro 1996 campaign saw Italy eliminated in the group stage with four points, in a group which contained the two eventual finalists of the tournament, Germany and the Czech Republic. Maldini played in all three of Italy&#x27;s group matches.

The 1998 World Cup in France saw Italy start strongly, topping their group. Maldini played in all five of Italy&#x27;s matches, and started the play that led to Christian Vieri&#x27;s opening goal in Italy&#x27;s first match against Chile, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Maldini, partnering with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Giuseppe Bergomi, also helped Italy to keep clean sheets in the second group match against Cameroon, the round of 16 match Norway and France in the quarter-finals, but Italy eventually went out of the tournament to the hosts and eventual champions on penalties, for the third consecutive time in a World Cup.

===Euro 2000 final and fourth World Cup===
Maldini made his 100th appearance for Italy on 28 April 1999, in a 0–0 friendly away draw against Croatia, under manager Dino Zoff. The following year, Italy reached the final of Euro 2000, but lost once again to defending World Cup champions France in extra time. Maldini played in all six of Italy&#x27;s matches during the tournament. Italy topped their group, winning every match, and Maldini, starting alongside Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, helped the Italian defence to concede only two goals en route to the final, keeping clean sheets against co-hosts Belgium in the group stage, Romania in the quarter-finals and co-hosts the Netherlands in the semi-finals. A ten-man Italy advanced to the final on penalties after a 0–0 draw with the Dutch following extra time. Although Maldini missed his penalty, Italy won the shootout 3–1. Italy were leading 1–0 in the final until Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the final minute of stoppage time. David Trezeguet scored the golden goal in the 103rd minute, in extra time. In all of the three UEFA European Championships in which Maldini participated, he was elected to be part of the team of the tournament for his performances.

On 7 October 2000, in a 3–0 win over Romania in Milan in a 2002 World Cup qualifier, Maldini overtook Dino Zoff to become Italy&#x27;s most capped player of all time with his 113th senior international appearance for Italy. Maldini played in his fourth World Cup, and his second as captain, in the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. He helped Italy keep a clean sheet in their opening win against Ecuador, and played in all four of Italy&#x27;s matches. Italy disappointed in the remaining group matches, but went on to the knockout round as the second placed team of their group. On 18 June, immediately after a ten-man Italy were controversially eliminated in the round of sixteen, by a golden goal, to co-hosts South Korea, Maldini retired from international football, at the age of 34, as Italy&#x27;s most capped player. He scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his 16 years as an international as team captain, wearing the armband a record 74 times, until he was overtaken by Cannavaro, and subsequently Buffon. Despite his performances for his country, Maldini was unable to win a trophy, although he reached the final of both the World Cup and the European Championship. Maldini made 23 appearances in World Cups, the third-highest total after Lothar Matthäus, who appeared in 25 matches and Lionel Messi, who appeared in 26 matches. Maldini once held the record for most minutes played at the FIFA World Cup (2,217 minutes), which was also later broken by Messi at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

In February 2009, Italian head coach Marcello Lippi declared his support for a testimonial match for Maldini, stating that it would give him a chance to play for the &quot;Azzurri&quot; for a final time. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) offered him a place in the line-up in a friendly match against Northern Ireland. Maldini, however, rejected the offer, saying that he wanted to part with football in an &quot;official&quot; match.

==After retirement==

Prior to his retirement, Maldini stated that he wouldn&#x27;t become a coach. He was offered a position that would have reunited him with his former coach Carlo Ancelotti by joining Chelsea as a coach. Maldini had met up with Ancelotti and with Chelsea&#x27;s owner, Roman Abramovich, to discuss such a possibility. Ancelotti later revealed that Maldini had turned down the offer.

In 2012, Maldini was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Maldini played in the 11th Match Against Poverty on 4 March 2014 alongside other footballers such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, and Pavel Nedvěd, which was held in Bern, Switzerland, with the proceeds being donated to the recovery efforts in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan. On 1 September 2014, Maldini, along with other footballers, took part in the &quot;Match for Peace&quot;, which was played at the Stadio Olimpico, Rome, with the proceeds being donated to charity. In May 2015, Maldini became the co-owner of North American Soccer League (NASL) club Miami FC alongside television rights entrepreneur Riccardo Silva, in hope that the club could join the Major League Soccer (MLS) in the future. On 1 May 2016, Maldini became the second player after Southampton&#x27;s Matthew Le Tissier to receive the One Club Award from La Liga club Athletic Bilbao; he was presented with the prize at half-time, during the club&#x27;s 2–1 home win over Celta de Vigo, and received a standing ovation from the attending fans.

In June 2017, Maldini and his tennis partner Stefano Landonio qualified for the Aspria Tennis Cup in Milan, a professional tennis tournament on the ATP Challenger Tour, after winning a qualifier in Italy. They were defeated in the first round by Tomasz Bednarek and David Pel by a score of 6–1, 6–1. After the defeat, Maldini stated that it was his last professional tennis match.

===2018–2023: Return to AC Milan===
In August 2018, a few weeks after Milan&#x27;s changed their ownership to Elliott Management Corporation, Maldini accepted an offer to become the sporting director for the club. This marked his comeback to the club since his retirement from professional football. On 14 June 2019, Maldini was promoted to technical director.

Milan won the 2021–22 Serie A title, the first title since 2011, with Maldini helping sign a bunch of key players for the victorious squad, namely Théo Hernandez, Pierre Kalulu, Rafael Leão, Olivier Giroud, Fikayo Tomori, and Mike Maignan, the latter of which was named the Best Goalkeeper of the 2021–22 season. In addition, Leão was awarded the MVP of the season.

On 1 July 2022, one day after Maldini&#x27;s contract expired, it was announced that he would remain Milan&#x27;s technical director for two more years. On 17 November 2022, he was recognised as Sporting Director of the Year alongside fellow Milan director Frederic Massara at the 2022 Globe Soccer Awards.

On 6 June 2023, Milan terminated his contract.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Although he played as a left-back for most of his career, Maldini was right-footed and began playing for Milan as a right-back. He was switched to the left-back position by manager Arrigo Sacchi due to Mauro Tassotti occupying the right side for Milan.
Maldini was renowned for his aerial abilities, sliding tackles, speed, and stamina. He was also an excellent attacker, as he scored and assisted many goals throughout his career. In the final few years of his career, as he lost speed, he was moved to a centre-back position, where he excelled in relying on his experience, aerial abilities, and tackling to stop attackers.

Maldini was renowned for his tactical intelligence and ability to anticipate threats from the opposition. Despite being a precise tackler and an imposing defensive presence, he often avoided committing to challenges when he deemed them unnecessary, preferring to restrict the offensive play of his opponents through his positioning and man-marking. His excellent passing allowed him to play in the sweeper or &quot;libero&quot; position.

===Legacy===
Maldini is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time and is referred to as &quot;an icon and gentleman of the game&quot;. He was known for his calm and composed manner on the pitch, his ability to read the game, and his discipline on the pitch, as he only received three red cards throughout his entire career. In a 2002 FIFA poll, Maldini was named in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team.

Maldini was the first defender to be shortlisted for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, finishing second in 1995. He also finished third in the Ballon d&#x27;Or rankings in 1994 and in 2003. In addition to his team success, he also won many individual awards, including the UEFA Defender of the Year, the Serie A Defender of the Year, the Bravo Award, and the World Soccer Player of the Year. He was also named in the UEFA Team of the Year, the FIFPro World XI, the World Cup Team of the Tournament, and the European Championship Team of the Tournament during his career. He was also renowned for his longevity, as he became a starter for Milan as a teenager and remained as a starter until his retirement at the age of 41.

Throughout his career, Maldini was also a leader and captain for Milan and for the Italy national team, earning the nickname &quot;Il Capitano&quot; (&quot;The Captain&quot;). He was renowned for his vocal and commanding presence on the pitch and his ability to motivate his teammates and ensure they remained in position. He made over 1,000 professional appearances and he held the record for appearances in Serie A, until he was surpassed by Gianluigi Buffon in 2020, and he still holds this record for Milan in all competitions. Maldini also appeared in a joint-record eight European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals. With 126 caps for Italy, he held the record for appearances with the national team, until he was surpassed by Fabio Cannavaro in 2009 and by Gianluigi Buffon in 2013. He also held the record for appearances as Italy&#x27;s captain (75), until again being surpassed by Cannavaro. Maldini has inspired many defenders like Rio Ferdinand, Rafael Márquez and Carles Puyol.

==Media==
Maldini has appeared in commercials for American sportswear company Nike. He wore Nike Tiempo football boots at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In 1996, he starred in a Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside other footballers such as Ronaldo, Eric Cantona, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, and Jorge Campos, they defend &quot;the beautiful game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors. Maldini states, &quot;Maybe they&#x27;re friendly?&quot; before they begin &quot;destroying evil&quot;, with Cantona striking the ball at the warriors.

Maldini has featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover of the Italian edition of &quot;&quot; and was an Ultimate Team Legend in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

==Personal life==
Maldini was born on 26 June 1968 in Milan to Cesare Maldini and Maria Luisa De Mezzi. In December 1994, he married Venezuelan former model Adriana Fossa. The couple have two sons, Christian (born 14 June 1996) and Daniel (born 11 October 2001), who both played for AC Milan&#x27;s youth teams. His father Cesare played as a defender and also captained Milan and the Italy national team. Cesare then became a coach and coached his son in the Italy under-21 side, the Italy senior team, and the Milan senior team. On 3 April 2016, Cesare died at the age of 84; his wife died on 28 July 2016.

Maldini and his former teammate Christian Vieri run a fashion brand named Sweet Years.

Maldini considers hiself Roman Catholic.

<text>Ennichi (, &quot;related day&quot;) is a day believed to have a special relation () with a particular Japanese deity. Often, it is a day when a deity is believed to have been born or left the world. In Shinto, this day is encouraged to be embraced as it is in the &quot;four affirmations&quot; of their religious code. Japanese people generally think that visiting a temple or a shrine on these holy days related to Kami and/or Buddha will bring greater fortunes than on regular days. Therefore, temples and shrines often hold festivals. At such events, there are generally a large number of food stalls selling Japanese food, such as &quot;takoyaki&quot;, &quot;okonomiyaki&quot;, grilled corn, and cotton candy.

<text>Nabemono (鍋物, なべ物, &quot;nabe&quot; &quot;cooking pot&quot; + &quot;mono&quot; &quot;thing&quot;), or simply nabe, is a variety of Japanese hot pot dishes, also known as one-pot dishes and &quot;things in a pot&quot;.

==Description==
Nabemono are stews and soups containing many types of ingredients that are served while still boiling. Nabe is thus typically enjoyed in cold days or the winter. In modern Japan, nabemono are kept hot at the dining table by portable stoves. The dish is frequently cooked at the table, and the diners can pick the cooked ingredients they want from the pot. It is either eaten with the broth or with a dip. Further ingredients can also be successively added to the pot.

There are two types of nabemono in Japan: lightly flavored stock (mostly with kombu) types such as &quot;yudōfu&quot; (湯豆腐) and &quot;mizutaki&quot; (水炊き), eaten with a dipping sauce (&quot;tare&quot;) to enjoy the taste of the ingredients themselves; and strongly flavored stock, typically with miso, soy sauce, dashi, and/or sweet soy types such as &quot;yosenabe&quot; (寄鍋), &quot;oden&quot; (おでん), and &quot;sukiyaki&quot; (すき焼き), eaten without further flavoring.

The pots are traditionally made of clay (土鍋, &quot;donabe&quot;) or thick cast iron (鉄鍋, &quot;tetsunabe&quot;). Clay pots can keep warm for a while after being taken off the fire, while cast iron pots evenly distribute heat and are preferable for &quot;sukiyaki&quot;. Pots are usually placed in the center of dining tables and are shared by multiple people. This is considered the most sociable way to eat with friends and family.

==Varieties==
* Chankonabe (ちゃんこ鍋): was originally served only to Sumo wrestlers. &quot;Chankonabe&quot; is served with more ingredients than other nabemono, as it was developed to help sumo wrestlers gain weight. Many recipes exist but usually contain meatballs, chicken, vegetables such as Napa cabbage and udon.
* Motsunabe (もつ鍋): made with beef or pork offal, originally a local cuisine of Fukuoka but popularised nationwide in the 1990s because of its taste and reasonable price. The ingredients of motsunabe vary from restaurant to restaurant, but it is typical to boil the fresh cow offal with cabbage and garlic chives. After having offal and vegetables, the rest of soup is used to cook champon noodles. The soup bases are mainly soy sauce or miso.
* Oden: several ingredients such as boiled eggs, daikon, konjac, and processed fishcakes stewed in a light, soy-flavoured dashi broth. Karashi (Japanese mustard) is often used as a condiment. 
* Shabu-shabu: thinly sliced meat and vegetables that are boiled in a pot at the dining table and eaten with a dipping sauce.
* Sukiyaki: thinly sliced beef, tofu, vegetables and starch noodles stewed in sweetened shouyu and eaten with a raw egg dip.
* Yosenabe: Yose (寄) means &quot;putting together&quot;, implying that all things (e.g., meat, seafood, egg, tofu and vegetables) are cooked together in a pot. &quot;Yosenabe&quot; is typically based on a broth made with miso or soy sauce flavourings.
* Yudofu: tofu simmered in a kombu stock and served with ponzu and various condiments.

===Regional variations===

==Sauces==
Nabemono are usually eaten with a sauce sometimes called &quot;tare&quot;, literally &quot;dipping&quot;. Several kinds of sauce can be used with additional spices, called yakumi. Typical yakumi include grated garlic, butter, red pepper, a mixture of red pepper and other spices, roasted sesame, or &quot;momiji oroshi&quot; (a mixture of grated daikon radish and red pepper).

* Ponzu: The common ponzu is made of soy sauce and juice pressed from a bitter orange, sweet sake, and kombu (kelp) stock.
* &quot;Gomadare&quot; (sesame sauce): Sesame sauce is usually made from ground sesame, soy sauce, kelp stock, sake and sugar.
* Beaten raw egg: Most commonly used as the sauce for sukiyaki.

<doc id="147722" wikidata="Q1721423" url="?curid=147722" title="Kaiji Kawaguchi">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. He is known for works such as &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, &quot;Zipang&quot;, &quot;A Spirit of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Kūbo Ibuki&quot;. Generally, his stories involve Japan and examine the moral choices that people make in extreme situations.

==Early life and career==
In elementary school, Kaiji and his younger identical twin brother Kyōji became engrossed in manga. Kyōji took over running the Kawaguchi family business, but was also a manga artist before dying in 2013. Kaiji&#x27;s daughter Nirako is an illustrator, while his eldest son Kōhei is a Kanze noh actor. In 1968, Kaiji made his professional debut with &quot;Yoru ga Aketara&quot; in &quot;Young Comic&quot; at age 21, while still attending Meiji University.

==Influences and style==
Kawaguchi was influenced by Shinji Nagashima, Tatsuhiko Yamagami&#x27;s &quot;Hikaru Kaze&quot;, and Tadao Tsuge. He also said that if it were not for the freedom and more adult material seen in &quot;gekiga&quot;, he probably would not have become a manga artist. In seventh grade he became interested in cinematography after seeing Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. This early influence from film is still seen in his manga &quot;names&quot;, which are largely text and more like film screenplays, which he read for fun in high school, than the usual storyboards.

In the middle of serializing &quot;Hard &amp; Loose&quot; (1983–87), Kawaguchi started drawing the eyes of his characters bigger. This was a suggestion by his editor, who told him that emotion is conveyed through the eyes. Before he made this switch, Kawaguchi said he never would have thought he would be able to draw Westerners and set his manga overseas. The artist cited his work in &quot;Actor&quot; (1984–88) as the basis for his current style. Kawaguchi was a heavy smoker who insisted a cigarette was &quot;indispensable&quot; when drawing. However, after being treated for esophageal cancer in 2019, he quit smoking.

<doc id="147723" wikidata="Q471866" url="?curid=147723" title="Miso soup">
<text>is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of miso paste mixed with a &quot;dashi&quot; stock. It is commonly served as part of an meal, meaning &quot;one soup, three dishes,&quot; a traditional Japanese meal structure that includes rice, soup, and side dishes. Optional ingredients based on region and season may be added, such as &quot;wakame&quot;, tofu, &quot;negi&quot;, &quot;abura-age&quot;, mushrooms, etc. Along with &quot;suimono&quot; (clear soups), miso soup is considered to be one of the two basic soup types of Japanese cuisine. It is a representative of soup dishes served with rice. 

Miso soup is also called in some parts of Japan, especially around Tokyo.

== Miso paste ==

The type of miso paste chosen for the soup defines a great deal of its character and flavor. Miso pastes (a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and the fungus &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;, known in Japanese as &quot;kōjikin&quot; (麹菌), and sometimes rice, barley, or other ingredients) can be categorized into red (&quot;akamiso&quot;), white (&quot;shiromiso&quot;), or mixed (&quot;awase&quot;). There are many variations within these themes, including regional variations, such as Shinshū miso or Sendai miso.

The amount of time taken also affects its flavor: a miso paste that has been fermented for a shorter period of time, such as a white miso, provides a lighter, sweeter flavor, while one which has been fermented for a longer period, such as a red miso, gives the miso soup a stronger, deeper one.

More than 80% of Japan&#x27;s annual production of miso is used in miso soup, and 75% of all Japanese people consume miso soup at least once a day.

== Stock ==

The most common &quot;dashi&quot; soup stocks for miso soup are made of &quot;niboshi&quot; (dried baby sardines), kombu (dried kelp), &quot;katsuobushi&quot; (thin shavings of dried and smoked bonito (similar to skipjack tuna)), or &quot;hoshi-shiitake&quot; (dried shiitake). The kombu can also be used in combination with &quot;katsuobushi&quot; or &quot;hoshi-shiitake&quot;. The kelp and/or shiitake &quot;dashi&quot; serve as a vegetarian soup stock.

When the ingredients involve clams such as &quot;asari, &quot;shijimi, or &quot;hamaguri&quot;, they will impart flavorings that serve the role of &quot;dashi&quot; and thus it is not necessary to prepare any stock in advance.

Outside Japan, American or European style miso soup is sometimes made by dissolving miso in a Western vegetable stock. The stock might include ingredients such as &quot;negi&quot;, carrot, potato and &quot;daikon&quot; radish. In some versions of the dish, chicken stock, Western-style fish stock, and other non-&quot;dashi&quot; bases can even be used, but there is some debate over whether or not miso soups made using these non-traditional bases count as true miso soup.

== Other ingredients ==
According to Japanese custom, ingredients are chosen to reflect the seasons and to provide contrasts of color, texture, and flavor. Thus negi and tofu, a strongly flavored ingredient mixed with a mildly flavored ingredient, are often combined. Ingredients that float, such as wakame seaweed, and ingredients that sink, such as potatoes, are also combined. Ingredients may include mushrooms (nameko or shiitake), potato, taro, seaweed, green laver, onion, nira, common bean, mitsuba, shrimp, fish, clams, and sliced daikon. Almost any Japanese ingredient may be added to some type of miso soup. However typical miso soup recipes contain a small number of additional ingredients beyond &quot;dashi&quot; stock and miso.

If pork is added to miso soup it is called &quot;tonjiru&quot;, meaning ‘pork soup’. Tonjiru is a soup served for dinner and lunch and not usually eaten for breakfast.

Hearty and robust cold-weather variations may include daikon, deep-fried tofu called &quot;abura-age&quot;, potatoes, onions and dark miso. Lighter variations are better suited for spring and summer and made with ingredients such as cabbage, seri myoga and/or eggplant.

== Preparation and serving ==
Miso soup can be prepared in several ways, depending on the chef and the style of soup. Japanese recipes usually call for most vegetables to be cooked in the simmering &quot;dashi&quot;, particularly mushrooms, daikon, carrots, potatoes, tofu, and fish. There is a common myth that when miso paste is heated, the microorganisms are killed and the health benefits are reduced, but this is incorrect. In fact, the health benefits are due to nutrients produced by enzymes produced during the miso making process, not the bacteria in miso that directly benefit health.

In Japan, miso soup and white rice make up the central dishes of the traditional Japanese breakfast. The soup has been a favorite of commoners and royalty alike for many centuries, but there are also many other dishes involving breakfast. They are all quite small, some include egg, fish, and nattō which is a fermented soybean. The soup is usually served in lacquer bowls with lids and drunk directly from the bowl, though the solid ingredients are eaten with chopsticks. The bowl sometimes has a lid to keep heat and aroma in as well as to improve the presentation.

=== Instant miso soup ===

Instant miso soup is available in single-serving packets. It is usually sold in dehydrated powder and paste forms, though it is sometimes also sold freeze dried. It generally contains dried toppings such as wakame and tofu with soybeans that reconstitute rapidly on the addition of hot water. These are popular in the Japanese workplace, where miso soup can be made with lunch as easily as green tea and using the same water. Instant miso soup is available in many grocery stores outside Japan. It has a shelf life of 3 to 12 months.

===&quot;Wappani&quot;===
, a miso-soup-based dish, is unique to Awashima island off the coast of Niigata, Japan. A cedar flask (&quot;&quot;) is filled with miso soup, fish and vegetables. It is then heated by dropping in hot rocks, which quickly brings it to a simmer. Hot rocks retain their heat for hours after being taken from the fire, so a hot meal can be prepared without the use of fire.

== Health benefits ==

In 2003, researchers at Japan&#x27;s National Cancer Centre suggested that eating three or more bowls of miso soup every day could lower the risk of breast cancer in women.

Studies in 2020 showed that habitual consumption of miso soup has the effect of lowering blood pressure and heart rate, causing proliferation of good bacteria in the intestines and helping to prevent constipation.

A 2003 epidemiology study in Japan discovered that persons who consume miso soup daily have a lower risk of stomach cancer and heart disease. In 2019 research concluded that fermented soy foods, such as miso, have antidiabetic, antioxidant (anti aging), anti-obesity, anti‐inflammatory, anticancer and antihypertensive (lowering blood pressure) properties.

<text>The French Open (), also known as Roland-Garros (), is a tennis tournament organized by the French Tennis Federation annually at Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France. It is chronologically the second of the four Grand Slam tennis events every year, held after the Australian Open and before Wimbledon and the US Open.

The French Open begins in late May and continues for two weeks. The tournament and venue are named after the French aviator Roland Garros.

The French Open is the premier clay court championship in the world and the only Grand Slam tournament currently held on this surface. Until 1975, the French Open was the only major tournament not played on grass. Between the seven rounds needed for a championship, the clay surface characteristics (slower pace, higher bounce), and the best-of-five-set men&#x27;s singles matches, the French Open is widely regarded as the most physically demanding tournament in tennis.

== History ==

Officially named in French Internationaux de France de Tennis (&quot;French Internationals of Tennis&quot; in English), the tournament uses the name Roland-Garros in all languages, and it is usually called the French Open in English.&lt;section begin=GrandSlamArticle/&gt;

In 1891, the &quot;Championnat de France&quot;, which is commonly referred to in English as the French Championships, began. This was only open to tennis players who were members of French clubs. The first winner was H. Briggs, a Briton who resided in Paris and was a member of the Club Stade Français. In the final, he defeated P. Baigneres in straight sets. The first women&#x27;s singles tournament, with four entries, was held in 1897. The mixed doubles event was added in 1902 and the women&#x27;s doubles in 1907. In the period of 1915–1919, no tournament was organized due to World War I. 

In 1925, the French Championships became open to all amateurs internationally and was designated a major championship by the International Lawn Tennis Federation. It was held on clay courts at the Stade Français in Saint-Cloud (site of the previous World Hard Court Championships) in 1925 and 1927. In 1926 the Croix-Catelan of the Racing Club de France hosted the event in Paris, the site of the previous French club members only tournament, also on clay.

Another clay court tournament, called the World Hard Court Championships, is sometimes considered the true precursor to the modern French Open as it admitted international competitors. This was held at Stade Français in Saint-Cloud, from 1912 to 1914, 1920, 1921 and 1923, with the 1922 event held in Brussels, Belgium. Winners of this tournament included world No. 1s such as Anthony Wilding from New Zealand (1913, 1914) and Bill Tilden from the US (1921). In 1924 there was no World Hard Court Championships due to tennis being played at the Paris Olympic Games in Colombes.&lt;section end=GrandSlamArticle/&gt;

After the Mousquetaires or Philadelphia Four (René Lacoste, Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet, and Jacques Brugnon) won the Davis Cup on American soil in 1927, the French decided to defend the cup in 1928 at a new tennis stadium at Porte d&#x27;Auteuil. The &quot;Stade de France&quot; had offered the tennis authorities three hectares of land with the condition that the new stadium must be named after the World War I aviator hero Roland Garros. The new Stade de Roland Garros (whose central court was renamed Court Philippe Chatrier in 1988) hosted that Davis Cup challenge. On 24 May 1928, the French International Championships moved there, and the event has been held there ever since.

During World War II, the Tournoi de France was not held in 1940 and from 1941 through 1945 it took place on the same grounds, but those events are not recognized by the French governing body, the Fédération Française de Tennis. In 1946 and 1947, the French Championships were held after Wimbledon, making it the third Grand Slam event of the year. In 1968, the year of the French General Strike, the French Championships became the first Grand Slam tournament to go open, allowing both amateurs and professionals to compete.

Since 1981, new prizes have been presented: the Prix Orange (for the player demonstrating the best sportsmanship and cooperative attitude with the press), the Prix Citron (for the player with the strongest character and personality) and the Prix Bourgeon (for the tennis player revelation of the year). In another novelty, since 2006 the tournament has begun on a Sunday, featuring 12 singles matches played on the three main courts. Additionally, on the eve of the tournament&#x27;s opening, the traditional Benny Berthet exhibition day takes place, where the profits go to different charity associations. In March 2007, it was announced that the event would provide equal prize money for both men and women in all rounds for the first time.
In 2010, it was announced that the tournament was considering a move away from Roland Garros as part of a continuing rejuvenation. Plans to renovate and expand Roland Garros have put aside any such consideration, and the tournament remains in its long time home.

The 2022 edition finally saw a new tiebreaker format. If the deciding set is tied at six-all, the match is decided in a 10-point format. Should the tiebreaker game be tied at 9-all (or any tie hereafter), whoever scores two straight points wins. The decision was made by the Grand Slam Board for all four Grand Slams &quot;based on a strong desire to create greater consistency in the rules of the game at the grand slams, and thus enhance the experience for the players and fans alike&quot;, a statement from the Board read. The 2024 edition marked the first time that a member of the Big Three (Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic) was not featured in the final since 2004.

=== Expansion ===

From 2004 to 2008, plans were developed to build a covered stadium with a roof, as complaints continued over delayed matches. Various proposals were put forward to expand the facility or to move the tournament to a completely new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits. In 2011 the decision was taken to maintain the tournament within its existing venue. The expansion project called for a new stadium to be built alongside the historical Auteuil&#x27;s greenhouses and expansion of old stadiums and the tournament village. A wide-ranging project to overhaul the venue was presented in 2011, including building a roof over Court Philippe-Chatrier, demolishing and replacing Court No. 1 with a grassy hill for outdoors viewing, and geographical extension of the venue eastward into the Jardin des Serres d&#x27;Auteuil.

Legal opposition from environmental defence associations and other stakeholders delayed the works for several years as litigation ensued. In particular, the city council voted in May 2015 against the expansion project, but on 9 June 2015 Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced the signing of the construction permits, with work scheduled to begin in September of that year and conclude in 2019. In December 2015, the Administrative Court of Paris once again halted renovation work, but the French Tennis Federation won the right to proceed with the renovation on appeal.

Renovation work finally commenced at the close of the 2018 edition of the tournament. Redeveloped seating and a retractable roof was constructed for Court Philippe-Chatrier and the new 5,000-seat Court Simonne-Mathieu was opened, having been named after France&#x27;s second-highest achieving female tennis player, and noted for its innovative use of greenhouse encasing architecture. The renewal of the venue has been generally well received by the players and the public. The 2020 edition of the tournament, which was the first to be assisted by the roof over Philippe-Chatrier, was postponed to late September and early October and was played in front of limited spectators, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Floodlights were also installed over each of the courts in the precinct, allowing the tournament to facilitate night matches for the first time. In 2021, the tournament was back in the traditional slot of late May and early June.

== Surface characteristics ==

The French Open has been the only major played on clay courts since 1978, when the US Open changed to hard courts. Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce when compared with grass courts or hard courts. For this reason, clay courts take away some of the advantages of big servers and serve-and-volleyers, which makes it hard for these types of players to dominate on the surface. For example, Pete Sampras, known for his huge serve and who won 14 Grand Slam titles, never won the French Open – his best result was reaching the semi-finals in 1996. Many other notable players have won multiple Grand Slam events but have never won the French Open, including John McEnroe, Frank Sedgman, John Newcombe, Venus Williams, Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Murray, Jimmy Connors, Louise Brough, Virginia Wade and Martina Hingis; McEnroe and Edberg lost their only French Open finals appearances in five sets.

On the other hand, players whose games are more suited to jumpier surfaces, such as Rafael Nadal, Björn Borg, Ivan Lendl, Mats Wilander, Justine Henin and Chris Evert, have found great success at this tournament. In the Open Era, the only male players who have won both the French Open and Wimbledon, played on faster grass courts, are Rod Laver, Jan Kodeš, Björn Borg, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz and only female players are Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Garbiñe Muguruza, Simona Halep and Ashleigh Barty. Borg&#x27;s French Open–Wimbledon double was achieved three times consecutively.

===Composition of the courts===
1. Red brick dust.
2. Crushed white limestone.
3. Clinker (coal residue).
4. Crushed gravel.
5. Drain rock.

==Trophies, prize money and rankings points==

The trophies have been awarded to the winners since 1953 and are manufactured by Mellerio dits Meller, a famous Parisian jewelry house. They are all made of pure silver with finely etched decorations on their side. Each new singles winner gets his or her name written on the base of the trophy. Winners receive custom-made pure silver replicas of the trophies they have won. They are usually presented by the president of the French Tennis Federation (FFT).

The trophy awarded to the winner of the men&#x27;s singles is called the (The Musketeers&#x27; Cup). It is named in honor of the &quot;Four Musketeers&quot;. The trophy weighs 14 kg, is 40 cm high and 19 cm wide. The current design was created in 1981 by the Mellerio dit Meller. Each winner gets a smaller-size replica and the original remains property of the FFT at all times.

The trophy awarded to the winner of the women&#x27;s singles is called the &quot;Coupe Suzanne Lenglen&quot; (Suzanne Lenglen Cup) since 1979. The current cup was awarded for the first time in 1986. It is, with a few details, a replica of a cup offered at the time by the city of Nice to Suzanne Lenglen. This trophy, donated by Suzanne Lenglen&#x27;s family to the Musée National du Sport, was awarded between 1979 and 1985 to every winner until the FFT made a copy. Each winner receives a smaller-size replica and the original remains property of the FFT at all times.

===Prize money===
For 2024, the prize money pool was announced to be €53.478 million, an increase of 7.82% compared to the prize pool for 2023 edition.

*1 Prize money for doubles is per team.

== Broadcasting and streaming ==

===France===
France Télévisions and Amazon Prime Video hold the broadcast rights to the French Open until 2027. All 11 &quot;night sessions&quot; will remain exclusive to Prime Video.
Studio presentation for the French Open on France Télévisions is hosted by Laurent Luyat and is historically located on a terrace in a corner of the Court Philippe Chatrier.

===United States===
NBC&#x27;s coverage of the French Open began in 1975. In 2007, Tennis Channel acquired the pay television rights to the tournament and sub-licensed coverage of morning window (U.S. time) matches to ESPN for broadcast by ESPN2 from 2007 through 2015. In August 2015, ESPN announced that it would discontinue its sub-licensing and drop coverage of the French Open beginning in 2016, with network staff citing that because of the structure of the arrangement, its coverage &quot;did not fit our successful model at the other three Majors&quot;—where ESPN is the exclusive rightsholder. Rather than find another partner to sub-license coverage to, Tennis Channel chose to retain the rights under its new owner Sinclair Broadcast Group, nearly doubling the amount of Tennis Channel&#x27;s coverage.

Starting with the 2023 edition and continuing the following year, NBC moved some of its coverage of the French Open exclusively to its streaming service, Peacock.

In June 2024, it was reported that the U.S. rights had been acquired by TNT Sports beginning in 2025, as part of an overall deal with Warner Bros. Discovery that also includes a renewal of its pan-European rights with Eurosport.

===United Kingdom===

BBC began broadcasting French Open finals annually in 1981 (often in their &quot;Grandstand&quot; or &quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot; programmes). The BBC&#x27;s coverage continued until 2011. From 2012 until 2021, ITV Sport televised the French Open in the United Kingdom. Eurosport began broadcasting the tournament in 1989. As of 2022, Eurosport holds exclusive UK broadcast rights to the tournament. Studio presentation for the French Open on Eurosport is hosted by Barbara Schett with Mats Wilander. Commentators include Simon Reed, Chris Bradnam, Nick Lester, Barry Millns alongside Jo Durie, Annabel Croft, Frew McMillan, Miles Maclagan, Arvind Parmar and Chris Wilkinson.

=== India ===

In India, Star Sports had the exclusive broadcast rights of the French Open. However, Sony Pictures Sports Network, owned by Sony Pictures Networks India, acquired the broadcast rights from 2022 through 2024.

== Ball boys and ball girls ==
For the 2024 French Open, 280 &quot;ramasseurs de balles&quot; (literally &quot;gatherers of balls&quot; in English) are scheduled to be selected for the tournament. 

Aged between 11 and 16 years old and dressed in matching Lacoste shirts and shorts, the ball boys and ball girls are chosen to take part in the French Open through an application process, only available to those licensed of the French Tennis Federation, which in 2023 had approximately 4,000 applicants from across France. Upon selection they are trained in the weeks leading up to the event.

He is a and center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O&#x27;Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.

After playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O&#x27;Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning NBA Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O&#x27;Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O&#x27;Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O&#x27;Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O&#x27;Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season. O&#x27;Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.

O&#x27;Neal was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996. Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O&#x27;Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times. O&#x27;Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017. In October 2021, O&#x27;Neal was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

In addition to his basketball career, O&#x27;Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, &quot;Shaq Diesel&quot;, going platinum. O&#x27;Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as Diesel. He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, &quot;Shaq&#x27;s Big Challenge&quot; and &quot;Shaq Vs.&quot; He hosts &quot;The Big Podcast with Shaq&quot;. He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.

==Early life==

Shaquille Rashaun O&#x27;Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey, to Lucille O&#x27;Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O&#x27;Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant. O&#x27;Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O&#x27;Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship. On his 1994 rap album, &quot;Shaq Fu: The Return&quot;, O&#x27;Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song &quot;Biological Didn&#x27;t Bother&quot;, dismissing him with the line &quot;Phil is my father.&quot; However, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison&#x27;s death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O&#x27;Neal telling him, &quot;I don&#x27;t hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.&quot;

O&#x27;Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were and tall, respectively, and by age 13, O&#x27;Neal was already tall. He credited the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. &quot;It gave me something to do,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;d just go there to shoot. I didn&#x27;t even play on a team.&quot; Because of his stepfather&#x27;s career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.

After returning from Germany, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O&#x27;Neal had grown to , and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year. His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s ability to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, 33. However, his high school team did not have a &quot;33&quot; jersey, so O&#x27;Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.

==College career==
After graduating from high school in 1989, O&#x27;Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O&#x27;Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men&#x27;s basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by Associated Press and UPI. O&#x27;Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player. He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame. A bronze statue of O&#x27;Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.

==Professional career==
===Orlando Magic (1992–1996)===
====Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)====
The Orlando Magic drafted O&#x27;Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. O&#x27;Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey. O&#x27;Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so. During his rookie season, O&#x27;Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985. The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Jack McCallum overheard O&#x27;Neal saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].&quot;

====First playoff appearance (1993–1994)====
In 1993–1994, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office. O&#x27;Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O&#x27;Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks. He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee &quot;Penny&quot; Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In his first playoff series, O&#x27;Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds as the Pacers swept the Magic.

====First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)====
In O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league&#x27;s top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller&#x27;s Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O&#x27;Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.

O&#x27;Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan&#x27;s Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference finals.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)===
====O&#x27;Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)====

O&#x27;Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O&#x27;Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s conditions for returning. 82% answered &quot;no&quot;. O&#x27;Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill. He said the team &quot;just didn&#x27;t respect [Hill]&quot;. Another question in the poll asked whether O&#x27;Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic&#x27;s offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s Olympic teammates teased him over the poll. He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O&#x27;Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry. O&#x27;Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to &quot;feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond&quot;. He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O&#x27;Neal making more money than him.

On the team&#x27;s first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O&#x27;Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract. O&#x27;Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.&quot; The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season. O&#x27;Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O&#x27;Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O&#x27;Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman&#x27;s teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; reported that O&#x27;Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O&#x27;Neal said: &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.&quot;

The following season, O&#x27;Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of four consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.

With the tandem of O&#x27;Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O&#x27;Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.

====MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)====

In 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Los Angeles Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team&#x27;s fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O&#x27;Neal, telling him &quot;the [NBA&#x27;s] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.&quot;

In a November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O&#x27;Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O&#x27;Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O&#x27;Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O&#x27;Neal. On March 6, 2000, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s 61-point game was the last game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer until Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 64 points against the Indiana Pacers on December 13, 2023.

O&#x27;Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers, who went on to win MVP the next season. O&#x27;Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson&#x27;s influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O&#x27;Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.

In the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O&#x27;Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It&#x27;s a shame that the referees buy into that&quot;, O&#x27;Neal said. &quot;I wish he&#x27;d stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.

A month before the training camp, O&#x27;Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot. He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker. He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.

In January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players. O&#x27;Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000. For the season, O&#x27;Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.

Matched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O&#x27;Neal said, &quot;There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.&quot; O&#x27;Neal meant &quot;cheat&quot; in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings&#x27; center Vlade Divac. O&#x27;Neal referred to Divac as &quot;she&quot;, and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. &quot;I&#x27;m a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.&quot; 
After the 2001–2002 season, O&#x27;Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O&#x27;Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.

Using Jackson&#x27;s triangle offense, O&#x27;Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O&#x27;Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.

====Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)====
O&#x27;Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery. He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe. He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, &quot;I got hurt on company time, so I&#x27;ll heal on company time.&quot; O&#x27;Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure. The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19. At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.

For the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O&#x27;Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O&#x27;Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O&#x27;Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O&#x27;Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, &quot;Pay me.&quot; There had been increasing tension between O&#x27;Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O&#x27;Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.

The Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, &quot;Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He&#x27;s always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn&#x27;t had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding&quot;. After the series, O&#x27;Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O&#x27;Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team&#x27;s decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O&#x27;Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks&#x27; Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest in O&#x27;Neal, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade. Winter said, &quot;[O&#x27;Neal] left because he couldn&#x27;t get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq&#x27;s demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn&#x27;t please the owner too much.&quot;

===Miami Heat (2004–2008)===
====MVP runner-up (2004–2005)====

On July 14, 2004, O&#x27;Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O&#x27;Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O&#x27;Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname &quot;Flash&quot;. With O&#x27;Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O&#x27;Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O&#x27;Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.

Despite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O&#x27;Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference finals and a game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O&#x27;Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O&#x27;Neal. 
In August 2005, O&#x27;Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat&#x27;s decision to secure O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s services for the long term. They contended that O&#x27;Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.

====Fourth championship (2005–2006)====

In the second game of the 2005–06 season, O&#x27;Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities. O&#x27;Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a &quot;frontrunner&quot; and a &quot;master of panic&quot;. Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O&#x27;Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O&#x27;Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O&#x27;Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview &quot;Stats don&#x27;t matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I&#x27;m happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I&#x27;m pissed off. &#x27;Cause I knew I did something wrong. I&#x27;ll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.&quot; During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O&#x27;Neal in the line-up.

On April 11, 2006, O&#x27;Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists. O&#x27;Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.
In the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O&#x27;Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O&#x27;Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O&#x27;Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat 
held on to win game 6 with O&#x27;Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.

In the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O&#x27;Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O&#x27;Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.

====Surgery and Wade&#x27;s injury (2006–2007)====
In the , O&#x27;Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery. After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O&#x27;Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as &quot;Benedict Arnold&quot;. Jackson had previously said, &quot;The only person I&#x27;ve ever [coached] that hasn&#x27;t been a worker... is probably Shaq.&quot; The Heat struggled during O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s absence, but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O&#x27;Neal as the focus of the team. Critics doubted that O&#x27;Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs. The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.

In a rematch of the previous year, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O&#x27;Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round. It was the first time in 13 years that O&#x27;Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O&#x27;Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.

====Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)====
O&#x27;Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O&#x27;Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season. O&#x27;Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak. According to O&#x27;Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury. During a practice in February 2008, O&#x27;Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O&#x27;Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O&#x27;Neal. O&#x27;Neal said his relationship with Wade was not &quot;all that good&quot; by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.

O&#x27;Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O&#x27;Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O&#x27;Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.

===Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)===

The Phoenix Suns acquired O&#x27;Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. O&#x27;Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O&#x27;Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: &quot;I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn&#x27;t in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I&#x27;ll get it.&quot;

In 28 regular season games, O&#x27;Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds, good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns&#x27; six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs. O&#x27;Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O&#x27;Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.

O&#x27;Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. &quot;I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys&quot;, O&#x27;Neal said. &quot;We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I&#x27;m actually on a team again.&quot; Riley felt O&#x27;Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O&#x27;Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the &quot;great Pat Riley&quot; while playing for the Heat. O&#x27;Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career. They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.

The 2008–09 season, improved for O&#x27;Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division. He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.

On February 27, 2009, O&#x27;Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.

In a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O&#x27;Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. &quot;I&#x27;m really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds&quot;, O&#x27;Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. &quot;It&#x27;s not really my role anymore.&quot; O&#x27;Neal was double-teamed most of the night. &quot;I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it&#x27;s cool&quot;, said O&#x27;Neal. During the game, O&#x27;Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O&#x27;Neal with the Heat, was &quot;very disappointed cause [O&#x27;Neal] knows what it&#x27;s like. Let&#x27;s stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.&quot; O&#x27;Neal responded, &quot;Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.&quot; Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s for three years, found it amusing since &quot;everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.&quot; In a 2006 interview in &quot;TIME&quot;, O&#x27;Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would &quot;Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.&quot;

On March 6, O&#x27;Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. &quot;It&#x27;s not going to be man-on-man, so don&#x27;t even try that,&quot; says O&#x27;Neal with an incredulous laugh. &quot;They&#x27;re going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it&#x27;s just going to be me down there. So don&#x27;t try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it&#x27;s Shaq versus four other guys.&quot;

The 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O&#x27;Neal he might be traded to cut costs.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)===
On June 25, 2009, O&#x27;Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ben Wallace, Sasha Pavlovic, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick. Upon arriving in Cleveland, O&#x27;Neal said, &quot;My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King&quot;, referring to LeBron James. James was the leader of the team, and O&#x27;Neal deferred to him. On February 25, 2010, O&#x27;Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics. He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.

After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O&#x27;Neal said: &quot;When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.&quot; O&#x27;Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, largely due to splitting Center duties with Zydrunas Ilgauskas.

===Boston Celtics (2010–2011)===

Upon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O&#x27;Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Boston Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O&#x27;Neal. Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O&#x27;Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami. On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O&#x27;Neal. The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million. O&#x27;Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O&#x27;Neal. The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s salary demands. He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.

O&#x27;Neal said he did not &quot;compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.&quot; O&#x27;Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: &quot;If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say &#x27;Duncan is the best,&#x27; and I can&#x27;t have that.&quot; Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit. Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself. O&#x27;Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg including knee, calf, hip, and Achilles injuries. The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O&#x27;Neal would return to fill Perkins&#x27; role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury, and they were 19–3 in games that O&#x27;Neal played over 20 minutes. After requesting a cortisone shot, O&#x27;Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf. It was the last regular season game he would play that year. O&#x27;Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.

On June 1, 2011, O&#x27;Neal announced his retirement via social media. On a short video on Twitter, O&#x27;Neal tweeted, &quot;We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m telling you first. I&#x27;m about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.&quot; On June 3, 2011, O&#x27;Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.

==National team career==
While in college, O&#x27;Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner. His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O&#x27;Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.

He was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O&#x27;Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O&#x27;Neal that it would probably be Robinson&#x27;s last Olympics.

After his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a &quot;lack of respect&quot;. He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough. O&#x27;Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics, and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster, he eventually declined the invitation.

==Player profile==

O&#x27;Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.

At , and U.S. shoe size 23, he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.

O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s &quot;drop step&quot;, (called the &quot;Black Tornado&quot; by O&#x27;Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O&#x27;Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time. He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s record of nine.

Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O&#x27;Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams&#x27; offensive and defensive strategies.

O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record. O&#x27;Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice. In hope of exploiting O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as &quot;Hack-a-Shaq&quot;. O&#x27;Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken, having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O&#x27;Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.

O&#x27;Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).

O&#x27;Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.

Phil Jackson believed O&#x27;Neal underachieved in his career, saying he &quot;could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.&quot; In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O&#x27;Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.

The Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013. On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O&#x27;Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams. The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 13, 2024, the Orlando Magic retired O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s No. 32 jersey, the first time they retired a players&#x27; number. He became the third player to have his number retired by three NBA teams, joining Wilt Chamberlain and Pete Maravich.

==Off the court==
===Media personality===

O&#x27;Neal called himself &quot;The Big Aristotle&quot; and &quot;Hobo Master&quot; for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O&#x27;Neal several nicknames, including &quot;Shaq&quot;, &quot;The Diesel&quot;, &quot;Shaq Fu&quot;, &quot;The Big Daddy&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;The Big Agave&quot;, &quot;The Big Cactus&quot;, &quot;The Big Shaqtus&quot;, &quot;The Big Galactus&quot;, &quot;Wilt Chamberneezy&quot;, &quot;The Big Baryshnikov&quot;, &quot;The Real Deal&quot;, &quot;The Big Shamrock&quot;, &quot;The Big Leprechaun&quot;, &quot;Shaqovic&quot;, and &quot;The Big Conductor&quot;. Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O&#x27;Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking. When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.

During the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O&#x27;Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O&#x27;Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.

O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O&#x27;Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the &quot;Queens&quot;. During the 2002 victory parade, O&#x27;Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California, after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O&#x27;Neal.

He also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O&#x27;Neal told a reporter, &quot;you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.&quot; O&#x27;Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O&#x27;Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn&#x27;t see the humor. Yao joked, &quot;Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.&quot; O&#x27;Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.

During the 2005 NBA playoffs, O&#x27;Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier, a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.

O&#x27;Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, who?&quot; and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.

O&#x27;Neal also appeared on television on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted &quot;Shaq&#x27;s Big Challenge&quot;, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.

When the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O&#x27;Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called &quot;Bryant–O&#x27;Neal feud&quot; that had festered since O&#x27;Neal left Los Angeles. O&#x27;Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant. On June 22, 2008, O&#x27;Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O&#x27;Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O&#x27;Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times &quot;Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes&quot;. O&#x27;Neal justified his act by saying &quot;I was freestyling. That&#x27;s all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I&#x27;m totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.&quot; Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O&#x27;Neal, Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O&#x27;Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to &quot;use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language&quot;. The racial quote from his song was &quot;it&#x27;s like a white boy trying to be more nigga than me.&quot;

===Music career===
Beginning in 1993, O&#x27;Neal began to compose rap music. He released five studio albums and one compilation album. Although his rapping abilities were criticized at the outset, one critic credited him with &quot;progressing as a rapper in small steps, not leaps and bounds&quot;. His 1993 debut album, &quot;Shaq Diesel&quot;, received platinum certification from the RIAA.

O&#x27;Neal was featured alongside Michael Jackson as a guest rapper on &quot;2 Bad&quot;, a song from Jackson&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;&quot;. He contributed three tracks, including the song &quot;We Genie&quot;, to the &quot;Kazaam&quot; soundtrack. O&#x27;Neal was also featured in Aaron Carter&#x27;s 2001 hit single &quot;That&#x27;s How I Beat Shaq&quot;. Shaq also appears in the music video for the release.

Shaquille O&#x27;Neal conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra at the Boston Symphony Hall on December 20, 2010.

O&#x27;Neal also started DJing in the 1980s at LSU.

O&#x27;Neal produces electronic dance music and tours the world under the stage name DJ Diesel (stylized in all caps).

In July 2017, O&#x27;Neal released a diss track aimed at LaVar Ball, the father of NBA point guard Lonzo Ball. The three-minute song was released in response to Ball claiming he and his younger son LaMelo, would beat O&#x27;Neal and his son Shareef in a game of basketball.

On October 23, 2021, O&#x27;Neal performed as DJ Diesel on the bassPOD stage at the 2021 Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Nevada.

On June 7, 2023, O&#x27;Neal released his first single as DJ Diesel from his debut album &quot;Gorilla Warfare&quot;, titled &quot;Bang Your Head&quot; in collaboration with Hairitage. The album was released on August 18.

He contributed a verse to the rapper Redman&#x27;s track &quot;Lite It Up&quot; from the &quot;Muddy Waters Too&quot; album, released December 24, 2024.

===Education===
O&#x27;Neal dropped out of LSU for the NBA after three years. However, he promised his mother he would eventually return to his studies and complete his bachelor&#x27;s degree. He fulfilled that promise in 2000, earning his B.A. degree in general studies from LSU, with a minor in political science. Coach Phil Jackson let O&#x27;Neal miss a home game so he could attend graduation. At the ceremony, he told the crowd &quot;now I can go and get a real job&quot;.

Subsequently, O&#x27;Neal earned an online MBA degree through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In reference to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: &quot;It&#x27;s just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else.&quot;

Toward the end of his playing career, O&#x27;Neal began work on an educational doctorate at Barry University. His doctoral capstone topic was &quot;The Duality of Humor and Aggression in Leadership Styles&quot;. O&#x27;Neal received his Ed.D. degree in Human Resource Development from Barry in 2012. He told a reporter for ABC News that he planned to further his education by attending law school.

In 2009, O&#x27;Neal attended the Sportscaster U. training camp at S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. Additionally, he studied directing and cinematography with the New York Film Academy&#x27;s Filmmaking Conservatory.

===Law enforcement===
O&#x27;Neal maintained a high level of interest in the workings of police departments and became personally involved in law enforcement. O&#x27;Neal went through the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Reserve Academy and became a reserve officer with the Los Angeles Port Police. 
On March 2, 2005, O&#x27;Neal was given an honorary U.S. Deputy Marshal title and named the spokesman for the Safe Surfin&#x27; Foundation; he served an honorary role on the task force of the same name, which tracks down sexual predators who target children on the Internet.

Upon his trade to Miami, O&#x27;Neal began training to become a Miami Beach reserve officer. On December 8, 2005, he was sworn in, but elected for a private ceremony to avoid distracting attention from the other officers. He assumed a $1-per-year salary in this capacity. Shortly thereafter, in Miami, O&#x27;Neal witnessed a hate crime (assaulting a man while calling out homophobic slurs) and called Miami-Dade police, describing the suspect and helping police, over his cell phone, track the offender. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s actions resulted in the arrest of two suspects on charges of aggravated battery, assault, and a hate crime.

In September 2006, O&#x27;Neal took part in a raid on a home in rural Bedford County, Virginia. O&#x27;Neal had been made an &quot;honorary deputy&quot; by the local sheriff&#x27;s department. O&#x27;Neal was not qualified as a SWAT officer.

In June 2008, the Bedford County, Virginia, and Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff departments revoked O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s special deputyship after a video surfaced of him rapping about Kobe Bryant and using racial slurs.

On January 20, 2015, O&#x27;Neal was sworn in as a reserve officer for Doral, Florida&#x27;s police force. In December 2016, O&#x27;Neal was sworn in as a sheriff&#x27;s deputy in Jonesboro, Georgia, as part of Clayton County, Georgia Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

===Business ventures===
 O&#x27;Neal is among the five wealthiest NBA players, with a net worth of $400 million. He was an active bond investor in the early 1990s but continued to wade into stocks and made investments in various companies such as General Electric, Apple, and PepsiCo. He described what has worked best for him in stock investing was where he felt a personal connection with the company. O&#x27;Neal refused to endorse Wheaties cereal because he preferred Frosted Flakes. He has also been an active real estate entrepreneur. O&#x27;Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando homeowners facing foreclosure. His plans involved buying the mortgages of those who had fallen into foreclosure and then selling the homes back to them under more affordable terms. He would make a small profit in return, but wanted to make an investment in Orlando and help out homeowners.

In conjunction with Boraie Development, O&#x27;Neal has developed projects in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, including, CityPlex12 and One Riverview.
