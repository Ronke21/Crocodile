<text>The Battle of Dresden (26–27 August 1813) was a major engagement of the Napoleonic Wars. The battle took place around the city of Dresden in modern-day Germany. With the recent addition of Austria, the Sixth Coalition felt emboldened in their quest to expel the French from Central Europe. Despite being heavily outnumbered, French forces under Napoleon scored a victory against the Army of Bohemia led by Generalissimo Karl von Schwarzenberg. However, Napoleon&#x27;s victory did not lead to the collapse of the coalition, and the weather and the uncommitted Russian reserves who formed an effective rear-guard precluded a major pursuit. Three days after the battle, the Coalition surrounded and destroyed a French corps advancing into their line of withdrawal at the Battle of Kulm.

==Prelude==
On 16 August, Napoleon had sent Marshal Saint-Cyr&#x27;s corps to fortify and hold Dresden in order to hinder coalition movements and to serve as a possible base for his own manoeuvres. He planned to strike against the interior lines of his enemies and defeat them in detail, before they could combine their full strength. He had a field army of 442,810 men and 1,284 guns in 559 battalions and 395 squadrons against Coalition field forces totaling 512,113 men in 556 battalions, 572 squadrons and 68 Cossack regiments, and 1,380 guns.

The Coalition avoided battle with Napoleon himself, choosing to attack his subordinate commanders as per the Trachenberg Plan. On 23 August, at the Battle of Grossbeeren, south of Berlin, Crown Prince Charles of Sweden (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte, Napoleon&#x27;s own Marshal) defeated his old comrade Marshal Oudinot. On 26 August, Prussian Marshal Blücher crushed Marshal MacDonald&#x27;s army at the Battle of Katzbach.

== Battle ==

On 25 August, the three monarchs—Alexander I of Russia, Francis I of Austria, and Frederick William III of Prussia—and their staffs assembled on an overlook of the city to discuss their strategy. The city&#x27;s weak defenses were clear from this vantage point: the French and Saxon garrison of 20,000 men under Marshal Saint-Cyr could not hope to hold a city of that size. The Tsar and General Jean Victor Moreau, formerly a General of France and by 1813 an adviser to the Coalition, wanted to attack at once; Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg wanted to wait until additional forces arrived.

The following day, 26 August, Schwarzenberg sent the Coalition force of over 200,000 men to attack Saint-Cyr. The Army of Bohemia was divided into three parts: the Left Wing consisted of Austrians and commanded by Schwarzenberg himself and included the 9 divisions of infantry, 3 divisions of cavalry and 128 guns; the Right Wing consisted of Russians and Prussians under Wittgenstein and included 2 Russian infantry divisions and von Kleist&#x27;s Prussian corps and 158 guns; the Reserves behind the center consisted of the best Russian and Prussian troops under Barclay de Tolly and included 2 Russian grenadier divisions, 4 Russian Guard cavalry divisions, the Prussian Royal Guard and about 150 guns. The monarchs stayed with the reserves.

In Dresden, Saint-Cyr&#x27;s XIV Corps manned the various redoubts and defensive positions. From 6:00am to noon, the coalition probed the French defenses. Napoleon arrived from the north about 10:00am with the Guard Infantry and Murat&#x27;s I Cavalry Corps arriving shortly afterwards, covering in forced marches over three days. Napoleon&#x27;s Guard consisted of 2 Young Guard Corps and the Old Guard Division.

Shortly after 11:00am, the Coalition monarchs noticed the stream of French troops hurrying into Dresden from the north. There was a lull in the battle between noon and 3:00pm while the French reinforcements took positions and the Coalition leaders pondered whether they should fight Napoleon or withdraw. The Coalition finally began a bombardment and general assault starting about 3:00pm against the southern suburbs of the city. As the Coalition forces made progress, Napoleon swiftly dispatched reinforcements to the threatened areas – the I Cavalry Corps to the French right, Ney and the II Young Guard Corps to the center and Mortier and the I Young Guard Corps to the French left. At 5:30pm, Napoleon launched his riposte. By nightfall, the French had regained almost all of Saint-Cyr&#x27;s original positions. As night fell on 26 August, a torrential downpour started that lasted throughout the night. The streams became swollen with water and the ground turned to mud.

After being reinforced overnight with Victor&#x27;s II Corps, Marmont&#x27;s VI Corps and the Guard Cavalry, Napoleon attacked the following morning on 27 August in a steady rain, destroyed the coalition left flank, and won an impressive tactical victory. The flooded Weisseritz cut off a large portion the left wing of the Coalition army, commanded by Johann von Klenau and Ignaz Gyulai, from the Coalition&#x27;s main body in the center. Marshal Joachim Murat took advantage of this isolation and inflicted heavy losses on the Austrians. A French participant observed, &quot;Murat... cut off from the Austrian army Klenau&#x27;s corps, hurling himself upon it at the head of the carabineers and cuirassiers. ... Nearly all his [Klenau&#x27;s] battalions were compelled to lay down their arms, and two other divisions of infantry shared their fate.&quot; Of Klenau&#x27;s force, Lieutenant Field Marshal Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny&#x27;s division of five infantry regiments was surrounded and captured by Murat&#x27;s cavalry, which amounted to approximately 13,000 men, and 15 colours. Mesko was wounded, and retired the following year. Gyulai&#x27;s divisions also suffered serious losses when they were attacked by Murat&#x27;s cavalry supported by Victor&#x27;s II Corps during a rainstorm. With damp flints and powder, their muskets would not fire and many battalions became an easy prey to the French cuirassiers and dragoons.

As the coalition left wing was being disintegrated, the French attacked on the coalition right wing with Ney, Mortier and Saint-Cyr. Despite desperate charges by the Russian and Prussian cavalry, this flank was also driven back. The French center was held by Marmont&#x27;s VI Corps but the center was largely limited to an artillery duel. By about 5:00pm, the entire coalition force had to slowly pull back even though Schwarzenberg&#x27;s powerful reserves had not been committed. That night, the Coalition decided that they have had enough and quietly withdrew south. Napoleon did not realize that they had left until the following morning.

An effective rear-guard and the weather allowed Schwarzenberg to withdraw and escape any attempt of encirclement or pursuit. The Coalition had lost some 38,000 men and 40 guns. French casualties totaled around 10,000. Some of Napoleon&#x27;s officers noted he was &quot;suffering from a violent colic, which had been brought on by the cold rain, to which he had been exposed during the whole 2nd day of the battle.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
On 27 August, General Vandamme received orders to advance on Pirna and bridge the Elbe there with his I Corps. This was accomplished in a pouring rain, without disturbing the Russians drawn up on the heights of Zehista. This advance by Vandamme ran into the midst of the coalition forces withdrawing from Dresden and resulted in the Battle of Kulm three days later. After being attacked from all sides, Vandamme was eventually compelled to surrender. This loss along with the defeats of Marshal Oudinot and Marshal MacDonald at the Battle of Katzbach overshadowed Napoleon&#x27;s victory at Dresden.

Napoleon&#x27;s old rival Jean Victor Marie Moreau, who had only recently returned from exile in the United States, was talking to the Tsar (who wished to see Napoleon defeated) and was mortally wounded in the battle, dying later on 2 September in Louny.

===Hoffman===
The author and composer E. T. A. Hoffmann happened to be in Dresden during the battle, being at the time employed by a locally based orchestra. On 22 August, after the end of the armistice, the Hoffmann Family was forced to relocate from their pleasant house in the suburbs into the town. During the next few days, as the battle raged, they experienced the ongoing bombardments. As Hoffman later recounted, many people were killed by shells directly in front of him. After the main battle was over, he visited the gory battlefield. His account can be found in &quot;Vision auf dem Schlachtfeld bei Dresden&quot;.

<doc id="157388" wikidata="Q700860" url="?curid=157388" title="Battle of Eckmühl">
<text>The Battle of Eckmühl fought on 22 April 1809, was the turning point of the 1809 Campaign, also known as the War of the Fifth Coalition. Napoleon I had been unprepared for the start of hostilities on 10 April 1809, by the Austrians under Archduke Charles of Austria and for the first time since assuming the French Imperial Crown had been forced to give up the strategic initiative to an opponent. Thanks to the dogged defense waged by the III Corps, commanded by Marshal Davout, and the Bavarian VII Corps, commanded by Marshal Lefebvre, Napoleon was able to defeat the principal Austrian army and wrest the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.

==Strategic situation==
Operating over a fifty-mile front, from Regensburg (Ratisbon to the French) to Pfaffenhofen, marked by stretches of rugged, wooded terrain, neither the French nor the Austrians had developed adequate intelligence about their opponent&#x27;s strength, dispositions, or intentions. Assuming that the bulk of the Austrian army was deployed to cover their bridgehead at Landshut and the main highway to Vienna, on 20 April 1809, Napoleon launched most of his army in an attack to the Southwest. The resulting Battle of Abensberg was a clear, French victory, following which Napoleon ordered all but Davout&#x27;s III Corps and Lefebvre&#x27;s (Bavarian) VII Corps to pursue and destroy what he thought was the remains of the Austrian Army.

The French attack, however, had only split the Austrian Army, separating its Left Wing, composed of the V Armee Korps, VI A.K., and II Reserve A.K., from the balance of the army. Two corps, III A.K. and IV A.K., were withdrawn by Archduke Charles to the North, forming a nine-mile line from Abbach on the Danube to Eckmühl on the Grosse Laber. More importantly, unbeknownst to Napoleon, the Austrians gained a victory of their own on 20 April 1809, by surrounding and capturing the French garrison at Regensburg and its strategic bridge over the Danube. The capture of the bridge at Regensburg allowed Charles to re-establish contact with his Right Wing, General der Kavallerie Bellegarde&#x27;s I A.K. and FZM Kollowrat&#x27;s II A.K., hitherto separated from the rest of the Austrian Army by the Danube.

==Battle Plans==
With the seizure of the bridge at Regensburg, Archduke Charles no longer needed to defend the Landshut bridgehead and instead moved to concentrate his remaining forces so as to envelop and destroy Davout&#x27;s corps. FML Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen&#x27;s III A.K. (15,700 men) and FML Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini&#x27;s IV A.K. (21,460 men), were ordered to hold the Austrian left, pinning in place Davout&#x27;s corps, while FZM Johann Kollowrat&#x27;s fresh II A.K. (28,168 men) and the elite grenadiers and cuirassiers of G.d.K. Prince Johann of Liechtenstein&#x27;s I Reserve A.K. advanced south from Regensburg and deployed against Davout&#x27;s exposed left flank. Inexplicably, no orders were issued to G.d.K. Count Heinrich von Bellegarde, so his powerful I A.K. (27,653 men) remained on the north bank of the Danube and played no role in the subsequent fighting.

For his part, Napoleon was intent on enveloping and destroying the Austrian forces retiring Southwest to Landshut and its bridge across the Isar. The II and IV Corps (App. 57,000 men under the overall command of Marshal Masséna) were directed to cross the Isar upstream from Landshut and block the Austrians from crossing to the South Bank. Meanwhile, under the overall command of Marshal Lannes, Lannes&#x27; Provisional Corps, the VII (Württemberg) Corps, a division from VII Corps and two cuirassier divisions (App. 51,000 men) were to closely pursue and destroy the defeated Austrians. The mop-up of what Napoleon thought was a &quot;curtain of three regiments&quot; was left to Davout, even though more than half of the III Corps&#x27; original units had been detached to create Lannes&#x27; task force. Despite Davout&#x27;s reports to the contrary, Napoleon ordered him to attack the Austrians on his front in the morning, with the proviso that Lefebvre&#x27;s equally depleted corps would support him if he needed help (A total of approximately 36,000 men for both corps).

==22 April==
The leading elements of the Austrian attack ran into Montbrun&#x27;s determined cavalry, who managed to reduce the impetus of the charge thanks to hilly and wooded terrain. Rosenberg displayed serious concern when he realized that Davout&#x27;s troops were not moving to account for the ongoing battle, and rightly assumed that more French troops were on the way. These troops had, in fact, arrived and brushed aside Rosenberg&#x27;s flank guard. Napoleon had set the French army into motion around 2 a.m. on the 22nd and had his men march 18 miles north in just a few short hours, meaning reinforcements for Davout would be arriving faster than promised.

The vanguard of the assault were the German troops under General Vandamme; these soldiers stormed the bridge at Eckmühl and even captured the town&#x27;s chateau after ferocious Austrian resistance. At this point, Davout launched his men against the Austrian center at the village of Unterlaichling and the woods to the north. The famous 10th Legere Regiment became involved in vicious fighting around the woods, but eventually was strengthened by Bavarians under Deroy and managed to capture the positions. North of Unterlaichling, Davout&#x27;s troops under Louis Friant and St. Hilaire steadily pushed back the defenders of Oberlaichling and the surrounding woods, overran a redoubt held by Hungarian grenadiers, and prompted Charles to order a general retreat.

The struggle now devolved into a series of major cavalry clashes as the Austrians attempted to extricate their army without losing too many prisoners. Perhaps the best cavalry in the Habsburg army, the Vincent Chevau-légers and the Stipsic Hussars, occupied the Bettelberg ridgeline between Eckmühl and the woods above Unterlaiching. These elite units demolished some German light cavalry before being stopped by Bavarian infantry. Napoleon was insistent on the immediate capture of this position and ordered forward two heavy cavalry divisions under St. Sulpice and Nansouty. These horsemen were pummeled by Austrian artillery but came on nonetheless and managed to saber the gunners after having seen off the enemy cavalry.

The first phase of the retreat ended, but it was not over yet. The Austrians had found a chokepoint in the road and were instructed to stem the French tide. Three French cuirassier divisions supported by additional German light cavalry attacked and a swirling melee developed. The Austrians fought but were heavily outnumbered and had to retreat. During this part of the conflict, more French cavalry struck in their flank and the remaining Austrian horse fled north to Ratisbon with great celerity.

==Aftermath==
The French had won the battle, but it was not a decisive engagement. Napoleon had hoped that he would be able to catch the Austrian army between Davout and the Danube, but he didn&#x27;t know that Ratisbon had fallen and thus gave the Austrians a means of escape over the river.

Nevertheless, the French inflicted 10,700 casualties at the cost of just 3,000, and Napoleon&#x27;s speedy arrival witnessed an entire axial realignment of his army (from a north–south axis to an east–west one) that permitted the defeat of the Austrians. Subsequent campaigning led to the French recapture of Ratisbon, Austrian eviction from Southern Germany, and the fall of Vienna.

Napoleon is alleged to have remarked of the series of manoeuvers that culminated at Eckmühl, it was &quot;the finest&quot; that he ever conducted.

Following the victory at Eckmühl, Napoleon&#x27;s council of war led to the Battle of Ratisbon.

<text>Guy-Ernest Debord (; ; 28 December 1931 – 30 November 1994) was a French Marxist theorist, philosopher, filmmaker, critic of work, member of the Letterist International, founder of a Letterist faction, and founding member of the Situationist International. He was also briefly a member of &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot;.

Debord is best known for his 1967 essay &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Guy Debord was born in Paris in 1931. Debord&#x27;s father, Martial, was a pharmacist who died when Debord was young. Debord&#x27;s mother, Paulette Rossi, sent Debord to live with his grandmother in her family villa in Italy. During World War II, the Rossis left the villa and began to travel from town to town. As a result, Debord attended high school in Cannes, where he began his interest in film and vandalism.

As a young man, Debord actively opposed the French war in Algeria and joined in demonstrations in Paris against it. Debord studied law at the University of Paris, but left early and did not complete his university education. After ending his stint at the University of Paris, he began his career as a writer.

=== Involvement with the Lettrists ===
Debord joined the Lettrists when he was 18. The Lettrists were led dictatorially by Isidore Isou until a widely agreed upon schism ended Isou&#x27;s authority. This schism gave rise to several factions. One of them, the Letterist International, was decidedly led by Debord upon Gil Wolman&#x27;s unequivocal recommendation. In the 1960s, Debord led the Situationist International group, which influenced the Paris Uprising of 1968, during which he took part in the occupation of the Sorbonne. Some consider his book &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; (1967) to be a catalyst for the uprising.

===Founding of the Situationist International===
In 1957, the Letterist International, the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, and the London Psychogeographical Association gathered in Cosio d&#x27;Arroscia (Imperia), Italy, to found the Situationist International, with Debord having been the leading representative of the Letterist delegation. Initially made up of a number of well-known artists such as Asger Jorn and Pinot Gallizio, the early days of the SI were heavily focused on the formulation of a critique of art, which would serve as a foundation for the group&#x27;s future entrance into further political critiques. The SI was known for a number of its interventions in the art world, which included one raid against an international art conference in Belgium during 1958 that included a large pamphlet drop and significant media coverage, all of which culminated in the arrest of various situationists and sympathizers associated with the scandal. In addition to this action, the SI endeavored to formulate industrial painting, or, painting prepared en masse with the intent of defaming the original value largely associated with the art of the period. In the course of these actions, Debord was heavily involved in the planning and logistical work associated with preparing these interventions, as well as the work for &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot; associated with theoretical defense of the Situationist International&#x27;s actions.

===Political phase of the Situationist International===
With Debord&#x27;s 1967 &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; and excerpts from the group&#x27;s journal, &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot;, the Situationists began to formulate their theory of the spectacle, which explained the nature of late capitalism&#x27;s historical decay. In Debord&#x27;s terms, situationists defined the spectacle as an assemblage of social relations transmitted via the imagery of class power, and as a period of capitalist development wherein &quot;all that was once lived has moved into representation&quot;. With this theory, Debord and the SI would go on to play an influential role in the revolts of May 1968 in France, with many of the protesters drawing their slogans from Situationist tracts penned or influenced by Debord.

===After the Situationist International===

In 1972, Debord disbanded the Situationist International after its original members, including Asger Jorn and Raoul Vaneigem, quit or were expelled. (Vaneigem wrote a biting criticism of Debord and the International.) Debord then focused on filmmaking with financial backing from the movie mogul and publisher Gérard Lebovici (éditions Champ Libre), until Lebovici&#x27;s mysterious death. Debord was suspected of Lebovici&#x27;s murder. He had agreed to have his films released posthumously at the request of the American researcher Thomas Y. Levin.

After dissolving the Situationist International, Debord spent his time reading, and occasionally writing, in relative isolation in a cottage at Champot with Alice Becker-Ho, his second wife. He continued to correspond on political and other issues, notably with Lebovici and the Italian situationist Gianfranco Sanguinetti. He focused on reading material relating to war strategies, e.g. Clausewitz and Sun Tzu, and he designed a war game with Alice Becker-Ho.

=== Death ===
Just before his death, Debord filmed (although did not release) the documentary &quot;Son art et son temps&quot; (&quot;His Art and His Times&quot;), an autobiography of sorts that focused primarily on social issues in Paris in the 1990s. It has been suggested that his dark depiction of this period was a suicide note of sorts. Both Debord&#x27;s depression and alcohol consumption had become problematic, resulting in a form of polyneuritis. Perhaps to end the suffering caused by these conditions, Debord died by suicide on 30 November 1994, shooting himself through the heart. This was not the first time he attempted to end his life.

Debord&#x27;s suicide is as controversial as it is unclear. Some assert that it was a revolutionary act related to his career. Due to his involvement with the radical Situationist International (SI), as well as his sadness at &#x27;the society as a spectacle&#x27; being considered a cliché in later life, many think that Debord felt hopeless about the very society he was trying to shed light on. Debord was said to be &quot;victim of the Spectacle he fought&quot;. Among the many commentaries on Debord&#x27;s demise, one scholar noted: &quot;Guy Debord did not kill himself. He was murdered by the thoughtlessness and selfishness of so-called scholars (primarily trendy lit-criters) who colonized his brilliant ideas and transformed his radical politics into an academic status symbol not worth the pulp it&#x27;s printed on...&quot;

== Works ==

===Written works===
Guy Debord&#x27;s best known works are &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; and &quot;Comments on the Society of the Spectacle&quot;. In addition to these works he wrote a number of autobiographical books including &quot;Mémoires&quot;, &quot;Panégyrique&quot;, &quot;Cette Mauvaise Réputation...&quot;, and &quot;Considérations sur l&#x27;assassinat de Gérard Lebovici&quot;. He was also the author of numerous short pieces, sometimes anonymous, for the journals &quot;Potlatch&quot;, &quot;Les Lèvres Nues&quot;, &quot;Les Chats Sont Verts&quot;, and &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot;. &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; was written in an &quot;interesting prose&quot;, unlike most writings in that time or of that nature. For Debord, the Spectacle is viewed as false representations in our real lives. The spectacle is a materialized worldview. The spectacle &#x27;subjects human beings to itself&#x27;.

Debord was deeply distressed by the hegemony of governments and media over everyday life through mass production and consumption. He criticized both the capitalism of the West and the dictatorial communism of the Eastern Bloc for the lack of autonomy allowed to individuals by both types of governmental structure. Debord postulated that Alienation had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the &#x27;spectacle&#x27; – &quot;a social relation between people that is mediated by images&quot; consisting of mass media, advertisement, and popular culture. The spectacle is a self-fulfilling control mechanism for society. Debord&#x27;s analysis developed the notions of &quot;reification&quot; and &quot;commodity fetishism&quot; pioneered by Karl Marx and Georg Lukács. Semiotics was also a major influence, particularly the work of his contemporary Roland Barthes, who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle. Debord&#x27;s analysis of &quot;the spectaclist society&quot; probed the historical, economic, and psychological roots of the media and popular culture.

Debord&#x27;s first book, &quot;Mémoires&quot;, was bound with a sandpaper cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it.

===Films===
Debord began an interest in film early in his life when he lived in Cannes in the late 1940s. Debord recounted that, during his youth, he was allowed to do very little other than attend films. He said that he frequently would leave in the middle of a film screening to go home because films often bored him. Debord joined the Lettrists just as Isidore Isou was producing films and the Lettrists attempted to sabotage Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s trip to Paris through negative criticism.

Overall, Debord challenged the conventions of filmmaking, prompting his audience to interact with the medium instead of being passive receivers of information. As a matter of fact, his film &quot;Hurlements&quot; exclusively consists of a series of black and white screens and silence with a bit of commentary dispersed throughout. Debord directed his first film, &quot;Hurlements en faveur de Sade&quot;, in 1952 with the voices of Michèle Bernstein and Gil Wolman. The film has no images; instead, it shows bright white when there is speaking and black when there is not. Long silences separate speaking parts. The film ends with 24 minutes of black silence. People were reported to have become angry and left screenings of this film. The script is composed of quotes appropriated from various sources and made into a montage with a sort of non-linear narrative.

Later, through the financial support of Michèle Bernstein and Asger Jorn, Debord produced a second film, &quot;Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps&quot;, which combined scenes with his friends and scenes from mass media culture. This integration of Debord&#x27;s world with mass media culture became a running motif climaxing with &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;. Debord wrote the book &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; before writing the movie. When asked why he made the book into a movie, Debord said, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why this surprised people. The book was already written like a script&quot;. Debord&#x27;s last film, &quot;Son Art et Son Temps&quot;, was not produced during his lifetime. It worked as a final statement where Debord recounted his works and a cultural documentary of &quot;his time&quot;.

== Legacy ==
On 29 January 2009, fifteen years after his death, Christine Albanel, Minister of Culture, classified the archive of his works as a &quot;national treasure&quot; in response to a sale request by Yale University. The Ministry declared that &quot;he has been one of the most important contemporary thinkers, with a capital place in history of ideas from the second half of the twentieth century.&quot; Similarly, Debord once called &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; &quot;the most important book of the twentieth century&quot;. He continues to be a canonical and controversial figure particularly among European scholars of radical politics and modern art.

In a critical appraisal written after Debord&#x27;s death, Régis Debray characterized his work as derivative of Ludwig Feuerbach (asking, for example, &quot;Had nothing, then, taken place in history and philosophy between 1841 and 1967?&quot;) and essentialist, &quot;rest[ing] on the idea of a generic nature, of man&#x27;s pre-existent essence.&quot; For Debray, Debord&#x27;s emancipatory vision is abstract and ahistorical: &quot;It disclaims political mediation as a structuring instantiation of collective existence, along with technical mediation as a structuring instantiation of the hominization process. Nor does our author ever speak the language of technology or politics: such silence is typical of the moralist in all ages and climes. He fulminates from afar without taking a look up close.&quot;

<doc id="157394" wikidata="Q761009" url="?curid=157394" title="Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros">
<text>The Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros took place during the Napoleonic Wars, on 10 and 11 November 1808 at the village of Espinosa de los Monteros in the Cantabrian Mountains. It resulted in a French victory under Marshal Victor against Lieutenant General Joaquín Blake&#x27;s Army of Galicia.

==Background==
The Dos de Mayo Uprising had put Iberia in revolt against French rule. The Spanish conventional warfare had started at El Bruch (June 1808), while the Battle of Bailen (July 1808) marked the first open-field defeat of a Napoleonic army. British intervention had started at Roliça (August 1808), and Napoleon&#x27;s personal participation in the invasion of Spain started with the engagement of Joaquín Blake&#x27;s forces at Zornoza.

== Battle ==
Victor launched a series of attacks on the first day that were thrown back with heavy losses by the disciplined regulars of General La Romana&#x27;s Division of the North. By nightfall, Blake&#x27;s positions still held. On the morning of 11 November, Victor regained his composure and coordinated a massive French attack that pierced Blake&#x27;s left wing and drove the Spaniards from the field.

General Acevedo launched a counterattack, with two brigades of the Asturian division, some five thousand troops each, commanded by Cayetano Valdés y Flores and Gregorio Bernaldo de Quirós. The troops headed downhill into a barrage of musket-fire from Maison&#x27;s brigade of fusiliers, resulting in the Spanish commanding officers, at the head of their raw recruits, bearing the brunt of the fire; General Quirós was killed and both Valdés and Acevedo were seriously wounded, the latter blinded. The defeated Army of the Left suffered over five thousand casualties.

Blake led his remaining men through a heroic retreat west through the mountains to escape Soult&#x27;s pursuit. However, when Blake arrived at León on 23 November, only 20,000 of his men remained, in an extremely bad condition.

==Aftermath==
Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain proceeded with the Battle of Tudela.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;The Gun&quot;, by C. S. Forester (author of the Horatio Hornblower series), begins with the Spanish retreat from Espinoza.

<text>Daniel Dominic Kaplan Sleator (born 10 December 1953) is a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, United States. In 1999, he won the ACM Paris Kanellakis Award (jointly with Robert Tarjan) for the splay tree data structure.

He was one of the pioneers in amortized analysis of algorithms, early examples of which were the analyses of the move-to-front heuristic, and splay trees. He invented many data structures with Robert Tarjan, such as splay trees, link/cut trees, and skew heaps.

The Sleator and Tarjan paper on the move-to-front heuristic first suggested the idea of comparing an online algorithm to an optimal offline algorithm, for which the term competitive analysis was later coined in a paper of Karlin, Manasse, Rudolph, and Sleator. Sleator also developed the theory of link grammars, and the Serioso music analyzer for analyzing meter and harmony in written music.

==Personal life==
Sleator was born to William Warner Sleator, Jr., a professor of physiology and biophysics, and Esther Kaplan Sleator, a pediatrician who did pioneering research on attention deficit disorder (ADD). He is the younger brother of William Sleator, who wrote science fiction for young adults.

Sleator commercialized the volunteer-based Internet Chess Server into the Internet Chess Club despite outcry from fellow volunteers. The ICS has since become one of the most successful internet-based commercial chess servers.

From 2003 to 2008, Sleator co-hosted the progressive talk show &quot;Left Out&quot; on WRCT-FM with Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science faculty member Bob Harper.

He is also an active member of the competitive programming platform Codeforces.

<doc id="157400" wikidata="Q241108" url="?curid=157400" title="Battle of Friedland">
<text>The Battle of Friedland (14 June 1807) was a major engagement of the Napoleonic Wars between the armies of the French Empire commanded by Napoleon I and the armies of the Russian Empire led by General Levin August von Bennigsen. Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle river by the end of the fighting. The battlefield is located in modern-day Kaliningrad Oblast, near the town of Pravdinsk, Russia. 
The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated reserve corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon&#x27;s numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units before Napoleon could save them, and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes skillfully held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000–60,000 men on the opposite bank of the river, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&#x27;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops close to the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers and the vulnerability of the Russians with their backs to the river, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland–losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield.

Napoleon&#x27;s overwhelming victory was enough to convince the Russian political establishment that peace was necessary. Friedland effectively ended the War of the Fourth Coalition, as Emperor Alexander I reluctantly entered peace negotiations with Napoleon. These discussions eventually culminated in the Treaties of Tilsit, by which Russia agreed to join the Continental System against Great Britain and by which Prussia lost almost half of its territories. The lands lost by Prussia were converted into the new Kingdom of Westphalia, which was governed by Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Jérôme. Tilsit also gave France control of the Ionian Islands, a vital and strategic entry point into the Mediterranean Sea. Some historians regard the political settlements at Tilsit as the height of Napoleon&#x27;s empire because there was no longer any continental power challenging the French domination of Europe.

==Background==
Prior to Friedland, Europe had become embroiled in the War of the Third Coalition in 1805. Following the French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805, Prussia went to war in 1806 to recover her position as the leading power of Central Europe.

===The Prussian Campaign===
Franco-Prussian tensions gradually increased after Austerlitz. Napoleon insisted that Prussia should join his economic blockade of Great Britain. This adversely affected the German merchant class. Napoleon ordered a raid to seize a subversive, anti-Napoleonic bookseller named Johann Philipp Palm in August 1806, and made a final attempt to secure terms with Britain by offering her Hanover, which infuriated Prussia.
The Prussians began to mobilize on 9 August 1806 and issued an ultimatum on 26 August: they required French troops to withdraw to the west bank of the Rhine by 8 October on pain of war between the two nations.

Napoleon aimed to win the war by destroying the Prussian armies before the Russians could arrive.
180,000 French troops began to cross the Franconian forest on 2 October 1806, deployed in a bataillon-carré (square-battalion) system designed to meet threats from any possible direction. On 14 October the French won decisively at the large double-battle of Jena-Auerstedt. A famous pursuit followed, and by the end of the campaign the Prussians had lost 25,000 killed and wounded, 140,000 prisoners, and more than 2,000 cannon.
A few Prussian units managed to cross the Oder River, but Prussia lost the vast majority of its army. Russia now had to face France alone. By 18 November French forces under Louis Nicolas Davout were marching from Eylau, and towards Warsaw with their spirits high. Augereau&#x27;s men had neared Bromberg, and Jérôme Bonaparte&#x27;s troops had reached the approaches of Kalisz.

===Eylau===
When the French arrived in Poland, the local people hailed them as liberators.
The Russian general Bennigsen worried that French forces might cut him off from Buxhoevden&#x27;s army, so he abandoned Warsaw and retreated to the right bank of the Vistula. On 28 November 1806 French troops under Murat entered Warsaw. The French pursued the fleeing Russians and a significant battle developed around Pułtusk on 26 December. The result remained in doubt, but Bennigsen wrote to the Tsar that he had defeated 60,000 French troops, and as a result he gained overall command of the Russian armies in Poland. At this point, Marshal Ney began to extend his forces to procure food supplies. Bennigsen noticed a good opportunity to strike at an isolated French corps, but he abandoned his plans once he realized Napoléon&#x27;s maneuvers intended to trap his army. The Russians withdrew towards Allenstein (Battle of Allenstein, 3 February), and later to Eylau.

On 7 February the Russians fought Soult&#x27;s corps for possession of Eylau. Daybreak on 8 February saw 44,500 French troops on the field against 67,000 Russians, but after receiving reinforcements the French had 75,000 men against 76,000.
Napoleon hoped to pin Bennigsen&#x27;s army long enough to allow Ney&#x27;s and Davout&#x27;s troops to outflank the Russians. A fierce struggle ensued, made worse by a blinding snowstorm on the battlefield. The French found themselves in dire straits until a massed cavalry charge, made by 10,700 troopers formed in 80 squadrons, relieved the pressure on the centre. Davout&#x27;s arrival meant the attack on the Russian left could commence, but the assault was blunted when a Prussian force under L&#x27;Estocq suddenly appeared on the battlefield and, with Russian help, threw the French back. Ney came too late to effect any meaningful decision, so Bennigsen retreated. Casualties at this indecisive battle were horrific, perhaps 25,000 on each side. More importantly, however, the lack of a decisive victory by either side meant that the war would go on.

===Heilsberg===
After several months of recuperating from Eylau, Napoleon ordered the on the move once again. Learning that the Russians had encamped at their operational base in the town of Heilsberg, by the Alle River, Napoleon decided to conduct a general assault in the hopes of dislodging what he thought was the rearguard of the Russian army. In fact, the French ran into the entire Russian army of over 50,000 men and 150 artillery guns. Repeated and determined attacks by the French failed to dislocate the Russians, who were fighting inside elaborate earthworks designed to prevent precisely the kind of river crossing Napoleon was attempting. French casualties soared to 10,000 while the Russians lost about 6,000. The Russians eventually withdrew from Heilsberg as their position became untenable, prompting Napoleon to chase after them once again. The French headed in the direction of Königsberg to gain additional supplies and provisions. 

On 13 June the advance guard of Marshal Lannes reported seeing large numbers of Russian troops at the town of Friedland. Both sides engaged one another for the remainder of the day with no result. Crucially, Bennigsen believed he had enough time to cross the Alle the following day, to destroy the isolated units of Lannes, and to withdraw back across the river without ever encountering the main French army.

==Battle==

Bennigsen&#x27;s main body began to occupy the town on the night of 13 June, after Russian forces under General Golitsyn had driven off the French cavalry outposts. The army of Napoleon marched on Friedland, but remained dispersed on its various march routes, and the first stage of the engagement became a purely improvisational battle. Knowing that Napoleon was within supporting distance with at least three corps, Lannes sent aides galloping off with messages for help and waged an expert delaying action to fix Bennigsen in place. With never more than 26,000 men, Lannes forced Bennigsen to commit progressively more troops across the Alle to defeat him. 

Showing a bold front, and shifting troops where needed to stop Russian advances, the French engaged the Russians first in the Sortlack Wood and in front of Posthenen in the early hours of the 14th. Lannes held Bennigsen in place until the French had massed 80,000 troops on the west bank of the river. Both sides now used their cavalry freely to cover the formation of lines of battle, and a race between the rival squadrons for the possession of Heinrichsdorf ended in favor of the French under Grouchy and Nansouty. Bennigsen was trapped and had to fight. Having thrown all of his pontoon bridges at or near the bottleneck of the village of Friedland, Bennigsen had unwittingly trapped his troops on the west bank.

In the meantime Lannes fought hard to hold Bennigsen. Napoleon feared that the Russians meant to evade him again, but by 6 am Bennigsen had nearly 50,000 men across the river and forming up west of Friedland. His infantry, organized in two lines, extended between the Heinrichsdorf-Friedland road and the upper bends of the river along with the artillery. Beyond the right of the infantry, cavalry and Cossacks extended the line to the wood northeast of Heinrichsdorf. Small bodies of Cossacks penetrated even to Schwonau. The left wing also had some cavalry and, beyond the Alle river, batteries came into action to cover it. A heavy and indecisive fire-fight raged in the Sortlack Wood between the Russian skirmishers and some of Lannes&#x27;s troops.

The head of Mortier&#x27;s (French and Polish) corps appeared at Heinrichsdorf and drove the Cossacks out of Schwonau. Lannes held his own, and by noon Napoleon arrived with 40,000 French troops at the scene of the battle. Napoleon gave brief orders: Ney&#x27;s corps would take the line between Postlienen and the Sortlack Wood, Lannes closing on his left, to form the centre, Mortier at Heinrichsdorf the left wing. I Corps under General Victor and the Imperial Guard were placed in reserve behind Posthenen. Cavalry masses were collected at Heinrichsdorf. The main attack was to be delivered against the Russian left, which Napoleon saw at once to be cramped in the narrow tongue of land between the river and the Posthenen mill-stream. Three cavalry divisions were added to the general reserve.

The course of the previous operations meant that both armies still had large detachments out towards Königsberg. The emperor spent the afternoon in forming up the newly arrived masses, the deployment being covered by an artillery bombardment. At 5 o&#x27;clock all was ready, and Ney, preceded by a heavy artillery fire, rapidly carried the Sortlack Wood. The attack was pushed on toward the Alle. Marshal Ney&#x27;s right-hand division under Marchand drove part of the Russian left into the river at Sortlack, while the division of Bisson advanced on the left. A furious charge by Russian cavalry into the gap between Marchand and Bisson was repulsed by the dragoon division of Latour-Maubourg.

Soon the Russians found themselves huddled together in the bends of the Alle, an easy target for the guns of Ney and of the reserve. Ney&#x27;s attack indeed came eventually to a standstill; Bennigsen&#x27;s reserve cavalry charged with great effect and drove him back in disorder. As at Eylau, the approach of night seemed to preclude a decisive success, but in June and on firm ground the old mobility of the French reasserted its value. The infantry division of Dupont advanced rapidly from Posthenen, the cavalry divisions drove back the Russian squadrons into the now congested masses of infantry on the river bank, and finally the artillery general Sénarmont advanced a mass of guns to case-shot range. The terrible effect of the close range artillery saw the Russian defense collapsing within minutes, as canister decimated the ranks. Ney&#x27;s exhausted infantry succeeded in pursuing the broken regiments of Bennigsen&#x27;s left into the streets of Friedland. Lannes and Mortier had meanwhile held the Russian centre and right on its ground, and their artillery had inflicted severe losses. When Friedland itself was seen to be on fire, the two marshals launched their infantry attack. Fresh French troops approached the battlefield. Dupont distinguished himself for the second time by fording the mill-stream and assailing the left flank of the Russian centre. This offered stubborn resistance, but the French steadily forced the line backwards, and the battle was soon over.

The Russians suffered heavy losses in the disorganized retreat over the river, with many soldiers drowning. Farther north the still unbroken troops of the right wing withdrew by using the Allenburg road; the French cavalry of the left wing, though ordered to pursue, remained inactive. French casualties numbered approximately 10,000 soldiers while the Russians suffered at least 20,000 casualties.

==Aftermath==

On 19 June Emperor Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with the French. Napoleon assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: &quot;I hate the English as much as you do.&quot; Napoleon reportedly replied, &quot;Then we have already made peace.&quot; The two emperors spent several days reviewing each other&#x27;s armies, passing out medals, and frequently talking about non-political subjects.

Although the negotiations at Tilsit featured plenty of pageantry and diplomatic niceties, they were not spared from ruthless politics. Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia and appointed his young brother Jérôme as its new monarch, and a 40,000 square mile Polish state entitled the Duchy of Warsaw, with the King of Saxony as its duke. Prussia&#x27;s humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic Era progressed. Moreover, Alexander&#x27;s pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days. His arrival was greeted with huge celebrations in Paris.

In 1810 a new ship-of-the-line of the French navy was named &quot;Friedland&quot;, to commemorate this battle. This ship of 80 guns of the &quot;Bucentaure&quot; class was built in Antwerp. After the fall of the French empire the ship was transferred to the new Dutch navy and named &quot;Vlaming&quot;. In 1840 another ship of the French navy was called &quot;Friedland&quot;.

==In literature and the arts==
The battle is mentioned as a pivotal event, though not described, in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

<text>At the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro (3–5 May 1811), the Anglo-Portuguese Army under Wellington checked an attempt by the French Army of Portugal under Marshal André Masséna to relieve the besieged city of Almeida.

A bloody stalemate was not the sort of battle that had been expected to follow André Masséna&#x27;s expulsion from Portugal. His confidence and moral authority having been much boosted by holding the Lines of Torres Vedras, the spring of 1811 found Wellington intending to move over to the offensive, for which policy he had received de facto authorisation from his political masters in London, where talks of major reductions in the size of the army employed in Portugal had been replaced by promises of major reinforcements. 

Supply difficulties, sickness amongst the troops and want of siege artillery ensured that in the short term no great strokes of strategy could be envisaged, but it was hoped that Almeida, Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz might be all recaptured, thereby opening the way for lightning strikes on such targets as Salamanca or Seville. In the event, however, success was limited, the story of the rest of 1811 essentially being one of failure and frustration.

==Background==

In 1810, Masséna had followed the British–Portuguese back to Lisbon before arriving at the Lines of Torres Vedras, but was determined to avoid storming the extensive double line of interlocking fortifications. After starving outside Lisbon through a miserable winter, the French withdrew to the Spanish border with the British–Portuguese army in pursuit.

Having first secured Portugal, Wellington then set about re-taking the fortified frontier cities of Almeida, Badajoz, and Ciudad Rodrigo. Whilst Wellington besieged Almeida, Masséna reformed his battered army and marched to relieve the French garrison in the city. Wellington chose to check the relief attempt at the small village of Fuentes de Oñoro, leaving his line of retreat exposed in order to cover all routes to Almeida. He felt this risk was justified because the French would not have had more than a few days&#x27; supplies, whereas he had more than that. 

The British–Portuguese Army had 34,000 infantry, 1,850 cavalry and 48 guns. The French had 42,000 infantry, 4,500 cavalry and 38 guns.

==Organisation==

===The French Army of Portugal===
Masséna&#x27;s army was organised into four corps and a cavalry reserve. Louis Henri Loison&#x27;s VI Corps had three divisions, led by Jean Gabriel Marchand, Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet, and Claude François Ferey. In Jean-Andoche Junot&#x27;s VIII Corps, only Jean-Baptiste Solignac&#x27;s division was present. Jean-Baptiste Drouet&#x27;s IX Corps included the divisions of Nicolas François Conroux and Michel Marie Claparède. Louis Pierre, Count Montbrun headed the cavalry reserve. Jean Reynier&#x27;s II Corps hovered off to the northeast, threatening Almeida with its two divisions under Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle and Étienne Heudelet de Bierre.

An 800-man cavalry force, comprising squadrons of the &quot;élite&quot; Imperial Guard Mounted Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard and Dragoons of the Imperial Guard, was also present at the battle under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières. The reinforcements that Bessières brought were almost symbolic, even though Masséna had requested that he bring the entirety of his Army corps into battle.

===The British–Portuguese army===
Wellington commanded six infantry divisions, Charles Ashworth&#x27;s independent Portuguese brigade, and three cavalry brigades. Brent Spencer commanded the 1st Division, Thomas Picton the 3rd, William Houston the 7th, and Robert Craufurd, the Light Division. Stapleton Cotton commanded John Slade&#x27;s and Frederick von Arentschildt&#x27;s brigades of cavalry. Edward Howorth supervised four British (Ross RHA, Bull RHA, Lawson&#x27;s RA, Thompson&#x27;s RA) and four Portuguese (Arentschildt (2), Da Cunha, Rozierres) 6-gun batteries. William Erskine (5th Division), Alexander Campbell (6th Division), and 300 Portuguese cavalry under Count Barbacena were detached, facing the French II Corps.

==Battle==
On 3 May, Masséna launched a frontal assault against the British–Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while bombarding the British–Portuguese on the heights east of the village with heavy artillery. The fight in the centre of the village lasted all that day, with French soldiers of Ferey&#x27;s and Marchand&#x27;s divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions.

At first, the British–Portuguese were driven back under immense pressure, but a charge that included men of the 71st Highland Light Infantry reclaimed the streets and buildings lost earlier in the day. As the sun sank, the French withdrew and the village remained in British hands, with the former suffering 650 casualties against only 250 for the British.

Both sides spent 4 May recovering from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington&#x27;s right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Poco Velho.

Action began again at dawn on 5 May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Masséna launched a heavy attack on the weak British–Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun&#x27;s dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet, and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King&#x27;s German Legion cavalry.

On the threatened British–Portuguese right flank, the elite Light Division, well-supported by cavalry and artillery, made a textbook fighting withdrawal. For trifling casualties, they covered the retreat of the 7th Division and fell back into a stronger position selected by Wellington. During the retreat, whenever French artillery ventured too close, the British cavalry charged or feinted a charge. This allowed the infantry time to retreat out of range. If the French horsemen pressed the outnumbered British cavalry back, the British–Portuguese infantry formed squares and their volleys drove off the French. Montbrun then requested help from the Imperial Guard cavalry, which were present but had not yet been committed to battle.

Time was of the essence and Masséna at once sent one of his &quot;aides-de-camp&quot;, Charles Oudinot, the son of Marshal Nicolas Oudinot, Duke of Reggio, with orders to bring forward the Guard cavalry. The young Oudinot hastily set off and Masséna was impatiently checking his watch, pressed to commit this cavalry to what he believed was a decisive action of the battle. Much to the general staff&#x27;s stupefaction, Oudinot was soon seen returning without any cavalry following him. As soon as he saw him, Masséna furiously shouted from afar: &quot;Where is the cavalry of the Guard?&quot;. The sweaty, dust-covered Oudinot needed a moment to catch his breath after his exhausting gallop but then explained that he was not able to fetch it. Oudinot had encountered the Guard cavalry second-in-command, General Louis Lepic, who sharply refused to commit his men, saying that he only recognised the Duke of Istria (Bessières) as commander and that without explicit orders from its commander, the Guard Horse Grenadiers and Dragoons would not draw their swords. In a staggering display of treachery, Bessières was absent from the field of battle, needlessly inspecting a series of ditches where the French army had passed a few days before. Unable to find the commander of the Guard in time, Masséna was forced to admit that the opportunity was lost.

Two incidents spoiled this otherwise fine accomplishment for the British–Portuguese. One occurred when a British 14th Light Dragoon squadron pressed home a frontal attack on a French artillery battery and was mauled. In the second case, French cavalry caught some companies of the 3rd Foot Guards in skirmish order and inflicted 100 casualties.

Masséna, however, still aimed primarily to secure Fuentes de Oñoro. He sent forward massed columns of infantry from Ferey&#x27;s division. The village, filled with low stone walls, provided excellent cover for the British line infantry and skirmishers, while the French were severely restricted in the little narrow streets. At first, the French had some success, wiping out two companies of the 79th Foot and wounding the regiment&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Philips Cameron, who died some days later. But a counterattack chased Ferey&#x27;s men out of the village.

General d&#x27;Erlon launched a second attack on the village. This time, it was led by three battalions of converging grenadiers from the IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. d&#x27;Erlon threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Claparède&#x27;s divisions, seizing almost the entire village.

In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th &quot;Caçadores&quot;, led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot. This broke d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s attack, and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. One party of 100 grenadiers was trapped in a tight spot and killed. Facing murderous volleys, the French halted and retreated back to the Dos Casas, leaving their casualties behind. By sunset, French morale had plummeted and many companies were down to 40% strength.

The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington&#x27;s cannons. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington&#x27;s men entrenched during the evening. After spending the next three days parading before the British position, Masséna gave up the attempt and retreated to Ciudad Rodrigo. He was furious because Bessières had refused to fetch ammunition from the citadel.

==Consequences==
Wellington had repelled Napoleon&#x27;s Army of Portugal, inflicting a great number of casualties, and was able to continue his blockade of Almeida. The numbers of losses vary according to different sources, from 2,200 to 2,800 French compared to the loss of 1,800 British–Portuguese, while another historian stated there were 2,800 French and 1,800 British–Portuguese losses. However, he acknowledged how dangerous the situation had been, saying later, &quot;If Boney had been there, we should have been beat.&quot; Russian historian Oleg Sokolov noted that Wellington had committed a serious strategic error by following the French into northern Portugal, and that this decision could have had grievous consequences for the British–Portuguese. Sokolov adds that, despite the various setbacks that he encountered before and during the battle, Masséna was still able to check Wellington&#x27;s position at Fuentes de Oñoro. Wellington himself did not mark the battle as a victory; he also considered that he had unnecessarily extended his line, putting the 7th Division and Light Division in danger.

Two nights after Masséna&#x27;s withdrawal, Antoine Brenier&#x27;s 1,400-man French garrison of Almeida slipped through the British–Portuguese lines during the night. About 360 French troops were captured, but the rest escaped when their British pursuers ran into a French ambush. This fiasco was blamed on Erskine and others. An infuriated Wellington wrote, &quot;I have never been so much distressed by any military event as by the escape of even a man of them.&quot;

On reaching Ciudad Rodrigo, Masséna was recalled to Paris by a furious Napoleon to explain his actions (although Napoleon had issued the order to return prior to the battle). He was replaced by Marshal Auguste Marmont. Masséna set off for France with a vast sum of gold, looted from Portugal and Spain. The defeated French marshal complained that Wellington &quot;had not left him one black hair on his body—he had turned grey all over.&quot;

This battle also included a notable friendly fire incident when a French infantry unit mistook their allies, the , for an English battalion and opened fire on them. The unfortunate Hanoverians retreated hastily past the village, leaving over 100 dead. The confusion came about because the Hanoverian Legion wore red coats, and in the smoke and heat of battle the finer details of uniforms that might have distinguished them from British line infantry were easily overlooked.

Wellington commended his troops for their generosity after the battle, writing, &quot;The village of Fuentes de Oñoro having been the field of battle the other day, and not having been much improved by this circumstance, they immediately and voluntarily subscribed to raise a sum of money, to be given to the inhabitants as a compensation for the damage which their properties have sustained in the contest.&quot;

The battle is included in the list of French victories on the Arc de Triomphe as FUENTE D&#x27;OŨORO, despite being a tactical draw and strategic defeat.

The book includes most of the events of the battle and a description of the British right-wing withdrawal conducted under the Light Division&#x27;s commander Robert Craufurd. The novel has several fictional characters, but includes actual historic people, such as Wellington and Massena.

<text>The First Battle of Höchstädt took place on 20 September 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Fought near Höchstädt an der Donau in Bavaria, a combined Franco-Bavarian force under Claude Louis Hector de Villars defeated an Imperial army led by Hermann Otto II of Limburg Stirum.

During the summer of 1703, a Franco-Bavarian offensive along the Danube potentially threatened the Habsburg capital of Vienna. In response, Imperial forces under Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden entered Bavaria, and captured Augsburg. He then ordered Limburg Stirum to cross the Danube at Donauwörth with 18,000 men, and join an attack on the Franco-Bavarian camp at Nordendorf. The latter arrived in Höchstädt on 19 September, but Villars and Maximilian had already reached Donauwörth. 

Early on the morning on 20 September, Limburg Stirum found the main Franco-Bavarian army of 15,000 was advancing on him from Donauwörth, with a corps of 8,000 under the Marquis d&#x27;Husson in his rear. He therefore decided to withdraw north to Nördlingen, but was attacked by d&#x27;Husson as he did so. The Imperials drove their outnumbered opponents back, before the main Franco-Bavarian force arrived on the battlefield at 11:00 am. Attempts to block the road north nearly succeeded, before a stubborn rearguard action by Prussian troops under Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau enabled the rest of the infantry to make an orderly retreat.

The Imperials lost around 4,500 men compared to 1,500 for the Franco-Bavarians, as well as much of their baggage, but Maximilian opted not to pursue. The 1704 Battle of Blenheim was fought over much of the same ground. 

==Background==
When the War of the Spanish Succession began in March 1701, it was initially focused on the Spanish Netherlands and Northern Italy. In 1702, fighting expanded into Germany, with an Imperial army under Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, capturing Landau in September. Soon afterwards, Bavaria joined the French coalition, with Villars winning a minor victory at Friedlingen in October. However, this had little impact on the strategic situation, with both sides going into winter quarters. 

1703 began with a campaign along the Danube by Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. By the end of April, he held strongholds along the river stretching from Ulm to Regensburg, home of the Imperial Diet. Villars, who had spent the winter in Strasbourg, capital of French Alsace, crossed the Rhine at Kehl on 28 April, and met up with the Bavarians at Ehingen in mid-May.

He tried to persuade Maximilian to join him in marching down the Danube and taking Vienna, the Austrian capital, a plan vetoed by Maximilian. Instead, the Bavarians advanced south into the Tyrol, but were forced to withdraw in late August. While Maximilian was engaged in this attempt, Louis William marched into Bavaria and took up positions around Haunsheim, just north of Dillingen an der Donau. To monitor his movements, Villars constructed a fortified camp outside Dillingen, where he was joined by Maximilian on 1 September. 

While the two commanders argued over their next move, Louis William left Hermann Otto II of Limburg Stirum and 18,000 men to keep them occupied. On 3 September, he himself crossed the Danube with a small force at Munderkingen, south of Ehingen. From there, he marched on Augsburg, a move that threatened Munich, the Bavarian capital. Taken by surprise, Maximilian and Villars tried to intercept him, leaving 13,000 troops at Dillingen under the Marquis d&#x27;Husson. 

They were too late to save Augsburg, which surrendered on 6 September, and withdrew to positions around Nordendorf, on the right bank of the Danube, east of Dillingen. Louis William now ordered Limburg Stirum to cross the Danube at Donauwörth, then join him in attacking the Franco-Bavarian camp. However, his artillery was delayed, giving Villars and Maximilian time to reach Donauwörth first, and order d&#x27;Husson to move up from Dillingen. When Limburg Stirum stopped at Höchstädt an der Donau on 19 September, he was unaware there were 15,000 men blocking his advance, with d&#x27;Husson and 8,000 men closing from behind.

==Battle==
The Imperial army spent the night camped on level ground outside Schwenningen, from Höchstädt. At 6:00 am on 20 September, Bavarian cavalry scouts from Donauwörth clashed with Prussian outposts in Tapfheim, while Imperial foragers ran into d&#x27;Husson&#x27;s advance guard under General Cheyladet. Correctly deducing he was threatened from two sides, Limburg Stirum held a hurried conference with his deputies, Lieutenant-General Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg and the leader of the Prussian contingent, Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. Deciding their current position was indefensible, they agreed to withdraw along the road running north from Schwenningen to Nördlingen. In preparation, his artillery fired three shots, the signal for all troops to return to the main army.

Unfortunately, this was also the signal Villars had previously agreed with d&#x27;Husson would indicate he was ready to attack. Assuming this to be the case, the latter launched his assault prematurely at 8:00 am, with Villars still some distance away. While this stopped the retreat, and both sides suffered heavy casualties in a series of bloody firefights, the Imperial troops eventually drove back their outnumbered opponents. French units around Höchstädt and its castle repulsed a number of Prussian assaults, but by 11:00 am d&#x27;Husson&#x27;s corps was disintegrating. Limburg Stirum thought he had won a victory, only to find the main Franco-Bavarian army had now reached the battlefield. Bavarian cavalry under the Graf von Arco immediately attacked the Imperial lines, to provide time for their slower moving infantry to cut the road to Nördlingen.

By 13:00, the Imperial cavalry had been in action for nearly five hours, and taken heavy losses. Limburg Stirum gave them permission to withdraw, with the infantry left to fight their way out, a situation made more difficult because they had to abandon their baggage and ammunition supplies. At one point, four battalions of French infantry managed to get across their line of retreat, and the road was re-opened only by a series of desperate charges. The rear guard was formed by Anhalt-Dessau&#x27;s Prussians, whose stubborn resistance gave the rest of the Imperial infantry time to escape.

==Aftermath==
By 16:00, the last of the Imperial infantry had exited the battlefield, reaching Nördlingen around midnight. Estimates of casualties vary; in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Villars claimed to have killed, wounded or captured over 12,000, for the loss of only 1,000. Other sources suggest 4,500 Imperial casualties, those of the Franco-Bavarian force being around 1,500. Prussian archives put their own losses as 900 from a contingent of 6,000, with another 3,000 attributed to the rest of the army.

Although Villars wanted to pursue, Maximilian argued their troops were in no shape to do so, having marched nearly in twelve hours, then fought a battle. He besieged Augsburg instead, which surrendered in early October, but this irretrievably damaged his relationship with Villars, who was recalled to France. Despite the failure of their Bavarian offensive, Imperial units based in the Lines of Stollhofen blocked French attempts to break into the northern Rhineland. Louis William played an important role in the 1704 campaign that ended at Blenheim, fought over much of the same ground, and known to the Dutch and Germans as the Second Battle of Höchstädt.

<text>The Battle of Höchstädt was fought on 19 June 1800 on the north bank of the Danube near Höchstädt, and resulted in a French victory under General Jean Victor Marie Moreau against the Austrians under Baron Pál Kray. The Austrians were subsequently forced back into the fortress town of Ulm. Instead of attacking the heavily fortified, walled city, which would result in massive losses of personnel and time, Moreau dislodged Kray&#x27;s supporting forces defending the Danube passage further east. As a line of retreat eastward disappeared, Kray quickly abandoned Ulm, and withdrew into Bavaria. This opened the Danube pathway toward Vienna.

The Danube passage connecting Ulm, Donauwörth, Ingolstadt and Regensburg had strategic importance in the ongoing competition for European hegemony between France and the Holy Roman Empire; the army that commanded the Danube, especially its passage through Württemberg and Bavaria, could command access to the important cities of Munich and the seat of Habsburg authority: Vienna. The result of the battle was the opposite of what had occurred on those same fields in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession, when the Second Battle of Höchstädt had ensured the safety of Vienna and opened the pathway into France for the allied English and Austrian forces.

==Background==
Although the First Coalition forces achieved several initial victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797). This treaty proved difficult to administer. Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories. A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be mediatised to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses, but was unable to make any progress. Supported by French republican forces, Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings, ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war. By early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. An uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous for the French to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.

At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day&#x27;s march from French-held Switzerland.

General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau&#x27;s true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe&#x27;s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans. Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray&#x27;s army, Moreau&#x27;s forces lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, while portions of Kray&#x27;s army was still guarding the passes on the other side. Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between Moreau&#x27;s and Kray&#x27;s armies. The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under Joseph Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to retreat north to Meßkirch, where his army enjoyed a more favorable defensive position. It also meant, however, that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Vorarlberg was cut off.

On 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Meßkirch. At nearby Krumbach, where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Meßkirch. Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen, followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby Biberach an der Ris ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000 man-strong French &quot;Center&quot;, commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr against a Habsburg force of similar size. Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.

==Order of battle==

===French===

Sources are unclear which forces were present. Certainly, it was approximately 40,000 troops, and possibly 60,000, well above the 10,000–30,000 total Austrian and Württemberg numbers. Contemporary accounts place the 94th Demi-brigade at the center of action in Gremheim, a village between Höchstädt and Donauwörth, about half a mile (800m) from Blindheim. This suggests the presence of General Claude Jacques Lecourbe&#x27;s Corps, including the forces of generals Laval, Molitor, Jardon, and VanDamme. This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau&#x27;s dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the &quot;London Chronicle&quot;, 10 June 1800. &quot;The 6th chasseurs, 13th cavalry, 4th hussars and 11th chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair. The rest of the division, and that of LeClere, passed rapidly the Danube... General Grenier was equally well prepared.&quot; In his &quot;Art of War&quot;, Baron Antoine-Henri Jomini also refers to General Dedon-Duclos as having a key role in the French success at Höchstädt.

===Austrian===

The Allied force included approximately 20,000 Habsburg regulars and Württemberg&#x27;s contingent of troops raised for the war:

*FZM Count Anton Sztáray, commanding
** FML von Ferdinand August Freiherr von Hügel&#x27;s Württemberg Contingent, including
***General Beulwitz, Infantry Regiment Beulwitz, Seckendorf and Seeger (1 battalion each)
***Füss-Jägers (three companies);
***Garde du Corps (1 squadron)
***3 squadrons of light horse
***Contingent regiments commanded by von Zobel, von Mylius, and von Oberniz (1 battalion each)
***20 guns
**Austrian regulars
***Royal Regiment Albert, Number 3 (6 squadrons)
***Hohenzollern Number 8 (6 squadrons)
***Hussar Regiment Vécsey Number 4 (8 squadron)
***Blankenstein Number 6 (8 squadron)

Total Austrian-Württemberg force: 20,000 men.

==Dispositions==
Kray assumed that Moreau would follow him to the fortress at Ulm, on the Danube, where he arrayed most of the Austrian regulars and Württemberg contingent and supplies. This position gave him ready access to both shores of the river and effectively, he assumed, blocked Moreau&#x27;s path into Bavaria. At several points east on the Danube, he posted modest forces to protect the river crossings there, and to dismantle, if necessary, the stone bridges across the river. Several bridges crossed the river between Ulm and Donauwörth, which lay downstream to the east, and each presented a strategic point at which to rupture Kray&#x27;s potential line of march into Bavaria: Leipheim, Günzburg, Gundelfingen, Lauingen, Dillingen, Höchstädt, Gremheim, and Elchingen.

According to Moreau&#x27;s narrative, he intended to force Kray to either come to battle outside Ulm, or to abandon the city. Ulm obstructed unfettered French access into Bavaria, and blocked the main force of the Army of the Rhine. To keep his forces secure, accepted military wisdom required that Moreau secure at least half of the crossings of the river, and that his troops follow a line of march perpendicular to the river. This would prevent them from having to fight a battle (or a skirmish) with their backs to the river. The more bridges his force could take, the more secure the approach on Ulm.

==General engagement==

Moreau appeared to march toward Ulm, which lay some twenty miles east of Sigmaringen and Biberach an der Ris, where his army and Kray&#x27;s had engaged a few days earlier. Instead of striking directly at the well-fortified and supplied city, however, his force suddenly veered to the east and struck at the smaller forces posted between Ulm and Donauwörth. Lecourbe first secured posts in Landsberg and Augsburg, and left sufficient rearguard troops to protect himself from Prince Reuss-Plauen, who remained in the Tyrol, guarding mountain access to Vienna. He then approached Dettingen, Blindheim (Blenheim) and Höchstädt. The Corps of General Grenier has been posted with their right flank to the Danube and Gunzburg, and their left flank at Kinsdorf. General Richepanse protected both shores of the Iller, covering the road from Ulm south to Memmingen, and secured communication with Switzerland; there, he withstood considerable skirmishing with the Austrians. Three divisions of reserve remained at the hamlets of Kamlack and Mindel, to support the attack made by General Lecourbe on Ulm, in a case it should succeed, or Grenier&#x27;s attack upon Gunzburg, in case Lecourbe should not succeed.

Lecourbe made several feints on the bridge at Dillingheim, but his reconnaissance suggested instead that he focus on the bridges at Gremsheim, Blindheim and Höchstädt, which he did the next day. A small group of 80 or so men from the 94th Demi-brigade managed a spectacular crossing of the river. After stripping their clothing and weapons, and loading them into a small raft, the naked men swam the river, pulling their raft behind them. Once reaching the other side, they took possession of several guns and some ammunition, wood, and materials. Here they held their position until some artillery men managed to scramble across the wreck of the bridge at Gremsheim and support them. The pioneers and bridge builders reconstructed the bridges under Austrian fire, allowing the remainder of the 94th to cross the river. This accomplishment seemed to mark the turning point of the action, at least it did to Moreau, who mentioned it at length in his dispatch. A full Austrian corps maintained a stand at Höchstädt, but were dislodged by repeated attacks of carabiners, cuirassiers and hussars, who took about 2,000 of the Austrians and Würtembergers as prisoners, along with some cannons and standards.

==Aftermath==

Once the French had secured the downstream shores of the Danube, Kray had no choice but to evacuate his corps from Ulm, leaving only a small garrison behind. The French invested the fortress at Ulm immediately, and on the 20th, the 6th Chasseurs captured a convoy of 300 wagons loaded with grain. A few days later, a general armistice halted all fighting. Emperor Francis II dismissed Pál Kray and appointed his brother, the 18-year-old Archduke John, to command the Austrian army. To bolster the inexperienced archduke, the Emperor named Franz von Lauer as deputy commander and Oberst (Colonel) Franz von Weyrother as chief of staff.

The campaign culminating in Kray&#x27;s evacuation of Ulm was one of Moreau&#x27;s most resounding triumphs. Napoleon Bonaparte had given Moreau specific instructions about the conduct of the campaign, all of which Moreau had ignored. Regardless, their combined efforts damaged Habsburg military operations. In early 1800, while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany, Massena and Desaix ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy. Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo. The battle near Höchstädt, five days after the Austrian failure at Marengo, allowed the French to take Munich. The combined efforts forced the Habsburgs to accept an armistice, which ended hostilities for the rest of the summer, but the French extracted massive levies on the Bavarians. Despite these significant losses—both of them decisive—the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms. In mid-November, the French ended the truce and Moreau inflicted another significant and decisive defeat at Hohenlinden, on 3 December 1800. The subsequent Peace of Lunéville stripped Austria of much of her Italian territories, obliged the Habsburgs to recognize the French satellites in the Low Countries, Switzerland, and northern Italy, and laid the groundwork for the mediatization of the small independent ecclesiastical and secular imperial polities by the duchies of Baden and Württemberg, and the Electorate of Bavaria.

<text>The Battle of Hohenlinden was fought on 3 December 1800 during the French Revolutionary Wars. A French army under Jean Victor Marie Moreau won a decisive victory over an Austrian and Bavarian force led by 18-year-old Archduke John of Austria. The allies were forced into a disastrous retreat that compelled them to request an armistice, effectively ending the War of the Second Coalition. Hohenlinden is 33 km east of Munich in modern Germany.

General of Division Moreau&#x27;s 56,000-strong army engaged some 64,000 Austrians and Bavarians. The Austrians, believing they were pursuing a beaten enemy, moved through heavily wooded terrain in four disconnected columns. Moreau ambushed the Austrians as they emerged from the Ebersberg forest while launching Antoine Richepanse&#x27;s division in a surprise envelopment of the Austrian left flank. Displaying superb individual initiative, Moreau&#x27;s generals managed to encircle and smash the largest Austrian column.

This crushing victory, coupled with the narrow French victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800, ended the War of the Second Coalition. In February 1801, the Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville, accepting French control up to the Rhine and the French puppet republics in Italy and the Netherlands. The subsequent Treaty of Amiens between France and Britain began the longest break in the wars of the Napoleonic period.

==Background==
From April to July 1800, Moreau&#x27;s army drove the Austrian army of Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray from the Rhine River to the Inn River with victories at Stockach, Messkirch, and Höchstädt. On 15 July, the combatants agreed to an armistice. Realizing that Kray was no longer up to the task, Emperor Francis II removed him from command. The Austrian chancellor Johann Amadeus von Thugut first offered Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary command of the army but both declined. Because his brother, the capable Feldmarschall Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, also refused the command, the emperor appointed another brother, the 18-year-old Archduke John. The inexperienced youth could not cope with this enormous responsibility, so the emperor nominated Franz von Lauer as John&#x27;s second-in-command and promoted him to Feldzeugmeister. John was directed to follow Lauer&#x27;s instructions. To further complicate the clumsy command structure, the aggressive Oberst (Colonel) Franz von Weyrother was named John&#x27;s chief of staff.

The armistice was renewed in September but lapsed on 12 November. By this time, Weyrother had convinced John and Lauer to adopt an offensive posture. Weyrother&#x27;s plan called for crushing the French left wing near Landshut and lunging south to cut Moreau&#x27;s communications west of Munich. After a few days of marching, it became obvious that the Austrian army was too slow to execute such an ambitious plan. Therefore, Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the enterprise into a direct attack on Munich. Even so, the sudden advance caught Moreau&#x27;s somewhat scattered French forces by surprise and achieved local superiority.

In the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December, the Austrians drove back part of General of Division Paul Grenier&#x27;s Left Wing. The defeated French managed to inflict 3,000 casualties on the Austrians while only suffering 1,700 losses. Yet, when the Austrian leaders found that Grenier evacuated Haag in Oberbayern the next day, they became ecstatic. Archduke John and Weyrother overrode Lauer&#x27;s cautious counsel and launched an all-out pursuit of an enemy they believed to be fleeing. However, Moreau decided to stand and fight, deploying his army in open ground near Hohenlinden. To approach his position, the Austro-Bavarians had to advance directly west through heavily wooded terrain.

==Plans==
Moreau&#x27;s main defensive position consisted of four divisions facing east. From north to south, these were commanded by General of Division Claude Legrand (7,900), General of Brigade Louis Bastoul (6,300), General of Division Michel Ney (9,600) and General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy (8,600). The divisions of Legrand, Bastoul and Ney belonged to Grenier&#x27;s corps. Moreau held 1,700 heavy cavalry under General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d&#x27;Hautpoul in reserve. Off to the south near Ebersberg were two more divisions, under Generals of Division Antoine Richepanse (10,700) and Charles Decaen (10,100). The divisions of d&#x27;Hautpoul, Richepanse, Decaen, and Grouchy formed Moreau&#x27;s Reserve Corps. Moreau planned to have Richepanse march northeast to strike the Austrian left, or southern flank. His main line would maneuver in open terrain and counterattack the Austrians as they emerged from the woods. Decaen would support Richepanse.

According to the battle plan drawn up by Weyrother, the Austrians advanced west in four corps. From north to south they were Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer&#x27;s Right Column (16,000), Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ludwig Anton, Count Baillet de Latour&#x27;s Right Center Column (10,800), Feldzeugmeister Johann Kollowrat&#x27;s Left Center Column (20,000), and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann Sigismund Riesch&#x27;s Left Column (13,300). The three southern columns marched near the main road from Haag to Hohenlinden. Meanwhile, Kienmayer followed the Isen River valley from Dorfen west to Lengdorf, then south to Isen, before approaching the Hohenlinden plain from the east. Archduke John rode with Kollowrat&#x27;s force, which used the main east–west highway. Latour used trails just to the north of the highway, while Riesch followed tracks just to the south. Due to the densely forested terrain, bad roads, and poor staff work, the Austrian columns were not mutually supporting. Their commanders mistakenly thought the French were in retreat and were rushing to catch their enemies before they could escape.

==Battle==
===Kollowrat and Grouchy&#x27;s fight===
All Austrian columns started at dawn. Marching on the all-weather highway, Kollowrat&#x27;s column made good time despite heavy snow. At 7:00 am, his advance guard under General-Major Franz Löpper collided with Colonel Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet&#x27;s 108th Line Infantry Demi-Brigade of Grouchy&#x27;s division. Defending deep in the forest, the 108th held their ground at first. However, General-Major Lelio Spannochi sent a grenadier battalion in a flank attack and drove the French back. Kollowrat committed General-Major Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy&#x27;s Bavarian brigade and a second grenadier battalion to keep the attack rolling.

As the Austrians burst from the tree line, Grouchy led a powerful infantry and cavalry counterattack. Kollowrat&#x27;s troops reeled back as the 11th Chasseurs à cheval Regiment broke a square of grenadiers and the 4th Hussar Regiment overran an artillery battery. Both Spannochi and the wounded Marcognet became prisoners. Having lost five cannon, Kollowrat decided to suspend his drive until Latour and Riesch came up on his flanks. Anxious about his open left flank, he sent two grenadier battalions back in search of Riesch&#x27;s column.

===Attack on Grenier&#x27;s wing===
To the north, Kienmayer flushed French outposts from Isen. These executed a planned withdrawal westward to Grenier&#x27;s main line of defense. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Karl of Schwarzenberg, who led Kienmayer&#x27;s left division, pushed southwest to crash into the divisions of Bastoul and Ney. An Austrian force captured the town of Forstern, but Moreau committed d&#x27;Hautpoul&#x27;s reserve cavalry to help drive them out. A back and forth struggle began over the hamlets of Tading, Wetting, Kreiling, and Kronacker, which run in a north to south line. The Austrian &quot;Murray&quot; Infantry Regiment Nr. 55 distinguished itself in the fighting for Kronacker, which lies only 1.3 km north of Hohenlinden. On the far north flank, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Ferdinand&#x27;s division began coming into action against Legrand near the town of Harthofen.

Latour, moving along muddy forest trails amid snow and sleet squalls, fell badly behind schedule. At 10:00 am, his column was still well to the rear of Kollowrat&#x27;s corps. By this time, the gunfire from Kienmayer&#x27;s and Kollowrat&#x27;s combats could be clearly heard to the front. Even more disturbing were sounds of battle from the south. Latour made the extraordinary decision to divide the divisions of Feldmarschall-Leutnants Prince Friedrich of Hessen-Homburg and Friedrich Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen into small task forces. He sent one infantry battalion and six cavalry squadrons to the north to look for Kienmayer. One battalion and four squadrons marched south to find Kollowrat. After advancing the bulk of his column to the village of Mittbach, Latour sent two battalions and two squadrons to assist Schwarzenberg&#x27;s attack and three battalions and an artillery battery to help Kollowrat. This left him with only three battalions and six squadrons.

===Richepanse&#x27;s envelopment===
Like Latour, Riesch&#x27;s troops had to contend with terrible roads and snow squalls. They fell far behind Kollowrat, reaching Albaching only at 9:30 am. Consequently, Richepanse&#x27;s division passed in front of Riesch. Near the village of St. Christoph, the two Austrian grenadier battalions sent by Kollowrat stumbled upon Richepanse&#x27;s marching column, cutting his division in half. With single-minded determination, the Frenchman left his rear brigade under General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Drouet to fight it out and drove to the north with his leading brigade.

With the 8th Line Demi-Brigade and 1st Chasseurs à Cheval leading, Richepanse seized the village of Maitenbeth and advanced to the main highway. There he confronted elements of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Johann of Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry division. Leaving his two advance units to bear the brunt of General-major Christian Wolfskeel&#x27;s cuirassier charges, Richepanse wheeled the 48th Line Demi-Brigade west onto the highway. Aware that this route took him directly into Kollowrat&#x27;s rear area, he formed the demi-brigade&#x27;s three battalions side by side with skirmishers protecting the flanks. Hearing firing to the east, Weyrother gathered up three Bavarian battalions from Kollowrat&#x27;s column and sent them to investigate. These units moved to the southeast and became embroiled in the fight with Drouet. Two more Bavarian battalions under General-major Karl Philipp von Wrede now appeared and blocked Richepanse&#x27;s path. After a brief fight, the 48th Line overwhelmed Wrede&#x27;s men and Weyrother fell wounded.

Riesch&#x27;s patrols told him that two French divisions were in the area. Instead of pushing into the combat raging to his front, he cautiously decided to wait for his stragglers to arrive at Albaching. He then fell into the same error as Latour. Dividing his two powerful divisions under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ignaz Gyulai and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Maximilian, Count of Merveldt into five small columns, he sent each forward on a separate forest trail. Riesch held back three battalions and most of his cavalry as a reserve.

===Crisis===
At 11:00 am, Decaen came up in support of Drouet&#x27;s brigade near the southern edge of the battlefield. The situation was very fluid, with units blundering into each other in a heavy snowfall. The fresh infusion of French troops finally broke through the opposition. Drouet led his troops north to the highway, where the 8th Line still battled Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry. Spearheaded by the Polish Danube Legion, Decaen turned east to grapple with Riesch. Decaen&#x27;s men overcame Riesch&#x27;s small columns one by one and pushed them back to the heights of Albaching. The Austrian managed to hold onto his hilltop position and capture 500 French soldiers while suffering 900 casualties.

Sensing victory, Moreau ordered Grenier&#x27;s divisions and Grouchy to attack around noon. Undeterred by Latour&#x27;s weak pressure on his front, Ney swung to his right and began pounding Kollowrat&#x27;s troops. Pressing his attack, he overran their positions, capturing 1,000 soldiers and ten cannons. Grouchy also returned to the offensive. Hemmed in on three sides by Ney, Grouchy and Richepanse, Kollowrat&#x27;s column finally disintegrated in a disorderly rout. Archduke John escaped capture on a fast horse, but many of his men were not so lucky and thousands of demoralized Austrians and Bavarians surrendered. In addition, over 60 artillery pieces fell into French hands.

Latour learned of the left center column&#x27;s fate when its fugitives flooded the nearby woods. Abandoning his position, he retreated to Isen, leaving Kienmayer to fend for himself. When Kienmayer got news of Kollowrat&#x27;s destruction, he ordered his division commanders to fall back. After a brief fight against Legrand on the north flank, Archduke Ferdinand pulled back with General-major Karl von Vincent&#x27;s dragoon brigade covering his withdrawal. Legrand reported fewer than 300 casualties while rounding up 500 prisoners and three guns. Thanks to Schwarzenberg&#x27;s able combat leadership, his division escaped a very tight spot. At one point, a French officer came forward under a flag of truce to demand his surrender, but the Austrian successfully disengaged his command and brought them to safety that evening without the loss of a single cannon.

==Aftermath==
The Austrians reported losses of 798 killed, 3,687 wounded, and 7,195 prisoners, with 50 cannons and 85 artillery caissons captured. Bavarian casualties numbered only 24 killed and 90 wounded, but their losses also included 1,754 prisoners, 26 artillery pieces, and 36 caissons. In round numbers, this amounts to 4,600 killed and wounded, plus 8,950 soldiers and 76 guns captured. The French admitted casualties of 1,839 soldiers, one cannon, and two caissons. Since several units failed to turn in reports, Moreau&#x27;s army probably lost at least 3,000 men. Bastoul was mortally wounded.

After the disaster, the Austrian high command found its scapegoat in Lauer who was summarily retired. Archduke John heaped blame on Riesch for being slow, but also considered Latour and Kienmayer at fault. Weyrother escaped censure and in 1805 his plan at the Battle of Austerlitz contributed to that disaster. Bavarian Lieutenant General Christian Zweibrücken blamed Austrian ignorance and ineptitude. Apart from Schwarzenberg, the Austrian commanders showed little initiative. Meanwhile, Moreau&#x27;s division commanders performed well, particularly Richepanse.

Archduke John ordered his demoralized army into a retreat. Moreau pursued slowly until 8 December. Then, in 15 days, his forces advanced 300 km and captured 20,000 Austrians. General of Division Claude Lecourbe&#x27;s Right Wing brushed aside Riesch at Rosenheim on 9 December. At Salzburg on 14 December, the archduke held off Lecourbe in a successful rearguard action. However, in a series of actions at Neumarkt am Wallersee, Frankenmarkt, Schwanenstadt, Vöcklabruck, Lambach and Kremsmünster during the following week, the Austrian army lost cohesion. Richepanse greatly distinguished himself in the pursuit. On 17 December, when Archduke Charles relieved his brother John, the Austrian army was practically a rabble. With French forces 80 km from Vienna, Charles requested an armistice, which Moreau granted on 25 December. The resulting Treaty of Lunéville was signed in February 1801, which was highly favourable to France. The decisive French victory at Hohenlinden made Moreau a potential rival to Napoleon Bonaparte.

==Legacy==
The battle is the subject of a poem &quot;&quot; by Thomas Campbell (1777–1844). The first verse is:
The American cities Linden, Alabama, and Linden, Tennessee, are named in honor of this battle. The former was established to serve as the county seat of Marengo County, Alabama. The county&#x27;s first European settlers were exiled French Bonapartists and many of the settlements they established were named in honor of Napoleonic victories.

<text>The Battle of Hondschoote took place during the Flanders Campaign of the Campaign of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars. It was fought during operations surrounding the siege of Dunkirk between 6 and 8 September 1793 at Hondschoote, Nord, France, and resulted in a French victory under General Jean Nicolas Houchard and General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan against the command of Marshal Freytag, part of the Anglo-Hanoverian corps of the Duke of York.

==Background==
By August 1793, the Coalition Army under command of the Austrian Prince of Coburg had taken Condé, Valenciennes, and Le Cateau in Northern France. The Allies planned to next besiege Cambrai, however the British government ordered the Duke of York&#x27;s Anglo-Hanoverian corps to instead seize the coastal port of Dunkirk, the possession of which they believed would be a valuable military base and bargaining counter. Its defences, manned by 8,000 men under the command of Joseph Souham, were thought to be in a poor state of repair and vulnerable to capture. York concentrated at Menen and split his command in two forces: 22,000 British troops he led directly to invest the city of Dunkirk, while the 14,500 man covering army of Marshal Freytag consisting of the Hanoverian troops and ten squadrons of British cavalry had to protect his left flank. The Duke of York drove Souham&#x27;s men back into Dunkirk, taking the Rosendaël suburb on 24 August then digging in to besiege Dunkirk from the east side. The siege looked as though it might be a protracted affair, as York had neither siege artillery nor the manpower to properly surround the city.

Arriving at Poperinge on 20 August, Hessian troops under Freytag&#x27;s command drove the French from Oost-Cappel and Rexpoëde back to Bergues. This fortified town was, two days later, surrounded by a corps moving south of Bergues and taking Wormhout and Esquelbecq. The corps was then spread in a thin military cordon. Its left lay at Poperinge, its right at Houtkerque. Freytag&#x27;s command was split into a number of small outposts in the occupied villages. Freytag was an experienced commander and had seen much service in the seven years war commanding light troops, however at Hondschoote his trust in the cordon system of linked army outposts was to prove fatal.

The new French commander of the Armée du Nord was Jean Nicolas Houchard, a brave and experienced subordinate general but patently out of his depth as Commander-in-Chief. Formerly one of Custine&#x27;s closest deputies, he was in his element leading the charge of a cavalry regiment, but had neither the acumen or confidence to head an army the size of the Armée du Nord. Custine had prophesied that the command of an army would be &quot;an evil present&quot; to him, &quot;Custine certainly could judge men, and he was right in this case, for all who knew the worthy old Houchard considered him as lost when given a charge so much beyond his powers”. Paris was in the grip of the Reign of Terror, hanging over him was the spectre of suspicion, Custine himself was under arrest for failing in the field and would shortly die on the scaffold. Placed between the zealous harangues of the Représentant en missions and the inadequate condition of the rag-tag troops he commanded Houchard was acutely aware that the leadership of the &#x27;Nord&#x27; could be a fatal command, and his confidence both in himself and his subordinates was greatly undermined. Houchard wrote on taking command “My life is poisoned... everywhere calumny has preceded me, everywhere I have suffered the last agony, since I have found nothing but distrust in all the persons who do not know me&quot;

Nevertheless, following the Levée en Masse the troops under his command were being rapidly reinforced with new recruits. Lazare Carnot, newly elected to the Committee of Public Safety, had galvanised the command structure and had ordered a rapid concentration of forces south of Freytag&#x27;s position. By 24 August, 20,000 men were in Cassel entrenched camp, 4,000 at Lille, and between 12 and 15,000 more were en route from the Moselle front.

The Anglo-Hanoverians were aware that the French were strengthening their front and asked for reinforcements from Coburg, but the Austrians were tied down with the siege of Le Quesnoy. The only concessions made were for a corps under Beaulieu to be moved up to Bouvines and Orchies, while the lackluster Dutch troops of the Prince of Orange spread out between Lannoy to Menin.

On 27 August Houchard launched 15,000 men in three columns against Orange and Beaulieu&#x27;s forces towards Tourcoing and Menin. Macdonald&#x27;s column was beaten back from Lannoy, and the same fate befell the command of Dumas at Lincelles. At Tourcoing, faced by Houchard&#x27;s central column the Dutch abandoned the village after a stiff fight, but the French then dispersed to plunder, only to flee on the sight of two small bodies of enemy cavalry. Houchard had intended to threaten Menin, a determined attack through here would almost certainly have cut off the entire British corps, but confusion reigned in the French camp, Houchard lost 7 guns as he fell back due to his civilian artillery drivers cutting their traces, and the opportunity was missed.

==Battle of 6 September==
Having realised that York&#x27;s objective was to besiege Dunkirk, Houchard saw his opportunity to drive a wedge between the Anglo-Hanoverians and the Austrians. However he had no intention of massing troops to strike a decisive blow, Houchard merely planned to use the concentrated forces at Cassel to demonstrate against York and draw him away from Dunkirk.

At the beginning of September Houchard learned of the execution of Custine in Paris, which sent him into a spiral of dejection and allowed the Representatives virtually a free hand. On the 5th reinforcements from the Rhine raised his forces at Cassel to 45,800 men. On the same day Freytag, fearful of the French build-up to his front, sent two detachments to seize Arneke, which was duly stormed, though a British colonel was taken prisoner. Houchard was probably aware that an enveloping attack against York&#x27;s communications would be the most effective strategy, but under pressure from the Representatives, it was resolved instead to launch a direct attack on Freytag&#x27;s thin line, spread out in detachments south of Dunkirk.

On 6 September Houchard&#x27;s forces were poised in eight commands. On the right Dumesny (9,000 men) was at Bailleul. To his North-West lay Vandamme (4,500), while Hédouville (7,400) lay at Steenvoorde. Next was Jourdan&#x27;s corps of 13,000 at the Cassel Camp. Slightly north of there on Cassel hill stood Landrin (6,000). Considerably further to the north Bergues was held by Leclaire with 6,000 men, and finally the Dunkirk garrison were to commit 6,000 in support. In total Houchard utilised some 51,000 men against York&#x27;s 35,000 across an 18-mile front.

At daybreak on the 6th, 30,000 republicans erupted from these positions. Hédouville drove the defenders from Poperinge, while on his right Vandamme advanced with little resistance to Proven. They then took Rousbrugge, crossed the Yser and halted at Oost-Capel. On the left flank Landrin came up against severe resistance at Wormhoute. Further still to the left Leclaire (6,000) advanced from Bergues but was forced back by Freytag&#x27;s right wing under Wallmoden.

In the centre Colaud&#x27;s brigade from Hédouville&#x27;s column drove the defenders from Houtkerque, where he was soon joined by Houchard with Jourdan&#x27;s Division. Houchard had planned to join Hédouville via Rousebrugge then march with both columns on Hondschoote, however on the insistence of his staff officer Ernouf he abandoned this plan and instead turned West for Herzeele, sending Colaud to Proven. Jourdan led the assault on Herzeele, which was quickly taken, and, encouraged by this success, Houchard then advance to cross the Yser and capture Bambecque.

Freytag&#x27;s men withstood the assault bravely despite being vastly outnumbered and the fighting became very protracted, those facing Houchard and Jourdan behind the Yser held out at Bambecque all day, helped by a violent rainstorm. As French ammunition began to run low Jourdan wrote to Houchard to ask if they should halt, to which the Chief of Staff Berthelmy responded &quot;we must conquer at any price; failing cartridges, are there not bayonets?&quot;. Eventually at 6.00 pm Bernadotte&#x27;s regiment managed to ford the river and the Hanoverians withdrew from Bambecque. With his men exhausted and knowing Hédouville&#x27;s column had also crossed the river at Oost-Capel Houchard wished to halt for the night, but Representative Hentz overruled him, announcing &quot;Free men were never too tired to fight the slaves of tyrants; therefore the army should continue its movement&quot;. On they pushed to Rexpoede, which was seized by Jourdan with three battalions and a regiment of cavalry.

At 8.00 pm Freytag ordered a retreat to Hondschoote, sending orders for Wallmoden&#x27;s command facing Bergues to join him there. Freytag led his men along the route via Rexpoede, unaware that the town had already fallen to the French, and the head of the column ran straight into the French outposts. After a confused scuffle Freytag was wounded and captured, together with the future Duke of Cambridge. The latter soon escaped, thanks to the help of his young Aide-de-Camp Scharnhorst, but Freytag remained a prisoner in French hands until Walmoden, who had suspected his commander could be in danger, arrived with his column at Rexpoede and retook the town, scattering Jourdan&#x27;s three battalions and almost capturing Houchard in turn. The panic was so severe that some of the French, including Bernadotte&#x27;s battalion, ran all the way back to Cassel.

Walmoden then took command of the whole corps and fell back to Hondschoote, arriving there by 6.00 am on the 7th. He stationed his left on the village of Leysele, his centre in front of the town, and his right on the Bergues canal. His front was covered by a mass of hedges and ditches, the only passage was over a dyke leading into the town of Hondschoote, however despite being a great defensive position it denied the Hanoverians the use of their cavalry, in which they greatly outclassed the French. Walmoden urgently requested reinforcements from York, but due to the flooding of the fields around Dunkirk the only way troops could be sent was via Bergues.

==Attack of 8 September==

The next day Houchard attempted to renew the assault, but Jourdan&#x27;s troops in particular were scattered and demoralised after the hard fighting, so his forces were pulled back to the south bank of the Yser to reorganize and re-supply. However to his left Leclaire advanced once more from Bergues and met with Hédouville&#x27;s column advancing from Oost-Capel. As night fell their commands lay at Rexpoede and Maison Blanche respectively. Behind them Landrin was at Wormhoudt, west of Houchard&#x27;s own command at Herzeele. Further north Vandamme with his 4,400 men left Proven and advanced on Hondschoote via Rousbrugge and Oost-Capel, only to be driven back to towards Killem by Wallmoden.

As 8 September dawned the situation lay as: Walmoden was at Hondschoote with 13,000 men, faced by the three largely fresh columns of Vandamme, Leclaire and Hédouville, 17,800 in total. Behind them lay the spent remnants of Jourdan and Houchard&#x27;s columns, some 13,000 strong, together with 6,000 fresh troops of Landrin. Further away at Bailleul lay 9,000 men under Dumesny. Thus Houchard&#x27;s command was again spread out over a wide front.

Houchard decided to launch a three pronged assault on Hondschoote. On the French left Leclaire&#x27;s column was to attack Hondschoote from the direction of Maison Blanche along the canal and the inundation. In the centre Houchard personally led the main attack with Jourdan&#x27;s Division from Rexpoede flanked on its left by Vandamme from Killem and on the right Colaud&#x27;s brigade detached from Hédouville&#x27;s command, in total a column of 20 battalions directly along the dyke covered by artillery. Hédouville was directed to move north-west to Bergues then turn eastward to join the battle at Hondschoote. Landrin&#x27;s column was sent to Dunkirk to help pin down the Duke of York. So, of his entire 43,000 men Houchard only utilised some 22,000 for the attack on Walmoden, while another 12,000 were sent to Dunkirk, and Dumesny&#x27;s 9,000 men were left facing Ypres, far from the seat of action.

This scattering of his forces was a mistake that displayed Houchard&#x27;s shortcomings as a commander, had he instead concentrated his attack against the Hanoverian left at Leysele rather than placed his main weight in the centre then Walmoden would inevitably have been forced to withdraw to protect his line of retreat. Nevertheless, tactics were on the side of the Republicans, the broken ground before Hondschoote was perfectly suited to the French use of loose skirmishers, Jourdan and Vandamme&#x27;s men kept up a constant fire from the protection of the hedges which the Hanoverians had little answer to. After four hours of determined combat however, with the fighting at such close range the opposing troops were within stabbing distance the French in the centre were making no headway and were slowly being forced back. With the centre wavering Houchard rode out to bring up Colaud&#x27;s brigade on the right, ordering Jourdan to attack again when he heard the charge sounded. As the French line began crumbling Jourdan brought forward his one remaining reserve battalion, hoping to use it as an anchor to lead an attack. Jourdan was slightly wounded in the chest, but at last Houchard&#x27;s signal was heard and the attack went forwards. On the right Houchard led the charge at the head of the 17th Cavalry.

Having lost a third of their number, with their left seriously threatened by Hedouville and ammunition running short the Hanoverians were finally forced out of the town. Having fought against incredible odds and endured heavy losses Walmoden withdrew in two disordered columns to Furnes, covered by a Hessian battalion and his cavalry which prevented any French pursuit.

==Allied retreat==

With news of his left flank exposed The Duke of York gave orders for his heavy baggage to be withdrawn to Furnes, while at a Council of War it was decided to lift the siege of Dunkirk. Souham had rendered the canal unusable for transport, so the heavy siege guns had to be abandoned. At midnight of the 8th York&#x27;s corps began withdrawing to the coastal city of Furnes (now Veurne in Flanders-Belgium), where the next day he rejoined the rest of Walmoden&#x27;s troops.

There was no pursuit by Houchard, so York was able to extricate his command without interference from the French. Part of the reason was that the French were in complete confusion by the end of the action, however Hédouville&#x27;s troops, who had been reconnoitering towards Bergues and taken no part in the action were available. Hédouville was in fact sent in pursuit, but he halted when he came to a broken bridge. Vandamme was given three cavalry regiments to cross a marsh and pursue York, some baggage was captured but nothing else.

Walmoden had lost 2,331 officers and men from his 9,000 infantry over the past few days fighting, including the Hessian General Cochenhausen, who was captured and later died of his wounds. Jomini suggests the French loss was about the same, but eye-witness Gay de Vernon estimates it as 1,800.

At Hondschoote, 30,000 French had defeated 14,500 Hessian and Hanoverian soldiers, capturing 6 flags and (as a consequence of the subsequent retreat) the Duke of York&#x27;s 32 requisitioned naval siege guns. Despite his triumph however, Houchard was seen unsympathetically by the Representatives. Not only were they witnesses to his hesitations, he refused to throw his tired and disorganised men at Yorks orderly rearguard, telling the Representative bluntly he was &#x27;not a military&#x27;. This was to prove fatal, for his failure to pursue York and stumbling command Houchard was later arrested on charges of cowardice, tried and guillotined.

==Assessment==

Alfred Burne devotes several pages assessing the siege of Dunkirk and Hondschoote, including York&#x27;s report, in which he made plain he felt Freytag was culpable. York writes of Freytag: &quot;On the 6th of September, the day of the first attack upon the Field Marshal&#x27;s Corps, He never would believe that the Enemy had forced the post on His left flank in spite of repeated reports that were sent to Him, nor was it till six in the evening, that he consented to retreat, which he did in two Columns. Instead however of sending the Artillery and baggage with General Count Walmoden&#x27;s Column which was furthest from the Enemy, He chose to take them in the rear of His own Column.&quot;

On the conduct of the Anglo-Hanoverian force Burne challenges Fortescue&#x27;s summary on several issues, pointing out that Fortescue did not have access to York&#x27;s correspondence when he wrote his History. In particular he criticises Fortescue&#x27;s assertion that Freytag should have taken position at Hondschoote from the beginning rather than the more advanced line, for reasons that Hondschoote was too narrow a front, too close to Furnes, the position lacked depth, it would have cut communication with York, and the terrain was unsuitable for cavalry. &quot;In my opinion Freytag occupied the best possible position; his mistake was that he was forgetful of the principle of maintenance of the objective – namely, to cover the besieging army – till pulled up sharply and rightly by the Duke&quot;

<text>The Battle of Inkerman was fought during the Crimean War on 5 November 1854 between the allied armies of Britain and France against the Imperial Russian Army. The battle broke the will of the Russian Army to defeat the allies in the field, and was followed by the Siege of Sevastopol. The role of troops fighting mostly on their own initiative due to the foggy conditions during the battle has earned the engagement the name &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Battle.&quot;

==Prelude to the battle==
The allied armies of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire had landed on the west coast of Crimea on 14 September 1854, intending to capture the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. The allied armies fought off and defeated the Russian Army at the Battle of Alma, forcing them to retreat in some confusion toward the River Kacha. While the allies could have taken this opportunity to attack Sevastopol before Sevastopol could be put into a proper state of defence, the allied commanders, British general FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan and the French commander François Certain Canrobert could not agree on a plan of attack.

Instead, they resolved to march around the city, and put Sevastopol under siege. Toward this end the allies marched to the southern coast of the Crimean peninsula and established a supply port at the city of Balaclava. However, before the siege of Sevastopol began, the Russian commander Prince Menshikov evacuated Sevastopol with the major portion of his field army, leaving only a garrison to defend the city. On 25 October 1854, a superior Russian force attacked the British base at Balaclava, and although the Russian attack was foiled before it could reach the base, the Russians were left holding a strong position north of the British line. Balaclava revealed the allied weakness; their siege lines were so long they did not have sufficient troops to man them. Realising this, Menshikov launched an attack across the Tchernaya River on 4 November 1854.

==Battle==
===Assault===

On 5 November 1854, the Russian 10th Division, under Lt. General , launched a heavy attack on the allied right flank atop Home Hill east from the Russian position on Shell Hill. The assault was made by two columns of 35,000 men and 134 field artillery guns of the Russian 10th Division. When combined with other Russian forces in the area, the Russian attacking force would form a formidable army of some 42,000 men. The initial Russian assault was to be received by the British Second Division dug in on Home Hill with only 2,700 men and 12 guns. Both Russian columns moved in a flanking fashion east towards the British. They hoped to overwhelm this portion of the Allied army before reinforcements could arrive. The fog of the early morning hours aided the Russians by hiding their approach. Not all the Russian troops could fit on the narrow 300-metre-wide heights of Shell Hill. Accordingly, General Soymonov had followed Prince Alexander Menshikov&#x27;s directive and deployed some of his force around the Careenage Ravine. Furthermore, on the night before the attack, Soymonov was ordered by General Peter A. Dannenberg to send part of his force north and east to the Inkerman Bridge to cover the crossing of Russian troop reinforcements under Lt. General . Thus, Soymonov could not effectively employ all of his troops in the attack.

When dawn broke, Soymonov attacked the British positions on Home Hill with 6,300 men from the Kolyvansky, Ekaterinburg and Tomsky regiments. Soymonov also had a further 9,000 in reserve. The British had strong pickets and had ample warning of the Russian attack despite the early morning fog. The pickets, some of them at company strength, engaged the Russians as they moved to attack. The firing in the valley also gave warning to the rest of the Second Division, who rushed to their defensive positions. De Lacy Evans, commander of the British Second Division, had been injured in a fall from his horse so command of the Second Division was taken up by Major-General John Pennefather, a highly aggressive officer. Pennefather did not know that he was facing a superior Russian force. Thus he abandoned Evans&#x27; plan of falling back to draw the Russians within range of the British field artillery which was hidden behind Home Hill. Instead, Pennefather ordered his 2,700 strong division to attack. When they did so, the Second Division faced some 15,300 Russian soldiers. Russian guns bombarded Home Hill, but there were no troops on the crest at this point.

===The Second Division in action; the Russians in the valley===

The Russian infantry, advancing through the fog, were met by the advancing Second Division, who opened fire with their Pattern 1851 Enfield rifles, whereas the Russians were still armed with smoothbore muskets. The Russians were forced into a bottleneck owing to the shape of the valley, and came out on the Second Division&#x27;s left flank. The Minié balls of the British rifles proved deadly accurate against the Russian attack. Those Russian troops that survived were pushed back at bayonet point. Eventually, the Russian infantry were pushed all the way back to their own artillery positions. The Russians launched a second attack, also on the Second Division&#x27;s left flank, but this time in much larger numbers and led by Soymonov himself. Captain Hugh Rowlands, in charge of the British pickets, reported that the Russians charged &quot;with the most fiendish yells you can imagine.&quot; At this point, after the second attack, the British position was incredibly weak. If Soymonov had known the condition of the British, he would have ordered a third attack before the British reinforcements arrived. Such a third attack might well have succeeded, but Soymonov could not see in the fog and thus did not know of the desperate situation of the British. Instead, he awaited the arrival of his own reinforcements—General Pavlov&#x27;s men who were making their way toward the Inkerman battlefield in four different prong attacks from the north. However, the British reinforcements arrived in the form of the Light Division which came up and immediately launched a counterattack along the left flank of the Russian front, forcing the Russians back. During this fighting Soymonov was killed by a British rifleman. Russian command was immediately taken up by Colonel Pristovoitov, who was himself shot a few minutes later. Colonel Uvazhnov-Aleksandrov assumed command of the Russian forces but was also killed in the withering British fire. At this point, no officer seemed keen to take up command and Captain Andrianov was sent off on his horse to consult with various generals about the problem.

At seven o&#x27;clock, Pavlov&#x27;s Okhotsky, Yakutsky and Selenginsky regiments crossed the Chernaia, joining Soimonov&#x27;s men. Pavlov&#x27;s Tarutinsky&#x27;s regiments engaged Adams&#x27; 700 men at the Sandbag Battery, forcing them retreat to Home Ridge.

===Home Ridge===

The Grenadiers under the command of the Duke of Cambridge arrived and initiated a new assault on Sandbag Battery. In the words of Figes, &quot;The fighting became increasingly frenzied and chaotic, as one side charged the other down the hill, only to be counter-attacked by another group of men from further up the hill.&quot; Pierre Bosquet&#x27;s Zouaves, called upon by Raglan earlier, then overwhelmed the Russians, driving the Tarutinsky Regiment from Sandbag Battery and onward to St. Clement&#x27;s Ravine, before the Zouaves joined the British on Home Ridge. Dannenberg, leading Pavolv&#x27;s Okhotsky, Yakutsky and Selenginsky regiments, with the remnants of Soimonov&#x27;s, then attacked the Sandbag Battery, while George Cathcart&#x27;s 4th Division six companies attacked the ridge by Sandbag Battery. Stunned by the French arrival, the Russians retreated to Shell Hill., where they came under fire from the British two 18-pounders. Dannenberg then ordered a retreat, and the Russians fled in panic.

===Fourth Division in action===
When the British Fourth Division arrived under General George Cathcart, they were finally able to go on the offensive, but confusion reigned. The Duke requested him to fill the &#x27;gap&#x27; on the left of the Guards, to prevent them from being isolated; when Cathcart asked Pennefather where to help, Pennefather replied &quot;Everywhere.&quot;, so Cathcart dispersed his men in different directions, until about 400 men were left. Quartermaster general Richard Airey, 1st Baron Airey told to &quot;Support the Brigade of Guards. Do not descend or leave the plateau... Those are Lord Raglan&#x27;s orders.&quot; Cathcart moved his men to the right. The courage of Cathcart and his men had the unexpected effect of encouraging other British units to charge the Russians. However, the flanking troops were caught in the rear by an unexpected Russian counter-attack, during which Cathcart, believing that the Guards had mistaken them for Russians, ordered his men to remove their greatcoats, but the firing intensified, and Cathcart was shot from his horse and killed as he led 50 men of the 20th Regiment of Foot up a hill (Cathcart&#x27;s Hill), leaving his troops disorganized and the attack was broken up. This gave the Russian army an opportunity to gain a crest on the ridge. However, as the Russian troops were coming up, they were attacked and driven off by newly arrived soldiers from the French camps. The French, with marvelous rapidity, brought up a division from five miles away and poured reinforcements into the entire line, reducing the Russians&#x27; advantage in numbers.


==Aftermath==
The dense fog precluded effective control by senior commanders, leading to fighting amongst units smaller than a company in size. Figes called it a &#x27;soldier&#x27;s battle&#x27;. Though still in control of the heights around Sevastopol, the British and French casualties were such that any further attack on Sevastopol would require reinforcements.

Alexander Kinglake obtained the official casualty returns for the battle. By his account allied casualties were: 2,573 British, of whom 635 were killed, and 1,800 French, of whom 175 were killed. Russia lost 3,286 killed within a total (including men taken prisoner) of 11,959 casualties.

== Legacy ==

The battle popularised the use of the name Inkerman in placenames in Victorian England, including Inkerman Road in Kentish Town, London, Inkerman Road, St Albans, Inkerman Street in Preston, Inkerman Way in Knaphill, and Inkerman Court, House and Way in Denby Dale. There is an Inkerman Street in Mosman Mosman, New South Wales, Australia, in at the end of Countess St. There is also an Inkerman Street in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, in between Balaclava Rd and Alma Rd. Inkerman, a locality in South Australia, was named in 1856. There is also an Inkerman, New Brunswick and an Inkerman, Ontario named after the battle.

On the popular and long running Granada Television soap opera Coronation Street, a nearby Inkerman Street has been mentioned on occasion.

On Operation Herrick in Afghanistan, there was a Forward Operating Base called FOB Inkerman.

The third company of the Grenadier Guards is known colloquially as the &quot;Inkerman Company&quot; for their part in the battle.

<text>Freedumb is the ninth studio album by American crossover band Suicidal Tendencies. It was released in 1999 on Suicidal Records.

The tracks are rawer than the funk-influenced thrash metal direction they were taking before the hiatus. The album&#x27;s cover art is a reference to the photo &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; taken during World War II.

==Reception==
&quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; wrote that the songs &quot;display thousand-mile-an-hour, classic hardcore guitar assaults.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Freedumb&quot; was ranked number 489 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>Friends &amp; Family, Vol. 1 is an album containing various artists&#x27; material including Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves. It was released by Suicidal Records in 1997.

It was sub-titled &quot;Epic Escape&quot; because Suicidal Tendencies – whose singer Mike Muir runs Suicidal Records – had exited the Epic Records label on which they had released much of their late 1980s and early 1990s material.

The Suicidal Tendencies tracks, &quot;Scream Out&quot; and &quot;We Are Family&quot;, were eventually re-recorded and ended up on their next album, &quot;Freedumb&quot; in 1999.

The Cyco Miko track, &quot;Big Fat Baby&quot;, was a re-recording of a track called &quot;Lost My Brain (Once Again)&quot; on the 1995 album of the same name.

<text>NS Gemeinschaft ; KdF) was a German NSDAP-operated leisure organization in Nazi Germany. It was part of the German Labour Front (), the national labour organization at that time. 

Set up in November 1933 as a tool to promote the advantages of Nazism to the German people and internationally, it was also used to ease the process of the rearmament of Germany. Through its structure of organized events and promotion of propaganda, it was also intended to prevent dissident and anti-state behavior. By 1939, it became the world&#x27;s largest tourism operator.

KdF was composed of several departments with their own specific goals, with each department organizing different leisure activities. It organized activities such as sporting events on factory floors, art exhibitions, discounted concerts and, most famously and popularly, subsidized holidays and cruise trips. One of its largest departments, although sometimes considered a separate organization altogether, was Beauty of Labour, which concerned itself with physical and sanitary improvements of the workplace. KdF was responsible for the improvement of several factories and sports facilities throughout its operations in the 1930s.

KdF was supposed to bridge the class divide by making middle-class leisure activities available to the masses. It also sought to bolster the German tourist industry, something it did successfully up until the outbreak of World War II. Official statistics showed that in 1934, 2.3 million people took KdF holidays. By 1938, this figure rose to 10.3 million. With the outbreak of war in 1939, most of the organization&#x27;s programs were suspended and several projects, such as the Prora holiday resort, were never completed.

== Organization ==

On November 27, 1933, Strength through Joy was announced by Robert Ley as a subset of the German Labour Front whose goal was to provide Germans with access to once-privileged leisure activities such as cruises and the ownership of motorcars. The government feared that increasing wages would dampen the rearmament process and decided to raise living standards differently to influence the opinion of Nazism, and paid for the program by taking deductions from workers&#x27; wages. By providing these luxuries, the government hoped that class divisions would be bridged leading to the building of a &#x27;people&#x27;s community,&#x27; and that a common national consciousness would end class conflict and enable all classes to work together for the greater benefit of the nation. A key feature of the people&#x27;s community was the overall good physical health of the German people, in order to produce a population fit for military service and for work. In addition, it was believed that if workers were given sufficient leisure time and provided with cleaner workplaces morale and productivity would increase, aspects needed of the working class for the rearmament. It initially was intended to focus on controlling evening and weekend leisure time, but after positive reception of KdF train trips, tourism became an important priority.

=== Departments ===
KdF had a number of individual departments. The Beauty of Labour (&quot;Schönheit der Arbeit)&quot; department was devoted to improvements in the workplace, from general hygiene to reduction of sound pollution. Other departments included the Sports Office (&quot;Sportamt),&quot; Adult Education Office (&quot;Volksbildungswerk&quot;), Leisure Time Office (&quot;Amt Feierabend),&quot; the Office for Folklore and Homeland (&quot;Amt für Volkstum und Heimat),&quot; and the Office for Travel, Hiking, and Holidays (&quot;Amt Reisen, Wandern, und Urlaub).&quot;

The Sports Office organized tennis, skiing, and likewise sports that the working class were previously unable to partake in. Its main concerns were in building &#x27;everyday joy&#x27; and improving the health of the masses, and KdF took a keen interest in building the physicality and bodily strength of the German population. Physical education classes and gymnastic events were scheduled on weekends and after working hours, but also included skiing and hiking trips. It also encouraged workers to partake in physical exercise and sports, encouraging employers to provide access to facilities and equipment during work hours and after hours.

The Adult Education Office was headed by Fritz Leutloff. Its goal was to educate Germans on cultural and artistic topics. &#x27;Popular education&#x27; programs had been taken over when the government began imposing Gleichschaltung, but the programs offered by the Adult Education Office were not centralized by KdF until 1936 when the Reichskulturkammer and KdF began stern cooperation. Plans had been proposed by 1939 to designate KdF as a chamber of culture, but ultimately fell through due to backlash from Alfred Rosenberg and Rudolf Hess.

The Leisure Time Office enabled workers to attend theatres and concerts by organizing local events and offering discounted tickets. It also organized concerts and events to take place in factories. As the Adult Education Office focused more on propaganda and refined education, the Leisure Time Office was more concerned with the recreational aspects of spare time.

The largest and most profitable department was the Office for Travel, Hiking, and Holidays, headed by Bodo Lafferentz&quot;.&quot; Organizing both domestic and international excursions, for the first time workers were able to travel at length. This was achieved by offering discounts on travel and tour packages, sending thousands of Germans on holidays before 1939.

The Office for Folklore and Homeland was tasked with organizing smaller Nazi organizations that promoted the &#x27;folklore&#x27; and the idea of Lebensraum, but was dissolved in 1934.

==Activities==


Following its inception, KdF began to provide a wide range of activities at an affordable price, ranging from concerts and theatre trips to weekend trips and holidays. Workers could enter KdF competitions and win prizes that would send them and their families to local events, or on extended trips either in Germany or abroad. Many of their events occurring after the work day and on weekends: the government sought not only to create a positive and productive environment, but also to dissuade potential anti-state activities.

=== In the workplace ===
Borrowing from the Italian fascist organization &quot;Dopolavoro&quot; (&#x27;After Work&#x27;), but extending its influence into the workplace as well through the Beauty of Labour department, the KdF rapidly developed a wide range of activities and quickly grew into one of Nazi Germany&#x27;s largest organizations. Wardens were posted in every factory and workshop employing more than 20 people. It strove to improve the hygiene of workplaces, by providing toilets, locker rooms, and proper washing facilities. It also looked to improve air quality and reduce noise for workers. The government offered tax incentives as encouragement, and by 1938 the conditions of 34,000 workplaces had improved considerably. This was largely achieved by workers completing renovations while on unpaid overtime.

KdF stressed that partaking in sports would encourage physical health and a healthy attitude, and as such the Sports Office began to organize physical education events for workers. Under supervision of the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise, by 1936 sports and physical training were implemented in factories, and employees under the age of 18 were required to spend time in their workweek performing exercise. The Sports Office also pushed employers to build recreation facilities on work grounds, such as tennis courts, and offered tax incentives as encouragement. Official estimates by the German Labour Front show that by 1939, approximately 3,000 sports facilities were created and over 12 million sports courses were organized through these efforts. Overall, it sought heightened physical and mental health for workers, important aspects for potential citizens living in the &#x27;people&#x27;s community.&#x27;

The Leisure Time Office and Adult Education Office, seeking to educate adults in arts and culture as well as to ensure they spend their time profitably, took steps to provide access to events for workers. To do as such, exhibitions, concerts and cultural events were held within factories to ensure workers had the ability to attend. Exhibitions of art created by exclusively German artists, plays, musicals and concerts were organized and admission for workers was either very cheap or free. Some art exhibitions featured art created by workers, oftentimes created in classes organized by the KdF. At all exhibitions, the art was for sale. In some cases, renowned composers such as Wilhelm Brueckner-Rueggeberg and Wilhelm Furtwängler led the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra in these performances, while at other times concerts would be conducted by local composers and played by local orchestras.

=== At home and abroad ===
The Sports Office organized several sports events and classes throughout the operation of KdF. In the summer months, activities such as horse riding, sailing and swimming were offered with KdF emphasizing track and field activities. Gymnastics became an increasingly popular sport for German women during this time. During the winter, KdF organized activities such as skiing, ice skating and winter hiking. Most of its activities and events occurred on weekends, and its volunteers, who were mostly unsalaried schoolteachers, taught exercise and sports classes. KdF would use local school gymnasiums or meeting halls and offer courses people could attend without prior registration, known as &#x27;open courses,&#x27; for the price of 30 pfennings per 90 minutes. &#x27;Closed courses&#x27; required participants to register for the entire course, cost 80 pfennings per 90 minutes, and often covered more skilled sports such as boxing, golf and rowing. Activities organized early in KdF&#x27;s existence often deliberately left out competition, training and expectations of high performance. This was intended to focus the course on the production of joy and improvement of the population&#x27;s health. Another reason for it may have been that the government sought to prevent opposition between participating groups, and rather promote and encourage cooperation. In 1939, KdF was awarded the Olympic Cup by the International Olympic Committee.

The Leisure Time Office offered a variety of different activities and discounts for workers. Offering discounted ticket packages to theatres for films, musicals and plays for workers in cities, KdF also organized events to occur in rural areas by utilizing buses, called &quot;Theaterzüge,&quot; equipped with film projectors and loudspeakers as well as organizing productions using mobile stages. With the approval of the propaganda ministry, the Great Theatre (&quot;Großes Schauspielhaus)&quot; in Berlin was renamed the &#x27;Theatre of the People&#x27; (&quot;Theater des Volkes&quot;) and was established as the official theatre of KdF, with numerous other KdF theatres opening in major cities. The Adult Education Office similarly used these theatres for showings of propaganda films, alongside the film buses. Employing civilian performers as well as organizing performances of their own orchestras, by 1938 KdF had sponsored and offered ticket packages to performances such as &quot;As You Like It&quot; by William Shakespeare and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; by R.C. Sherriff, but over time the performances would be replaced almost entirely by propagandistic pieces. Other notable performances included &quot;Wibbel the Tailor&quot; and &quot;The Land of Smiles.&quot; Following the declaration of total war, most musicians and performers utilized by the KdF were used for troop entertainment. 

The Office for Travel, Hiking, and Holidays offered various discounted vacation trips, ranging in length from day and weekend trips to one week or upwards of three weeks. Taking travelers via rail and bus to their destinations, within Germany or its occupied and annexed territories, the office organized activities such as hiking trips and swimming excursions. In most destinations hotelkeepers and some local businesses saw increased profits thanks to the increasing number of tourists, as did the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; (German National Railway). Popular extended holiday destinations included the Alps, the Black Forest, and the coasts of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, but most of the trips booked were overnight or over a weekend. Two weeks after the Anschluss, when SS-Gruppenführer Josef Bürckel became &quot;Reichskommissar für die Wiedervereinigung&quot; (&#x27;Reich Commissioner for Reunification&#x27;) as well as Gauleiter, the first five KdF trains with some 2,000 Austrian workers left for Passau where they were ceremonially welcomed. While Bürckel announced that he did not expect all of the travelers to return as Nazis, he did expect them to look him in the eyes and say, &quot;I tried hard to understand you.&quot; Many KdF travelers complained of their trips, noting poor travel conditions, second-class treatment by locals and the KdF alike, and little free time, thanks to the regimentation of activities.
Most famously, the office also offered discounted cruise trips to German citizens. Although not initially planned to be a program offered by KdF, the initial successes of the cruises led to six large ships, including the MV &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, being built specifically for use by KdF while a further six were chartered. They were first ships to be built specifically for cruises. They were collectively known as the KdF fleet, with the MV &quot;Robert Ley&quot; being considered as its flagship. Through these cruises Nazism was promoted internationally, and KdF travelers therefore were expected to represent it positively by dressing modestly and behaving appropriately. Ship events included masquerades, political and educational lectures, and events dedicated to displaying customs of individual German regions, such as shows of dance groups performing dances from their home regions. Drinking alcohol was prohibited, and the government planted spies on ships instructed to pose as passengers and monitor participants&#x27; behavior. Cruise trips were sometimes offered as prizes in KdF competitions, but were largely affordable; an eighteen-day trip to Madeira cost 120 Reichsmarks, the equivalent to about four weeks&#x27; average salary at the time, and a seven-day trip to Norway cost about 50 Reichsmarks. Although cruises were inexpensive, workers were often greatly underrepresented on these voyages, with most of KdF&#x27;s cruise participants being from the middle class. Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, tourism opportunities were suspended and the organization shifted to more domestic activities and troop entertainment; up until this point, KdF had sold more than 45 million package tours and excursions, totaling over 700,000 German travelers.

The Nazi government also sought to attract tourists from abroad, a task performed by , one of the secretaries of the (&#x27;Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda&#x27;). A series of multilingual and colourful brochures, titled &quot;Deutschland&quot;, advertised Germany as a peaceful, idyllic and progressive country, on one occasion even portraying the ministry&#x27;s boss, , grinning in an unlikely photo series of the Cologne carnival.

Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, tourism opportunities were suspended and the organization shifted to more domestic activities and troop entertainment; up until this point, KdF had sold more than 45 million package tours and excursions, totaling over 700,000 German travelers. By 1939, it had 7,000 employees and over 135,000 volunteers.

=== Wartime activities ===

KdF formed &#x27;troop-care units&#x27; (&quot;Truppenbetreuung&quot;) in 1935, and after the invasion of Poland in 1939 the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda created the &#x27;Caring for the Troops&#x27; department of KdF, with Goebbels appointing Hans Hinkel as its head. The equivalent of the United States&#x27; USO, the troop-care units utilized portable stages and civilian performers such as musicians and actors, hiring them for up to 100 Reichsmarks per day. Many of the hired performers had little experience or were considered third-rate. By the end of 1941 it had become a massive program, as troop-care units had staged over 300,000 performances across every theater of war, including Africa. 

Hinkel described the units in official propaganda as equally essential as the Wehrmacht, stating that soldiers and artists had a special bond through their allegiance to Hitler, and were &quot;an essential part of modern war and human leadership in National Socialist Greater Germany.&quot; Seeking also to ensure the heightened physical and mental health of troops, other forms of light KdF entertainment were made available such as art exhibitions and sports. Entertainment by troop-care units was not exclusive to the Wehrmacht, as they were also tasked to put on shows for SS guards in concentration camps and &#x27;Ethnic Germans&#x27; living in occupied territory. Germany&#x27;s troop-care units remain a lightly researched topic.

Several KdF cruise ships were requisitioned into the Kriegsmarine and converted to serve as hospital ships. The &quot;Robert Ley&quot; was requisitioned in August 1939 and converted to serve as a hospital ship after only six months of operation. The ship would be converted several times to serve different purposes throughout World War II and was bombed by the Royal Air Force in the port of Hamburg on 9 March 1945 where the wreckage remained afloat until June 1947, when it was towed to the UK and scrapped. The &quot;MV Wilhelm Gustloff,&quot; requisitioned in September 1939, was designated as &quot;Lazarettschiff D&quot; and converted to serve as a hospital ship. In November 1940, medical equipment was removed from the ship and it was converted to serve as a barracks ship. Tasked with transporting civilians and military personnel during Operation Hannibal, the &quot;Lazarettschiff D&quot; was sunk on 30 January 1945 while returning to Germany from Prussia, killing an estimated 9,934. It was one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history.

==People&#x27;s Car==
KdF&#x27;s most ambitious programme for German workers was to set up production of an affordable car, the &quot;KdF-Wagen&quot;, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle (&quot;Volkswagen&quot; being German for &#x27;People&#x27;s Car&#x27;). This was originally a project undertaken at Hitler&#x27;s request by the engineer Ferdinand Porsche. When the German car industry was unable to meet Hitler&#x27;s demand that the Volkswagen be sold at 1,000 Reichsmarks or less, the project was taken over by the German Labour Front (; DAF). Now working for the DAF, Porsche built a new Volkswagen factory in at a huge cost, partly met by raiding the DAF&#x27;s accumulated assets and misappropriating the dues paid by DAF members.

The Volkswagen was sold to German workers on an installment plan, where buyers of the car made payments and posted stamps in a stamp-savings book, which, when full, would be redeemed for the car. Due to the shift of wartime production, no private citizen ever received a &quot;KdF-Wagen&quot;, although after the war, Volkswagen did give some customers a 200 DM discount for their stamp-books. The Beetle factory was then primarily converted to produce the , the German equivalent of the Jeep. The few Beetles that were produced went to the diplomatic corps and military officials.

== Propaganda ==
An important propaganda tool in Nazi Germany was the radio, something that Goebbels realized and attempted to utilize. At his request, engineer Otto Greissing developed the &#x27;people&#x27;s receiver,&#x27; or &#x27;people&#x27;s radio&#x27; (&quot;Volksempfänger.)&quot; The original model was the VE301 and exhibited in August 1933 at the cost of 76 Reichsmarks, the equivalent to two weeks&#x27; average salary at the time. A cheaper model was later produced, the DKE38 (sometimes called the &quot;Goebbels-Schnauze&quot; – &quot;Goebbels&#x27; snout&quot; – by the German public) and was used as the base of a KdF branded radio. Giving poor Germans access to this medium for the first time, it cost 35 Reichsmarks and the option of paying with an installment plan was offered. 

Cheaply produced, these radios suffered from a short reception range, but it was deemed acceptable as long as the radios could receive &quot;Deutschlandsender&quot; and the local &quot;Reichssender.&quot; The radios were designed to be produced as cheaply as possible, and because the act of listening to non-German radio stations had become a criminal offense, it is speculated that the short reception range was a purposeful feature. Penalties ranged from fines and confiscation of radios to, particularly later in the war, sentencing to a concentration camp or capital punishment.

A number of films were produced to promote KdF, usually showing workers engaging in the many activities offered by the organization. One, for example, was produced by UFA titled &quot;Henkel - ein deutsches Werk in seiner Arbeit,&quot; which showcased the improved conditions of factories. Groups were shown engaging in calisthenics, going on walks through company grounds, and checking out books from the company library.

==After work==

The (&#x27;After-work organization&#x27;) was the &quot;planned&quot; structuring of daily leisure time within KdF&#x27;s programme, attempted by the Nazis through individual state agencies, including the (&#x27;Office for After-Work Activity&#x27;) and the (&#x27;Office for Popular Education&#x27;). In Nazi Germany, the term &quot;after-work organization&quot; was increasingly applied to the entire area of organized leisure activity, including holidays.

<doc id="157424" wikidata="Q12135688" url="?curid=157424" title="Moxy Früvous">
<text>Moxy Früvous was a Canadian politically satirical folk-pop band from Thornhill, Ontario, Canada. The band was founded in 1989, and was active until 2001. Common themes in Früvous songs include Canada and the &quot;human experience.&quot;

==History==
The band formed in 1989 when Jian Ghomeshi (then going by Jean Ghomeshi), Murray Foster and Mike Ford, former classmates at the local Thornlea Secondary School and playing in a pub band called The Chia Pets at the time, joined with David Matheson to busk in Toronto. They drew crowds, and, eventually, the attention of Toronto-based CBC Radio, which commissioned songs about political and local issues for the radio show &quot;Later the Same Day.&quot; Some songs written for the show later appeared on their albums; these songs include &quot;The Gulf War Song&quot; and &quot;My Baby Loves a Bunch of Authors&quot;, which was written for a Toronto authors&#x27; festival.

The band released a self-titled six-song demo tape in 1992, and that year performed at the SOCAN Awards celebration. The band&#x27;s success led to a bidding war and the band signing with Warner Music Canada. The demo sold over 50,000 units and was certified Gold in Canada in 1993. Their first major-label album, &quot;Bargainville&quot;, was released the same year. &quot;Bargainville&quot; was also successful, and was certified Platinum in Canada in 1994.

On August 14, 1997, their song &quot;You Will Go to the Moon&quot; was used by NASA to wake the crew of STS-85.

The band sometimes sang with little or no accompaniment in a style similar to contemporary a cappella. A number of their songs also express the band&#x27;s progressive political leanings (&quot;The Greatest Man in America&quot;, for instance, mocks Rush Limbaugh, and &quot;Big Fish&quot; lambastes former Premier of Ontario Mike Harris). Früvous was also known for their close relationship with their fans and their live shows, which were full of political commentary, humorous banter, and musical improvisation.

On July 27, 1999, the band released &quot;Thornhill&quot;. The album was released by True North Records.

The band gave its last concert in 2000 (excepting a performance at an annual fan convention in 2001).

===Post-breakup activity===
On September 5, 2005, Ford, Foster and Ghomeshi performed on CIUT, the U of T&#x27;s campus radio station, as part of the morning program &quot;Toronto Unlocked,&quot; an ad hoc program produced and hosted by locked-out CBC Radio One staff.

The last update to the band&#x27;s website occurred on September 26, 2018. The website was replaced by a default webserver page in mid-2009. The page eventually returned, and as of February 2024 was still available.

Ghomeshi, Foster, and Ford performed on CBC Radio One on March 1, 2010, as a goodbye to &quot;Metro Morning&quot; host Andy Barrie.

In late 2014, Ghomeshi was arrested and charged with four counts of sexual assault, and one count of choking, in relation to three complainants. He was charged with three additional counts related to three more women on January 8, 2015.

On October 31, 2014, Murray Foster posted an &quot;official response from the other former Moxy Fruvous members&quot;:

&quot;As former colleagues of Jian (our last show was in 2000), we are sickened and saddened by this week&#x27;s news. We had no inkling that Jian engaged in this type of behaviour. We abhor the idea of a sexual relationship of any sort being entered into without full consent from both parties and condemn violence against women in any form. We wish only health and healing to everyone involved. We have no further comment on this matter at this time.&quot;

Ghomeshi was acquitted of five assault charges on March 24, 2016. On May 11, 2016, the Crown withdrew the last remaining charge after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond and apologized to the plaintiff.

==Later projects==
* Jian Ghomeshi worked for CBC Radio One, primarily as the host of the arts and cultural program &quot;Q&quot; until October 2014, when he was fired. He also wrote a book, &quot;1982&quot;, published by Penguin Books.
* Murray Foster is part of the band Great Atomic Power, with Dave Matheson, Tory Cassis, Mark Mariash and Jason LaPrade. He also performs in a vocal jazz standard group called The Lesters. Most recently, Foster toured as part of Great Big Sea, replacing bass player and singer Darrell Power.
* Dave Matheson performs solo and with Murray Foster in Great Atomic Power.
* Mike Ford often performs in schools, singing his songs about the history of Canada.
* Murray Foster and Mike Ford formed The Cocksure Lads in 2011. They have released two albums and have performed live in the Toronto area. Dave Matheson also makes occasional appearances with The Cocksure Lads.

==Band name==
The name &quot;Moxy Früvous&quot; is a nonsense phrase, although the liner notes of their first CD &quot;Bargainville&quot; contained a faux-dictionary listing of definitions for &quot;früvous.&quot; The band was known to never provide a straight or consistent answer when defining the origin or meaning of the band&#x27;s name.

In an interview with WBER radio in Rochester, New York, on November 23, 1999, Ghomeshi explained the band&#x27;s name origin by saying that they were &quot;trying to think of a name that wasn&#x27;t easy to remember and didn&#x27;t mean anything,&quot; satirically going against two conventions most bands might use in determining a band name. The band name also includes a (satirical) heavy metal umlaut.

<text>Gene Rodman Wolfe (May 7, 1931 – April 14, 2019) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer. He was noted for his dense, allusive prose as well as the strong influence of his Catholic faith. He was a prolific short story writer and novelist who won many literary awards. Wolfe has been called &quot;the Melville of science fiction&quot;, and he was honored as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.

Wolfe is best known for his &quot;Book of the New Sun&quot; series (four volumes, 1980–1983), the first part of his &quot;Solar Cycle&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Locus&quot; magazine ranked it the third-best fantasy novel published before 1990 based on a poll of subscribers that considered it and several other series as single entries.

==Personal life==
Wolfe was born in New York City, the son of Mary Olivia () and Emerson Leroy Wolfe. He had polio as a small child. He and his family moved to Houston when he was 6, and he went to high school and college in Texas, attending Lamar High School in Houston. While attending Texas A&amp;M University, he published his first speculative fiction in &quot;The Commentator,&quot; a student literary journal. Early in his writing career, Wolfe exchanged correspondence with J. R. R. Tolkien. 

Wolfe dropped out during his junior year and subsequently was drafted to fight in the Korean War. After returning to the United States, he earned a degree from the University of Houston and became an industrial engineer. He was a senior editor on the staff of the journal &quot;Plant Engineering&quot; for many years before retiring to write full-time, but his most famous professional engineering achievement is a contribution to the machine used to make Pringles potato chips.

Wolfe lived in Barrington, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, with his wife Rosemary where they raised four children. Wolfe also has three granddaughters. The Wolfes moved to Peoria, Illinois in 2013. Wolfe underwent double bypass surgery on April 24, 2010. 

Wolfe also underwent cataract surgery on his right eye in early 2013. Wolfe&#x27;s wife, Rosemary, died on December 14, 2013, after a series of illnesses including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Wolfe said, &quot;There was a time when she did not remember my name or that we were married, but she still remembered that she loved me.&quot;

Wolfe died at his Peoria home from cardiovascular disease on April 14, 2019, at the age of 87.

==Literary works==
Wolfe&#x27;s first published book was the paperback original novel &quot;Operation Ares&quot; (Berkley Medallion, 1970). He first received critical attention for &quot;The Fifth Head of Cerberus&quot; (Scribner&#x27;s, 1972) that examined a &quot;colonial mentality within an orthodox science fiction framework&quot;. It was published in German and French-language editions within the decade.

His best-known and most highly regarded work is the multi-volume novel &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;. Set in a bleak, distant future influenced by Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series, the story details the life of Severian, a journeyman torturer, exiled from his guild for showing compassion to one of the condemned. The novel is composed of the volumes &quot;The Shadow of the Torturer&quot; (1980), &quot;The Claw of the Conciliator&quot; (1981; winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel), &quot;The Sword of the Lictor&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Citadel of the Autarch&quot; (1983). A coda, &quot;The Urth of the New Sun&quot; (1987), wraps up some loose ends but is generally considered a separate work. Several of Wolfe&#x27;s essays about writing the &quot;Book of the New Sun&quot; series were published in &quot;The Castle of the Otter&quot; (1982; the title refers to a misprint of the fourth book&#x27;s title in &quot;Locus&quot; magazine).

In 1984, Wolfe retired from his engineering position and was then able to devote more time to his writing. In the 1990s, Wolfe published two more works in the same universe as &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;. The first, &quot;The Book of the Long Sun&quot;, consists of the novels &quot;Nightside the Long Sun&quot; (1993), &quot;Lake of the Long Sun&quot; (1994), &quot;Caldé of the Long Sun&quot; (1994), and &quot;Exodus From the Long Sun&quot; (1996). These books follow the priest of a small parish as he becomes wrapped up in political intrigue and revolution in his city-state. Wolfe then wrote a sequel, &quot;The Book of the Short Sun&quot;, composed of &quot;On Blue&#x27;s Waters&quot; (1999), &quot;In Green&#x27;s Jungles&quot; (2000), and &quot;Return to the Whorl&quot; (2001), dealing with colonists who have arrived on the sister planets Blue and Green. The four &quot;Sun&quot; works (&quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, &quot;The Urth of the New Sun&quot;, &quot;The Book of the Long Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Book of the Short Sun&quot;) are often referred to collectively as the &quot;Solar Cycle&quot;.

Wolfe also wrote many stand-alone books. His first novel, &quot;Operation Ares&quot;, was published by Berkley Books in 1970 and was unsuccessful. He subsequently wrote two novels held in particularly high esteem, &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Head of Cerberus&quot;. The first is the seemingly-rambling narrative of Alden Dennis Weer, a man of many secrets who reviews his life under mysterious circumstances. &quot;The Fifth Head of Cerberus&quot; is either a collection of three novellas or a novel in three parts, dealing with colonialism, memory, and the nature of personal identity. The first story, which gives the book its name, was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novella.

==Style==

Wolfe&#x27;s writing frequently relies on the first-person perspectives of unreliable narrators. He said: &quot;Real people really are unreliable narrators all the time, even if they try to be reliable narrators.&quot; The causes for the unreliability of his characters vary. Some are naive, as in &quot;Pandora by Holly Hollander&quot; or &quot;The Knight&quot;; others are not particularly intelligent (&quot;There Are Doors&quot;); Severian, from &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, tells his story from the perspective of his younger, ignorant self; and Latro of the &quot;Soldier&quot; series suffers from amnesia.

Wolfe wrote in a letter, &quot;My definition of a great story has nothing to do with &#x27;a varied and interesting background.&#x27; It is: &quot;One that can be read with pleasure by a cultivated reader and reread with increasing pleasure.&quot;&quot; In that spirit, Wolfe also left subtle hints and lacunae that may never be explicitly referred to in the text. For example, a backyard full of morning glories is an intentional foreshadowing of events in &quot;Free Live Free&quot;, but it is apparent only to a reader with a horticultural background, and a story-within-the-story provides a clue to understanding &quot;Peace&quot;.

Wolfe&#x27;s language can also be a subject of confusion for the new reader. In the appendix to &quot;The Shadow of the Torturer,&quot; he says:

In rendering this book—originally composed in a tongue that has not achieved existence—into English, I might easily have saved myself a great deal of labor by having recourse to invented terms; in no case have I done so. Thus in many instances I have been forced to replace yet undiscovered concepts by their closest twentieth-century equivalents. Such words as &quot;peltast&quot;, &quot;androgyn&quot;, and &quot;exultant&quot; are substitutions of this kind, and are intended to be suggestive rather than definitive.

This character of the fictional &quot;translator&quot; of his novel provides a certain insight into Wolfe&#x27;s writing: all of his terms—&quot;fuligin&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;thaumaturge&quot;, and so on—are real words.

==Reception==
Although he was not a best-selling author, Wolfe is highly regarded by critics and fellow writers. He was often considered to be not only one of the greatest science fiction authors, but one of the best American writers regardless of genre. In 2003, award-winning science fiction author Michael Swanwick said: &quot;Gene Wolfe is the greatest writer in the English language alive today. Let me repeat that: Gene Wolfe is the greatest writer in the English language alive today! I mean it. Shakespeare was a better stylist, Melville was more important to American letters, and Charles Dickens had a defter hand at creating characters. But among living writers, there is nobody who can even approach Gene Wolfe for brilliance of prose, clarity of thought, and depth in meaning.&quot;

Patrick O&#x27;Leary has credited Wolfe for inspiration. He has said: &quot;Forget &#x27;Speculative Fiction.&#x27; Gene Wolfe is the best writer alive. Period. And as Wolfe once said, &#x27;All novels are fantasies. Some are more honest about it.&#x27; No comparison. Nobody – I mean nobody – comes close to what this artist does.&quot; O&#x27;Leary also wrote an extensive essay concerning the nature of Wolfe&#x27;s artistry, entitled &quot;If Ever A Wiz There Was&quot;, originally published in his collection &quot;Other Voices, Other Doors&quot;. Ursula K. Le Guin is frequently quoted on the jackets of Wolfe&#x27;s books as having said &quot;Wolfe is our Melville.&quot;

Harlan Ellison, reviewing &quot;The Shadow of the Torturer&quot;, wrote: &quot;Gene Wolfe is engaged in the holy chore of writing every other author under the table. He is no less than one of the finest, most original writers in the world today. His work is singular, hypnotizing, startlingly above comparison. &quot;The Shadow of the Torturer&quot; breaks new ground in American literature and, as the first novel of a tetralogy, casts a fierce light on what will certainly be a lodestone landmark, his most stunning work to date. It is often said, but never more surely than this time: This book is not to be missed at peril of one&#x27;s intellectual enrichment.&quot;

Wolfe&#x27;s fans regard him with considerable dedication, and one Internet mailing list (URTH, begun in November 1996) dedicated to his works amassed over ten years and thousands of pages of discussion and explication. Similarly, much analysis and exegesis has been published in fanzine and small-press form (e.g. &quot;Lexicon Urthus&quot; ).

When asked the &quot;Most overrated&quot; and &quot;Most underrated&quot; authors, Thomas M. Disch identified Isaac Asimov and Gene Wolfe, respectively, writing: &quot;...all too many have already gone into a decline after carrying home some trophies. The one exception is Gene Wolfe...Between 1980 and 1982 he published &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, a tetralogy of couth, intelligence, and suavity that is also written in VistaVision with Dolby Sound. Imagine a &quot;Star Wars&quot;–style space opera penned by G. K. Chesterton in the throes of a religious conversion. Wolfe has continued in full diapason ever since, and a crossover success is long overdue.&quot;

Michael Dirda included Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Book of the New Sun&quot; in his &quot;Science Fiction Reading List&quot;, writing: &quot;If Proust, while listening to late Beethoven string quartets, wrote &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and set it in the future, the result might resemble this measured, autumnal masterpiece.&quot;

Neil Gaiman introduced Wolfe at the World Horror Convention, where Wolfe was the Guest of Honor. He offered some advice on how to read Wolfe, noting: &quot;There are two kinds of clever writer. The ones that point out how clever they are, and the ones who see no need to point out how clever they are. Gene Wolfe is of the second kind, and the intelligence is less important than the tale. He is not smart to make you feel stupid. He is smart to make you smart as well.&quot; Gaiman wrote about Wolfe for the &quot;My Hero&quot; feature in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: I&#x27;ve met too many of my heroes, and these days I avoid meeting the few I have left, because the easiest way to stop having heroes is to meet them, or worse, have dinner with them. But Gene Wolfe remains a hero to me. He&#x27;s just turned 80, looks after his wife Rosemary, and is still writing deep, complex, brilliant fiction that slips between genres. He&#x27;s my hero because he keeps trying new ways of writing and because he remains as kind and as patient with me as he was when I was almost a boy. He&#x27;s the finest living male American writer of SF and fantasy – possibly the finest living American writer. Most people haven&#x27;t heard of him. And that doesn&#x27;t bother Gene in the slightest. He just gets on with writing the next book.

===Awards===
Wolfe won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1996, a judged award at the annual World Fantasy Convention. He was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2007. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him its 29th SFWA Grand Master in December 2012; the annual Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award was presented to Wolfe during Nebula Awards weekend, May 16–19, 2013.

He was Guest of Honor at the 1985 World Science Fiction Convention and he received the 1989 Edward E. Smith Memorial Award (or &quot;Skylark&quot;) at the New England convention Boskone. In March 2012 he was presented with the first Chicago Literary Hall of Fame Fuller Award, for outstanding contribution to literature by a Chicago author. After his death, Wolfe was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame in a ceremony on September 21, 2021. Wolfe was the first Fuller Award recipient to be inducted; and though he was part of the 2019 class, the ceremony to honor him did not occur until 2021.

He also won many awards for individual works:

Wolfe also amassed a long list of nominations in years when he did not win, including sixteen Nebula award nominations and eight Hugo Award nominations.

<text>The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent agency of the United States federal government that supports fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering. Its medical counterpart is the National Institutes of Health. With an annual budget of about $9.9 billion (fiscal year 2023), the NSF funds approximately 25% of all federally supported basic research conducted by the United States&#x27; colleges and universities. In some fields, such as mathematics, computer science, economics, and the social sciences, the NSF is the major source of federal backing.

NSF&#x27;s director and deputy director are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate, whereas the 24 president-appointed members of the National Science Board (NSB) do not require U.S. Senate confirmation. The director and deputy director are responsible for administration, planning, budgeting and day-to-day operations of the foundation, while the NSB meets six times a year to establish its overall policies. The current NSF director is Sethuraman Panchanathan.

==History==
===Founding===
The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) was established by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950. Its stated mission is &quot;to promote the progress of science, to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare, and to secure the national defense.&quot; The NSF&#x27;s scope has expanded over the years to include many areas that were not in its initial portfolio, including the social and behavioral sciences, engineering, and science and mathematics education. The NSF is the only U.S. federal agency with a mandate to support &quot;all&quot; non-medical fields of research.

===Budget and performance history===
Since the technology boom of the 1980s, the U.S. Congress has generally embraced the premise that government-funded basic research is essential for the nation&#x27;s economic health and global competitiveness, and for national defense. This support has manifested in an expanding National Science Foundation budget from $1 billion in 1983 to $8.28 billion in 2020.

NSF has published annual reports since 1950, which since the new millennium have been two reports, variously called &quot;Performance Report&quot; and &quot;Accountability Report&quot; or &quot;Performance Highlights&quot; and &quot;Financial Highlights&quot;; the latest available FY 2013 Agency Financial Report was posted December 16, 2013, and the six-page FY 2013 Performance and Financial Highlights was posted March 25, 2013. More recently, the NSF has focused on obtaining high return on investment from their spending on scientific research.

Various bills have sought to direct funds within the NSF. In 1981, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) introduced a proposal to reduce the NSF social sciences directorate&#x27;s budget by 75%. Economist Robert A. Moffit suggests a connection between this proposal and Democratic Senator William Proxmire&#x27;s Golden Fleece Award series criticizing &quot;frivolous&quot; government spending — Proxmire&#x27;s first Golden Fleece had been awarded to the NSF in 1975 for granting $84,000 to a social science project investigating why people fall in love. Ultimately, the OMB&#x27;s 75% reduction proposal failed, but the NSF Economics Program budget did fall 40%. In 2012, political science research was barred from NSF funding by the passage of the Flake Amendment, breaking the precedent of granting the NSF autonomy to determine its own priorities.

===Funding profile===
In fiscal year 2020, NSF received 42,400 proposals and awarded 12,100, for a funding rate of 28%. In FY 2021, the estimates are 43,200 and 11,500 respectively, giving a funding rate of 26.6%. According to FY 2020 numbers, the median annualized award size is $153,800 and the average duration of an award is 2.9 years.

In 2022 the NSF has started funding open source software as part of their Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program.

===Timeline===

====Pre–World War II====
Although the federal government had established nearly 40 scientific organizations between 1910 and 1940, the US relied upon a primarily laissez-faire approach to scientific research and development. Academic research in science and engineering occasionally received federal funding. Within University laboratories, almost all support came from private contributions and charitable foundations. In industrial laboratories, the concentration of workers and funding (some through military and government programs as a result of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal) would eventually raise concern during the wartime period. In particular, concerns were raised that industry laboratories were largely allowed full patent rights of technologies developed with federal funds. These concerns, in part, led to efforts like Senator Harley M. Kilgore&#x27;s &quot;Science Mobilization Act&quot;.

====1940–49====
Amidst growing awareness that US military capability depended on strength in science and engineering, Congress considered several proposals to support research in these fields. Separately, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sponsored creation of organizations to coordinate federal funding of science for war, including the National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) both from 1941 to 1947. Despite broad agreement over the principle of federal support for science, working out a consensus on how to organize and manage it required five years. The five-year political debate over the creation of a national scientific agency has been a topic for academic study, understood from a variety of perspectives. Themes include disagreements over administrative structure, patents and inclusion of social sciences, a populist-versus-scientist dispute, as well as the roles of political parties, Congress, and President Truman.

Commonly, this debate is characterized by the conflict between New Deal Senator Harley M. Kilgore and OSRD head Vannevar Bush. Narratives about the National Science Foundation prior to the 1970s typically concentrated on Vannevar Bush and his 1945 publication Science—The Endless Frontier. In this report, Vannevar Bush, then head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development which began the Manhattan Project, addressed plans for the postwar years to further foster government commitment to science and technology. Issued to President Harry S. Truman in July 1945, the report made a strong case for federally-funded scientific research, arguing that the nation would reap rich dividends in the form of better health care, a more vigorous economy, and a stronger national defense. It proposed creating a new federal agency, the National Research Foundation.

The NSF first appeared as a comprehensive New Deal Policy proposed by Sen. Harley Kilgore of West Virginia. In 1942, Senator Kilgore introduced the &quot;Science Mobilization Act&quot; (S. 1297), which did not pass. Perceiving organizational chaos, elitism, over-concentration of funds in elite universities, and lack of incentives for socially applicable research, Kilgore envisioned a comprehensive and centralized research body supporting basic and applied research which would be controlled by members of the public and civil servants rather than scientific experts. The public would own the rights to all patents funded by public monies and research monies would be equitably spread across universities. Kilgore&#x27;s supporters included non-elite universities, small businesses, and the Budget Bureau. His proposals received mixed support.

Vannevar Bush opposed Kilgore, preferring science policy driven by experts and scientists rather than public and civil servants. Bush was concerned that public interests would politicize science, and believed that scientists would be the best judges of the direction and needs of their field. While Bush and Kilgore both agreed on the need for a national science policy, Bush maintained that scientists should continue to own the research results and patents, wanted project selection limited to scientists, and focused support on basic research, not the social sciences, leaving the market to support applied projects.

Sociologist Daniel Kleinman divides the debate into three broad legislative attempts. The first attempt consisted of the 1945 Magnuson bill (S. 1285), the 1945 Science and Technology Mobilization Bill, a 1945 compromise bill (S. 1720), a 1946 compromise bill (S. 1850), and the Mills Bill (H.B. 6448). The Magnuson bill was sponsored by Senator Warren Magnuson and drafted by the OSRD, headed by Vannevar Bush. The Science and Technology Mobilization bill was promoted by Harley Kilgore. The bills called for the creation of a centralized science agency, but differed in governance and research supported. The second attempt, in 1947, included Senator H. Alexander Smith&#x27;s bill S. 526, and Senator Elbert Thomas&#x27;s bill S. 525. The Smith bill reflected ideas of Vannevar Bush, while the Thomas bill was identical to the previous year&#x27;s compromise bill (S. 1850).

After amendments, the Smith bill made it to President Truman&#x27;s desk, but it was vetoed. Truman wrote that regrettably, the proposed agency would have been &quot;divorced from control by the people to an extent that implies a distinct lack of faith in the democratic process&quot;. The third attempt began with the introduction of S. 2385 in 1948. This was a compromise bill cosponsored by Smith and Kilgore, and Bush aide John Teeter had contributed in the drafting process. In 1949, S. 247 was introduced by the same group of senators behind S. 2385, marking the fourth and final effort to establish a national science agency. Essentially identical to S. 2385, S. 247 passed the Senate and the House with a few amendments. It was signed by President Truman on May 10, 1950. Kleinman points out that the final NSF bill closely resembles Vannevar Bush&#x27;s proposals.

====1950–59====
In 1950 Harry S. Truman signed Public Law 507, or 42 U.S.C. 16 creating the National Science Foundation. which provided for a National Science Board of twenty-four part-time members. In 1951 Truman nominated Alan T. Waterman, chief scientist at the Office of Naval Research, to become the first Director.

With the Korean War underway, the agency&#x27;s initial budget was just $151,000 for 9 months. After moving its administrative offices twice, NSF began its first full year of operations with an appropriation from Congress of $3.5 million, far less the almost $33.5 million requested with which 28 research grants were awarded.

After the 1957 Soviet Union orbited Sputnik 1, the first ever human-made satellite, national self-appraisal questioned American education, scientific, technical and industrial strength and Congress increased the NSF appropriation for 1958 to $40 million.

In 1958 the NSF selected Kitt Peak, near Tucson, Arizona, as the site of the first national observatory, that would give any astronomer unprecedented access to state-of-the-art telescopes; previously major research telescopes were privately funded, available only to astronomers who taught at the universities that ran them. The idea expanded to encompass the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the National Solar Observatory, the Gemini Observatory and the Arecibo Observatory, all of which are funded in whole or in part by NSF. The NSF&#x27;s astronomy program forged a close working relationship with NASA, also founded in 1958, in that the NSF provides virtually all the U.S. federal support for ground-based astronomy, while NASA&#x27;s responsibility is the U.S. effort in space-based astronomy.

In 1959 the U.S. and other nations concluded the Antarctic Treaty reserving Antarctica for peaceful and scientific research, and a presidential directive gave the NSF responsibility for virtually all U.S. Antarctic operations and research in form of the United States Antarctic Program.

====1960–69====
In 1963, President John F. Kennedy appointed Leland John Haworth as the second director of the NSF. During the 1960s, the impact of the Sputnik Crisis spurred international competition in science and technology and accelerated NSF growth. The NSF initiated a number of programs that support institution-wide research during this decade including the Graduate Science Facilities program (started in 1960), Institutional Grants for Science (started in 1961), and Science Development Grants, better known as Centers of Excellence program (started in 1964). Notable projects conducted during this decade include creation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (1960), creation of the Division of Environmental Sciences (1965), deep sea exploration endeavors Project Mohole (1961) and the Deep Sea Drilling Project (1968–1983), the Ecosystems Analysis Program (1969), and ownership of the Arecibo Observatory (1969). In 1969, Franklin Long was tentatively selected to take over directorship of the NSF. His nomination caused some controversy due to his opposition to the current administration&#x27;s antiballistic missile program and was ultimately rejected by President Richard Nixon. William D. McElroy instead took over as the third director of the NSF in 1969. By 1968, the NSF budget had reached nearly $500 million.

====1970–79====
In 1972 the NSF took over management of twelve interdisciplinary materials research laboratories from the Defense Department&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). These university-based laboratories had taken a more integrated approach than did most academic departments at the time, encouraging physicists, chemists, engineers, and metallurgists to cross departmental boundaries and use systems approaches to attack complex problems of materials synthesis or processing. The NSF expanded these laboratories into a nationwide network of Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers. In 1972 the NSF launched the biennial &quot;Science &amp; Engineering Indicators&quot; report to the US president and Congress, as required by the NSF Act of 1950. In 1977 the first interconnection of unrelated public data networks was developed, run by DARPA.

====1980–89====
During this decade, increasing NSF involvement lead to a three-tiered system of internetworks managed by a mix of universities, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. By the mid-1980s, primary financial support for the growing project was assumed by the NSF. In 1983, NSF budget topped $1 billion for the first time. Major increases in the nation&#x27;s research budget were proposed as &quot;the country recognizes the importance of research in science and technology, and education&quot;. The U.S. Antarctic Program was taken out of the NSF appropriation now requiring a separate appropriation. The NSF received more than 27,000 proposals and funded more than 12,000 of them in 1983. In 1985, the NSF delivered ozone sensors, along with balloons and helium, to researchers at the South Pole so they can measure stratospheric ozone loss. This was in response to findings earlier that year, indicating a steep drop in ozone over a period of several years. The Internet project continued, now known as NSFNET.

====1990–99====
In 1990 the NSF&#x27;s appropriation passed $2 billion for the first time. NSF funded the development of several curricula based on the NCTM standards, devised by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. These standards were widely adopted by school districts during the subsequent decade. However, in what newspapers such as the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; called the &quot;math wars&quot;, organizations such as Mathematically Correct complained that some elementary texts based on the standards, including Mathland, had almost entirely abandoned any instruction of traditional arithmetic in favor of cutting, coloring, pasting, and writing. During that debate, NSF was both lauded and criticized for favoring the standards.

In 1991 the NSFNET acceptable use policy was altered to allow commercial traffic. By 1995, with private, commercial market thriving, NSF decommissioned the NSFNET, allowing for public use of the Internet. In 1993 students and staff at the NSF-supported National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, developed Mosaic, the first freely available browser to allow World Wide Web pages that include both graphics and text. Within 18 months, NCSA Mosaic becomes the Web browser of choice for more than a million users, and sets off an exponential growth in the number of Web users. In 1994 NSF, together with DARPA and NASA, launched the Digital Library Initiative. One of the first six grants went to Stanford University, where two graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, began to develop a search engine that used the links between Web pages as a ranking method, which they later commercialized under the name Google.

In 1996 NSF-funded research established beyond doubt that the chemistry of the atmosphere above Antarctica was grossly abnormal and that levels of key chlorine compounds are greatly elevated. During two months of intense work, NSF researchers learned most of what is known about the ozone hole.

In 1998 two independent teams of NSF-supported astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up, as if some previously unknown force, now known as dark energy, is driving the galaxies apart at an ever-increasing rate.

Since passage of the Small Business Technology Transfer Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–564, Title II), NSF has been required to reserve 0.3% of its extramural research budget for Small Business Technology Transfer awards, and 2.8% of its R&amp;D budget for small business innovation research.

====2000–09====
NSF joined with other federal agencies in the National Nanotechnology Initiative, dedicated to the understanding and control of matter at the atomic and molecular scale. NSF&#x27;s roughly $300 million annual investment in nanotechnology research was still one of the largest in the 23-agency initiative. In 2001, NSF&#x27;s appropriation passed $4 billion. The NSF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology&quot; revealed that the public had a positive attitude toward science, but a poor understanding of it. During 2004–5 NSF sent &quot;rapid response&quot; research teams to investigate the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and Hurricane Katrina. An NSF-funded engineering team helped uncover why the levees failed in New Orleans. In 2005, NSF&#x27;s budget stood at $5.6 billion, in 2006 it stood at $5.91 billion for the 2007 fiscal year (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007), and in 2007 NSF requested $6.43 billion for FY 2008.

====2010–19====
President Obama requested $7.373 billion for fiscal year 2013. Due to the October 1, 2013 shutdown of the Federal Government, and NSF&#x27;s lapse in funding, their website was down &quot;until further notice&quot;, but was brought back online after the US government passed their budget. In 2014, NSF awarded rapid response grants to study a chemical spill that contaminated the drinking water of about 300,000 West Virginia residents. In early 2018, it was announced that Trump would cut NSF Research Funding by 30% but quickly rescinded this due to backlash. As of May 2018, Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force, signed that letter of intent with the director of NSF initiating partnership for the research related to space operations and Geosciences, advanced material sciences, information and data sciences, and workforce and processes.

==Grants and the merit review process==

The NSF seeks to fulfill its mission chiefly by issuing competitive, limited-term grants in response to specific proposals from the research community and establishing cooperative agreements with research organizations. It does not operate its own laboratories, unlike other federal research agencies, notable examples being NASA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NSF uses four main mechanisms to communicate funding opportunities and generate proposals: dear colleague letters, program descriptions, program announcements, and program solicitations.

The NSF receives over 50,000 such proposals each year, and funds about 10,000 of them. Those funded are typically projects that are ranked highest in a &#x27;merit review&#x27; process, the current version of which was introduced in 1997. Reviews are carried out by ad hoc reviewers and panels of independent scientists, engineers, and educators who are experts in the relevant fields of study, and who are selected by the NSF with particular attention to avoiding conflicts of interest. For example, reviewers cannot work at the NSF itself, nor for the institution that employs the proposing researchers. All proposal evaluations are confidential: the proposing researchers may see them, but they do not see the names of the reviewers.

The first merit review criterion is &#x27;intellectual merit&#x27;, the second is that of the &#x27;broader societal impact&#x27; of the proposed research; the latter reflects a broader global trend for funding agencies to demand evidence of research &#x27;impact&#x27; and has been met with opposition from the scientific and policy communities since its inception in 1997. In June 2010, the National Science Board (NSB), the governing body for NSF and science advisers to both the legislative and executive branches, convened a &#x27;Task Force on Merit Review&#x27; to determine &quot;how well the current Merit Review criteria used by the NSF to evaluate all proposals were serving the agency.&quot; The task force reinforced its support for both criteria as appropriate for the goals and aims of the agency and published a revised version of the merit review criteria in its 2012 report, to clarify and improve the function of the criteria. However, both criteria already had been mandated for all NSF merit review procedures in the 2010 re-authorization of the America COMPETES Act. The Act also includes an emphasis on promoting potentially transformative research, a phrase which has been included in the most recent incarnation of the &#x27;merit review&#x27; criteria.

Most NSF grants go to individuals or small groups of investigators, who carry out research at their home campuses. Other grants provide funding for mid-scale research centers, instruments, and facilities that serve researchers from many institutions. Still, others fund national-scale facilities that are shared by the research community as a whole. Examples of national facilities include the NSF&#x27;s national observatories, with their giant optical and radio telescopes; its Antarctic research sites; its high-end computer facilities and ultra-high-speed network connections; the ships and submersibles used for ocean research; and its gravitational wave observatories.

In addition to researchers and research facilities, NSF grants also support science, engineering and mathematics education from pre-K through graduate school. Undergraduates can receive funding through Research Experiences for Undergraduates summer programs. Graduate students are supported through Integrative Graduate Education Research Traineeships (IGERT) and Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) programs and through the Graduate Research Fellowships, NSF-GRF. K–12 and some community college instructors are eligible to participate in compensated Research Experiences for Teachers programs. In addition, an early career-development program (CAREER) supports teacher-scholars that most effectively integrate research and education within the mission of their organization, as a foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions.

==Scope and organization==

The NSF is broadly organized into four offices, seven directorates, and the National Science Board. It employs about 2,100 people in permanent, temporary and contractual positions at its headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. Prior to 2017, its headquarters were located in Arlington, Virginia.

In addition to around 1,400 permanent employees and the staffs of the NSB office and the Office of the Inspector General, NSF&#x27;s workforce includes some 200 scientists on temporary duty and 450 contract workers. Scientists from research institutions can join the NSF as temporary program directors, called &quot;rotators&quot;, overseeing the merit review process and searching for new funding opportunities. These assignments typically last one–two years, but may extend to four. The NSF also offers contracting opportunities. As of May 2018, the NSF has 53 existing contracts.

=== Offices ===
* Office of the Director
* Office of the Inspector General
* Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management
* Office of Information &amp; Resource Management
* Office of the Chief Information Officer

The NSF also supports research through several offices within the Office of the Director, including the Office of Integrative Activities, and Office of International Science and Engineering.

===Research directorates===
The NSF organizes its research and education support through eight directorates, each encompassing several disciplines:
* Biological Sciences (molecular, cellular, and organismal biology, environmental science)
* Computer and Information Science and Engineering (theoretical computer science, fundamental hardware and software, systems and networking, and artificial intelligence)
* Engineering (bioengineering, environmental systems, civil and mechanical systems, chemical and transport systems, electrical and communications systems, and design and manufacturing)
* Geosciences (geological, atmospheric and ocean sciences)
* Mathematical and Physical Sciences (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry and materials science)
* Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (neuroscience, management, psychology, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, science of science policy and economics)
* STEM Education and Human Resources (science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at every level)
An eighth directorate, the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), was created in 2022 to accelerate the transition of basic research into real world impact. It has a primary goal of the support of use-inspired research and the translation of research results to the market and society.

===Overseas sites===
Prior to October 2018, NSF maintained three overseas offices to promote collaboration between the science and engineering communities of the United States and other continents&#x27; scientific communities:
* Brussels for Europe, formerly based in Paris (established 1984; relocated to Brussels in 2015)
* Tokyo for East Asia, except China (established 1960)
* Beijing for China (established 2006)

All three overseas offices were shut down in October 2018, to reflect the agency&#x27;s move to a more nimble international posture. Rather than maintain dedicated offices, NSF will dispatch small teams to specific international institutions. Teams may work for up to a week on-site to evaluate research and explore collaborations with the institution.

===Crosscutting programs===
In addition to the research it funds in specific disciplines, the NSF has launched a number of projects that coordinate the efforts of experts in many disciplines, which often involve collaborations with other U.S. federal agencies. Examples include initiatives in:
* Nanotechnology
* The science of learning
* Digital libraries
* The ecology of infectious diseases

===National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics===
NSF&#x27;s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) gathers data from surveys and partnerships with other agencies to offer official data on the American science and engineering workforce, graduates of advanced U.S. science and engineering programs, and R&amp;D expenditures by U.S. industry. NCSES is one of the principal U.S. statistical agencies. It is a part of the NSF&#x27;s Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate (SBE).

==Criticism==
In May 2011, Republican Senator Tom Coburn released a 73-page report, &quot;National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope&quot;, receiving immediate attention from such media outlets as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Fox News, and MSNBC. The report found fault with various research projects and was critical of the social sciences. It started a controversy about political bias and a Congressional Inquiry into federally sponsored research. In 2014, Republicans proposed a bill to limit the NSF Board&#x27;s authority in grant-writing.

In 2013, the NSF had funded the work of Mark Carey at University of Oregon with a $412,930 grant, which included a study concerning gender in glaciological research. After its January 2016 release, the NSF drew criticism for alleged misuse of funding.

Some historians of science have argued that the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 was an unsatisfactory compromise between too many clashing visions of the purpose and scope of the federal government. The NSF was certainly not &quot;the&quot; primary government agency for the funding of basic science, as its supporters had originally envisioned in the aftermath of World War II. By 1950, support for major areas of research had already become dominated by specialized agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (medical research) and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (nuclear and particle physics). That pattern would continue after 1957 when U.S. anxiety over the launch of Sputnik led to the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (space science) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (defense-related research).

<text>Peter Robert Garrett (born 16 April 1953) is an Australian musician, environmentalist, activist and former politician.

In 1973, Garrett became the lead singer of the Australian rock band Midnight Oil. As a performer he is known for his signature bald head, his eccentric dance style, and a &quot;mesmerising onstage presence&quot;. He served as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation for ten years before being elected for the Labor Party as the Member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Kingsford Smith in the 2004 election.

After Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2007 election, Garrett was appointed Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Following the 2010 election, he was made Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. In the aftermath of the 2013 leadership spill, Garrett resigned from the Ministry and announced he would retire from politics at the 2013 election.

In 2003, Garrett was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia, &quot;for service to the community as a prominent advocate for environmental conservation and protection, and to the music industry.&quot; In 2009, the French Government appointed Garrett an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters. In 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature presented him with their Leaders for a Living Planet Award.

==Early life==
Born on 16 April 1953, in Wahroonga, Sydney, Garrett was the eldest of three siblings. He suffered from severe asthma as a child. He attended Gordon West Public School and then Barker College in Hornsby before studying politics at the Australian National University (ANU), where he was a resident at Burgmann College, and later law at the University of New South Wales.

His father died from an asthma attack while Peter was in his teens, and his mother died in a fire at the family home when he was in his early twenties. Peter managed to escape the fire, but his mother was asleep upstairs and he was unable to rescue her.

==Musical career and activism==
In 1973, Garrett became the lead singer for the rock band Midnight Oil, after responding to an advertisement placed by one of the band&#x27;s founding members, Rob Hirst. In tandem with their musical and commercial success, the band were strongly identified with environmental and Aboriginal rights causes. They were particularly critical of the military and foreign policy of the United States during the 1980s. On and off stage, Midnight Oil often made political statements. At the closing ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the group performed before then-Prime Minister, John Howard, and a television audience of hundreds of millions, wearing black overalls bearing the word &quot;sorry&quot;. This referred to the Howard Government&#x27;s refusal to apologise to Aboriginal Australians for the former policy of removing Aboriginal children from their families.

During his time with Midnight Oil, Garrett served two terms as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation (from 1989 to 1993 and 1998 to 2004). He was also invited to join the international board of Greenpeace in 1993 for a two-year term. He served as an adviser and patron to various cultural and community organisations, including Jubilee Debt Relief, and was a founding member of the Surfrider Foundation. In 2000, Garrett was awarded the Australian Humanitarian Foundation Award in the environment category and in 2001 he received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of New South Wales. Garrett announced his departure from Midnight Oil in 2002, saying he wished to concentrate more fully on his environmental and social activism.

Although no longer part of the band, Garrett performed several times with Midnight Oil in the following years. After the Asian tsunami on 26 December 2004, Garrett joined the other members of Midnight Oil to perform as part of the fund-raising event WaveAid. On 7 July 2007, Garrett presented Crowded House at the Australian leg of Live Earth. On 14 March 2009, Garrett performed live at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with Midnight Oil for Sound Relief, in order to raise money for the Victorian bushfire appeal. In November 2012, Garrett and Paul Kelly inducted Yothu Yindi into the ARIA Hall of Fame and performed with the band their best-known song &quot;Treaty&quot;.

On 5 May 2016, after the conclusion of his career in Parliament, Garrett announced that Midnight Oil would be reforming and that they would be touring in 2017, including a trip to the United States. Midnight Oil stated on their Facebook page: &quot;We wanted you to be the first to know that the five of us are planning to do some gigs in Australia and overseas during 2017.&quot; Days later, Garrett also announced his first solo album, &quot;A Version of Now&quot;, which was released on 15 July. His second solo album, &quot;The True North&quot;, was released in March 2024. 

==Political career==
===Nuclear Disarmament Party===
Garrett&#x27;s first attempt to enter the Australian Parliament came in December 1984, when the Nuclear Disarmament Party (NDP) invited him to stand for a New South Wales seat in the Australian Senate at the federal election. He refused at first, but after consulting his bandmates, he agreed on the condition that he head the ticket. He needed 12.5% of the statewide vote to win a seat in the Senate voting system, but a primary vote of 9.6% proved insufficient when Labor allocated its second preferences to the Democrats ahead of the NDP.

===Australian Labor Party===
====Opposition (2004–2007)====
After the conclusion of Garrett&#x27;s term as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation ended, in June 2004 Labor Leader Mark Latham announced that Garrett would become an Australian Labor Party candidate for the House of Representatives at that year&#x27;s federal election, in the safe New South Wales seat of Kingsford Smith which was being vacated by the former Cabinet Minister Laurie Brereton. There was some initial criticism from Labor members within the electorate, as the local branch had wished to select their own candidate; in the end, Garrett was comfortably elected for the seat in October 2004.
In 2015, Garrett alleged in his autobiography and an ABC documentary that he had been handed an envelope containing &quot;hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars&quot; in cash by a representative of Clubs NSW at a function following the 2004 election. He subsequently retracted his allegations and stated that the envelope in fact contained a cheque, which he returned, and also that the incident &quot;took place before he was elected, which would mean the possible offence of bribery or attempted bribery of a public official would not apply&quot;. Clubs NSW subsequently sued the ABC for defamation, but withdrew the suit in 2016 following a court ruling on discovery that would have granted the ABC access to the organisation&#x27;s financial records.

Six months after entering parliament, Garrett was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Reconciliation and the Arts. It was reported that he had modified some of his earlier views. He expressed support for the U.S.-Australia alliance, and recanted earlier opposition to the Joint U.S.-Australian Defence Facility at Pine Gap. He also stated that, while he would argue the case for environmentalism inside the Labor Party, he would observe the ultimate decision of the party caucus, including accepting any decision on the &quot;no new uranium mines&quot; policy. Garrett&#x27;s change of stance drew criticism from both journalists and Midnight Oil fans, who contrasted Garrett&#x27;s former pronouncements on environmental and political issues he had made before joining the Labor Party.

While some in the media labelled him a &quot;turncoat&quot;, some, such as &quot;Eureka Street&quot; and the &quot;Canberra Times&quot; columnist and ANU academic John Warhurst, defended his need to be a &quot;team player&quot; if he was going to succeed in the political game &quot;from the inside&quot;.

Garrett campaigned for Labor in the 2006 Victorian state election, causing some controversy when he sent a letter to voters in the seat of Melbourne, where Labor and the Greens were embroiled in a tight contest. In the letter Garrett urged voters not to vote for the Greens, claiming they were in alliance with the conservative Liberal Party. This incurred the ire of Greens Leader, and former Garrett ally, Bob Brown, who accused Garrett of having &quot;sold out&quot; and of going against the environmental movement since joining the Labor Party.

In December 2006, Kevin Rudd appointed Garrett to his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Climate Change, the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Garrett supported Rudd in that month&#x27;s leadership spill, a decision he would later come to regret, saying years later that it was &quot;certainly the biggest mistake&quot; he made in his political career.

During the 2007 election campaign, Garrett caused some controversy after the journalist Steve Price claimed that Garrett had said to him Labor would change their policies if put in power. This was disputed by Garrett as a &quot;short jocular conversation&quot;. Garrett was comfortably re-elected for Kingsford Smith in the election, with a 4.56% swing towards him.

====Environment Minister (2007–2010)====
After Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2007 election, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed Garrett as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in the Cabinet, although responsibility for climate change was separated from the portfolio and handed to Senator Penny Wong. Although Garrett requested to represent the Government on climate change within the House of Representatives, Rudd instead gave that responsibility to Treasurer Wayne Swan.

In his first acts in the role, Garrett approved a controversial plan to dredge Melbourne&#x27;s Port Phillip Bay. This move attracted strong criticism from some environmental groups, who were concerned that the 23 million cubic metres of sand, rock and contaminated silt dredged from the bay&#x27;s shipping channels would affect fishing and tourism in the area. Garrett also refused federal funding that would have enabled a remount of Elke Neidhardt&#x27;s acclaimed Adelaide production of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; in 2008.

As Environment Minister, Garrett was responsible for implementing the Government&#x27;s whaling conservation policy, which included the cessation of commercial and &quot;scientific&quot; whaling. Japan&#x27;s annual trips to the Southern Ocean to kill whales in the name of science was most controversial issue, with the Australian Government attempting to negotiate a cessation of &quot;scientific&quot; whaling at the annual meetings of the International Whaling Commission. These negotiations were unsuccessful, culminating in Australia taking Japan to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Although the case was concluded after Garrett had left politics, the ICJ eventually announced its judgement, based on his application, that Japan must stop whaling in the Southern Ocean.

In August 2008, Garrett approved a major expansion of South Australia&#x27;s Beverley uranium mine, saying the mine would demonstrate global best practice for environmental protection. Garrett&#x27;s decision was praised by the uranium industry, but criticised by the Australian Conservation Foundation, the organisation Garrett previously led, which said the decision would result in the mine spreading acid and radioactive pollution over . Later that year, Garrett announced the withdrawing of all 2.6 million funding from the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM).

In 2009, Garrett chose not to give the proposed A$2 billion Tamar Valley mill approval until more studies were undertaken on its potential impact on marine environments. A new condition was put on the mill, meaning Gunns could be liable for criminal and civil penalties if the mill was approved and broke defined &quot;environmental limits&quot;. That same year saw Garrett also rejected proposals to impound the Mary River through the construction of the Traveston Crossing Dam. Garrett determined that the impacts of the proposed dam on the threatened species of Australian lungfish, the Mary River Turtle and the Mary River cod would be too great and of national environmental significance.

In a 2010 reshuffle of his Cabinet, Rudd demoted Garrett to the outer ministry in response to Garrett&#x27;s administration of the Home Insulation Program (HIP), which was linked to four deaths, over 100 house fires and allegations of fraud. It was subsequently revealed in May 2010 that Garrett had written to Rudd on four occasions raising concerns about safety. Following the leadership spill in June 2010, which saw Rudd replaced by Julia Gillard, Garrett&#x27;s colleague Gary Gray revealed most MPs believed Garrett was demoted because &quot;...Rudd had a shocking interview on &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; and needed a scapegoat&quot;. Gray stated:The majority of caucus felt he had been badly treated. For Rudd and his office to position Garrett as the fall guy was disgraceful, weak, sneaky, unprincipled and just plain wrong. All along, Peter properly put his objections to the administration of the program on the record. How can you have a situation where Rudd executes complete and total influence, micromanages everything, yet not the home insulation program? The shape and execution of the program was certainly designed by the prime minister&#x27;s office, if not the prime minister himself.

====Education Minister (2010–2013)====
Garrett initially retained the portfolio of Environment Minister in the First Gillard Ministry, and was re-elected at the 2010 election, albeit with a substantially reduced majority, suffering a two-party preferred negative swing against him of 8.1%. After the election, Gillard promoted him back to the full Cabinet as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth.

In September 2011, Garrett announced an alteration of the National School Chaplaincy Program by offering schools the opportunity to employ, instead of &quot;a religious support worker&quot; (chaplain), a &quot;secular student well-being officer&quot;. In February 2012, Garrett, alongside Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin, announced an expansion of the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (SEAM), a program through which parents of indigenous students in the Northern Territory can have their Centrelink payments suspended for three months if their children are not attending or enrolled in school. Though the Government claimed that the program improved indigenous school attendance, it was heavily criticised by some indigenous spokespeople and academics for being excessively punitive rather than implementing other policies that may have been far more effective in improving school attendance.

In 2013, Garrett pledged to increase funding to public schools as recommended in the Gonski Report, in order to reduce inequality in educational performance. In a 2014 book review, Garrett stated that he was concerned at the growth of private schools, which could lead to &quot;an increasingly segregated school system&quot;. He noted that the National School Chaplaincy Program needed to change their guidelines because &quot;the line between chaplains acting to support students in the provision of general pastoral care and proselytising was too easily crossed&quot;.

Garrett supported Gillard in both 2013 leadership spills. After the June spill, where Rudd defeated Gillard, Garrett immediately announced his resignation as Education Minister, and the following day declared that he would not seek re-election at the 2013 election, ending his career in Parliament after nine years.

==Personal life==
Garrett is married and has three daughters. He is the uncle of Maude Garrett, formerly of Nickelodeon Australia and SourceFed.

Garrett&#x27;s grandfather, Tom Vernon Garrett, was one of many prisoners of war who died in the sinking of &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;. That sinking is considered the worst maritime disaster in Australia&#x27;s history. He refers to this event in the opening line of the &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; track &quot;In the Valley&quot;.

In 2007, artist Michael Mucci entered a portrait of Garrett in the Archibald Prize, while in 2022 Anh Do&#x27;s portrait was a finalist.

Garrett supports the Essendon Bombers in the Australian Football League, although he has also shown favour to the Melbourne Demons as a secondary team when they faced Essendon rival Carlton in an AFL final.

In September 2023, Garrett publicly advocated for the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, a vote to change the Australian Constitution to enshrine a Voice to Parliament for Indigenous Australians. He also provided ongoing support of the Yes campaign in the lead up to the unsuccessful referendum.

<text>John MacBeth Paxson (born September 29, 1960) is an American basketball administrator and former player who was vice president of basketball operations for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2009 to 2020. He was their general manager from 2003 to 2009. Paxson played eleven NBA seasons for the San Antonio Spurs and Chicago Bulls, winning three championships as a member of the Bulls. He was an All-American college player at the University of Notre Dame.

==High school career==
Paxson attended Archbishop Alter High School in Kettering, Ohio, following in the footsteps of his elder brother, Jim, who would go on to a star career at the University of Dayton, and, later, in the NBA, as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. By his senior year, John was considered one of the top guards in the country and was named to the 1979 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Team, joining such future college and NBA standouts as Isiah Thomas, James Worthy, and Byron Scott in the game.

==College career==
Paxson played collegiate basketball at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. In 1980–81, his sophomore year, Paxson led the Fighting Irish in assists with a career-high 138 that season. He earned his first All-America recognition as a junior in 1981–82, averaging 16.4 points and dishing out 4.7 assists. The following year, Paxson led Notre Dame to a 19–10 record, averaging a career-high 17.7 points per game and tallying 112 assists en route to claiming his second All-America selection. He also helped guide the team to NCAA appearances in 1980 and 1981. For his career, he was a .526 shooter from the field, presaging his sharpshooting prowess in the pros. He finished his four-year stint at Notre Dame with 1,366 points (19th in Notre Dame history), 411 assists (seventh), 133 steals (eighth), 86 games started (13th), and field goal percentage (20th). His four-year average was 12.2 points per game.

===Academic honors===
Paxson graduated from Notre Dame in 1983 with a degree in Business Administration and a 3.17 GPA and was a two-time Academic All-American. Bob Arnzen, Pat Garrity, Tim Abromaitis and Paxson are the only four basketball players in Notre Dame&#x27;s history to earn Academic All-America accolades more than once.

On June 6, 2005, Paxson was inducted into the College Sports Information Directors of America Academic All-America (CoSIDA) Hall of Fame, along with five other celebrities.

==NBA career==
Paxson was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the 19th overall pick of the 1983 NBA draft. In two seasons with the Spurs, he averaged 4.9 points per game and 2.9 assists. He then signed as a free agent with the Chicago Bulls, who teamed him in the backcourt with Michael Jordan. Paxson proved to be a valuable 3-point marksman and clutch shooter in the Bulls&#x27; first 3 championships.

Paxson is best known for his championship-winning shot during Game 6 of the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls were down by two in the last seconds of Game 6 of the finals series held at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona, before Paxson shot a wide-open three point shot with 3.9 seconds remaining, giving the Bulls a 99–98 lead and their third consecutive NBA title, thanks to Horace Grant&#x27;s last-second block on Kevin Johnson. In his NBA career, he started 369 games, and averaged 7.2 points and 3.6 assists per game.

==Coaching career==
After Paxson&#x27;s retirement, Bulls head coach Phil Jackson hired him as an assistant coach for the 1995–96 season. The Bulls won the title that year, fueled by Michael Jordan&#x27;s return and the addition of another eventual Hall of Famer, Dennis Rodman. Paxson resigned shortly after the season to join Neil Funk on radio broadcasts, saying &quot;I knew full well the time commitment coaching takes. But after that year I missed my wife and kids so much. I realized that if I didn&#x27;t prioritize, I&#x27;d miss everything that they were doing.&quot; When Jordan joined the Washington Wizards, he asked Paxson to consider the head coaching job, but Paxson declined for the same reasons.

==Executive career==
===Chicago Bulls===
In April 2003, Paxson left his broadcasting position to become General Manager for the Bulls after the resignation of longtime Bulls general manager Jerry Krause.

After a promising conclusion to the 2002–03 NBA season, Paxson pledged that the team would make the playoffs. He made headlines by signing former icon Scottie Pippen after years of bad relations between the franchise and one of the stars of their championship years. However, the Bulls opened the 2003–04 NBA season in sloppy and uninspired form, and Paxson opted to begin reshaping the character of the team by trading leading scorer Jalen Rose for Antonio Davis and firing friend and former teammate coach Bill Cartwright, replacing him with Scott Skiles. These moves had virtually no impact at all, and the Bulls finished Paxson&#x27;s first season as general manager with a 23–59 record, second-worst in the NBA.

In his second season, however, Paxson was able to reshape the franchise with remarkable speed through the draft. Kirk Hinrich made the NBA All-Rookie Team in 2003–04, and the 2004–05 rookie class yielded four major contributors, Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon and Andrés Nocioni. After a long drought dating back to Jordan&#x27;s departure, the Bulls returned to the playoffs and posted the third-best record in the Eastern Conference, a 24-game improvement from the previous year. The Bulls were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round, by the Washington Wizards despite having home-court advantage, a better regular-season record and a 2–0 lead in the best of seven playoff series. The absence of starting center and leading scorer Eddy Curry and promising small forward Luol Deng in this series played a major role, although Tyson Chandler and Kirk Hinrich both performed well.

When center Eddy Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart problem shortly before the playoffs, Paxson took a cautious approach and would not clear Curry to play without extensive DNA testing. Ultimately, Curry was traded along with Antonio Davis to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney, Tim Thomas, and several draft picks. This trade would give them the Knicks&#x27; first-round pick in 2006, which they eventually used to acquire Tyrus Thomas, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007. The Bulls floundered in the season that followed, but the team made a late-season run to finish at 41-41 and earn a second consecutive trip to the playoffs – as well as a second consecutive first-round exit. Eddy Curry has yet to miss another game due to a heart-related injury.

Paxson acknowledged &quot;It&#x27;s no secret we need to get size in our frontcourt and we need to get a bigger guard if we can, a defensive-oriented guard. And we really need some leadership on the floor. I think our guys are still young in their development there; it&#x27;s a lot to ask an entire group to assume that leadership role. So, that&#x27;s the wish list, if you could get everything you wanted. I&#x27;m optimistic about this offseason. We should be, we&#x27;re in a really good position; we&#x27;ve got good, young players and the ability to add to that.&quot;

Following the Bulls&#x27; first-round loss to eventual champion, the Miami Heat, Paxson sought to improve the Bulls&#x27; frontcourt and defensive guard play by trading for rookie forward Tyrus Thomas, drafting guard Thabo Sefolosha, and signing four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace.

The Bulls experienced an up-and-down regular season in 2006–07, winning 49 games but suffering a demoralizing loss to the New Jersey Nets in the last game of the season, dropping as a result from the 2-seed in the East to the 5-seed. Deng rewarded his general manager&#x27;s loyalty by playing dominating basketball in the Bulls&#x27; first-round playoff sweep of the defending champion Heat in April 2007. But Paxson observed the Bulls&#x27; lack of a low-post threat when they were beaten by the Pistons in six games. 

After high expectations for the 2007–08 season, the Bulls started 9-16 and were last in the Central division. He fired Scott Skiles on December 24, 2007. Saying &quot;This was a difficult decision to make, but one that was necessary at this time. Scott helped us in many ways during his time with the Bulls; most importantly, he helped this franchise get back to respectability. I am appreciative of his hard work and the imprint that he left on our team.&quot; Over the span of five seasons with the Bulls, Skiles compiled a record of 165-172 (.490), and guided the team to the playoffs three consecutive years before getting fired. Paxson promoted assistant coach Jim Boylan to interim head coach and the Bulls finished the year with a 33–49 record, missing the playoffs. Despite having only 1.7% probability, the Bulls won the NBA draft lottery and selected Chicago native Derrick Rose with the first pick in the 2008 NBA draft. In June 2008, Paxson named former NBA player and scout Vinny Del Negro head coach, but their relationship eventually went sour. Multiple reports surfaced that on March 30, 2010, Paxson and Del Negro got into a physical altercation over the minutes of Bulls center Joakim Noah, who was recovering from a foot injury. Paxson allegedly grabbed Del Negro by the tie and shoved him. Del Negro was fired a little over a month later.

On May 21, 2009, Gar Forman replaced Paxson as general manager, when he was promoted to vice president of basketball operations.

During Paxson&#x27;s leadership of the Bulls front office, the Bulls have had below-average success. From the 2003–04 through 2018–19 seasons, they failed to make the playoffs five times; lost in the first round seven times; lost in the conference semifinals three times; and lost in the conference finals once.

On April 13, 2020, Paxson was reassigned as senior advisor of basketball operations, when the Bulls named Artūras Karnišovas executive vice president of basketball operations.

==Personal life==
Paxson attended Le Mans Academy Military Boarding School in Indiana, where he played basketball. 
His father, James, played in the NBA for two years in the mid-1950s, for the Minneapolis Lakers and Cincinnati Royals, and his brother Jim played 11 years in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics.

<doc id="157430" wikidata="Q1459202" url="?curid=157430" title="Mormonism and polygamy">
<text>Polygamy (called plural marriage by Latter-day Saints in the 19th century or the Principle by modern fundamentalist practitioners of polygamy) was practiced by leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) for more than half of the 19th century, and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families. Polygamy among Latter-day Saints has been controversial, both in Western society and within the LDS Church itself. Many U.S. politicians were strongly opposed to the practice; the Republican platform even referred to polygamy and slavery as &quot;the twin relics of barbarism.&quot; Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter-day Saint movement, first introduced polygamy privately in the 1830s. Later, in 1852, Orson Pratt, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, publicly announced and defended the practice at the request of then-church president Brigham Young.

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the LDS Church and the United States remained at odds over the issue. The church defended polygamy as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government, in line with prevailing public opinion, sought to eradicate it. Polygamy likely played a role in the Utah War of 1857–1858, as Republican critics portrayed Democratic President James Buchanan as weak in opposing both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, prohibiting polygamous marriage in the territories. Despite the law, many Latter-day Saints continued to practice polygamy, believing it was protected by the First Amendment. However, in 1879, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Act&#x27;s constitutionality in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot;, asserting that while laws could not interfere with religious belief, they could regulate religious practices.

In 1890, when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still practiced, church president Wilford Woodruff issued the 1890 Manifesto, officially banning the formation of new polygamyous unions within the LDS Church. Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing polygamous marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the manifesto, some church members continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a &quot;Second Manifesto&quot;, calling for all new polygamous marriages in the church to cease, and established excommunication as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Existing polygamous LDS couples continued to live together into the 1950s.

Several small Mormon fundamentalist groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). Meanwhile, the LDS Church continues its policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from fundamentalist groups that continue the practice. Adherents of various churches and groups from the larger Latter Day Saint movement continue to practice polygamy.

==Origin==
Historian Richard van Wagoner reports that Smith developed an interest in polygamy after studying parts of the Old Testament in which prophets had more than one wife. In the 1830s or early 1840s, Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith secretly initiated a practice of religious polygamy among select members of the Church of Christ he founded. In Nauvoo, Illinois, Smith introduced ecclesiastical leaders to the practice of polygamy, and he married several plural wives. On July 12, 1843, Smith dictated and had recorded what he said was a revelation from God describing the theology and purpose of polygamy, relating it to biblical portrayals of polygamous marriage by Old Testament patriarchs such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. When he dictated the document, Smith said he already &quot;knew the revelation perfectly from beginning to end&quot;.

At the time, the practice was kept secret from most people, both adherents and not. The church publicly denounced polygamy, and only some membership knew about the teachings and practiced polygamy. The number of members aware of polygamy grew until the church started openly practicing polygamy in early 1852, eight years after Smith&#x27;s death. According to some historians and then-contemporary accounts, by this time, polygamy was openly taught and practiced. The doctrine authorizing polygamy was canonized and first published in the 1876 version of the church&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants.

=== Types of polygamous marriages ===
There were two types of polygamous marriages in the LDS Church: eternity-only and time-and-eternity. Eternity-only polygamous marriages applied only in the afterlife and time-and-eternity marriages applied both in mortal life and in the afterlife. Smith had sexual relations with some of his wives; others, he had no sexual relations with.

=== Polyandry ===
Other types of polygamous marriages in the early LDS Church were polyandrous (literally &quot;many men&quot;) in contrast to polygynous marriages. In polyandrous marriages one woman was married to more than one living husband at the same time. Examples of prominent Mormon women who at some point practiced polyandry included Zina D. H. Young, Patty Bartlett Sessions, Sarah M. Cleveland, and Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner. Prominent men who were in polyandrous marriages included presidents Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, as well as the apostles Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde. Smith married 14 women who were currently married to their living husband.

== Teachings about polygamy ==

=== Theology ===

==== Salvation ====
Polygamy was taught as being essential for salvation. Polygamy was seen as &quot;more important than baptism&quot; and the practice of polygamy was required before the Second Coming of Christ. Brigham Young said that any male member of the church who was commanded to practice polygamy and refused would be damned. Other leaders of the church taught that men who refused to have multiple wives were not obeying God&#x27;s commandments and that they should step down from their priesthood callings. Church president Joseph F. Smith also spoke about the necessity of practicing polygamy in order to receive salvation. Members of the church in St George, Utah report being taught in the late 1800s that there is no &quot;exaltation&quot; without polygamy. In a church-owned newspaper, an article speculates that men and women who refuse to practice polygamy will have a lesser station in the afterlife.

Polygamy was also explained as being a commandment of God that was received by divine revelation and that polygamy was a part of God&#x27;s plan.

==== Women&#x27;s place in heaven ====
Latter-day Saints believed that a woman could secure her place in heaven by being sealed to a righteous man who held the priesthood. Some women embraced polygamy because of this teaching and their desire to receive divine blessings. The salvation of women was understood to be dependent on their status as wives.

==== Posterity ====
One reason given for the practice of polygamy is to increase the Mormon population by childbirth. In the Millennial Star, a church owned and operated newspaper, an article teaches that monogamous marriages result in offspring that are physically and mentally lesser than offspring of polygamous marriages.

==== Morality and preventing temptation ====
An early church leader argued that polygamy has historically been the main form of marriage and that polygamy is the most moral form of marriage. Polygamy was sometimes explained as a way to prevent men from falling into sexual temptation, while monogamy was immoral and increased the likelihood of sexual temptation.

==== Biblical precedence ====
Some who practiced polygamy defended it as a religious practice that was taught in the Bible.

==== Teachings on the multiple wives of God and Jesus ====
Top leaders used the examples of the polygamy of God the Father and Jesus Christ in defense of it and these teachings on God and Jesus&#x27; polygamy were widely accepted among Latter-day Saints by the late 1850s. In 1853, Jedediah M. Grant—who later became a member of the First Presidency—stated that the top reason behind the persecution of Christ and his disciples was due to their practice of polygamy. Two months later, apostle Orson Pratt taught in a church periodical that &quot;We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives&quot;, and that after her death, Mary (the mother of Jesus) may have become another eternal polygamous wife of God. He also stated that Christ had multiple wives—Mary of Bethany, Martha, and Mary Magdalene—as further evidence in defense of polygamy. In the next two years the apostle Orson Hyde also stated during two general conference addresses that Jesus practiced polygamy and repeated this in an 1857 address.

=== Modern teachings of the church ===
In a teaching manual published by the church in 2015, the practice of polygamy is described as a &quot;test of faith&quot; that brought Latter-day Saints closer to God. Other recent church documents point to an increase in children as being why Mormons believe God commanded them to practice polygamy. An article on the church&#x27;s website states that early Mormons believed that they would receive blessings from God by obeying the commandment of polygamy.

==Polygamous marriages of early church leaders==

===Joseph Smith===
Among historians, there is disagreement as to the precise number of wives Smith married. D. Michael Quinn reports 46, George D. Smith 38, Todd M. Compton 33 (plus eight &quot;possible wives&quot;), and Stewart Davenport 37.

It is unclear with how many of the wives Smith had sexual relations. Some contemporary accounts from Smith&#x27;s time indicate that he engaged in sexual relations with some of his wives. , there were at least twelve early Latter Day Saints who, based on historical documents and circumstantial evidence, had been identified as potential Smith offspring stemming from polygamous marriages. In 2005 and 2007 studies, a geneticist with the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation stated that they had shown &quot;with 99.9 percent accuracy&quot; that five of these individuals were in fact not Smith descendants: Mosiah Hancock (son of Clarissa Reed Hancock), Oliver Buell (son of Prescindia Huntington Buell), Moroni Llewellyn Pratt (son of Mary Ann Frost Pratt), Zebulon Jacobs (son of Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs Smith), and Orrison Smith (son of Fanny Alger). The remaining seven have yet to be conclusively tested, including Josephine Lyon, for whom current DNA testing using mitochondrial DNA cannot provide conclusive evidence either way. Lyon&#x27;s mother, Sylvia Sessions Lyon, left her daughter a deathbed affidavit telling her she was Smith&#x27;s daughter.

===Other early church leaders===
LDS Church president Brigham Young had 51 wives, and 56 children by 16 of those wives.

LDS Church apostle Heber C. Kimball had 43 wives, and had 65 children by 17 of those wives.

== Response to polygamy ==

=== Mormon response ===
Mormons responded to polygamy with mixed emotions. One historian notes that Mormon women often struggled with the practice and a belief in the divinity of the polygamy commandment was often necessary in accepting it. Records indicate that future church leaders, such as Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Heber C. Kimball, greatly opposed polygamy initially. Documents left by Mormon women describe personal spiritual experiences that led them to accept polygamy. Another historian notes that some Mormon women expressed appreciation for polygamy and its effects.

An early leader of the church, Orson Pratt, defended polygamy by arguing that the practice was a result of divine revelation and that it was protected under the US Constitution as a religious freedom. Following the public announcement of polygamy, members of the church published pamphlets and literature defending the practice. Mormon missionaries were also directed to defend polygamy.

=== Non-Mormon response ===

The majority of Americans who were not members of the church were opposed to polygamy as they saw the practice as a violation of American values and morals. Opponents of polygamy believed that polygamy forced wives into submission to their husbands and some described polygamy as a form of slavery. The overall opposition to polygamy led the Republican Party&#x27;s platform to refer to it as one of the &quot;relics of barbarianism&quot;. Sensational and often violent novels provided fictional stories about polygamy which fueled the public&#x27;s dislike for the practice and Mormons.

However, some non-Mormons held more positive views of polygamy. For example, after surveying the Utah Territory, Captain Howard Stansbury concluded that most polygamous marriages were successful and there were good feelings between families.

==== John C. Bennett and &quot;The History of the Saints&quot; ====
John C. Bennett was a member of the church and close friend of Joseph Smith who was disfellowshipped and later excommunicated for adultery. Following his excommunication, Bennett began to travel around the eastern United States as he lectured about the church. In his lectures, Bennett included claims of sexual misconduct among church leaders, secret rituals, and violence. In 1842, Bennett published a book entitled &quot;The History of the Saints: Or, An Exposé of Joe Smith and Mormonism&quot; which includes alleged stories of sexual misconduct by Smith and other church leaders. The church responded to Bennett&#x27;s claims about Smith by gathering affidavits and printing contradictory evidence in newspapers. The women of the Relief Society, encouraged by its president, Emma Smith, also wrote their experiences that disproved Bennett&#x27;s statements. They also began a petition in support of Joseph Smith&#x27;s character which they delivered to the governor of Illinois.

== Church officially ends polygamy ==

=== U.S. government actions against polygamy ===

Mormon polygamy was one of the leading moral issues of the 19th century in the United States, perhaps second only to slavery in importance. Spurred by popular indignation, the U.S. government took a number of steps against polygamy; these were of varying effectiveness. Anti-polygamy laws began to be passed ten years after the church publicly announced the practice of polygamy.

==== Anti-polygamy Bill of 1854 ====
The first legislative attempt to discourage polygamy in Utah was presented in the 33rd Congress. The bill was debated in May 1854. The bill included the provision that any man who had more than one wife would not be able to own land in the Utah Territory. This bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after multiple representatives argued that the federal government did not have the authority to legislate morals in the states.

==== 1857–1858 Utah War ====
As the church settled in what became the Utah Territory, it eventually was subjected to the power and opinion of the United States. Friction first began to show in the James Buchanan administration and federal troops arrived (see Utah War). Buchanan, anticipating Mormon opposition to a newly appointed territorial governor to replace Brigham Young, dispatched 2,500 federal troops to Utah to seat the new governor, thus setting in motion a series of misunderstandings in which the Mormons felt threatened.

==== 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act ====
In 1862, the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act became law. The act criminalized the practice of polygamy, unincorporated the church, and limited the church&#x27;s real estate holdings. The act was largely understood to be unconstitutional and was only enforced in rare cases. While the act outlawed bigamy in the US territories, it was seen to be largely weak and ineffective at preventing people from practicing polygamy. However, due to the continuous threat of legislation targeting polygamy and the church, Brigham Young pretended to comply.

On January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot;.

==== Wade, Cragin, and Cullom Bills ====
The Wade, Cragin, and Cullom Bills were anti-bigamy legislation that failed to pass in the US Congress. The bills were all intended to enforce the Morrill Act&#x27;s prohibition on polygamy with more punitive measures. The Wade Bill of 1866 had the power to dismantle local government in Utah. Three years after the Wade Bill failed, the Cragin Bill, which would have eliminated the right to a jury for bigamy trials, was introduced but not passed. After that, the Cullom Bill was introduced. One of the most concerning parts of the Cullom Bill for polygamists was that, if passed, anyone who practiced any type of non-monogamous relationship would not be able to become a citizen of the United States, vote in elections, or receive the benefits of the homestead laws. The leadership of the church publicly opposed the Cullom Bill. Op-eds in church-owned newspapers declared the bill as unjust and dangerous to Mormons.

The introduction of the Cullom Bill led to protests by Mormons, particularly Mormon women. Women organized indignation meetings to voice their disapproval of the bill. The strong reaction of Mormon women surprised many onlookers and politicians. Outside of the church, Mormon women were seen as weak and oppressed by their husbands and the men of the church. The political activism in support of polygamy of Mormon women was unexpected from a group that had been portrayed as powerless.

==== 1874 Poland Act ====

Following the failure of the Wade, Cragin, and Collum Bills, the Poland Act was an anti-bigamy prosecution act that was successfully enacted by the 43rd United States Congress. The Poland Act, named after its sponsor in the US House of Representatives, attempted to prosecute Utah under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act for refusing to stop practicing polygamy. The act stripped away some of Utah&#x27;s powers and gave the federal government greater control over the territory. Among other powers, the act gave US district courts jurisdiction in the Utah Territory for all court cases. The Poland Act was a significant threat to Mormons practicing polygamy as it allowed for men who had multiple wives to be criminally indicted.

==== 1882 Edmunds Act ====

In February 1882, George Q. Cannon, a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the Edmunds Act was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. &quot;Unlawful cohabitation&quot;, in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment. It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, Rudger Clawson was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.

==== 1887 Edmunds–Tucker Act ====
In 1887, the Edmunds–Tucker Act allowed the disincorporation of the LDS Church and the seizure of church property; it also further extended the punishments of the Edmunds Act. On July 31 of the same year, U.S. Attorney General George Peters filed suit to seize all church assets.

The church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate &quot;underground&quot;.

Following the passage of the Edmunds–Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president Wilford Woodruff left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice polygamy and thereby losing the temples, &quot;stopping all the ordinances therein&quot; and, on the other, ceasing to practice polygamy in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed.

==== 1879 &quot;Reynolds&quot; vs. &quot;United States&quot; ====

In 1879, the Supreme Court ruled that a defendant cannot claim a religious obligation as a valid defense to a crime and upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot;. The Court said that while holding a religious belief was protected under the First Amendment right of freedom of religion, practicing a religious belief that broke the law was not. &quot;Reynolds&quot; vs. &quot;United States&quot; was the Supreme Court&#x27;s first case in which a party used the right of freedom of religion as a defense. The ruling concluded that Mormons could be charged with committing bigamy despite their religious beliefs.

=== 1890 Manifesto banning polygamy ===

The final element in Woodruff&#x27;s revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the general authorities that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone polygamous marriages. The document was later edited by George Q. Cannon of the First Presidency and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the General Conference and unanimously approved.

While many church leaders in 1890 regarded the Manifesto as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory. Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 polygamous marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.

===1904 Second Manifesto===

It was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president Joseph F. Smith, that the church completely banned new polygamous marriages worldwide. Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the Smoot hearings made it clear that polygamy had not been completely extinguished.

The ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the &quot;Second Manifesto&quot;, an emphatic declaration that prohibited new polygamous marriages and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to church discipline. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles Matthias F. Cowley and John W. Taylor, who both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve. Cowley retained his membership in the church, but Taylor was later excommunicated.

Although the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new polygamous marriages, existing ones were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained their polygamy into the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1943, the First Presidency learned that apostle Richard R. Lyman was cohabitating with a woman other than his legal wife. As it turned out, in 1925 Lyman had begun a relationship which he defined as a polygamous marriage. Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943. The Quorum of the Twelve provided the newspapers with a one-sentence announcement, stating that the ground for excommunication was violation of the law of chastity.

==Polygamy in other churches in the Latter Day Saint movement==

Over time, many of those who rejected the LDS Church&#x27;s relinquishment of polygamy formed small, close-knit communities in areas of the Rocky Mountains. These groups continue to practice &quot;the Principle&quot;. In the 1940s, LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen coined the term &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot; to describe such people. Fundamentalists either practice as individuals, as families, or as part of organized denominations. Today, the LDS Church objects to the use of the term &quot;Mormon fundamentalists&quot; and suggests using the term &quot;polygamist sects&quot; to avoid confusion about whether the main body of Mormon believers teach or practice polygamy. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (also referred to as the FLDS Church) continues to practice polygamy.

==Modern plural marriage theory within the LDS Church==
Although the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through vicarious sealing if they are also deceased.
=== Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died ===
In the case where a man&#x27;s first wife dies, and the man remarries, and both of the marriages involve a sealing, LDS authorities teach that in the afterlife, the man will enter a polygamous relationship with both wives. Current apostles Russell M. Nelson and Dallin H. Oaks are examples of such a case.
Under LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife&#x27;s circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to a subsequent husband and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.
As of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died. Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely &quot;offered&quot; to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. This caveat is necessary to comply with Jesus&#x27;s teaching in Mark 12, wherein he teaches the law of marriage with regards to the question of widows remarrying.
In the twenty-first century, church leadership has taught that doctrinal knowledge about the nature of family relations in the afterlife is limited and there is no official church teaching on how multiple marriages in life play out in the afterlife beyond trust in God that such matters will work out happily.
=== Multiple sealings when marriages end in divorce ===
A man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a &quot;sealing clearance&quot; from the First Presidency in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a &quot;cancellation of sealing&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;temple divorce&quot;), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, according to Drs. Joseph Stuart and Janiece Johnson of the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through a temple sealing they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.
=== Proxy sealings where both spouses have died ===
According to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.
Church doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:
# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then marry another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.
# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications.

==Criticism of LDS polygamy==

===Instances of unhappy polygamous marriage===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy produced unhappiness in some wives. Historian Todd Compton, in his book &quot;In Sacred Loneliness&quot;, described various cases where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.

===A means for immoral sexual gratification===
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners. Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted.

===Underage polygamous marriages===
Historian George D. Smith studied 153 men who took multiple wives in the early years of the Latter Day Saint movement, and found that two of the girls were thirteen years old, 13 girls were fourteen years old, 21 were fifteen years old, and 53 were sixteen years old. Historian Todd Compton believes that Joseph Smith married one girl who was fourteen-years old (possibly two); according to Compton, &quot;it is unlikely that the marriage was consummated&quot;. Historian Stanley Hirshon documented cases of girls aged 10 and 11 being married to old men.

The mean age of marriage for women was lower in Mormon polygamy than in New England and the Northeastern states (the societies in which Smith and many early converts to the movement had lived), and this was partly caused by the practice of polygamy, and Compton concludes that &quot;[e]arly marriage and very early marriage were… accepted&quot; in early Mormonism. These marriages were frequently dynastic in purpose, meant to join people to the families of leaders, motivated by the significance of marriage for the nineteenth-century Latter-day Saint understanding of the afterlife. According to Compton, the &quot;valid parallel&quot; for Mormon early marriages is the &quot;American and European history of elite early marriages that were not consummated until the marriage participants were much older&quot;. Compton &quot;find[s] dynastic marriages of teenage girls problematic, even if sexual consummation is delayed&quot;.

===Unmarried men===
If some men have several wives and the numbers of men and women are approximately equal, some men will necessarily be left without wives. In the denominations that still practice polygamy today, such men, known as lost boys are often driven out so as not to compete with high-ranked polygamous men.

<text>United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895), also known as the &quot;Sugar Trust Case,&quot; was a United States Supreme Court antitrust case that severely limited the federal government&#x27;s power to pursue antitrust actions under the Sherman Antitrust Act. In Chief Justice Melville Fuller&#x27;s majority opinion, the Court held that the U.S. Congress could not regulate manufacturing and thus gave state governments the sole power to take legal action against manufacturing monopolies. The case has never been overruled, but in &quot;Swift &amp; Co. v. United States&quot; and subsequent cases, the Court has held that Congress can regulate manufacturing when it affects interstate commerce.

==The case==
In 1892, the American Sugar Refining Company gained control of the E. C. Knight Company and several others, which resulted in a 98% monopoly of the American sugar refining industry. U.S. President Grover Cleveland, in his second term of office (1893–1897), directed the national government to sue the Knight Company under the provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act to prevent the acquisition. The question the court had to answer was, &quot;could the Sherman Antitrust Act suppress a monopoly in the &quot;manufacture&quot; of a good, as well as its &quot;distribution&quot;?&quot;

==The decision==

The court&#x27;s 8–1 decision, handed down on January 21, 1895 and written by Chief Justice Melville Weston Fuller, went against the government. Justice John Marshall Harlan dissented.

The Court held &quot;that the result of the transaction was the creation of a monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary of life&quot; but ruled that it &quot;could not be suppressed under the provisions of the act.&quot;

The Court ruled that manufacturing, in this case, refining, was a local activity, not subject to congressional regulation of interstate commerce. Fuller wrote:

That which belongs to commerce is within the jurisdiction of the United States, but that which does not belong to commerce is within the jurisdiction of the police power of the State. . . . Doubtless the power to control the manufacture of a given thing involves in a certain sense the control of its disposition, but . . . affects it only incidentally and indirectly.

The decision required any action against manufacturing monopolies to be taken by individual states. The ruling prevailed until the end of the 1930s, when the Court took a different position on the federal government&#x27;s power to regulate the economy.

In his dissent, Harlan argued &quot;the doctrine of the autonomy of the states cannot properly be invoked to justify a denial of power in the national government to meet such an emergency.&quot; He continued to argue the Constitution gives Congress &quot;authority to enact all laws necessary and proper&quot; to regulate commerce and cited &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;. .

==Later developments==
Although the decision was never expressly overturned, the Court later retreated from its position in a series of cases such as &quot;Swift and Company v. United States&quot;, which have defined various steps of the manufacturing process as part of commerce. Eventually, &quot;E.C. Knight&quot; came to be a precedent narrowed to its precise facts, with no other force.

<doc id="157437" wikidata="Q182665" url="?curid=157437" title="Iggy Pop">
<text>James Newell Osterberg Jr. (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as Iggy Pop, is an American singer, musician, songwriter, actor and radio broadcaster. He was the vocalist and lyricist of proto-punk band the Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since. Often called the &quot;Godfather of Punk&quot;, he was named one of the &quot;50 Great Voices&quot; by NPR. In 2010, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Stooges. Pop also received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020 for his solo work.

Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll (progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock), the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Pop. He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges&#x27; album &quot;Raw Power&quot; in 1973. Both musicians went to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, Pop usually contributing the lyrics. Throughout his career, he is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics, poetic lyrics and distinctive voice. He was one of the first performers to do a stage-dive and popularized the activity. Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.

Pop&#x27;s music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including garage rock, punk rock, hard rock, heavy metal, art rock, new wave, grunge, jazz, blues and electronic. Though his popularity has fluctuated, many of Pop&#x27;s songs have become well known, including &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; by the Stooges, and his solo hits &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, &quot;The Passenger&quot; and &quot;Real Wild Child (Wild One)&quot;. In 1990, he recorded his only Top 40 U.S. hit, &quot;Candy&quot;, a duet with the B-52s&#x27; singer Kate Pierson. Pop&#x27;s song &quot;China Girl&quot; became more widely known when it was re-recorded by co-writer Bowie, who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983). Bowie re-recorded and performed many of Pop&#x27;s songs throughout his career.

Although Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges&#x27; album &quot;Raw Power&quot; has proved an influence on artists such as Sex Pistols, the Smiths, and Nirvana. His solo album &quot;The Idiot&quot; has been cited as a major influence on a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial artists including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division, and was described by Siouxsie Sioux as a &quot;re-affirmation that our suspicions were true: the man is a genius.&quot;

== Early life ==
James Newell Osterberg was born in Muskegon, Michigan, on April 21, 1947, the son of Louella (&quot;née&quot; Christensen; 1917–1996) and James Newell Osterberg (1921–2007), an English teacher and baseball coach at Fordson High School in Dearborn, Michigan. He is of English, German, and Irish descent on his father&#x27;s side, and Danish and Norwegian ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side. His father was adopted by a Swedish-American nurse surnamed Osterberg. The family lived in a trailer park in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Ron Asheton later described him as having been a conventional teenager: &quot;He hung out with the popular kids that wore chinos, cashmere sweaters, and penny loafers. Iggy didn&#x27;t smoke cigarettes, didn&#x27;t get high, didn&#x27;t drink.&quot;

Osterberg began to play drums in the fifth grade, first starting with rubber pads glued to plywood, before his parents bought him a drum set. In a 2007 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, he explained his relationship with his parents and their contribution to his music:

==Music career==
===Early days: 1960–1967===

Osterberg began his music career as a drummer in various high school bands in Ann Arbor, Michigan, including the Iguanas, who covered several records such as Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Mona&quot; in 1965. He then began exploring local blues-style bands such as the Prime Movers (with brothers Dan and Michael Erlewine), which he joined at 18 years old. The Prime Movers gave him the nickname &quot;Iggy&quot; for having played in the Iguanas. According to biographer Jim Ambrose, the two years he spent in the band made him aware of &quot;art, politics, and experimentation&quot;.

Osterberg eventually dropped out of the University of Michigan and moved to Chicago to learn more about blues. While in Chicago, he played drums in blues clubs, helped by Sam Lay (formerly of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band) who shared his connections with Pop. Inspired by Chicago blues as well as bands like the Sonics, MC5 and the Doors, he formed the Psychedelic Stooges. The band was composed of Osterberg on vocals, Ron Asheton on guitar, Asheton&#x27;s brother Scott on drums, and Dave Alexander on bass. Their first show was played at a Halloween party at a house in Detroit, Michigan. Members of the MC5 were also in attendance. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in the Chosen Few (a covers band), believing &quot;I&#x27;ve never met a convincing musician that didn&#x27;t look kind of ill and kind of dirty, and Ron had those two things covered!&quot; The three nicknamed Osterberg &quot;Pop&quot; after a local character named Jim Popp, who he was said to have resembled after shaving his eyebrows.

=== The Stooges era: 1968–1974 ===
The seeds of Pop&#x27;s stage persona were sown when he saw the Doors perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and antagonism displayed by singer Jim Morrison. Morrison&#x27;s extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop&#x27;s vocals and persona were Mick Jagger and James Brown:

In addition to Jim Morrison and the Doors&#x27; influence on the band, Pop also attributes the Stooges getting jump-started after seeing an all-girl rock band from Princeton, New Jersey, called the Untouchable. In a 1995 interview with &quot;Bust&quot;, he relates:

In 1968, one year after their live debut and now dubbed the Psychedelic Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again following in the footsteps of the Doors, who were Elektra&#x27;s biggest act at the time (according to Pop, guitarist Ron Asheton called Moe Howard to see if it was all right to call the band &quot;The Stooges&quot;, to which Howard responded by merely saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care what they call themselves, as long as they&#x27;re not The &quot;Three&quot; Stooges!&quot; and hung up the phone). Pop himself told the story in the 2016 Jim Jarmusch documentary film about the Stooges, &quot;Gimme Danger&quot;. The Stooges&#x27; first album &quot;The Stooges&quot; (on which Pop was credited as &quot;Iggy Stooge&quot;) was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, &quot;Fun House&quot;, produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of &quot;Fun House&quot; did not receive the recognition expected, it was later ranked No. 191 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &#x27;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&#x27; in 2003. Shortly after the release of &quot;Fun House&quot;, the group disbanded because of Pop&#x27;s worsening heroin addiction.

In 1971, without a record deal, the Stooges kept performing in small clubs with a five-piece lineup that included both Ron Asheton and James Williamson on guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass, Pop having fired Dave Alexander the previous year when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic alcoholism. That year Pop and David Bowie met at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, a nightclub and restaurant in New York City. Pop&#x27;s career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with him in England. With Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for a rhythm section. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark &quot;Raw Power&quot;. After its release, Scott Thurston was added to the band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop&#x27;s drug problem persisted. The Stooges&#x27; last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of bikers, documented on the album &quot;Metallic K.O.&quot; Drug abuse stalled Pop&#x27;s career again for several years.

=== Bowie and Berlin: 1976–1978 ===
After the Stooges&#x27; second breakup, Pop made recordings with James Williamson, but these were not released until 1977 (as &quot;Kill City&quot;, credited jointly to Pop and Williamson). Pop was unable to control his drug use and checked himself into a mental institution, the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, to try to clean up. Bowie was one of his few visitors, continuing to support his friend and collaborator. In 1976, Bowie took Pop as his companion on the &quot;Station to Station&quot; tour. This was Pop&#x27;s first exposure to large-scale professional touring, and he was impressed, particularly with Bowie&#x27;s work ethic. Following a March 21, 1976, show, Bowie and Pop were arrested together for marijuana possession in Rochester, New York, although charges were later dropped.

Bowie and Pop relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions. &quot;Living in a Berlin apartment with Bowie and his friends was interesting…&quot; Pop recalled. &quot;The big event of the week was Thursday night. Anyone who was still alive and able to crawl to the sofa would watch &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;.&quot;

In 1977, Pop signed with RCA Records. Bowie helped write and produce &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life,&quot; Pop&#x27;s two most acclaimed albums as a solo artist, the latter featuring one of his best-known songs, &quot;The Passenger&quot;. &quot;Lust for Life&quot; featured another team of brothers, Hunt and Tony Fox Sales, sons of comedian Soupy Sales. Among the songs Bowie and Pop wrote together were &quot;China Girl&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Sister Midnight&quot;, all of which Bowie performed on his own albums later (the last being recorded with different lyrics as &quot;Red Money&quot; on &quot;Lodger&quot;). Bowie also played keyboards in Pop&#x27;s live performances, some of which are featured on the album &quot;TV Eye Live&quot; in 1978. In return, Pop contributed backing vocals on Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot;.

&quot;Artistically, I really like those two records, &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;,&quot; Pop said. &quot;But I was personally just miserable… David was a really good friend to me in many ways, but… he had his whole thing going on and a whole apparatus of people around him, and problems that he had to face. For more than year, I lived in the room next door, and I had a good friendship, but it wasn&#x27;t the same as being in a band.&quot;

===Arista albums: 1979–1981===
Pop had grown dissatisfied with RCA, later admitting that he had made &quot;TV Eye Live&quot; as a quick way of fulfilling his three-album RCA contract. He moved to Arista Records, under whose banner he released &quot;New Values&quot; in 1979. This album was something of a Stooges reunion, with James Williamson producing and latter-day Stooge Scott Thurston playing guitar and keyboards. Not surprisingly, the album&#x27;s style harkened back to the guitar sound of the Stooges. &quot;New Values&quot; was not a commercial success in the U.S. but has since been highly regarded by critics.

The album was moderately successful in Australia and New Zealand, however, and this led to Pop&#x27;s first visit there to promote it. While in Melbourne, he made a memorable appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s nationwide show &quot;Countdown&quot;. During his anarchic performance of &quot;I&#x27;m Bored&quot;, Pop made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was lip-synching (shoving the microphone down his pants at one point), and he even tried to grab the teenage girls in the audience. He was also interviewed by host Molly Meldrum, an exchange which was frequently punctuated by the singer jumping up and down on his chair and making loud exclamations of &quot;G&#x27;day mate&quot; in a mock Australian accent. His &quot;Countdown&quot; appearance is generally considered one of the highlights of the show&#x27;s history and it cemented his popularity with Australian punk fans, since then he has often toured there. While visiting New Zealand, Pop recorded a music video for &quot;I&#x27;m Bored&quot; and attended a record company function where he appeared to slap a woman and throw wine over a photographer. While in Australia, Pop was also the guest on a live late-night commercial TV interview show on the Ten Network. The &quot;Countdown&quot; appearance has often been re-screened in Australia.

During the recording of &quot;Soldier&quot; (1980), Pop and Bowie argued with Williamson over various aspects of the project. Williamson recalled, &quot;I was not at all happy with a number of aspects of that record including the band, the material and the recording facilities. So I was unhappy in general and vice versa&quot;. Williamson left the project. Bowie appeared on the song &quot;Play it Safe&quot;, performing backing vocals with the group Simple Minds. During a live performance in Brooklyn in 1981, Pop smashed a microphone into his own face, knocking out a front tooth.
Both &quot;Soldier&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Party&quot; (1981) were commercial failures, and Pop was dropped from Arista.

===1980s===
In 1980, Pop published his autobiography &quot;I Need More&quot;, co-written with Anne Wehner, an Ann Arbor arts patron. The book, which includes a selection of black and white photographs, featured a foreword by Andy Warhol. Warhol wrote that he met Pop when he was Jim Osterberg, at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1966. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why he hasn&#x27;t made it really big,&quot; Warhol wrote. &quot;He is so good.&quot;

The 1982 album &quot;Zombie Birdhouse&quot; on Chris Stein&#x27;s Animal label, with Stein himself producing, was no more commercially successful than his Arista works. In 1983, Pop&#x27;s fortunes changed when David Bowie recorded a cover of the song &quot;China Girl&quot;. The song had originally appeared on &quot;The Idiot&quot; and was a major hit on Bowie&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; album. As co-writer of the song, Pop received substantial royalties. On &quot;Tonight&quot; in 1984, Bowie recorded five more of their co-written songs (2 from &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, 1 from &quot;New Values&quot;, and 2 new songs), assuring Pop financial security, at least for the short term. The support from Bowie enabled Pop to take a three-year break, during which he overcame his resurgent heroin addiction and took acting classes.

Additionally, Pop contributed the title song to the 1984 film &quot;Repo Man&quot; (with Steve Jones, previously of the Sex Pistols, on guitar, and Nigel Harrison and Clem Burke, both of Blondie on bass and drums) as well as an instrumental called &quot;Repo Man Theme&quot; that was played during the opening credits.

In 1985, Pop recorded some demos with Jones. He played these demos for Bowie, who was sufficiently impressed to offer to produce an album for Pop: 1986&#x27;s new wave-influenced &quot;Blah-Blah-Blah&quot;, featuring the single
&quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, a cover of &quot;The Wild One&quot;, originally written and recorded by Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll musician Johnny O&#x27;Keefe in 1958. The single was a Top 10 hit in the UK and was successful around the world, especially in Australia, where it has been used since 1987 as the theme music for the ABC&#x27;s late-night music video show &quot;Rage&quot;. &quot;Blah-Blah-Blah&quot; was Pop&#x27;s highest-charting album in the U.S. since &quot;The Idiot&quot; in 1977, peaking at No. 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Also in 1985, Pop and Lou Reed contributed their singing voices to the animated film &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;. Pop performed the song &quot;Pain &amp; Suffering&quot; in the final sequence of the film.

In 1987, Pop appeared (along with Bootsy Collins) on a mostly instrumental album, &quot;Neo Geo&quot;, by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. The music video for &quot;Risky&quot;, written and directed by Meiert Avis, won the first MTV Breakthrough Video Award. The groundbreaking video explores philosopher FM-2030&#x27;s ideas of &quot;Nostalgia for the Future&quot; in the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one of Man Ray&#x27;s models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn from Jean Baudrillard, Edvard Munch&#x27;s 1894 painting &quot;Puberty&quot;, and Roland Barthes &quot;Death of the Author&quot;. The surrealist black-and-white video uses stop motion, light painting, and other retro in-camera effects techniques. Meiert Avis recorded Sakamoto while at work on the score for &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; in London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Pop, who performs the vocals on &quot;Risky&quot;, chose not to appear in the video, allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.

Pop&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot;, &quot;Instinct&quot; (1988), was a turnaround in musical direction. Its stripped-back, guitar-based sound leaned further towards the sound of the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him, but the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; radio show recorded the &quot;Instinct&quot; tour (featuring guitarist Andy McCoy and Alvin Gibbs on bass) in Boston on July 19, 1988. Working with rock attorney Stann Findelle, Pop scored more movie soundtrack inclusions in 1989: &quot;Living on the Edge of the Night&quot; in the Ridley Scott thriller &quot;Black Rain&quot;; and &quot;Love Transfusion&quot;, a song originally written by Alice Cooper (who does backing vocals) and Desmond Child, in &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s Shocker&quot;. Also, at the same time, Pop, dissatisfied from RCA&#x27;s decisions, revoked copyrights of his RCA releases, assigned it to his company &quot;Thousand Mile&quot;, and signed a contract with Virgin Records, which was a unique hybrid of distribution deal for his RCA releases and a recording contract for new albums. Virgin first reissued &quot;Lust for Life&quot; and &quot;The Idiot&quot; in 1990, then &quot;TV Eye Live 1977&quot; in 1994.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Pop recorded &quot;Brick by Brick&quot;. The album was produced by Don Was and featured members of Guns N&#x27; Roses and the B-52&#x27;s as guests. His &quot;Kiss My Blood&quot; video (1991) was directed by Tim Pope and filmed at the Olympia in Paris. The video attracted much controversy, as it included footage of Pop performing with his penis exposed to the audience. &quot;Brick by Brick&quot; featured his first Top 40 U.S. hit, &quot;Candy&quot;, a duet with B-52&#x27;s singer Kate Pierson.

Also in 1990, Pop sang the role of &quot;The Prosecutor&quot; for the POINT Music/Philips Classics recording (released in 1992) of composer John Moran&#x27;s multimedia opera &quot;The Manson Family&quot;. That year he also contributed to the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; project, singing a version of &quot;Well Did You Evah!&quot; in a duet with Debbie Harry.

In the early to middle 1990s, Pop would make several guest appearances on the Nickelodeon show &quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot;. He played James Mecklenberg, Nona Mecklenberg&#x27;s father.

In 1991, Pop and Kirst contributed the song &quot;Why Was I Born (Freddy&#x27;s Dead)&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;. The song also plays over the end credits of the film, with a compilation of clips from the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series running alongside the end credits. In the same year, Pop sang a leading role in the John Moran opera &quot;The Manson Family&quot;.

In 1992, he collaborated with Goran Bregović on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; by Emir Kusturica. Pop sang four of the songs: &quot;In the Deathcar&quot;, &quot;TV Screen&quot;, &quot;Get the Money&quot;, and &quot;This is a Film&quot;. Also in 1992, he collaborated with the New York City band White Zombie. He recorded spoken word vocals on the intro and outro of the song &quot;Black Sunshine&quot; as well as playing the character of a writer in the video shot for the song.

In 1993, Pop released &quot;American Caesar&quot;, including two successful singles, &quot;Wild America&quot; and &quot;Beside You&quot;. The following year Pop contributed to Buckethead&#x27;s album &quot;Giant Robot&quot;, including the songs &quot;Buckethead&#x27;s Toy Store&quot; and &quot;Post Office Buddy&quot;. He appears also on the Les Rita Mitsouko album &quot;Système D&quot; where he sings the duet &quot;My Love is Bad&quot; with Catherine Ringer.

In 1996, Pop again found mainstream fame when his 1977 song &quot;Lust for Life&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. A new video was recorded for the song, with clips from the film and studio footage of Pop dancing with one of the film&#x27;s stars, Ewen Bremner. A Pop concert also served as a plot point in the film. The song has also been used in TV commercials for Royal Caribbean and as the theme music to &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;, a nationally syndicated American sports talk show.

In 1996, Pop released &quot;Naughty Little Doggie&quot; and the single &quot;I Wanna Live&quot;. In 1997, he remixed &quot;Raw Power&quot; to give it a rougher, more hard-edged sound; fans had complained for years that Bowie&#x27;s official &quot;rescue effort&quot; mix was muddy and lacking in bass. Pop testified in the reissue&#x27;s liner notes that on the new mix, &quot;everything&#x27;s still in the red&quot;. He co-produced his 1999 album &quot;Avenue B&quot; with Don Was, releasing the single &quot;Corruption&quot;.

In 1997, Pop was credited with the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Brave&quot;.

On January 1, 1998, Pop made a guest appearance on Paramount Television&#x27;s science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Pop played a Vorta in an episode based upon the film &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, titled &quot;The Magnificent Ferengi&quot;. Pop also contributed the theme song for &quot;Space Goofs&quot;.

Pop sang on the 1999 Death in Vegas UK Top-10 single &quot;Aisha&quot;. The same year he appeared on &quot;Hashisheen: The End of Law&quot;, a collaborative effort by Bill Laswell, reading on the tracks &quot;The Western Lands&quot; and &quot;A Quick Trip to Alamut&quot;. He also sang on the tracks &quot;Rolodex Propaganda&quot; and &quot;Enfilade&quot; by At the Drive-In in 2000.

===The Stooges reunion: 2003–2010===

Pop&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Skull Ring&quot; featured collaborators Sum 41, Green Day, Peaches, and the Trolls, as well as Ron and Scott Asheton, reuniting the three surviving founding members of the Stooges for the first time since 1974. Pop made a guest appearance on Peaches&#x27;s song &quot;Kick It&quot; as well as the video. Also in 2003, the first full-length biography of Pop was published. &quot;Gimme Danger – The Story of Iggy Pop&quot; was written by Joe Ambrose; Pop did not collaborate on the biography or publicly endorse it.

Having enjoyed working with the Ashetons on &quot;Skull Ring&quot;, Pop reformed the Stooges, with bassist Mike Watt (formerly of the Minutemen) filling in for the late Dave Alexander and &quot;Fun House&quot; saxophonist Steve Mackay rejoining the lineup. That year, Pop opened Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Reinvention&quot; World Tour in Dublin.

Pop and the Stooges played the Glastonbury Festival in June 2007. Their set included material from the 2007 album &quot;The Weirdness&quot; and classics such as &quot;No Fun&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;. Pop also caused controversy in June 2007 when he was interviewed on the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Glastonbury Festival. He used the phrase &quot;paki shop&quot;, apparently unaware of its racist connotations, prompting three complaints and an apology from the BBC.

On March 10, 2008, Pop appeared at Madonna&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. Together with the Stooges, he sang raucous versions of two Madonna hits, &quot;Burning Up&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. Before leaving the stage, he looked directly at Madonna, quoting &quot;You make me feel shiny and new, like a virgin, touched for the very first time&quot;, from Madonna&#x27;s hit song &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. According to guitarist Ron Asheton, Madonna asked the Stooges to perform in her place, as a protest to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for not inducting the Stooges, despite six appearances on the nomination ballot. Pop also sang on the &quot;No Fun&quot; cover by Asian Dub Foundation on their 2008 album &quot;Punkara&quot;.

On January 6, 2009, original Stooges guitarist and Pop&#x27;s self-described best friend Ron Asheton was found dead from an apparent heart attack. He was 60 years old.

In 2009, James Williamson rejoined the band after 29 years.

On December 15, 2009, it was announced that the Stooges would be inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2010. Pop had &quot;about two hours of a strong emotional reaction&quot; to the news.

=== 2000s ===
Pop produced 2001&#x27;s &quot;Beat &#x27;Em Up&quot;, which gave birth to the Trolls, releasing the single &quot;Football&quot; featuring Trolls alumni Whitey Kirst and brother Alex.
In 2005, Pop appeared, along with Madonna, Little Richard, Bootsy Collins, and the Roots&#x27; Questlove, in an American TV commercial for the Motorola ROKR phone. In early 2006, Pop and the Stooges played in Australia and New Zealand for the Big Day Out. They also began work on a new album, &quot;The Weirdness&quot;, which was recorded by Steve Albini and released in March 2007. In August 2006, Pop and the Stooges performed at the Lowlands pop festival in the Netherlands, Hodokvas in Slovakia and in the Sziget Festival in Budapest.

Author Paul Trynka completed a biography of Pop (with his blessing) called &quot;Open Up and Bleed&quot;, published in early 2007. In February 2007, Pop and the Stooges played at Bam Margera&#x27;s wedding and Pop appeared on the single &quot;Punkrocker&quot; with the Teddybears in a Cadillac television commercial. Pop was also the voice of Lil&#x27; Rummy on the Comedy Central cartoon &quot;Lil&#x27; Bush&quot; and confirmed that he has done voices for &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, which also included the Stooges song &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; (though the game&#x27;s manual credited Iggy Pop as the artist).

Pop guested on &quot;Profanation&quot;, the new album by the Bill Laswell-helmed group Praxis, which was released on January 1, 2008.

Pop collaborated with Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse on the album &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;, singing the track &quot;Pain&quot;.

Pop&#x27;s fifteenth solo album, &quot;Préliminaires&quot;, was released on June 2, 2009. Inspired by a novel by French author Michel Houellebecq called &quot;La Possibilité d&#x27;une île&quot; (2005; Trans. as &quot;The Possibility of an Island&quot; by Gavin Bowd, 2006), Pop was approached to provide the soundtrack for a documentary film on Houellebecq and his attempts to make a film from his novel. He describes this new release as a &quot;quieter album with some jazz overtones&quot;, the first single off the album, &quot;King of the Dogs&quot;, bearing a sound strongly influenced by New Orleans jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton. Pop said that the song was his response to being &quot;sick of listening to idiot thugs with guitars banging out crappy music&quot;. The album is available on legal download sites, CD, and a deluxe box set is available at only 6000 units worldwide. This box set contains the &quot;Préliminaires&quot; album, a collector &quot;Les Feuilles Mortes&quot; b/w &quot;King of the Dogs&quot; 7 inch, the cover of which is Pop&#x27;s portrait by Marjane Satrapi, and a 38-page booklet of drawings also by Marjane Satrapi.

In January 2009, Pop was signed up as the face of Swiftcover, the UK-based online insurance company. He fronted a £25 million TV ad campaign for Swiftcover, using the strapline &quot;Get a Life&quot;. The advert was then banned by the Advertising Standards Authority on April 28, 2009, for being misleading – it implied that Pop himself had an insurance policy with Swiftcover when at the time the company did not insure musicians.

=== 2010s ===
Pop also sings on &quot;We&#x27;re All Gonna Die&quot; on Slash&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Slash&quot;, which was released in April 2010. He appeared as a character in the video game &quot;Lego Rock Band&quot; to sing his song &quot;The Passenger&quot; and also lent his voice for the in-game tutorial. With reference to the song &quot;The Passenger&quot;, Pop has appeared on NZ television advertising phone networks, showing that he could get a band to play together by conference call. He was inducted as part of the Stooges into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2010.

After a March 2010 stage diving accident, Pop claimed he would no longer stage dive. However, he did so on three occasions at a concert in Madrid, Spain on April 30, 2010, and did similarly at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo on May 2, 2010. On July 9, 2010, Pop again stage dived at Rock Zottegem, Belgium, causing bleeding from the face. In June 2010, Pop appeared at Yonge and Dundas Square in Toronto with the reformed Stooges on the NXNE main stage. In 2011 he teamed up with the Lilies, a collaboration between Sergio Dias of Os Mutantes and French group Tahiti Boy &amp; The Palmtree Family, to record the single &quot;Why?&quot;.

Pop lent his image to PETA&#x27;s campaign against the annual Canada seal hunt.

On April 7, 2011, at age 63, Pop performed &quot;Real Wild Child&quot; on the tenth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; music blog &quot;Iggy Pop &amp; Hiss&quot; described Pop as being &quot;still magnetic, still disturbing&quot;. He is also featured on Kesha&#x27;s song &quot;Dirty Love&quot; on her second album &quot;Warrior&quot;. On August 25, 2013, Iggy and the Stooges co-headlined RiotFest 2013&#x27;s Day 2, performing in Toronto and Denver along with the Replacements.

In 2012, Pop was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.
Stooges drummer Scott Asheton died of a heart attack in March 2014 at the age of 64.

On October 14, 2014, Pop gave the fourth annual BBC Music John Peel Lecture in Salford, on the topic of &quot;Free Music in a Capitalist Society&quot;. He used the lecture to discuss his experiences of the music industry, and his reflections on the effect of the internet on the consumption of music and the broader media. 

In January 2015, it was announced that Pop contributed the theme song to Alex Cox&#x27;s film &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero&quot;. He also collaborated with New Order on the song &quot;Stray Dog&quot; of their album &quot;Music Complete&quot; released in September of that year. Pop also collaborated with Tomoyasu Hotei on the songs &quot;How The Cookie Crumbles&quot; and &quot;Walking Through The Night&quot; from the album &quot;Strangers&quot;, also released that same year.

In December, Pop featured on a rework of Elvis Costello&#x27;s song &quot;No Flag&quot; from Costello&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Hey Clockface&quot;. The song was a re-recording, with Pop providing the vocals, translated to French for this version. A new digital track by Pop was also released, titled &quot;Dirty Little Virus&quot;.

The album was produced by Andrew Watt. Upon release in January 2023. &quot;Every Loser&quot; received favourable reviews with &quot;NME&quot; dubbing it &quot;a high-velocity joyride full of delightful doses of wit and grit&quot;. In 2024 he re-recorded &quot;The Passenger&quot; in duet with Siouxsie Sioux: their orchestral version with a slower tempo was conceived for a commercial.

===Filmography===

==Biopic ==
&quot;The Passenger&quot; was the putative name for a biographical film about Pop&#x27;s early career with the Stooges. The film was to be directed by Nick Gomez and Elijah Wood was to play Pop.

Pop liked the script but refused to take part in the film. He said:

He also called Wood &quot;a very poised and talented actor&quot;.

The project appears to have been shelved.

==Classical scholarship==
In 1995, a newly founded journal of classical scholarship, &quot;Classics Ireland&quot;, published Pop&#x27;s reflections on the applicability of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; to the modern world in a short article, &quot;Caesar Lives&quot; (Vol. 2, 1995). Pop also relates how reading Gibbon while on tour in the Southern United States inspired him to a spontaneous soliloquy he called &quot;Caesar&quot;, which was included on his 1993 album &quot;American Caesar.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Pop lives near Miami, Florida. He has been married three times: to Wendy Weissberg for several weeks in 1968 before divorcing her in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, on November 25, 1969; to Suchi Asano (from 1984 until their divorce in 1999); and to his longtime partner Nina Alu, whom he married in 2008. He has a son, Eric Benson, born in 1970 from a relationship with Paulette Benson.

At age 23, Pop allegedly had a relationship with 13-year-old Sable Starr. Since the emergence of the MeToo movement, he has faced criticism for this. &quot;Look Away&quot;, a documentary about sexual abuse in the rock music industry, is named after an Iggy Pop song about Starr.

Pop was diagnosed with scoliosis, with one leg being one and a half inches shorter than the other.

In the 1990s, Pop became friends with Johnny Depp, Jim Jarmusch, and tattoo artist Jonathan Shaw. Shaw said the four wore matching rings depicting a skull, and all but Pop received a similar skull-and-crossbones tattoo.

<text>Belinda Laracuente (born 1980) is a women&#x27;s boxing competitor from Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, where she lived from 1989 to 1998. Her nickname is &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;.

Laracuente debuted as a professional boxer on 12 February 1997 in a match against Karen Nye, which Laracuente won.

On 10 October 1999 she reached a draw in four rounds with Jeanne Martinez. After winning her next fight, she went to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where she was arrested the night before the fight for underage gambling. She spent a night in jail, and then lost a decision in ten rounds to Denise Moraetes.

In her next competition, Laracuente beat future world champion Daniela Somers by a unanimous decision in Miami. After Somers went on to win the world title by beating Leah Melinger, Laracuente asked for a rematch, but she was denied by Somers&#x27; management.

After winning three more matches, she faced Zulfia Koutdoussova, who she ultimately lost to on a split decision.

Facing world champion Christy Martin at the Félix Trinidad-David Reid Pay Per View undercard, Laracuente lost a decision in eight rounds, in a bout that HBO Boxing commentator Jim Lampley said that he thought Laracuente should have won by 78 to 74 on his unofficial score.

After losing one more fight, she retired, but in December 2002 she announced plans to return into the ring, with hopes of getting a new world title chance.

On 14 May 2005, she returned, losing a decision to Mary Jo Sanders, in Kinder, Louisiana. She later lost also to Layla McCarter.

On 8 July 2005, she fought Missy Fiorentino on short notice, losing a unanimous decision to the undefeated prospect.

In 2007 Esther Phiri defeated Belinda to become a world champion.

In 2008 she appeared as a defendant on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. She was sued by a one-time cornerman who claimed Laracuente never paid him for his services. The cornerman had sued for $2500 of her $7000 purse, plus an additional $2500 for embarrassment and threats, but was awarded only $350 by judge Marilyn Milian.

Laracuente ended her boxing career on 22 June 2012, with a career record of 26-28-3 (9 KO&#x27;s).

She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Made&quot; when a teenager was being made into a boxer.

Laracuente was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2018.

<text>The Battle of Thermopylae ( ) was fought in 480 BC between the Achaemenid Persian Empire under Xerxes I and an alliance of Greek city-states led by Sparta under Leonidas I. Lasting over the course of three days, it was one of the most prominent battles of both the second Persian invasion of Greece and the wider Greco-Persian Wars.

The engagement at Thermopylae occurred simultaneously with the naval Battle of Artemisium: between July and September 480 BC. The second Persian invasion under Xerxes I was a delayed response to the failure of the first Persian invasion, which had been initiated by Darius I and ended in 490 BC by an Athenian-led Greek victory at the Battle of Marathon. By 480 BC, a decade after the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes had amassed a massive land and naval force, and subsequently set out to conquer all of Greece. In response, the Athenian politician and general Themistocles proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae while simultaneously blocking the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium.

Around the start of the invasion, a Greek force of approximately 7,000 men led by Leonidas marched north to block the pass of Thermopylae. Ancient authors vastly inflated the size of the Persian army, with estimates in the millions, but modern scholars estimate it at between 120,000 and 300,000 soldiers. They arrived at Thermopylae by late August or early September; the outnumbered Greeks held them off for seven days (including three of direct battle) before their rear-guard was annihilated in one of history&#x27;s most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the Greeks blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could traverse the narrow pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes revealed to the Persians the existence of a path leading behind the Greek lines. Subsequently, Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked by the Persians, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat along with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians. It has been reported that others also remained, including up to 900 helots and 400 Thebans. With the exception of the Thebans, most of whom reportedly surrendered, the Greeks fought the Persians to the death.

Themistocles was in command of the Greek naval force at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek defensive strategy had required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, the decision was made to withdraw to the island of Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and then captured the evacuated city of Athens. The Greek fleet—seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada—attacked and defeated the invading force at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, reportedly losing many of his troops to starvation and disease while also leaving behind the Persian military commander Mardonius to continue the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s Greek campaign. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat Mardonius and his troops at the Battle of Plataea, ending the second Persian invasion.

Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as a flagship example of the power of an army defending its native soil. The performance of the Greek defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and use of terrain as force multipliers.

==Sources==
The primary source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. The Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the 1st century BC in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. Diodorus is fairly consistent with Herodotus&#x27; writings. These wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and are referred to by other authors, as by Aeschylus in &quot;The Persians&quot;.

Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column (now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople), also supports some of Herodotus&#x27; specific reports. George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of Thermopylae, and led some modern writers (such as Liddell Hart) to revise their views of certain aspects of the battle. Grundy also explored Plataea and wrote a treatise on that battle.

On the Battle of Thermopylae itself, two principal sources, Herodotus&#x27; and Simonides&#x27; accounts, survive. Herodotus&#x27; account in Book VII of his &quot;Histories&quot; is such an important source that Paul Cartledge wrote: &quot;we either write a history of Thermopylae with [Herodotus], or not at all&quot;. Also surviving is an epitome of the account of Ctesias, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photios, though this is &quot;almost worse than useless&quot;, missing key events in the battle such as the betrayal of Ephialtes, and the account of Diodorus Siculus in his &quot;Universal History&quot;. Diodorus&#x27; account seems to have been based on that of Ephorus and contains one significant deviation from Herodotus&#x27; account: a supposed night attack against the Persian camp, of which modern scholars have tended to be skeptical.

==Background==
The city-states of Athens and Eretria had aided the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499–494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples. Darius, moreover, was a
usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.

The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved, especially the Athenians, &quot;since he was sure that [the Ionians] would not go unpunished for their rebellion&quot;. Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece. A preliminary expedition under Mardonius in 492 BC secured the lands approaching Greece, re-conquered Thrace, and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia.
Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states in 491 BC asking for a gift of &quot;earth and water&quot; as tokens of their submission to him. Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia. However, in order to appease the Persian king somewhat, two Spartans were voluntarily sent to Susa for execution, in atonement for the death of the Persian heralds.

Darius then launched an amphibious expeditionary force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC, which attacked Naxos before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands. It then besieged and destroyed Eretria. Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of Marathon, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.
At this, Darius began raising a huge new army with which to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian province revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius died while preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt and quickly restarted preparations for the invasion of Greece. No mere expedition, this was to be a full-scale invasion supported by long-term planning, stockpiling, and conscription. Xerxes directed that the Hellespont be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (cutting short the route where a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition beyond any other contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Xerxes&#x27; army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.

The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the strategic guidance of the Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes to resist the Persians. However, the Athenians lacked the manpower to fight on both land and sea, requiring reinforcements from other Greek city-states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece requesting &quot;earth and water&quot; but very deliberately omitting Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading cities. A congress met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed and chaotic Greek world, especially since many of the supposed allies were still technically at war with each other.

The congress met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes&#x27; advance. A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, being warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed through Sarantoporo Pass and that Xerxes&#x27; army was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.

Themistocles, therefore, suggested a second strategy to the Greeks: the route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesus) would require Xerxes&#x27; army to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae, which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, jamming up the overwhelming force of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. Congress adopted this dual-pronged strategy. However, in case of Persian breakthrough, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, while the women and children of Athens would evacuate &quot;en masse&quot; to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.

==Prelude==

The Persian army seems to have made slow progress through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy. At this time of the year, the Spartans, &quot;de facto&quot; military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of Carneia. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement. It was also the time of the Olympic Games, and therefore the Olympic truce, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war. On this occasion, the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the &quot;Hippeis&quot;. This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.

The renowned account of the Battle of Thermopylae, as documented by Herodotus, includes a significant consultation with the Oracle at Delphi. It is said that the Oracle delivered a prophetic message to the Spartans, foretelling the impending conflict: 
Herodotus tells us that Leonidas, in line with the prophecy, was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory, and so he selected only Spartans with living sons.

The Spartan force was reinforced &quot;en route&quot; to Thermopylae by contingents from various cities and numbered more than 7,000 by the time it arrived at the pass. Leonidas chose to camp at, and defend, the &quot;middle gate&quot;, the narrowest part of the pass of Thermopylae, where the Phocians had built a defensive wall some time before. News also reached Leonidas, from the nearby city of Trachis, that there was a mountain track that could be used to outflank the pass of Thermopylae. Leonidas stationed 1,000 Phocians on the heights to prevent such a manoeuvre.

Finally, in mid-August, the Persian army was sighted across the Malian Gulf approaching Thermopylae. With the Persian army&#x27;s arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war. Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus. The Phocians and Locrians, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic and agreed to defend Thermopylae. According to Plutarch, when one of the soldiers complained that, &quot;Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun&quot;, Leonidas replied, &quot;Won&#x27;t it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?&quot; Herodotus reports a similar comment, but attributes it to Dienekes.

Xerxes sent a Persian emissary to negotiate with Leonidas. The Greeks were offered their freedom, the title &quot;Friends of the Persian People&quot;, and the opportunity to re-settle on land better than that they possessed. When Leonidas refused these terms, the ambassador carried a written message by Xerxes, asking him to &quot;Hand over your arms&quot;. Leonidas&#x27; famous response to the Persians was &quot;Molṑn labé&quot; (Μολὼν λαβέ – literally, &quot;having come, take [them]&quot;, but usually translated as &quot;come and take them&quot;). With the Persian emissary returning empty-handed, battle became inevitable. Xerxes delayed for four days, waiting for the Greeks to disperse, before sending troops to attack them.

==Opposing forces==
===Persian army===
The number of troops which Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece has been the subject of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The poet Simonides, who was a contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.

Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic, resulting from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000 to 300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.
The number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force. For instance, it is unclear whether the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.

===Greek army===
According to Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, the Greek army included the following forces:

Notes:
* The number of Peloponnesians

:Diodorus suggests that there were 1,000 Lacedemonians and 3,000 other Peloponnesians, totalling 4,000. Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by Simonides saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians. However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle. Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes&#x27; public showing of the dead, &quot;helots were also there for them to see&quot;, but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle. If helots were present at the battle, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus&#x27; &quot;missing&quot; 900 troops might have been Perioeci, and could therefore correspond to Diodorus&#x27; 1,000 Lacedemonians.
* The number of Lacedemonians
:Further confusing the issue is Diodorus&#x27; ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 Lacedemonians included the 300 Spartans. At one point he says: &quot;Leonidas, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign&quot;. However, he then says: &quot;There were, then, of the Lacedemonians one thousand, and with them three hundred Spartiates&quot;. It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.

Pausanias&#x27; account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had – according to Pausanias 6,000 men – which added to Herodotus&#x27; 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.

Many modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable, add the 1,000 Lacedemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus&#x27; 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus&#x27; Melians and Pausanias&#x27; Locrians. However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).

==Strategic and tactical considerations==

From a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces. As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks&#x27; inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.

Tactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare. A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry. The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare). Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.

===Topography of the battlefield===

It is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian masses. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defences of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Pausanias states &quot;The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.&quot;

On the north side of the roadway was the Malian Gulf, into which the land shelved gently. When at a later date, an army of Gauls led by Brennus attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the Greek fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the Gauls with ship-borne missile weapons.

Along the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or &quot;gates&quot; (&quot;pylai&quot;), and at the centre gate a wall that had been erected by the Phocians, in the previous century, to aid in their defence against Thessalian invasions. The name &quot;Hot Gates&quot; comes from the hot springs that were located there.

The terrain of the battlefield was nothing that Xerxes and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.

Today, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of sedimentation in the Malian Gulf. The old track appears at the foot of the hills around the plain, flanked by a modern road. Recent core samples indicate that the pass was only wide, and the waters came up to the gates: &quot;Little do the visitors realize that the battle took place across the road from the monument.&quot; The pass still is a natural defensive position to modern armies, and British Commonwealth forces in World War II made a defence in 1941 against the Nazi invasion mere metres from the original battlefield.

==Battle==

===First day===

On the fifth day after the Persian arrival at Thermopylae and the first day of the battle, Xerxes finally resolved to attack the Greeks. First, he ordered 5,000 archers to shoot a barrage of arrows, but they were ineffective; they shot from at least 100 yards away, according to modern day scholars, and the Greeks&#x27; wooden shields (sometimes covered with a very thin layer of bronze) and bronze helmets deflected the arrows.
After that, Xerxes sent a force of 10,000 Medes and Cissians to take the defenders prisoner and bring them before him. The Persians soon launched a frontal assault, in waves of around 10,000 men, on the Greek position. The Greeks fought in front of the Phocian wall, at the narrowest part of the pass, which enabled them to use as few soldiers as possible. Details of the tactics are scant; Diodorus says, &quot;the men stood shoulder to shoulder&quot;, and the Greeks were &quot;superior in valour and in the great size of their shields.&quot; This probably describes the standard Greek phalanx, in which the men formed a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points protruding out from the sides of the shields, which would have been highly effective as long as it spanned the width of the pass. The weaker shields, and shorter spears and swords of the Persians prevented them from effectively engaging the Greek hoplites. Herodotus says that the units for each city were kept together; units were rotated in and out of the battle to prevent fatigue, which implies the Greeks had more men than necessary to block the pass. The Greeks killed so many Medes that Xerxes is said to have stood up three times from the seat from which he was watching the battle. According to Ctesias, the first wave was &quot;cut to ribbons&quot;, with only two or three Spartans killed in return.

According to Herodotus and Diodorus, Xerxes, having taken the measure of the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans reportedly used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.

===Second day===

On the second day, Xerxes again sent in the infantry to attack the pass, &quot;supposing that their enemies, being so few, were now disabled by wounds and could no longer resist.&quot; However, the Persians had no more success on the second day than on the first. Xerxes at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, &quot;totally perplexed&quot;.

Later that day, however, as Xerxes was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall; a Trachinian named Ephialtes informed him of the mountain path around Thermopylae and offered to guide the Persian army. Ephialtes was motivated by the desire for a reward. For this act, the name &quot;Ephialtes&quot; received a lasting stigma; it came to mean &quot;nightmare&quot; in the Greek language and to symbolize the archetypal traitor in Greek culture.

Herodotus reports that Xerxes sent his commander Hydarnes that evening, with the men under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were. The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day, so it is possible that Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including what was left of the Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission. The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of Locris.

===Third day===
At daybreak on the third day, the Phocians guarding the path above Thermopylae became aware of the outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.

Learning from a runner that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks. Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas resolved to stay at the pass with the Spartans. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around 2,000 soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened). The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.

Leonidas&#x27; actions have been the subject of much discussion. It is commonly stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating. It has also been proposed that the failure to retreat from Thermopylae gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It has also been suggested that Leonidas, recalling the words of the Oracle, was committed to sacrificing his life in order to save Sparta.

One commonly accepted theory is that Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away. If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If they had all remained at the pass, they would have been encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.

The Thebans have also been the subject of some discussion. Herodotus suggests they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes. However, Plutarch had argued that if they were hostages, they would have been sent away with the rest of the Greeks. The likelihood is that these were the Theban &quot;loyalists&quot;, who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to Persian domination. They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia. The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.

However, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.
At dawn, Xerxes made libations, pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance. A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged at the front of the Greek formation. The Greeks this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many Persians as they could. They fought with spears, until every spear was shattered, and then switched to &quot;xiphē&quot; (short swords). In this struggle, Herodotus states that two of Xerxes&#x27; brothers fell: Abrocomes and Hyperanthes. Leonidas also died in the assault, shot down by Persian archers, and the two sides fought over his body; the Greeks took possession. As the Immortals approached, the Greeks withdrew and took a stand on a hill behind the wall. The Thebans &quot;moved away from their companions, and with hands upraised, advanced toward the barbarians...&quot; (Rawlinson translation), but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted. The king later had the Theban prisoners branded with the royal mark. Of the remaining defenders, Herodotus says: 

 Here they defended themselves to the last, those who still had swords using them, and the others resisting with their hands and teeth. Tearing down part of the wall, Xerxes ordered the hill surrounded, and the Persians rained down arrows until every last Greek was dead. In 1939, archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos, excavating at Thermopylae, found large numbers of Persian bronze arrowheads on Kolonos Hill, which changed the identification of the hill on which the Greeks were thought to have died from a smaller one nearer the wall.

The pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army, according to Herodotus, at the cost to the Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle. Herodotus says, at one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus&#x27; own estimates), and this number is probably too high.

==Aftermath==
After the Persians&#x27; departure, the Greeks collected their dead and buried them on the hill. A full 40 years after the battle, Leonidas&#x27; bones were returned to Sparta, where he was buried again with full honours; funeral games were held every year in his memory.

With Thermopylae now opened to the Persian army, the continuation of the blockade at Artemisium by the Greek fleet became irrelevant. The simultaneous naval Battle of Artemisium had been a tactical stalemate, and the Greek navy was able to retreat in good order to the Saronic Gulf, where it helped to ferry the remaining Athenian citizens to the island of Salamis.
Following Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to sack and burn Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities that had not submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens and accomplished the Achaemenid destruction of Athens. Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage of the Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.

Fearing the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes now retreated with much of the Persian army back to Asia, though nearly all of them died of starvation and disease on the return voyage. He left a hand-picked force, under Mardonius, to complete the conquest the following year. However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and they marched on Attica. Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain, and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea. At the Battle of Plataea, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece. Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale, they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.
Thermopylae is one of the most famous battles in European ancient history, repeatedly referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had shown that even when heavily outnumbered, the Greeks could put up an effective fight against the Persians, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.

It is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a Pyrrhic victory for the Persians (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would, in the aftermath of Thermopylae, conquer the majority of Greece, and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later. Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis. However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between Thermopylae and Salamis, the time bought was negligible. Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae, incurring losses in the process. George Cawkwell suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes&#x27; systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia, and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae; thus, as a delaying action, Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes&#x27; own procrastination. Far from labelling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory, modern academic treatises on the Greco-Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece. For instance, Cawkwell states: &quot;he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success.
... Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself&quot;, while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as &quot;disastrous&quot;.

The fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set. Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass. Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: &quot;Salamis, Plataea, Mycale and Sicily are the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men&quot;. A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:

So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy—freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested. While this paradigm of &quot;free men&quot; outfighting &quot;slaves&quot; can be seen as a rather sweeping overgeneralization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.

Militarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers.

===Monuments===
There are several monuments around the battlefield of Thermopylae. One is a statue of King Leonidas I, portrayed as bearing a spear and shield.

====Epitaph of Simonides====
A well-known epigram, usually attributed to Simonides, was engraved as an epitaph on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae. It is also the hill on which the last of them died. The original stone has not survived, but in 1955, the epitaph was engraved on a new stone. The text from Herodotus is:
:.

:&quot;Ō ksein&#x27;, angellein Lakedaimoniois hoti tēide&quot;
:&quot;keimetha, tois keinōn rhēmasi peithomenoi.&quot;

:O stranger, tell the Lacedaemonians that
:we lie here, obedient to their words.

The alternative ancient reading (&quot;peithomenoi nomίmois&quot;) for (&quot;rhēmasi peithomenoi&quot;) substitutes &quot;laws&quot; (νόμοι) for &quot;words&quot;.

The form of this ancient Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, commonly used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian brevity, which allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem. Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.

It was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there (with the exception of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called &#x27;stranger&#x27;) for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died &#x27;fulfilling their orders&#x27;.

The first line of the epigram was used as the title of the short story &quot;Stranger, Bear Word to the Spartans We…&quot; by German Nobel Prize laureate Heinrich Böll. A variant of the epigram is inscribed on the Polish Cemetery at Monte Cassino.

John Ruskin expressed the importance of this ideal to Western civilization as follows:Also obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and compulsory law, but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience to an issued command ... His name who leads the armies of Heaven is &quot;Faithful and True&quot;... and all deeds which are done in alliance with these armies ... are essentially deeds of faith, which therefore ... is at once the source and the substance of all known deed, rightly so called ... as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever, so far as I know, uttered by simple man concerning his practice, being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical nation ... [the epitaph in Greek]

Cicero recorded a Latin variation in his &quot;Tusculanae Disputationes&quot; (1.42.101):

:&quot;Dic, hospes, Spartae nos te hic vidisse iacentes&quot;
:&quot;dum sanctis patriae legibus obsequimur.&quot;

:Tell, stranger, to Sparta that you saw us lying here
:since we followed the sacred laws of the fatherland.

====Leonidas monument====

Additionally, there is a modern monument at the site, called the &quot;Leonidas Monument&quot; by Vassos Falireas, in honour of the Spartan king. It features a bronze statue of Leonidas. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: &quot;Μολὼν λαβέ&quot; (&quot;Come and take them!&quot;—as in answer to Xerxes&#x27; demand that the Greeks give up their weapons). The metope below depicts battle scenes. The two marble statues on the left and the right of the monument represent, respectively, the river Eurotas and Mount Taygetos, famous landmarks of Sparta.

====Thespian monument====

In 1997, a second monument was officially unveiled by the Greek government, dedicated to the 700 Thespians who fought with the Spartans The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god Eros, to whom the ancient Thespians accorded particular religious veneration. Under the statue, a sign reads: &quot;In memory of the seven hundred Thespians.&quot; 

A plate below the statue explains its symbolism:
* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.
* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.
* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.
* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.
* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.

The monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.

===Associated legends===

Herodotus&#x27; colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.

For instance, Plutarch recounts, in his &quot;Sayings of Spartan Women&quot;, upon his departure, Leonidas&#x27; wife Gorgo asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, &quot;Marry a good man and have good children.&quot;

It is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoitre. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout&#x27;s reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in callisthenics and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of Demaratus, an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them &quot;the bravest men in Greece&quot; and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, &quot;there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defence.&quot;

Herodotus also describes Leonidas&#x27; reception of a Persian envoy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: &quot;If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others&#x27; possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.&quot; Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: Μολὼν λαβέ (&quot;Come and get them.&quot;)

Such laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when Dienekes, a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as &quot;to block out the sun&quot;, he retorted, &quot;So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade.&quot;

After the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: &quot;an olive-wreath&quot;. Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: &quot;Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honour!&quot; (Godley translation) or otherwise, &quot;Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory.&quot;

===Commemoration===
Greece has announced two commemorative coins to mark 2,500 years since the historic battle. While this anniversary took place in 2021, the coins show the dates 2020 and 480 BC and the text &quot;2,500 years since the Battle of Thermopylae.&quot;
==Analogues==
Similarities between the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of the Persian Gate have been recognized by both ancient and modern authors, which describe it as a kind of reversal of the Battle of Thermopylae, calling it &quot;the Persian Thermopylae&quot;. Here, on Alexander the Great&#x27;s campaign against Persia in 330 BC, he faced the same situation, encountering a last stand of the Persian forces, commanded by Ariobarzanes, at a narrow pass near Persepolis who held the invaders for a month, until the enemy found a path to their rear. There are even accounts that a local shepherd informed Alexander&#x27;s forces about the secret path, just as a local Greek showed the Persian forces a secret path around the pass at Thermopylae. Curtius describes the subsequent battle fought by the surrounded, unarmed Persians as &quot;memorable&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The battle&#x27;s earliest known appearance in culture is a series of epigrams commemorating the dead written by Simonides of Ceos in the battle&#x27;s aftermath. In Europe, interest in the battle was revitalized in the 1700s with the publication of the poems &quot;Leonidas, A Poem&quot; by Richard Glover in 1737 and &quot;Leonidas&quot; by Willem van Haren in 1742. The battle has been featured in numerous works of art, and overall, there is a long tradition of upholding the story of the battle as an example of virtuous self-sacrifice. In 2006, American filmmaker Zack Snyder released the Hollywood action movie 300 based on the battle which grossed $456 million dollars worldwide.

<doc id="157447" wikidata="Q381941" url="?curid=157447" title="Greg Norman">
<text>Gregory John Norman AO (born 10 February 1955) is an Australian former professional golfer who spent 331 weeks as world number one in the 1980s and 1990s. He won 88 professional tournaments, including 20 PGA Tour tournaments and two majors: The Open Championship in 1986 and 1993. Norman also earned thirty top-10 finishes and was the runner-up eight times in majors throughout his career. In a reference to his blond hair, size, aggressive golf style and his birthplace&#x27;s native coastal animal, Norman&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the Great White Shark&quot; (often shortened to just &quot;the Shark&quot;), which he earned after his play at the 1981 Masters.

Norman&#x27;s business interests began during his playing career. He is the chairman and CEO of the Greg Norman Company, a global corporation with a portfolio of companies in fields including apparel, interior design, real estate, wine production, private equity and golf course design. Between 2021 and 2025, he was the CEO of LIV Golf Investments, a start-up company financed by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund; the LIV Golf Invitational Series of golf tournaments began in 2022.

Norman has donated to and established numerous charities and charity events, like the QBE Shootout which benefits the CureSearch for Children&#x27;s Cancer fund. He became a Trustee of the Environmental Institute for Golf in 2004 and received the Golf Writers Association of America&#x27;s Bartlett Award in 2008 for his charitable work.

==Early life==

Norman was born in Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia to Mervin and Toini Norman. His mother was the daughter of a Finnish carpenter, and his father an electrical engineer. As a youth, he played rugby and cricket and aspired to be a professional surfer. His mother Toini, who had a single-figure handicap, taught the 15-year-old Norman how to play golf and allowed him to caddy for her at the Virginia Golf Club in Brisbane. Within about eighteen months, Norman went from a 27 handicap to a scratch handicap. In Townsville, Queensland, Norman attended Townsville Central State School (enrolled 1964) and then Townsville Grammar School then moved on to Aspley State High School on the north side of Brisbane.

== Amateur career ==
In June 1974, at the age of 19, Norman received media attention at the Queensland Open. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; reported that &quot;the young amateur Greg Norman&quot; was one shot off the lead after the first round.

==Professional career==
As of March 1975, Norman had turned professional. He served as assistant professional under Billy McWilliam OAM at Beverley Park Golf Club in Sydney, New South Wales. Shortly thereafter, in the same year, Norman started work as Charlie Earp&#x27;s trainee in the Royal Queensland Golf Club pro shop, earning A$38 a week.

=== Australian and European Tours ===
Norman&#x27;s first four-round professional tournament was the 1976 South Coast Open at Bateman&#x27;s Bay. In the first round, Norman shot a 68 (−3) to put him in a tie for fifth place, three back of David Good&#x27;s lead. He followed it up with an even-par 71 to remain in the top ten. In the third round, he &quot;jumped into the reckoning&quot; with a two-under-par 69 which included five birdies on the back nine, one back of the lead. In the final round, he had a chance to win down the stretch but was &quot;edged out&quot; by Barry Burgess. His second tournament was at the following week&#x27;s Queensland Open. Norman was well back of the lead entering Sunday but shot a final round 70 (−3) to finish in a tie for third. The next week he recorded another top-15 finish at the New South Wales Open. His fourth tournament was the West Lakes Classic held at The Grange Golf Club in Adelaide, South Australia. In the first round, Norman &quot;upstaged his more experienced opponents&quot; to shoot a &quot;brilliant&quot; 64 (−7) to take a three shot lead. In the second round, despite incurring three penalty strokes, Norman shot a four-under-par 67 to expand his lead to five shots. Norman followed it up with a 66 (−5) to create 10 shot lead. On Sunday, however, he had a &quot;fluctuating&quot; final round with six bogeys, six pars, five birdies, and one double-bogey for a 74 (+3). Though David Graham got within four shots Norman held on to win by five. Norman described the win as &quot;unreal.&quot; He later said, &quot;It&#x27;s been a great experience and now I know what now to do − I think.&quot;

Norman joined the European Tour in the following year and had his first victory in a European event that same season at the Martini International at the Blairgowrie Club in Scotland. In 1980, Norman earned a sizable victory in the French Open, winning the tournament by ten shots. He won the Scandinavian Enterprise Open in Sweden with a course record of 64 in the final round. Later in 1980, Norman won the Suntory World Match Play Championship. Norman also won his first Australian Open that year, his first of five wins in that event.

In 1981, Norman finished in 4th place on his debut at the Masters in Augusta, finishing just three strokes behind the winner Tom Watson. Norman had a victory in the 1981 British Masters and he won his third Martini International tournament that year as well. In 1982, Norman was the leading money winner on the European Tour. He won three European events that year, including successfully defending his British Masters title. The following year, Norman joined the U.S. PGA Tour.

=== PGA Tour ===
In June 1984, Norman won his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Kemper Open, winning by five strokes. He gained worldwide prominence a week later at the 1984 U.S. Open. Norman holed a dramatic 45-foot putt on the 72nd hole to force a playoff with former Masters champion Fuzzy Zoeller. At the next day&#x27;s 18-hole playoff, Zoeller would earn a 67–75 victory over Norman. He was able to put the defeat behind him with a victory at the Canadian Open the next month in July for his second win of the year.

In 1985, Norman won the Toshiba Australian PGA Championship and the National Panasonic Australian Open. He had two runner-up finishes in the U.S. PGA Tour that year, finishing tied for second place at the Canadian Open and at the Bank of Boston Classic.
In 1986, Norman&#x27;s 11 worldwide victories that year included four wins in Australia and two regular PGA Tour events; the Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational and the Kemper Open (for the second time) but 1986 is remembered for the &quot;Norman Slam&quot; or the &quot;Saturday Slam.&quot; Norman held the lead for all four majors through 54 holes. This meant he played in the final group for every major and had perhaps the best chance in history of winning the single-season Grand Slam. However, the only major victory Norman earned that year was in the 1986 Open Championship at Turnberry.

At the 1986 Masters, Norman began the final round with a one-stroke lead which he maintained until he double-bogeyed the 10th. After making four consecutive birdies on holes 14 to 17, Norman was tied with Jack Nicklaus going to the 18th. Norman missed a par putt on the 18th that would have sent the two into a sudden-death playoff. At the 1986 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, Norman again led after 54 holes. However, Norman faltered on the final day, finishing with a final round 75 placing him six strokes behind the winner, Raymond Floyd.

Norman finally broke through at the 1986 Open Championship for his first major title. Norman shot a second round of 63 on Friday at Turnberry, tying the record for the lowest ever round at the Open. Only 15 players broke par in the second round. Tom Watson described Norman&#x27;s feat as &quot;the greatest round ever played in a tournament in which I was a competitor.&quot; Norman survived the weekend&#x27;s brutal conditions at Turnberry, with a final round of 69 to win The Open by five shots. After being presented with the Claret Jug trophy, Norman said: &quot;Outside of Australia, Britain was the first place that accepted me as a professional golfer. To win my first Open in front of the British public is the greatest feeling ever.&quot; Norman was again in contention at the 1986 PGA Championship. He was in the lead on the final day, but shot a final-round 76 to finish 2 strokes behind the eventual winner, Bob Tway.

Norman&#x27;s four wins in Australia in 1986 helped him to finish top of the Australian Order of Merit for the fifth time. He also topped the U.S. PGA Tour money list for the first time that year. In September 1986, Norman won the Panasonic European Open at Sunningdale Golf Club and the following month he had another victory in England, winning his third World Match Play Championship at Wentworth. Norman ended 1986 with eleven worldwide victories and was officially ranked number 1 in the brand new Official World Golf Rankings.

Norman endured another setback at the 1987 Masters. In his final round on the 18th green, Norman had a 20-foot putt for a birdie that would win the tournament. The ball trickled over the left lip of the cup, missing by millimetres. After Norman&#x27;s par on the 72nd hole at Augusta, he found himself in a sudden-death playoff with Larry Mize and Seve Ballesteros. On the second playoff hole, with Ballesteros eliminated, Mize holed a 47-yard (140-foot) chip to win the tournament. Norman did, however, win the Australian Masters in February 1987 and the Australian Open later in the year by a record ten shots at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, beating the previous Australian Open record winning margin of eight strokes by Jack Nicklaus in 1971. Norman&#x27;s 1987 victory at the Australian Open lifted him back above Seve Ballesteros to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking.

Norman had another four wins in Australia in 1988. In the U.S., Norman won the MCI Heritage Golf Classic at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, in April 1988, inspired by a leukemia-stricken teenager who got his wish to meet Norman and watch him play. The teenage boy was only supposed to watch the golfer for two rounds, but Norman arranged for him to stay until the tournament&#x27;s completion. After the tournament, Norman awarded the teenager with the trophy. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year.

At the 1989 Masters, Norman missed a 12-foot par putt on the 72nd hole, which would have put him into a playoff with Nick Faldo and Scott Hoch. Norman had another chance at a major in 1989, this time at the Open Championship at Royal Troon. He played a final round of 64, starting his round with six straight birdies, forcing his way into a playoff with Mark Calcavecchia and Wayne Grady. Going into the final playoff hole, Norman and Calcavecchia were tied, but two successive bunker shots by Norman gave Calcavecchia the victory.

Norman won the Doral-Ryder Open and Memorial Tournament in 1990. He also missed the cut for the first time at Augusta National in the 1990 Masters. In the 1990 Open Championship at St Andrews, Norman began with two rounds of 66, leaving himself sharing the lead with Nick Faldo after 36 holes and the pair four shots ahead of the rest of the field. Faldo then shot a third round of 67, but Norman could only manage 76. Norman finished the tournament tied for sixth place, while Faldo won by five shots. Although 1990 was not Norman&#x27;s strongest majors year, he finished at the top of the PGA Tour money list for the second time in his career and won the Vardon Trophy and Byron Nelson Award. Later that year, he won the Australian Masters in his home country for a final and record sixth time.
After a career slump in the early 1990s, Norman turned to renowned coach Butch Harmon for help. Together, the two rebuilt Norman&#x27;s game by solving mechanical problems that had crept into his swing. As a result of this training, Norman earned his second major at Royal St George&#x27;s in the 1993 Open Championship. There, in ideal conditions, Norman defeated a leaderboard consisting of Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer and Corey Pavin. Norman&#x27;s final round 64 was the lowest score by a winner in Open history until Henrik Stenson&#x27;s 63 at the 2016 Open Championship.

During the following year, 1994, Norman easily beat records for the lowest 18-, 54-, and 72-hole scores at The Players Championship. After opening with a course record-tying 63, he followed with three 67s to give him a final total of 264 strokes, or 24 under par—six strokes better than any previous winner.
Norman finished third at the 1995 Masters and was the runner-up at the 1995 U.S. Open. In June, Norman won his second Memorial Tournament, a victory that marked the beginning of one of his best years on the PGA Tour. After his win at the Canon Greater Hartford Open, aided by a chip-in in for eagle on No. 14 in the final round, Norman overtook Nick Price as the number one golfer in the world. Later, he won the NEC World Series of Golf, holing a 70-foot birdie chip shot to defeat Billy Mayfair and Nick Price in a playoff on the first hole. He ultimately held the No. 1 ranking for 331 weeks in his career. He also topped the money list for the third time and was named PGA Player of the Year.

The following year, Norman opened the 1996 Masters Tournament with a course record-tying 63 which put him at the top of the leaderboard. He held the lead through three days of play. Norman took a six-stroke lead into the final round and lost the tournament to Nick Faldo by five strokes, shooting a Sunday 78 to Faldo&#x27;s 67. In January 1997, Norman won his largest winner&#x27;s check to date, one million dollars, when he won the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf. Norman then won two tournaments in 1997, but they were his final victories on the PGA Tour. In 1998, Norman missed part of the season after suffering hip and shoulder injuries. He contended in the 1999 Masters tournament, tying for the lead with five holes remaining before finishing third, three strokes behind, and again in the 1999 Open Championship, eventually finishing 6th, three strokes behind.

In July 2008, despite not playing in a major for three years, Norman finished nine over par in a tie for third at The Open Championship after being the 54-hole leader by two strokes. At 53, he set the record in becoming the oldest 54-hole leader in a major championship; a record that would last for just one year, until 59-year-old Tom Watson led the 2009 Open Championship after three rounds.

Norman turned 50 in February 2005, but has kept his distance from the senior golf circuit. This is due, in part, because of his focus on business, but also because of lingering hip and back issues. In 2003, Norman said: &quot;Hitting about four million golf balls has created unfortunate wear and tear.&quot; He had knee surgery in October 2005 and February 2006. Norman believes his back injuries could have been averted had he been introduced to the concept of golf fitness early in his career.

==Career achievements and legacy==

Norman has earned more than $1 million five times on the U.S. PGA Tour, including three Arnold Palmer Awards as the Tour&#x27;s leading money winner in 1986, 1990 and 1995. He was also the first person in Tour history to surpass $10 million in career earnings. He has 30 top-10 finishes in majors, or more than 38% of those he has entered. His 20 PGA Tour wins in the 1980s and 1990s ranks second behind Tom Watson (21 total) during this span. He had the lowest total four round score in the history of The Open Championship 267, in 1993, (since broken by Henrik Stenson in 2016), and The Players Championship (264, in 1994).

Norman&#x27;s dominance over his peers (despite his comparative lack of success in the majors) was probably best expressed in the Official World Golf Rankings: Norman finished the year on top of the ranking list on seven occasions, in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996 and 1997, and was second at the end of 1988, 1993 and 1994. Norman won the PGA Tour of Australia&#x27;s Order of Merit six times: 1978, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 1988. He won the European Tour&#x27;s Order of Merit in 1982, and topped the PGA Tour&#x27;s money list in 1986, 1990, and 1995. He won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average on the PGA Tour three times: 1989, 1990 and 1994; and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2001.

In 1986, Norman was awarded the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year Award, a feat he replicated in 1993 to join Muhammad Ali as a multiple winner of the award (now also joined by Roger Federer and Usain Bolt). In 2007, Norman was elevated to &quot;Legend&quot; status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He received the 2008 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA&#x27;s highest honour, at the 2008 Golf Industry Show in Orlando. Norman is a member of The Environmental Institute for Golf&#x27;s board of trustees and also chairs The institute&#x27;s advisory council. He was also the recipient of the Golf Writers Association of America&#x27;s 2008 Charlie Bartlett Award. In 2009 Norman was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Greg Norman was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.

In 2015, the PGA of Australia established the Greg Norman Medal, which is awarded to the best Australian male or female golfer in a given year. He also received the Australian Global Icon Award and the National Golf Course Owner&#x27;s Association Award of Merit both in 2015.

===Playing style===
Norman had a bold and aggressive style of play. He is widely regarded as one of the best drivers of the golf ball in his era. In the fourteen seasons between 1984 and 1997, Norman finished in the top 20 in total driving on the PGA Tour twelve times and in the top 6 nine times (including first in 1988, 1989 and 1993). When driving long and straight off the tee with a persimmon (wood) clubhead in his prime, Norman intimidated many of his fellow professionals. His high ball flight enabled him to carry the ball very long distances. In 2009, Nick Price said: &quot;The best driver I ever saw was Greg Norman.&quot;

==Greg Norman Company==
Norman founded the Greg Norman Company [originally known as Great White Shark Enterprises (GWSE)] in 1993 after leaving his previous management group, IMG. The now multi-national corporation is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida. He initially used the Reebok-licensed shark logo for his line of apparel; it now represents over a dozen different businesses. The company reports hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue annually. In 2016, the company changed its branding to become the &quot;Greg Norman Company.&quot;

Norman owns a number of business properties wholly owned by Great White Shark Enterprises. 

First established in 1987, Greg Norman Golf Course Design (GNGCD) has been responsible for the creation of over 100 golf courses across the world.

The Greg Norman Collection began in 1992 after Reebok gave Norman his own line of clothing. It reached $100 million in annual sales in 2005. The collection is composed largely of golf-inspired activewear for men and women.

Greg Norman Estates is a wine company that produces 14 different varietals from Australia, California, and Argentina. The brand is known for attracting attention from &quot;Wine Spectator&quot;, having earned the number 8 spot in the world with a 1998 Reserve Shiraz.

The real estate division of the company is responsible for a variety of developments and projects including the Medalist Village in Hobe Sound, Florida. The Greg Norman Design Group is a separate wing of the real estate division that deals in interior design.

The Great White Shark Opportunity Fund is an asset-based, debt-lending fund that invests in public and private small- to mid-cap growth companies throughout the world. The platform offers alternative lending and flex capital.

A joint venture between Norman and his son, Greg Norman Jr., Shark Wake Park is a brand of wakeboarding complexes. The first park opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in June 2016, and a second, larger park opened in June 2019 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Norman launched a connected golf cart in 2017 with partners Verizon, GPSi and Club Car. The cart is equipped with touchscreen display for music and GPS while playing a course.
Debuting in 2011, Greg Norman Eyewear provides sunglasses that are designed for use on the golf course. The brand has a partnership with Aspex Eyewear and is distributed in the United States by Aspex.

Greg Norman Australian Prime is a branded line of premium Wagyu steaks and other beef products.

Located in Barefoot Landing in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Greg Norman Australian Grille offers fine dining with an Australian theme.

===Non-GWSE properties and partnerships===
In addition to the wholly owned companies under the company umbrella, there are also numerous partially owned companies and partnerships. For instance, Norman invested in and became the ambassador for Vancouver-based GPS Industries in 2004. GWSE partnered with Kohlberg &amp; Company to acquire Troon Golf, one of the world&#x27;s largest golf management companies with over 250 golf courses in its portfolio. Norman is also a leading investment partner in Alchemy Global, a firm that seeks investors for sports startups.

Norman is also the brand ambassador and partner to numerous companies including Qantas (a partnership he&#x27;s been in since 1976), Cobra Golf, OMEGA, and others.

In 2017, Authentic Brands Group become a controlling partner for the consumer products division of The Greg Norman Company.

==Other ventures==

=== LIV Golf Investments ===

LIV Golf Investments was led by Greg Norman as CEO from 2021 to 2025 when he was replaced by Scott O&#x27;Neil. The LIV Golf Invitational Series began in 2022 and consist of seven regular-season events where players compete both individually for points and as part of a team. The series provoked strong resistance from the established PGA Tour and European Tour organisations, including suspensions of players who joined the series, and criticism of its financial backing by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund.

In May 2022 when asked on Sky Sports News about Saudi Arabia&#x27;s extensive human rights violations and how Norman felt about working for such people he stated: &quot;No they&#x27;re not my bosses. We&#x27;re independent, I do not answer to Saudi Arabia, I do not answer to MBS.&quot; LIV Golf Investments is on the public record as being under the majority ownership of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund (PIF). This fund has been controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s de facto ruler since 2015.

===Philanthropy===
The QBE Shootout, formerly known as the Shark Shootout, is a PGA Tour team golf event hosted by Greg Norman. The event is played at the Tiburón Golf Club in Naples, Florida. The Shootout benefits CureSearch National Childhood Cancer Foundation. The Greg Norman Golf Foundation was formed by Greg Norman and his father Merv Norman in 1987. The foundation provides professional guidance and instruction throughout Queensland to school students and those in other educational establishments, children with specific physical disabilities, and junior members of golf clubs. The Environmental Institute for Golf the philanthropic arm of the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA), is a collaborative effort of the environmental and golf communities, dedicated to strengthening the compatibility of golf with the natural environment. Norman became a Trustee of the Institute and a member of its advisory council in 2004.

===Broadcasting===
On 23 April 2014, Fox Sports announced that Norman would join Joe Buck as its lead commentary team for its coverage of the USGA&#x27;s championships beginning in 2015. However, following criticism of his performance at the 2015 U.S. Open, it was announced in January 2016 that Paul Azinger would replace Norman as the lead golf analyst for Fox Sports.

===Autobiography===

Norman released his autobiography, titled &quot;The Way of the Shark&quot;, in 2006.

==Personal life==
Norman had a brief romance with British tennis player Sue Barker before he met Laura Andrassy, an American flight attendant. Norman married Andrassy in July 1981. They had two children—Greg Norman Jr. and Morgan-Leigh. They divorced in 2006, with Andrassy receiving a $105 million settlement. He married former World No. 1 tennis player Chris Evert on Paradise Island in the Bahamas in June 2008, but they separated after only 15 months and were subsequently divorced. In November 2010, Norman married interior designer Kirsten Kutner on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, with Greg Jr. as his best man. Norman has two grandchildren.

In December 2020, Norman was hospitalized with COVID-19. While in hospital, he shared an update on Instagram saying, &quot;It&#x27;s been an ugly one. I for one am looking forward to getting out of this quarantine and looking forward to building whatever the great future is for 2021 and beyond.&quot;

===Political views===
Norman was accused by US Congressman Tim Burchett of promoting Saudi Arabian “propaganda” through his involvement with the LIV series. Norman has rejected this criticism.

Norman was a vocal supporter of the presidency and policies of Donald Trump. &quot;(From) my business perspective, he’s done a phenomenal job,&quot; Norman told one publication about Trump. &quot;He has pretty much stuck to all his promises he made when he was elected.&quot;

<text>Lucien James Longley (born 19 January 1969) is an Australian professional basketball coach and former player. He was the first Australian to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he played for four teams over 10 seasons. He most notably played for the Chicago Bulls, with whom he won three championships from 1996 to 1998. Longley represented Australia as a player at three Olympic Games in 1988, 1992 and 2000; he has worked as an assistant coach for the Australian national basketball team.

Longley began his career in Australia with a brief stint playing for the Perth Wildcats of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1986. He played collegiately for the New Mexico Lobos and was drafted 7th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1991 NBA draft. He played three middling seasons with the Timberwolves before he was traded to the Bulls in 1994. He became the Bulls&#x27; starting centre during their historic 1995–96 season when they set the NBA record for most wins in a regular season with 72. Longley was an important component of the team&#x27;s success and stayed in the Bulls&#x27; starting lineup during their championship three-peat. After the demise of the Bulls after their 1998 championship win, he had brief stints playing with the Phoenix Suns and New York Knicks.

==Early life and career==
Longley was born 19 January 1969 in Melbourne, Victoria, to Sue (&quot;née&quot; Hansen) and Richard Longley. Longley&#x27;s father was an architect who stood tall and represented Australia at international level in basketball, including being a member of two Olympic squads. His mother, who is tall, is an equestrian who has been divorced from Richard since 1984 and lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. Longley has two brothers, Sam, a journalist and actor, and Griffin, also a journalist who also played briefly for the Perth Wildcats.

Longley grew up in Fremantle, Western Australia. At the age of 16 he was a member of the Australian Under-19 side and the following year, 1986, he joined the Wildcats, with whom he played two games.

Longley was recruited out of Scotch College in Perth by the University of New Mexico&#x27;s basketball coach, Gary Colson, who went to Perth to recruit Longley&#x27;s childhood friend Andrew Vlahov, who ended up attending Stanford University. Vlahov and Longley both played their junior basketball for the Perth Redbacks on the same team. Longley attended college at the University of New Mexico, from 1987 to 1991, where he averaged 19.1 points, 9.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists in his senior year. He helped New Mexico reach the NCAA Tournament in 1991. At nineteen he was a member of the national team for the Seoul Olympics, where they finished fourth, at the time the best result an Australian senior men&#x27;s basketball team had achieved in Olympic competition.

Longley also spent time at the Australian Institute of Sport in 1986 and 1987 (before heading to New Mexico) under the coaching of Australian Boomers head coach Adrian Hurley, attending the AIS with Vlahov and another emerging basketball player from Adelaide, Mark Bradtke. Throughout the 1990s, the trio formed the nucleus of the Australian Boomers front court with Longley at centre, 6&#x27;10&quot; (208 cm) Bradtke at power forward, and 6&#x27;7&quot; (201 cm) Vlahov at small forward.

When Longley returned home to Perth during college breaks, he regularly suited up for the Perth Redbacks, helping the team to win consecutive State Basketball League (SBL) championships in 1989 and 1990.

==NBA career==

===Minnesota Timberwolves===
Longley was drafted 7th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1991. After long contract negotiations that were still going on when the 1991–92 NBA season started and actually prevented him from playing for the first month, he made his NBA debut for the Timberwolves on 30 November 1991. In 1992, he again represented Australia at the Barcelona Olympics. After two-plus mediocre seasons with the struggling franchise, the center was traded to the Chicago Bulls for Stacey King late in the 1993–94 season.

===Chicago Bulls===
Longley became the Bulls&#x27; starting center. He won three straight championships with the Bulls from 1996 to 1998, becoming the first Australian player to win an NBA title and the only to have won three championships. After he played 55 games from the bench in 1994–95, Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson made him the starting center in 1995–96. Post-season surgery to his left ankle and the recovery time forced him to miss playing for the Australian Boomers at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

Longley missed almost two months of the 1996–97 season after dislocating his shoulder while body surfing at Hermosa Beach near the team&#x27;s hotel after a game in Los Angeles. In a 2014 interview on Australian television, Longley joked that after a month he began receiving phone calls from Michael Jordan telling him to get back on court soon because he had no one to set screens for him.

===Phoenix Suns===
After the breakup of the Bulls roster after the 1997–98 season, Chicago did a sign-and-trade deal with Longley, sending him to the Phoenix Suns for Mark Bryant, Martin Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, and a conditional first-round draft pick.

===New York Knicks===
Longley was traded to the New York Knicks prior to the 2000–01 NBA season in what was only the second four-team trade in NBA history. The Suns acquired Chris Dudley as part of the deal together with a first-round draft pick from New York and an undisclosed amount of cash, while New York received Longley, Glen Rice, Travis Knight, Vladimir Stepania, Lazaro Borrell, Vernon Maxwell, two first-round draft picks (from the Los Angeles Lakers and the Seattle SuperSonics), and two second-round draft picks from Seattle. Seattle received Patrick Ewing and the Lakers received Horace Grant, Greg Foster, Chuck Person, and Emanual Davis. Longley played one year with New York before retiring, due to a degenerative condition in his left ankle.

==National team career==
Luc Longley made his international debut for the Australia national basketball team in 1988 and would be, whenever possible, the preferred starting centre for the next 12 years. He appeared in three Summer Olympic Games (1988, 1992 and 2000) as well as at the 1990 FIBA World Championship. Unfortunately, injury prevented him from playing for Australia at the 1996 Olympic games as well as the 1994 and 1998 FIBA World Championships.

During his international career, Longley played alongside a number of the greats of Australian basketball including Andrew Gaze, Phil Smyth, Mark Bradtke, Andrew Vlahov, Ray Borner, Brett Maher, and Larry Sengstock.

==Awards==
In 2001, Longley was inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27;. He was a part-owner of the Perth Wildcats basketball club in the Australian National Basketball League for several years and was the #1 ticket holder at the Fremantle Dockers in the Australian Football League between 2006 and 2007. In 2006 he was inducted into Basketball Australia&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Melbourne.

On 8 October 2009 Longley was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame at its 25th anniversary dinner in Melbourne, becoming only the fourth basketball player to be inducted along with Andrew Gaze, Michele Timms, and Phil Smyth.

In August 2021, Longley was inducted into the Basketball Western Australia Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
Longley has spoken of the importance of the Australian Boomers to his growth as a player, citing it as the reason he wanted to return to the national program as an assistant coach; he would later become the assistant coach of the Australian men&#x27;s national basketball team from 2013 to 2019.

==Personal life==
Longley was married to an American, Kelly Yates, whom he met while he was attending college in Albuquerque and they have two daughters. He married an Australian, Anna Gare, a former musician and current television presenter, in 2008. The Longley family are well known in the Fremantle, Western Australia area, to the extent that a 25-year-old, then Chicago Bulls player, Longley was present at the Fremantle Football Club&#x27;s unveiling and launch at the Fremantle Port. He cited Fremantle at the time as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great spots&quot;.

In 1996, Longley bought a house in Riverwoods, Illinois. Also in 1996, he wrote a book, &quot;Running with the Bulls,&quot; about the 1995–96 season; Bulls coach Phil Jackson wrote the foreword.

On 6 April 2007, Longley&#x27;s $2 million home in Fremantle was destroyed by a fire. It was initially believed that much of Longley&#x27;s memorabilia from his basketball career was lost, although he later said he only lost his 1996 team photo. He then bought a warehouse on a nearby street which Gare&#x27;s father, an architect, converted into a house for their needs. In 2015, the couple moved to a property near the coastal Western Australian town of Denmark.

In December 2009 Longley, who had previously participated in marine conservation efforts, named a newly discovered shrimp species &quot;Lebbeus clarehannah&quot; after his 15-year-old daughter. His wife&#x27;s sister Sophie is married to British comedian Ben Elton.

<doc id="157456" wikidata="Q301816" url="?curid=157456" title="Ned Kelly">
<text>Edward Kelly (December 185411 November 1880) was an Australian bushranger, outlaw, gang leader and convicted police-murderer. One of the last bushrangers, he is known for wearing a suit of bulletproof armour during his final shootout with the police.
Kelly was born and raised in rural Victoria, the third of eight children to Irish parents. His father, a transported convict, died in 1866, leaving Kelly, then aged 12, as the eldest male of the household. The Kellys were a poor selector family who saw themselves as downtrodden by the squattocracy and as victims of persecution by the Victoria Police. While a teenager, Kelly was arrested for associating with bushranger Harry Power and served two prison terms for a variety of offences, the longest stretch being from 1871 to 1874. He later joined the &quot;Greta Mob&quot;, a group of bush larrikins known for stock theft. A violent confrontation with a policeman occurred at the Kelly family&#x27;s home in 1878, and Kelly was indicted for his attempted murder. Fleeing to the bush, Kelly vowed to avenge his mother, who was imprisoned for her role in the incident. After he, his brother Dan, and associates Joe Byrne and Steve Hart shot dead three policemen, the government of Victoria proclaimed them outlaws.

Kelly and his gang, with the help of a network of sympathisers, evaded the police for two years. The gang&#x27;s crime spree included raids on Euroa and Jerilderie, and the killing of Aaron Sherritt, a sympathiser turned police informer. In a manifesto letter, Kelly—denouncing the police, the Victorian government and the British Empire—set down his own account of the events leading up to his outlawry. Demanding justice for his family and the rural poor, he threatened dire consequences against those who defied him. In 1880, the gang tried to derail and ambush a police train as a prelude to attacking Benalla, but the police, tipped off, confronted them at Glenrowan. In the ensuing 12-hour siege and gunfight, the outlaws wore armour fashioned from plough mouldboards. Kelly, the only survivor, was severely wounded by police fire and captured. Despite thousands of supporters rallying and petitioning for his reprieve, Kelly was tried, convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out at the Melbourne Gaol.

Historian Geoffrey Serle called Kelly and his gang &quot;the last expression of the lawless frontier in what was becoming a highly organised and educated society, the last protest of the mighty bush now tethered with iron rails to Melbourne and the world&quot;. In the century after his death, Kelly became a cultural icon, inspiring numerous works in the arts and popular culture, and is the subject of more biographies than any other Australian. Kelly continues to cause division in his homeland: he is variously considered a Robin Hood-like folk hero and crusader against oppression, and a murderous villain and terrorist. Journalist Martin Flanagan wrote: &quot;What makes Ned a legend is not that everyone sees him the same—it&#x27;s that everyone sees him. Like a bushfire on the horizon casting its red glow into the night.&quot;

==Family background and early life==

Kelly&#x27;s father, John Kelly (nicknamed &quot;Red&quot;), was born in 1820 at Clonbrogan near Moyglas, County Tipperary, Ireland. Aged 21, he was found guilty of stealing two pigs and was transported on the convict ship &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to Hobart Town, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (modern-day Tasmania), arriving on 2 January 1842. Granted his certificate of freedom in January 1848, Red moved to the Port Phillip District (modern-day Victoria) and was employed as a carpenter by farmer James Quinn at Wallan Wallan.

On 18 November 1850, at St Francis Church, Melbourne, Red married Ellen Quinn, his employer&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter, who was born in County Antrim, Ireland and migrated as a child with her parents to the Port Phillip District. In the wake of the 1851 Victorian gold rush, the couple turned to mining and earned enough money to buy a small freehold in Beveridge, north of Melbourne.

Edward (&quot;Ned&quot;) Kelly was their third child. His exact birth date is unknown, but was probably in December 1854. Kelly was possibly baptised by Augustinian priest Charles O&#x27;Hea, who also administered his last rites before his execution. His parents had seven other children: Mary Jane (born 1851, died 6 months later), Annie (1853–1872), Margaret (1857–1896), James (&quot;Jim&quot;, 1859–1946), Daniel (&quot;Dan&quot;, 1861–1880), Catherine (&quot;Kate&quot;, 1863–1898) and Grace (1865–1940).
The Kellys struggled on inferior farmland at Beveridge and Red began drinking heavily. In 1864 the family moved to Avenel, near Seymour, where they soon attracted the attention of local police. As a boy Kelly obtained basic schooling and became familiar with the bush. According to oral tradition, he risked his life at Avenel by saving another boy from drowning in a creek, for which the boy&#x27;s family gifted him a green sash. It is said this was the same sash worn by Kelly during his last stand in 1880.

In 1865, Red was convicted of receiving a stolen hide and, unable to pay the £25 fine, sentenced to six months&#x27; hard labour. In December 1866, Red was fined for being drunk and disorderly. Badly affected by alcoholism, he died later that month at Avenel, two days after Christmas. Ned signed his death certificate.

The following year, the Kellys moved to Greta in north-eastern Victoria, near the Quinns and their relatives by marriage, the Lloyds. In 1868, Kelly&#x27;s uncle Jim Kelly was convicted of arson after setting fire to the rented premises where the Kellys and some of the Lloyds were staying. Jim was sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to fifteen years of hard labour. The family soon leased a small farm of at Eleven Mile Creek near Greta. The Kelly selection proved ill-suited for farming, and Ellen supplemented her income by offering accommodation to travellers and selling sly-grog.

==Rise to notoriety==
===Bushranging with Harry Power===
In 1869, 14-year-old Kelly met Irish-born Harry Power (alias of Henry Johnson), a transported convict who turned to bushranging in north-eastern Victoria after escaping Melbourne&#x27;s Pentridge Prison. The Kellys were Power sympathisers, and by May 1869 Ned had become his bushranging protégé. That month, they attempted to steal horses from the Mansfield property of squatter John Rowe as part of a plan to rob the Woods Point–Mansfield gold escort. They abandoned the idea after Rowe shot at them, and Kelly temporarily broke off his association with Power.

Kelly&#x27;s first brush with the law occurred in October 1869. A Chinese hawker named Ah Fook said that as he passed the Kelly family home, Ned brandished a long stick, declared himself a bushranger and robbed him of 10 shillings. Kelly, arrested and charged with highway robbery, claimed in court that Fook had abused him and his sister Annie in a dispute over the hawker&#x27;s request for a drink of water. Family witnesses backed Ned and the charge was dismissed.

Kelly and Power reconciled in March 1870 and, over the next month, committed a series of armed robberies. By the end of April, the press had named Kelly as Power&#x27;s young accomplice, and a few days later he was captured by police and confined to Beechworth Gaol. Kelly fronted court on three robbery charges, with the victims in each case failing to identify him. On the third charge, Superintendents Nicolas and Hare insisted Kelly be tried, citing his resemblance to the suspect. After a month in custody, Kelly was released due to insufficient evidence. The Kellys allegedly intimidated witnesses into withholding testimony. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that Power&#x27;s accomplice was described as a &quot;half-caste&quot;, but the police believed this to be the result of Kelly going unwashed.
Power often camped at Glenmore Station on the King River, owned by Kelly&#x27;s maternal grandfather, James Quinn. In June 1870, while resting in a mountainside gunyah (bark shelter) that overlooked the property, Power was captured and arrested by police. Word soon spread that Kelly had informed on him. Kelly denied the rumour, and in the only surviving known to bear his handwriting, he pleads with Sergeant James Babington of Kyneton for help, saying that &quot;everyone looks on me like a black snake&quot;. The informant turned out to be Kelly&#x27;s uncle, Jack Lloyd, who received £500 for his assistance. However, Kelly had also given information which led to Power&#x27;s capture, possibly in exchange for having the charges against him dropped. Power always maintained that Kelly betrayed him.

Reporting on Power&#x27;s criminal career, the &quot;Benalla Ensign&quot; wrote:
===Horse theft, assault and imprisonment===

In October 1870, a hawker, Jeremiah McCormack, accused a friend of the Kellys, Ben Gould, of stealing his horse. In response, Gould sent an indecent note and a parcel of calves&#x27; testicles to McCormack&#x27;s wife, which Kelly helped deliver. When McCormack later confronted Kelly over his role, Kelly punched him and was arrested for both the note and the assault, receiving three months’ hard labor for each charge.

Kelly was released from Beechworth Gaol on 27 March 1871, five weeks early, and returned to Greta. Shortly after, horse-breaker Isaiah &quot;Wild&quot; Wright rode into town on a horse he supposedly borrowed. Later that night, the horse went missing. While Wright was away in search of the horse, Kelly found it and took it to Wangaratta, where he stayed for four days. On 20 April, while Kelly was riding back into Greta, Constable Edward Hall tried to arrest him on the suspicion that the horse was stolen. Kelly resisted and overpowered Hall, despite the constable&#x27;s attempts to shoot him. Kelly was eventually subdued with the help of bystanders, and Hall pistol-whipped him until his head became &quot;a mass of raw and bleeding flesh&quot;. Initially charged with horse stealing, the charge was downgraded to &quot;feloniously receiving a horse&quot;, resulting in a three-year sentence. Wright received eighteen months for his part.
Kelly served his sentence at Beechworth Gaol and Pentridge Prison, then aboard the prison hulk &quot;Sacramento&quot;, off Williamstown. He was freed on 2 February 1874, six months early for good behaviour, and returned to Greta. According to one possibly apocryphal story, Kelly, to settle the score with Wright over the horse, fought and beat him in a bare-knuckle boxing match. A photograph of Kelly in a boxing pose is commonly linked to the match. Regardless of the story&#x27;s veracity, Wright became a known Kelly sympathiser.

Over the next few years, Kelly worked at sawmills and spent periods in New South Wales, leading what he called the life of a &quot;rambling gambler&quot;. During this time, his mother married an American, George King. In early 1877, Ned joined King in an organised horse theft operation. Ned later claimed that the group stole 280 horses. Its membership overlapped with that of the Greta Mob, a bush larrikin gang known for their distinctive &quot;flash&quot; attire. Apart from Ned, the gang included his brother Dan, cousins Jack and Tom Lloyd, and Joe Byrne, Steve Hart and Aaron Sherritt.

On 18 September 1877, Kelly was arrested in Benalla for riding over a footpath while drunk. The following day he brawled with four policemen who were escorting him to court, including a friend of the Kellys, Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick. Another constable involved, Thomas Lonigan, supposedly grabbed Kelly&#x27;s testicles during the fraccas; legend has it that Kelly vowed, &quot;Well Lonigan, I never shot a man yet; but if I ever do...you will be the first!&quot; Kelly was fined and released.

In August 1877, Kelly and King sold six horses they had stolen from pastoralist James Whitty to William Baumgarten, a horse dealer in Barnawartha. On 10 November, Baumgarten was arrested for selling the horses. Warrants for Ned and Dan&#x27;s arrest for the theft were sworn in March and April 1878. King disappeared around this time.

==Fitzpatrick incident==
===Fitzpatrick&#x27;s version of events===

On 11 April 1878, Constable Strachan of Greta heard that Ned was at a shearing shed in New South Wales and left to apprehend him. Four days later, Constable Fitzpatrick arrived at Greta for relief duty and called at the Kellys&#x27; home to arrest Dan for horse theft. Finding Dan absent, Fitzpatrick stayed and conversed with Ellen Kelly.
When Dan and his brother-in-law Bill Skillion arrived later that evening, Fitzpatrick informed Dan that he was under arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner first. The constable consented and stood guard over his prisoner.

Minutes later, Ned rushed in and shot at Fitzpatrick with a revolver, missing him. Ellen then hit Fitzpatrick over the head with a fire shovel. A struggle ensued and Ned fired again, wounding Fitzpatrick above his left wrist. Skillion and Williamson came in, brandishing revolvers, and Dan disarmed Fitzpatrick.

Ned apologised to Fitzpatrick, saying that he mistook him for another constable. Fitzpatrick fainted and when he regained consciousness Ned compelled him to extract the bullet from his own arm with a knife; Ellen dressed the wound. Ned devised a cover story and promised to reward Fitzpatrick if he adhered to it. Fitzpatrick was allowed to leave. About 1.5 km away he noticed two horsemen in pursuit, so he spurred his horse into a gallop to escape. He reached a hotel where his wound was re-bandaged, then rode to Benalla to report the incident.

===Kelly family version of events===
Kelly and members of his family gave conflicting accounts of the Fitzpatrick incident. Kelly initially claimed he was away from Greta at the time, and that if Fitzpatrick suffered any wounds, they were probably self-inflicted. In 1879, Kelly&#x27;s sister Kate stated that he shot Fitzpatrick after the constable had made a sexual advance to her. After Kelly was captured in 1880, he called it &quot;a foolish story&quot;, and three policemen gave sworn evidence that he admitted he had shot Fitzpatrick.

In 1881, Brickey Williamson, who was seeking remission for his sentence in relation to the incident, stated that Kelly shot Fitzpatrick after the constable had drawn his revolver. Many years later, Kelly&#x27;s brother Jim and cousin Tom Lloyd claimed that Fitzpatrick was drunk when he arrived at the house, and while seated, pulled Kate onto his knee, provoking Dan to throw him to the floor. In the ensuing struggle, Fitzpatrick drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with Dan seized and disarmed the constable, who later claimed a wrist injury from a door lock was a gunshot wound.

Kelly scholars Jones and Dawson conclude that Kelly shot Fitzpatrick but it was his friend Joe Byrne who was with him, not Bill Skillion.

===Trial===
Williamson, Skillion and Ellen Kelly were arrested and charged with aiding and abetting attempted murder; Ned and Dan were nowhere to be found. The three appeared on 9 October 1878 before Judge Redmond Barry. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s doctor, who had treated his wound, gave evidence that the constable &quot;was certainly not drunk&quot; and that his wounds were consistent with his statement. The defence called two witnesses to give evidence that Skillion was not present, which would cast doubt on Fitzpatrick&#x27;s account. One of these witnesses, a family relative, swore that Ned was in Greta that afternoon, which was damaging to the defence. Ellen Kelly, Skillion and Williamson were convicted as accessories to the attempted murder of Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson both received sentences of six years and Ellen three years of hard labour.

==Stringybark Creek police murders==

After the Fitzpatrick incident, Ned and Dan escaped into the bush and were joined by Greta Mob members Joe Byrne and Steve Hart. Hiding out at Bullock Creek in the Wombat Ranges, they earned money sluicing gold and distilling whisky, and were supplied with provisions and information by sympathisers.

The police were tipped off about the gang&#x27;s whereabouts and, on 25 October 1878, two mounted police parties were sent to capture them. One party, consisting of Sergeant Michael Kennedy and constables Michael Scanlan, Thomas Lonigan and Thomas McIntyre camped overnight at an abandoned mining site at Stringybark Creek, Toombullup, 36 km north of Mansfield. Unbeknownst to them, the gang&#x27;s hideout was only 2.5 km away and Ned had observed their tracks.
The following day at about 5 p.m., while Kennedy and Scanlan were out scouting, the gang bailed up McIntyre and Lonigan at the camp. McIntyre was then unarmed and surrendered. Lonigan made a motion to draw his revolver and ran for the cover of a log. Ned immediately shot Lonigan, killing him. Ned said he did not begrudge his death, calling him the &quot;meanest man that I had any account against&quot;.

The gang questioned McIntyre and took his and Lonigan&#x27;s firearms. Hoping to convince Ned to spare Kennedy and Scanlan, McIntyre informed him that they too were Irish Catholics. Ned replied, &quot;I will let them see what one native [Australian-born colonial] can do.&quot; At about 5.30 p.m., the gang heard them approaching and hid. Ned advised McIntyre to tell them to surrender. As the constable did so, the gang ordered them to bail up. Kennedy reached for his revolver, whereupon the gang fired. Scanlan dismounted and, according to McIntyre, was shot while trying to unsling his rifle. Ned maintained that Scanlan fired and was trying to fire again when he fatally shot him.
According to McIntyre, the gang continued firing at Kennedy as he dismounted and tried to surrender. Ned later stated that Kennedy hid behind a tree and fired back, then fled into the bush. Ned and Dan pursued and exchanged gunfire with the sergeant for over 1 km before Ned shot him in the right side. According to Ned, Kennedy then turned to face him and Ned shot him in the chest with his shotgun, not realising that Kennedy had dropped his revolver and was trying to surrender.

Amidst the shootout, McIntyre, still unarmed, escaped on Kennedy&#x27;s horse. He reached Mansfield the following day and a search party was quickly dispatched and found the bodies of Lonigan and Scanlan. Kennedy&#x27;s body was found two days later.

In his accounts of the shootout, Ned justified the killings as acts of self-defence, citing reports of policemen boasting that they would shoot him on sight, the cache of weapons and ammunition that the police carried, and their failure to surrender as evidence of their intention to kill him. McIntyre stated that the police party&#x27;s intention was to arrest him, that they were not excessively armed, and that it was the gang who were the aggressors. Jones, Morrissey and others have questioned aspects of both versions of events.

===Outlawed under the &quot;Felons Apprehension Act&quot;===

On 28 October, the Victorian government announced a reward of £800 for the arrest of the gang; it was soon increased to £2,000. Three days later, the Parliament of Victoria passed the &quot;Felons Apprehension Act&quot;, which came into effect on 1 November. The bushrangers were given until 12 November to surrender. On 15 November, having remained at large, they were officially outlawed. As a result, anyone who encountered them armed, or had a reasonable suspicion that they were armed, could kill them without consequence. The act also penalised anyone who gave &quot;any aid, shelter or sustenance&quot; to the outlaws or withheld information, or gave false information, to the authorities. Punishment was imprisonment with or without hard labour for up to 15 years.

The Victorian act was based on the 1865 &quot;Felons Apprehension Act&quot;, passed by the Parliament of New South Wales to reign in bushrangers such as the Gardiner–Hall gang and Dan Morgan. In response to the Kelly gang, the New South Wales parliament re-enacted their legislation as the &quot;Felons Apprehension Act 1879&quot;.

==Euroa raid==

After the police killings, the gang tried to escape into New South Wales but, due to flooding of the Murray River, were forced to return to north-eastern Victoria. They narrowly avoided the police on several occasions and relied on the support of an extensive network of sympathisers.

In need of funds, the gang decided to rob the bank of Euroa. Byrne reconnoitered the small town on 8 December 1878. Around midday the next day, the gang held up Younghusband Station, outside Euroa. Fourteen male employees and passers-by were taken hostage and held overnight in an outbuilding on the station; female hostages were held in the homestead. A number of hostages were likely sympathisers of the gang and had prior knowledge of the raid.

The following day, Dan guarded the hostages while Ned, Byrne and Hart rode out to cut Euroa&#x27;s telegraph wires. They encountered and held up a hunting party and some railway workers, whom they took back to the station. Ned, Dan and Hart then went into Euroa, leaving Byrne to guard the prisoners.

Around 4 p.m., the three outlaws held up the Euroa branch of the National Bank of Australasia, netting cash and gold worth £2,260 and a small number of documents and securities. Fourteen staff members were taken back to Younghusband Station as hostages. There the gang performed trick riding for the thirty-seven hostages, before leaving at about 8.30 p.m., warning their captives to stay put for three hours or suffer reprisals.

Following the raid, a number of newspapers commented on the efficiency of its execution and compared it with the inefficiency of the police. Several hostages stated that the gang had behaved courteously and without violence during the raid. However, hostages also stated that on several occasions the bushrangers threatened to shoot them and burn buildings containing hostages if there was any resistance.

=== Cameron Letter ===
At Younghusband Station, Byrne wrote two copies of a letter that Kelly had dictated. They were posted on 14 December to Donald Cameron, a Victorian parliamentarian who Kelly mistook as sympathetic to the gang, and Superintendent John Sadleir. In the letter, Kelly gives his version of the Fitzpatrick incident and the Stringybark Creek killings, and describes cases of alleged police corruption and harassment of his family, signing off as &quot;Edward Kelly, enforced outlaw&quot;. He expected Cameron to read it out in parliament, but the government only allowed summaries to be made public. &quot;The Argus&quot; called it the work of &quot;a clever illiterate&quot;. Premier Graham Berry, a vociferous critic of the gang, also found it &quot;very clever&quot;, and alerted railway authorities to an allusion Kelly makes to tearing up tracks. Kelly expanded on much of its content in the Jerilderie Letter of 1879.

==Kelly sympathisers detained==

On 2 January 1879, police obtained warrants for the arrest of 30 presumed Kelly sympathisers, 23 of whom were remanded in custody. Over a third were released within seven weeks due to lack of evidence, but nine sympathisers had their remand renewed on a weekly basis for almost three months, despite the police failing to produce evidence for a committal hearing. In a letter to Acting Chief Secretary Bryan O’Loghlen, Kelly accused the government of &quot;committing a manifest injustice in imprisoning so many innocent people&quot; and threatened reprisals. Police claimed that such threats dissuaded their informants from giving sworn evidence.

On 22 April, police magistrate Foster refused prosecution requests to continue remands and discharged the remaining detainees. Although the police command opposed this decision, by then it was clear that the tactic of detaining sympathisers had not impeded the gang.

Jones argues that the detention strategy swung public sympathy away from the police. Dawson, however, points out that while there was widespread condemnation of the denial of the civil liberties of those detained, this did not necessarily mean support for the outlaws grew.

==Jerilderie raid==

Following the Euroa raid, the reward for Kelly&#x27;s capture increased to £1,000. Fifty-eight police were transferred to north-eastern Victoria, totaling 217 in the district. Around 50 soldiers were also deployed to guard local banks. The gang distributed most proceeds from the raid to family and other sympathisers. Once more in need of funds, they planned to rob the bank at Jerilderie, a town 65 km across the border in New South Wales. A number of sympathisers moved into Jerilderie before the raid to provide undercover support.

On 7 February 1879, the gang crossed the Murray River between Mulwala and Tocumwal and camped overnight in the bush. The following day they visited a hotel about 3 km from Jerilderie, where they drank and chatted with patrons and staff, learning more about the town and its police presence.

In the early hours of 9 February, the gang bailed up the Jerilderie police barracks and secured in the lockup the two constables present, George Devine and Henry Richards. They also held Devine&#x27;s wife and young children hostage overnight. The following afternoon, Byrne and Hart, dressed as police, went out with Richards to familiarise themselves with the town.

At 10 am on 10 February, Ned and Byrne donned police uniforms and took Richards with them into town, leaving Devine in the lockup and warning his wife that they would kill her and her children if she left the barracks. The gang held up the Royal Mail Hotel and, while Dan and Hart controlled the hostages, Ned and Byrne robbed the neighbouring Bank of New South Wales of £2,141 in cash and valuables. Ned also found and burnt deeds, mortgages and securities, saying &quot;the bloody banks are crushing the life&#x27;s blood out of the poor, struggling man&quot;.

With hostages from the bank now detained in the hotel, Byrne held up the post office and smashed its telegraph system while Ned had several hostages cut down telegraph wires. After lecturing the 30 or so hostages on police corruption and the justice system, Ned freed them, except for Richards and two telegraphists, who he had secured in the lockup. Dan and Byrne then left town with the police&#x27;s horses and weapons. Ned stayed a while longer to shout a group of sympathisers at the Albion Hotel. While there, he forced Hart to return a watch he had stolen from priest J. B. Gribble, who also persuaded Ned to leave a racehorse he had taken as it belonged to &quot;a young lady&quot;. After the raid, the gang went into hiding for 17 months.

===Jerilderie Letter===


Prior to arriving in Jerilderie, Kelly composed a lengthy letter with the aim of tracing his path to outlawry, justifying his actions, and outlining the alleged injustices he and his family suffered at the hands of the police. He also implores squatters to share their wealth with the rural poor, invokes a history of Irish rebellion against the English, and threatens to carry out a &quot;colonial stratagem&quot; designed to shock not only Victoria and its police &quot;but also the whole British army&quot;. Dictated to Byrne, the Jerilderie Letter, a handwritten document of fifty-six pages and 7,391 words, was described by Kelly as &quot;a bit of my life&quot;. He tasked Edwin Living, a local bank accountant, with delivering it to the editor of the &quot;Jerilderie and Urana Gazette&quot; for publication. Due to political suppression, only excerpts were published in the press, based on a copy transcribed by John Hanlon, owner of the Eight Mile Hotel in Deniliquin. The letter was rediscovered and published in full in 1930.

According to historian Alex McDermott, &quot;Kelly inserts himself into history, on his own terms, with his own voice. ... We hear the living speaker in a way that no other document in our history achieves&quot;. It has been interpreted as a proto-republican manifesto; one eyewitness to the Jerilderie raid noted that the letter suggested Kelly would &quot;have liked to have been at the head of a hundred followers or so to upset the existing government&quot;. It has also been described as a &quot;murderous, ... maniacal rant&quot;, and &quot;a remarkable insight into Kelly&#x27;s grandiosity&quot;. Noted for its unorthodox grammar, the letter reaches &quot;delirious poetics&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s language being &quot;hyperbolic, allusive, hallucinatory ... full of striking metaphors and images&quot;. His invective and sense of humour are also present; in one well-known passage, he calls the Victorian police &quot;a parcel of big ugly fat-necked wombat headed, big bellied, magpie legged, narrow hipped, splaw-footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords&quot;. The letter closes:

==Reward increase and disappearance==

In response to the Jerilderie raid, the New South Wales government and several banks collectively issued £4,000 for the gang&#x27;s capture, dead or alive, the largest reward offered in the colony since £5,000 was placed on the heads of the outlawed Clarke brothers in 1867. The Victorian government matched the offer for the Kelly gang, bringing the total amount to £8,000, bushranging&#x27;s largest-ever reward.

The Victorian police continued to receive many reports of sightings of the outlaws and information about their activities from their network of informants. Chief Commissioner of Police Frederick Standish and Superintendent Francis Augustus Hare directed operations against the gang from Benalla. Hare organised frequent search parties and surveillance of Kelly sympathisers.
In March 1879, six Queensland native police troopers and a senior constable under the command of sub-Inspector Stanhope O&#x27;Connor were deployed to Benalla to join the hunt for the gang. Although Kelly feared the tracking ability of the Aboriginal troopers, Standish and Hare doubted their value and temporarily withdrew their services.

In May 1879, on the advice of Standish, the Victorian Land Board blacklisted 86 alleged Kelly sympathisers from buying land in the secluded areas of northeastern Victoria. The aim of the policy was to disperse the gang&#x27;s network of sympathisers and disrupt stock theft in the region. Jones and others claim that it caused widespread resentment and hardened support for the outlaws. Morrissey, however, states that although the policy was sometimes used unfairly, it was effective and supported by the majority of the community.
Facing media and parliamentary criticism over the costly and failed gang search, Standish appointed Assistant Commissioner Charles Hope Nicolson as leader of operations at Benalla on 3 July 1879. Standish reduced Nicolson&#x27;s police forces, withdrew most of the soldiers guarding banks, and cut the search budget. Nicolson relied more heavily on targeted surveillance and his network of spies and informers.

After almost a year of unsuccessful efforts to capture the outlaws, Nicolson was replaced by Hare. In June 1880, police informant Daniel Kennedy reported that the gang were planning another raid and had made bullet-proof armour out of agricultural equipment. Hare dismissed the latter as preposterous and sacked Kennedy.

==Glenrowan affair==
===Murder of Aaron Sherritt===
During the Kelly outbreak, police watch parties monitored Byrne&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in the Woolshed Valley near Beechworth. The police used the house of her neighbour, Aaron Sherritt, as a base of operations and kept watch from nearby caves at night. Sherritt, a former Greta Mob member and lifelong friend of Byrne, accepted police payments for camping with the watch parties and for informing on the gang. Detective Michael Ward doubted Sherritt&#x27;s value as an informer, suspecting he lied to the police to protect Byrne.

In March 1879 Byrne&#x27;s mother saw Sherritt with a police watch party and later publicly denounced him as a spy. In the following months, Byrne and Ned sent invitations to Sherritt to join the gang, but when he continued his relationship with the police, the outlaws decided to murder him as a means to launch a grander plot, one that they boasted would &quot;astonish not only the Australian colonies but the whole world&quot;.
On 26 June 1880, Dan and Byrne rode into the Woolshed Valley. That evening, they kidnapped a local gardener, Anton Wick, and took him to Sherritt&#x27;s hut, which was occupied by Sherritt, his pregnant wife Ellen and her mother, and a four-man police watch party.

Byrne forced Wick to knock on the back door and call out for Sherritt. When Sherritt answered the door, Byrne shot him in the throat and chest with a shotgun, killing him. Byrne and Dan then entered the hut while the policemen hid in one of the bedrooms. Byrne overheard them scrambling for their shotguns and demanded that they come out. When they did not respond he fired into the bedroom. He then sent Ellen into the bedroom to bring the police out, but they detained her in the room.

The outlaws left the hut, collected kindling, and loudly threatened to burn alive those inside. They stayed outside for approximately two hours, yelled more threats, then released Wick and rode away.

===Plot to wreck the police train and attack Benalla===

The gang estimated that the policemen at Sherritt&#x27;s would report his murder to Beechworth within a few hours, prompting a police special train to be sent up from Melbourne. They also surmised that the train would collect reinforcements in Benalla before continuing through Glenrowan, a small town in the Warby Ranges. There, the gang planned to derail the train and shoot dead any survivors, then ride to an unpoliced Benalla where they would bomb the railway bridge over the Broken River, thereby isolating the town and giving them time to rob the banks, bomb the police barracks, torch the courthouse, free the gaol&#x27;s prisoners, and generally sow chaos before returning to the bush.

While Byrne and Dan were in the Woolshed Valley, Ned and Hart forced two railway workers camped at Glenrowan to damage the track. The outlaws selected a sharp curve at an incline, where the train would be speeding at 60 mph before derailing into a deep gully. They told their captives they were going to &quot;send the train and its occupants to hell&quot;.

The bushrangers took over the Glenrowan railway station, the stationmaster&#x27;s home and Ann Jones&#x27; Glenrowan Inn, opposite the station. They used the hotel to hold the workers, passers-by, and other men; most of the women and children taken prisoner were held at the stationmaster&#x27;s home. The other hotel in town, McDonnell&#x27;s Railway Hotel, was used to stable the gang&#x27;s stolen horses, one of which carried a keg of blasting powder and fuses. The packhorses also carried helmeted suits of bullet-repelling armour, each made from stolen plough mouldboards and weighing about . Kelly conceived of the armour to protect the outlaws in shootouts with the police and planned to wear it when inspecting the train wreckage for survivors.

===Siege and shootout===

By the afternoon of 27 June, the train still had not arrived, as the policemen in Sherritt&#x27;s hut remained there until morning, for fear that the bushrangers were still outside. The outlaws meanwhile had gathered all sixty-two hostages in the Glenrowan Inn. Amongst them were sympathisers planted by the gang to help control the situation. As the hours passed without sight of the train, the gang plied the hostages with drink and organised music, singing, dancing and games. One hostage later testified, &quot;[Ned] did not treat us badly—not at all&quot;. However, Ned terrorised a young hostage by threatening to shoot him.

Towards evening, Ned let 21 hostages he deemed trustworthy to leave, then captured Glenrowan&#x27;s lone constable, Hugh Bracken, with the assistance of hostage Thomas Curnow, a local schoolmaster who sought to gain the gang&#x27;s trust in order to thwart their plans. Believing that Curnow was a sympathiser, Ned let him and his wife return home, but warned them to &quot;go quietly to bed and not to dream too loud&quot;.
News of Sherritt&#x27;s death finally reached the outside world at midday 27 June, and at 9 pm, a police special train left Melbourne for Beechworth. In addition to its crew and four journalists, the train carried sub-Inspector O&#x27;Connor, his native police unit, wife and sister-in-law. They stopped at Benalla at 1:30 a.m. to take on Superintendent Hare and eight troopers, raising the passenger count to 27. Hare ordered a pilot engine to travel ahead of them as a lookout. One hour later, as the pilot approached Glenrowan, Curnow signalled it to stop and alerted the driver of the danger.

Kelly had decided to free the hostages and was delivering them a final lecture on the police when the train pulled into Glenrowan. The outlaws donned their armour and prepared for a confrontation. Meanwhile, Bracken escaped to the railway station to explain the situation to the police, after which Hare led his troopers towards the hotel. It was just after 3 a.m.

The outlaws lined up in the shadow of the hotel&#x27;s porch and, when the police appeared about away in the moonlight, opened fire. About 150 shots were exchanged in the first volley. Someone shouted that women and children were in the hotel, prompting a ceasefire. Hare was shot through the left wrist and, fainting from blood loss, returned to Benalla for treatment. Ned was wounded in the left hand, left arm and right foot. Byrne was shot in the calf. Two hostages were fatally wounded by police fire into the weatherboard building: thirteen-year-old John Jones and railway worker Martin Cherry. A third hostage, George Metcalf, was also fatally wounded, either by police fire or shot accidentally by Ned.

During the lull in gunfire, a number of hostages, mostly women and children, escaped the hotel. Kelly, bleeding heavily, retreated about 90 m into the bush behind the hotel, where police found his skull cap and rifle at around 3.30 a.m. Kelly was lying in the bush nearby.

Police surrounded the hotel throughout the night, and the firing continued intermittently. At about 5:30 a.m., Byrne was fatally shot while drinking whiskey in the bar, his last words being a toast to the gang. Over the next two hours, police reinforcements under Sergeant Steele and Superintendent Sadleir arrived from Wangaratta and Benalla, bringing the police contingent to about forty.

===Last stand and capture===

Seriously wounded, Kelly lay in the bush for most of the night. At dawn (about 7 a.m.), clad in armour and armed with three handguns, he rose out of the bush and attacked the police from their rear. Police returned fire as Kelly moved from tree to tree towards the hotel, at times staggering from his injuries, the weight of his armour and the impact of bullets on the plate iron, which he later described as &quot;like blows from a man&#x27;s fist&quot;. Due to these factors, Kelly had difficulty aiming, firing and reloading his guns.
Eyewitnesses struggled to identify the figure moving in the dim misty light and, astonished as it withstood bullets, variously called it a ghost, a bunyip, and the devil. Journalist Tom Carrington wrote:
The gun battle with Kelly lasted around 15 minutes with Dan and Hart providing covering fire from the hotel. It ended when Steele brought down Ned with two shotgun blasts to his unprotected legs and thighs. Ned was disarmed and divested of his armour by the police while Dan and Hart continued firing on them. Dan was wounded by return fire, and Ned was carried to the railway station, where a doctor attended to him. He was later found to have twenty-eight wounds, including serious gunshot wounds to his left elbow and right foot, several flesh wounds caused by gunshots, and cuts and abrasions from bullets striking his armour, which showed a total of 18 bullet marks, including five in the helmet.
In the meantime, the siege continued. Around 10 a.m., a ceasefire was called and the remaining thirty hostages left the hotel. They were ordered to lie down as police checked for any outlaws among them. Two of the hostages were arrested for being known Kelly sympathisers.

===Fire and aftermath===
By the afternoon of 28 June, some 600 spectators had gathered at Glenrowan, and Dan and Hart had ceased shooting. Forbidding his men from storming the hotel, Sadleir ordered a cannon from Melbourne to blast out the outlaws, then decided to burn them out instead. At 2.50 p.m, Senior Constable Charles Johnson, under cover of police fire, set the hotel alight.

Passing through the area, Catholic priest Matthew Gibney halted his travels to administer the last rites to Ned, then entered the burning hotel in an attempt to rescue anyone inside. He found the bodies of Byrne, Dan and Hart. The causes of Dan and Hart&#x27;s deaths remain a mystery. Police retrieved Byrne&#x27;s body and rescued the mortally wounded Martin Cherry. After the fire died out at 4 p.m., the police recovered the badly burnt bodies of Dan and Hart.

Others wounded during the shootout were hostages Michael Reardon and his baby sister Bridget (who was grazed by a bullet), and Jimmy, an Aboriginal trooper. Jones&#x27; sister Jane received a head wound from a stray bullet, and two years later died from a lung infection that her mother believed was hastened by the injury.

Following the siege, Kelly was transported to Benalla, where doctors determined that his injuries were non-fatal. Outside the lockup where Kelly was kept, Byrne&#x27;s body was strung up and photographed, with casts taken of his head and limbs for a waxwork, later exhibited in Melbourne. Sympathisers asked for his body, but the police arranged a hasty inquiry and burial in an unmarked grave in Benalla Cemetery. Dan and Hart&#x27;s charred remains were buried by their families in unmarked graves in Greta Cemetery. Kelly recuperated at Melbourne Gaol hospital, and four weeks after his capture, it was arranged that he be transferred to Beechworth for his committal hearing.

==Trial and execution==

Kelly&#x27;s committal hearing took place at Beechworth Court in August 1880, with lawyer-MP David Gaunson as his attorney. He later said he questioned Kelly&#x27;s mental stability and found him ineffective in justifying the shooting of police, especially by likening them to soldiers. According to Alex Castles, Kelly believed a guilty verdict was certain, leading Gaunson to focus on his claim that police persecution drove him to bushranging. He interviewed Kelly about this and paraphrased the transcript for &quot;The Age&quot;. Kelly was committed for trial on charges of murdering constables Lonigan and Scanlan. Initially set for Beechworth, the trial was transferred to the Central Criminal Court in Melbourne, primarily to protect jurors from threats by Kelly sympathisers.

Kelly&#x27;s trial began on 19 October 1880 before judge Sir Redmond Barry, who had sentenced his mother over the Fitzpatrick incident. The novice barrister Henry Bindon appeared for Kelly with Gaunson serving as counsel. The trial was adjourned to 28 October and the prosecution chose to proceed only with Lonigan&#x27;s murder, for which Kelly was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Barry concluded with the customary words, &quot;May God have mercy on your soul&quot;, to which Kelly replied, &quot;I will go a little further than that, and say I will see you there where I go&quot;. Barry was to die of natural causes twelve days after Kelly&#x27;s execution.

On 3 November, the Executive Council of Victoria announced that Kelly was to be hanged on 11 November, at the Melbourne Gaol. In response, thousands turned out at protests in Melbourne demanding a reprieve for Kelly, and a failed petition for clemency attracted over 32,000 signatures. The press was uniformly scathing: one journalist called the protests &quot;inflammatory, seditious and plainly useless&quot;; another, having noted the number of protesters, warned that Victoria was trending towards &quot;a socialistic revolt of class against class&quot;. Police reinforcements were mobilised to guard the gaol and other government buildings in Melbourne in case of a mob attack.
The day before his execution, Kelly had his photographic portrait taken as a keepsake for his family, and he was granted farewell meetings with relatives. One newspaper reported that his mother&#x27;s last words to him were, &quot;Mind you die like a Kelly&quot;, but Jones and Castles have questioned this.

The following morning, Kelly prayed and, when passing the gaol&#x27;s garden on the way to the gallows, commented on the beauty of the flowers, but said little else. He was hanged at 10 a.m. His last words were variously reported as &quot;Such is life&quot; or &quot;Ah, well, I suppose it has come to this&quot;, though the latter may have been an interpretation rather than a direct quote. According to another account, Kelly intended to make a speech, but &quot;made no audible sound&quot;. A policeman present later said that, just before the cap was drawn over his head, Kelly glanced up at the skylight and muttered something indiscernible.

==Royal Commission and aftermath==

In March 1881, the Victorian government approved a royal commission into the conduct of the Victorian police during the Kelly outbreak. Over the next six months, the commission, chaired by Francis Longmore, held sixty-six meetings, examined sixty-two witnesses and visited towns throughout &quot;Kelly Country&quot;. While its report found that the police had acted properly in relation to the criminality of the Kellys, it exposed widespread corruption and ended a number of police careers, including that of Chief Commissioner Standish. Numerous other officers, including senior staff, were reprimanded, demoted or suspended. It concluded with a list of thirty-six recommendations for reform. Kelly hoped that his death would lead to an investigation into police conduct, and although the report did not exonerate him or his gang, its findings were said to strip the authorities &quot;of what scanty rags of reputation the Kellys had left them.&quot;

The £8,000 reward money was divided among various claimants with £6,000 going to members of the Victorian police, Superintendent Hare receiving the lion&#x27;s share of £800. After Curnow complained about his payout of £550, it was increased to £1,000. Seven Aboriginal trackers were each awarded £50, but the Victorian and Queensland governments kept the money under the pretext that &quot;It would not be desirable to place any considerable sum of money in the hands of persons unable to use it.&quot;

There was widespread speculation that Kelly&#x27;s execution would lead to further outbreaks of violence in north-eastern Victoria. Jones and Dawson argue that changes in policing methods reduced this threat. The police no longer pursued a policy of dispersing Kelly sympathisers by denying them land in the district, and assured them that they would be treated fairly if they kept the peace. During the royal commission there were threats of violence and intimidation against people who had assisted the police. Nevertheless, the police reported a reduction in stock theft and crime in general in north-eastern Victoria following Kelly&#x27;s death.

Kelly&#x27;s mother was released from prison in February 1881. Jones states that she met with Greta police constable Robert Graham soon after, and they reached an understanding which helped reduce tension in the community.

==Remains and graves==

Kelly was buried at the Old Melbourne Gaol in what was known as the &quot;old men&#x27;s yard&quot;. In May 1881, reports emerged that Kelly&#x27;s body had been illegally dissected by medical students for study. Public outrage at the rumour raised concerns of civil unrest, leading the gaol&#x27;s governor to deny that it had occurred.

In 1929, the Old Melbourne Gaol was closed for demolition works, during which the remains of felons were uncovered. Before being reinterred in a mass grave at Pentridge Prison, skeletal parts were looted by workers and spectators from a number of graves, including one marked with the initials &quot;E.K.&quot;, situated apart from the rest on the opposite side of the yard. The skull from this grave was handed over to the police and stored at the Victorian Penal Department, then sent to the Australian Institute of Anatomy, Canberra in 1934. It went missing but was later found in a safe. From 1972 the skull was exhibited at the Old Melbourne Gaol until it was stolen on 12 December 1978.

On 9 March 2008, archaeologists announced they believed they had found Kelly&#x27;s burial site at Pentridge Prison, among the remains of 32 executed felons. In 2009, the skull that was stolen in 1978 was handed over for forensic testing along with the Pentridge remains. After conducting several tests in 2010–11, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine concluded the skull was not Kelly&#x27;s. Kelly&#x27;s skeleton was identified among the Pentridge remains through DNA analysis and comparisons to bullet wounds he received at Glenrowan. Most of the skull is missing, with what remains of the occipital bone showing cuts consistent with dissection.

In 2012, the Victorian government approved the handover of Kelly&#x27;s bones to his family, who made plans for his final burial and also appealed for the return of his skull. On 20 January 2013, following a Requiem Mass at St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church, Wangaratta, Kelly&#x27;s final wish was granted as his remains were buried in consecrated ground at Greta Cemetery, near his mother&#x27;s unmarked grave. It was encased in concrete to prevent looting.

Kelly&#x27;s original headstone, along with those of other felons executed at the Old Melbourne Gaol, was repurposed during the Great Depression to construct bluestone walls protecting Melbourne beaches from erosion.

===Kelly myth===

The myth surrounding Kelly pervades Australian culture, and he is one of Australia&#x27;s most recognised national symbols. Academic and folklorist Graham Seal writes:

Seal argues that Kelly&#x27;s story taps into the Robin Hood tradition of the outlaw hero and the myth of the Australian bush as a place of freedom from oppressive authority. For many admirers of Kelly, he embodies characteristics thought to be typically Australian such as defying authority, siding with the underdog and fighting bravely for one&#x27;s beliefs. This view was already evident in the aftermath of his death. Reviewing an 1881 performance of the Kelly gang play &quot;Ostracised&quot;, staged at Melbourne&#x27;s Princess Theatre, &quot;The Australasian&quot; wrote:
According to Jones, after Kelly&#x27;s death, &quot;a Robin Hood-like figure survived: good-looking, brave, a fine horseman and bushman and a crack shot, devoted to his mother and sisters, a man who treated all women with courtesy, who stole from the rich to give to the poor, who dressed himself in his enemy&#x27;s uniform to outwit him. Most of all a man who stood against the police persecutors of his family and was driven to outlawry when he defended his sister against a drunken constable. Such was Ned Kelly the myth&quot;. Superintendent Hare wrote that Kelly &quot;always posed as a friend of the working-man&quot;. Seale argues that the gang&#x27;s raids were partly public performances where they sought to live up to the romantic image of the bushranger-hero.

By the time Kelly was outlawed, bushranging was an anachronism. Australia was highly urbanised, the telegraph and the railway were rapidly connecting the bush to the city, and Kelly was already an icon for a romanticised past. Macintyre states that Kelly turning agricultural equipment into armour was an irresistible symbol of a passing era. For Seal, the failure of the gang to derail the train at Glenrowan was a symbol of the triumph of modern civilisation. The national image of Kelly, he writes, may bear &quot;about the same resemblance&quot; to the man as his armour does &quot;to the plough mouldboards from which it was beaten&quot;. He concludes:

===Cultural impact===
The siege at Glenrowan became a national and international media event, and reports of the armour sparked widespread fascination, cementing Kelly and his gang&#x27;s lasting infamy. Songs, poems, popular entertainments, fiction, books, and newspaper and magazine articles about the Kelly gang proliferated in the decades that followed, and by 1943 Kelly was the subject of 42 major published works.

Within eight weeks of the Stringybark Creek killings, a play about the gang, &quot;Vultures of the Wombat Ranges&quot;, was being staged in Melbourne. The farce &quot;Catching the Kellys&quot; debuted the following year. By 1900, Kelly gang plays were &quot;appearing all over the continent in a remarkably successful exploitation of popular myth&quot;. Later plays include Douglas Stewart&#x27;s 1942 verse drama &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;.

The first ballads about the Kelly gang appeared in 1878 and it quickly became a popular genre and form of social protest, despite colonial governments banning public performances. In 1939, country singer Tex Morton recorded a song about Kelly, and artists including Slim Dusty, Smoky Dawson and Midnight Oil followed. Non-Australian artists who have recorded songs about Kelly include Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash.

Robert Drewe&#x27;s novel &quot;Our Sunshine&quot; (1991) is a fictionalised account of the Glenrowan siege. Peter Carey won the 2001 Booker Prize for his novel &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot;, written from Kelly&#x27;s perspective and in emulation of his voice in the Jerilderie Letter. The Ned Kelly Awards are Australia&#x27;s premier prizes for crime fiction and true crime writing.

Kelly has figured prominently in Australian cinema since the 1906 release of &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot;, the world&#x27;s first dramatic feature-length film. Among those who have portrayed him on screen are Australian rules football player Bob Chitty (&quot;The Glenrowan Affair&quot;, 1951), rock musician Mick Jagger (&quot;Ned Kelly&quot;, 1970) and Heath Ledger (&quot;Ned Kelly&quot;, 2003). A comic film, &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot; (1993), drew on the Kelly legend.

In the visual arts, Sidney Nolan&#x27;s 1946–47 Kelly series is considered &quot;one of the greatest sequences of Australian painting of the twentieth century&quot;. His stylised depiction of Kelly&#x27;s helmet has become an iconic Australian image. Hundreds of performers dressed as &quot;Nolanesque Kellys&quot; starred in the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

The term &quot;Kelly tourism&quot; describes towns such as Glenrowan which sustain themselves economically &quot;almost entirely through Ned&#x27;s memory&quot;, while &quot;Kellyana&quot; refers to Kelly-themed memorabilia, merchandise, and other paraphernalia. The phrase &quot;&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s probably apocryphal final words, has become &quot;as much a part of the Kelly mythology as the famous armour&quot;. &quot;&quot; is an expression for bravery, and the term &quot;Ned Kelly beard&quot; describes a trend in &quot;hipster&quot; fashion. The rural districts of north-eastern Victoria are collectively known as &quot;Kelly Country&quot;.

===Controversy over political legacy===

In &quot;Bandits&quot; (1969), Eric Hobsbawm argues that Kelly was a social bandit, a type of peasant outlaw and symbol of social rebellion with significant community support. Expanding on this thesis, McQuilton argues that the Kelly outbreak should be seen in the context of increased poverty in north-eastern Victoria in the 1870s and a conflict over land between selectors (mostly small-scale farmers) and squatters (mostly wealthier pastoralists with more political influence). Jones, Molony, McQuilton and others argue that Kelly was a political rebel with considerable support among local selectors. Jones claims that Kelly intended to derail the train at Glenrowan to incite a rebellion of disaffected selectors and declare a &quot;Republic of North-eastern Victoria&quot;. For Jones, a republic is foreshadowed in the Jerilderie Letter and Kelly&#x27;s references to north-eastern Victoria as &quot;our country&quot;, where politicians should not interfere.

Morrissey argues that McQuilton and Jones have overstated both the economic distress and the level of support for Kelly among selectors. As for the alleged republican declaration or plan for a political rebellion, Dawson writes that no such document or intention appears in any records, interviews, memoirs or accounts from those connected to the gang or early historians. According to Mark McKenna, Kelly&#x27;s rhetoric in the Jerilderie Letter &quot;may fit the mould of the stereotypical Republican hero&quot;, but it remains &quot;simplistic&quot; and &quot;shallow&quot;. While Kelly often complained of oppression by the police and squatters, rejected the legitimacy of the Victorian government and British monarchy, and evoked Irish nationalist grievances against what he called &quot;the tyrannism of the English yoke&quot;, his response manifested as a violent reckoning rather than a clear political program. &quot;It is true that in the Jerilderie Letter Kelly is envisaging a new order of things in his part of the world&quot;, writes Morrissey. &quot;Whether it should be called a republic is debateable&quot;.

Seal states that in the Jerilderie Letter, Kelly advocates &quot;a rebalancing of the social and economic system of the region&quot;: squatter profits will be redistributed to the poor, who, in turn, will form a community guard, rendering the police unnecessary. Morrissey, however, sees the social justice element of the letter as a traditional call for the rich to help the poor, and argues that Kelly&#x27;s vision for society is driven by personal vengeance and a desire to consolidate his power through violence and terror.

Communist activist Ted Hill states that in the decades after Kelly&#x27;s execution, his legacy became linked with a &quot;democratic rebellious spirit&quot; that influenced both the working class and leftist intellectuals. More recently, some far-right groups have co-opted Kelly&#x27;s image to promote their version of a &quot;white Australia&quot;. Kelly has often been characterised by the press as a terrorist, particularly in his day and during the war on terror.

<doc id="157461" wikidata="Q1975172" url="?curid=157461" title="Rolf Harris">
<text>Rolf Harris (30 March 1930 – 10 May 2023) was an Australian musician, television personality, painter, and actor. He often used unusual instruments like the didgeridoo and the Stylophone in his performances, and is credited with the invention of the wobble board. He was convicted in England in 2014 of the sexual assault of four underage girls, which effectively ended his career.

Harris began his entertainment career in 1953, releasing several songs, including &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; (a Top 10 hit in Australia, the UK and the United States), &quot;Sun Arise&quot;, &quot;Jake the Peg&quot; and &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;, which reached number 1 in the UK. From the 1960s, Harris was a successful television personality in the UK, later presenting shows such as &quot;Rolf&#x27;s Cartoon Club&quot; and &quot;Animal Hospital&quot;. In 1985, he hosted the short educational film &quot;Kids Can Say No!&quot;, which warned children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be sexually abused, how to escape such situations and how to get help if they are abused. In 2005, he painted an official portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

After the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, Harris was arrested as part of the Operation Yewtree police investigation regarding historical allegations of sexual offences in 2013. Harris denied any wrongdoing and was placed on trial in 2014. In July 2014, Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison after being convicted on twelve counts of indecent assault on four female victims, who were between the ages of eight and nineteen at the time that the offences took place between the 1960s and 1980s. Following his conviction, he was stripped of many of his honours and re-runs of his television programmes were pulled from syndication. 

He was released on licence in 2017 after serving nearly three years at HM Prison Stafford. The conviction involving an eight-year-old girl in Portsmouth was overturned as unsafe in 2017. He applied for permission to appeal against his convictions concerning the three other girls, but this was refused.

==Early life==

Harris was born on 30 March 1930 in Bassendean, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, to Agnes Margaret (née Robbins) and Cromwell (&quot;Crom&quot;) Harris, who had both emigrated from Cardiff, Wales. He grew up in Wembley, Perth. He was named after Rolf Boldrewood, the pseudonym of an Australian writer whom his mother admired. After his later fame, Harris was often referred to within Australia as &quot;the boy from Bassendean&quot;. As a child he owned a dog called Buster Fleabags, about whom he later wrote a book (for the UK Quick Reads Initiative).

Harris attended Bassendean State School and Perth Modern School in Subiaco, later gaining a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Western Australia and a Diploma of Education from Claremont Teachers&#x27; College (now Edith Cowan University). While he was just 16, and still a student at Perth Modern School, his self-portrait in oils was one of the 80 works (out of 200 submitted) accepted to be hung in the Art Gallery of New South Wales as an entry in the 1947 Archibald Prize. He painted a portrait of the then Lieutenant Governor of Western Australia, Sir James Mitchell, for the 1948 Archibald Prize. He won the 1949 Claude Hotchin prize for oil colours with his landscape &quot;On a May Morning, Guildford&quot;.

As an adolescent and young adult Harris was a champion swimmer. In 1946, he was the Australian Junior Backstroke Champion. He was also the Western Australian state champion over a variety of distances and strokes during the period from 1948 to 1952.

==Career in television, music, and art==
===1950s===
Harris moved to England in 1952 and became an art student at City and Guilds of London Art School in South London, aged 22. In 1953 he found work in television, at the BBC, performing a regular ten-minute cartoon drawing section in a one-hour children&#x27;s show called &quot;Jigsaw&quot;, with a puppet called &quot;Fuzz&quot;, made and operated on the show by magician Robert Harbin. He went on to illustrate &quot;Paper Magic&quot;, Harbin&#x27;s first book on origami, in 1956. In 1954, Harris was a regular on BBC Television programme &quot;Whirligig&quot;, which featured a character called &quot;Willoughby&quot;, who sprang to life on a drawing board, but was erased at the end of each episode.

By this stage, Harris had drifted away from art school as a slightly disillusioned student. He then met his longtime hero, Australian impressionist painter Hayward Veal (1913–1968), who became his mentor, teaching him the rudiments of impressionism and showing him how it could help with his portrait painting. At the time that he was working with Veal, Harris was also entertaining with his piano accordion every Thursday night at a club called the Down Under, frequented by Australians and New Zealanders. At the Down Under venue Harris honed his entertainment skills over several years, eventually writing what later became his theme song, &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot;.

Although Harris chiefly appeared on the BBC, he was also on the British ITV network, and when commercial television started in 1955, he was the only entertainer to work with both the BBC and ITV. He performed on the BBC with his own creation, Willoughby, a specially made board on which he drew Willoughby (voiced and operated by Peter Hawkins). The character would then come to life to engage in a comedic dialogue with Harris as he drew cartoons of Willoughby&#x27;s antics. On Associated Rediffusion&#x27;s &quot;Small Time&quot;, Harris invented a character called Oliver Polip the Octopus, which he drew on the back of his hand and animated. Harris then illustrated the character&#x27;s adventures with cartoons on huge sheets of card.

Harris returned to Perth in Australia when television was introduced there in 1959 after he was headhunted. He subsequently produced and starred in five episodes of a half-hour weekly children&#x27;s show, as well as his own weekly evening variety show. From 1959, he worked on TVW-7&#x27;s first locally produced show, &quot;Spotlight&quot;, and during this time he recorded &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; on a single microphone placed above him in the television studio.

The song was sent to EMI in Sydney, and was released shortly afterwards as a record, becoming both his first recording and his first number one single. The song was successful in the UK. Harris offered four local backing musicians to split 10% of the royalties from the song, but they decided to take a recording fee of £7 each (), because they did not think the song would be successful. The novelty song was originally titled &quot;Kangalypso&quot; and featured the distinctive sound of the &quot;wobble board&quot;.

The fourth verse – &quot;Let me abos go loose, Lou/Let me abos go loose/They&#x27;re of no further use, Lou/So let me abos go loose&quot; – became increasingly controversial, because of the use of what later became regarded as a racial slur, and was removed in later versions of the song. In 2006, four decades after the song&#x27;s release, Harris expressed his regret about the original lyric.

===1960s to 1980s===
At the end of 1960, he toured Australia sponsored by Dulux paints and singing his hit song whilst doing huge paintings on stage with Dulux emulsion paint. While painting on stage, one of his catchphrases was, &quot;Can you tell what it is yet?&quot; After Harris and his wife returned to England, they visited Perth to meet family and for tours of Australia, where he spent around four months travelling with his band.

After returning to the UK in 1962, he was introduced to George Martin, who re-recorded all of his songs the following year, including a remake of &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; which became a huge hit in the US, and &quot;Sun Arise&quot;, an Aboriginal-inspired song Harris had written with Perth naturalist Harry Butler. The song reached number two in the UK charts. Harris met and worked with the Beatles after they started recording with Martin, and he their 16-night season of Christmas shows at London&#x27;s Finsbury Park Astoria Theatre (now the Rainbow Theatre) in 1963. Harris sang &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot;, with the Beatles singing backing vocals, for the first edition of the &quot;From Us to You&quot; BBC radio show in December 1963. Harris changed the original lyrics to create a version that was specially written for the Beatles.

Harris was the presenter of &quot;Hi There&quot; and &quot;Hey Presto it&#x27;s Rolf&quot; in 1964. By the time &quot;The Rolf Harris Show&quot; was broadcast in 1967, lasting until 1974, on BBC1, he had gained a high profile on British television. He was the commentator for the United Kingdom in the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest.

Harris created one of his best known characters in the 1960s, Jake the Peg, but his biggest success in terms of record sales was in 1969, with his rendering of the American Civil War song &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;, originally written in 1902. Harris later discovered a personal poignancy to the song, as the story bears such a resemblance to the World War I experiences of his father Crom, and Crom&#x27;s beloved younger brother Carl, who died aged 19 after being wounded in battle in France two weeks before the Armistice of November 1918. &quot;Two Little Boys&quot; was the Christmas Number One song in the UK charts for six weeks in 1969. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, his BBC TV programmes remained a light-entertainment staple, with the last show, &quot;Rolf on Saturday OK?&quot;, broadcast on Saturday evenings. On many of his television appearances, Harris painted pictures on large boards in an apparently slapdash manner, with the odd nonsense song thrown in, asking &quot;Can you tell what is it yet?&quot; as he painted. Only at the end of the song would a fully formed picture emerge, sometimes only after the board was turned through 90 or 180 degrees. Such appearances led to several television series based on his artistic ability, such as &quot;Rolf&#x27;s Cartoon Time&quot;, broadcast on BBC One from 1979 to 1989, and &quot;Rolf&#x27;s Cartoon Club&quot;, on CITV between 1989 and 1993. In the early 1980s, he starred in his own weekly Australian television series, The Rolf Harris Show, produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The series featured numerous guests, including regulars such as Jane Scali. During the show Harris would also paint Australian bush scenes.

Harris was the subject of episodes of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1971 and 1995. In 1973, Harris performed the first concert in the Concert Hall of the newly completed Sydney Opera House. In 1974, he released the single &quot;Papillon&quot; on EMI. He played the didgeridoo on two albums by English pop singer Kate Bush, entitled &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1982) and &quot;Aerial&quot; (2005); he also contributed vocals to the songs &quot;An Architect&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Painter&#x27;s Link&quot; on &quot;Aerial&quot;.

In 1985, Harris presented a twenty-minute child abuse prevention video called &quot;Kids Can Say No!&quot;

===Later career===
In the late 1980s, Harris was touring in Australia and was asked to sing his own version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; for the television programme &quot;The Money or the Gun&quot; performing with his own small group; a version was released as a single in the UK in February 1993. This cover version reached number seven in the charts, which led to his appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in 1993. Harris appeared at six subsequent Glastonbury festivals—1998, 2000, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2013—and a wobble board Harris used to perform &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; is an exhibit at the National Museum of Australia. In 2000, Harris, along with Steve Lima, released a dance track called &quot;Fine Day&quot;, which entered the &quot;top 30&quot; in the UK charts at that time. A &quot;Killie-themed&quot; version of the song was scheduled for release in March 2007, to coincide with the Scottish football club Kilmarnock&#x27;s appearance in the Scottish League Cup final after the song was adopted by the club&#x27;s fans in 2003. One of the adapted lyrics referred to a hypothetical situation, in which Kilmarnock could be losing the match 5–0, and the club coincidentally lost 5–1. Harris performed &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; in 2000 with the Australian children&#x27;s group the Wiggles; he was subsequently digitally removed from DVD releases after his conviction.

From 1994 to 2003, Harris was the host of the reality television programme &quot;Animal Hospital&quot;, a chronicle of a British veterinary practice. During his time hosting the series, he adopted an abandoned English Bull Terrier from the practice named &quot;Dolly&quot;. Harris presented 19 series of &quot;Animal Hospital&quot; for BBC One and the show won the &quot;Most Popular Factual Entertainment Show&quot; award at the National TV Awards on five occasions. Harris eventually announced that it was &quot;time to move on&quot; at the completion of the series, which broke &quot;the hearts of thousands of fans across the country&quot;, according to the &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

In 2001 and 2004, Harris presented &quot;Rolf on Art&quot;, a television series that highlighted the work of a selection of his favourite artists, including van Gogh, Degas, Monet and Gauguin. In November and December 2002, under the direction of Charles Saumarez Smith, London&#x27;s National Gallery exhibited a collection of Harris&#x27;s art.

On 26 September 2004, Harris oversaw a project to recreate John Constable&#x27;s &quot;The Hay Wain&quot; painting on a large scale, with 150 people each contributing a small section. On live BBC television, each individual canvas was assembled into the full picture as part of the episode &quot;Rolf on Art: The Big Event&quot;. Also in 2004, as a part of the &quot;Rolf on Art&quot; series, Harris travelled to Lapland to design and paint a Christmas card for the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity organisation.

Harris presented three series of the BBC art programme &quot;Star Portraits with Rolf Harris&quot;, with the first and second series airing in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Following the first series, a touring exhibition—featuring portraits of Cilla Black, Michael Parkinson and Adrian Edmondson—was organised with County Hall Gallery. In 2001, Harris had said he always imagined he would eventually become a portrait painter as his grandfather, George Frederick Harris, had been.

Harris was commissioned to paint a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II for her 80th birthday. The painting was conducted at Buckingham Palace and was unveiled there by Harris on 19 December 2005. The painting also became the subject of a special episode of &quot;Rolf on Art&quot;. Harris explained to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; the following year: &quot;I was as nervous as anything. I was in a panic&quot;. The portrait was later voted as the second most-favoured portrait of the Queen by the British public.

In September 2006, the Royal Australian Mint launched the first of the new 2007 Silver Kangaroo Collector&#x27;s Coin series and Harris was commissioned to design the first coin of the series. In January 2007, a one-hour documentary titled &quot;A Lifetime in Paint&quot;, about Harris&#x27;s work as an artist—from his early years in Australia to the present day—was screened on BBC One.

In 2007, Harris participated in the BBC Wales programme &quot;Coming Home&quot;, in which he discussed his Welsh family history. In December 2007 a new DVD, titled &quot;Rolf Live!&quot;, was released through his website, while &quot;Rolf on Art: Beatrix Potter&quot; was screened on BBC One during the same month. Harris appeared with a wobble board in a Churchill Insurance advertisement in 2009, and hosted the satirical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in May 2009.
Harris was narrator of the 2010 Australian documentary series &quot;Penguin Island&quot;, a six-part natural history documentary about the life of the little penguin. From September 2010 to October 2010, he took part in &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Dream School&quot;, teaching art to a class of 20 students, followed by an appearance as himself on the Christmas special of &quot;My Family&quot;, which aired on 24 December 2010.

Harris performed on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival on 25 June 2010, during the festival&#x27;s 40th birthday, followed by an appearance at the Bestival Festival on the Isle of Wight in September 2010. On 5 August 2011, Harris played at Wickham Festival in Wickham, Hampshire, and also appeared on the Wiggles&#x27; 2011 DVD release &quot;Ukulele Baby&quot;, singing and performing the song &quot;Good Ship Fabulous Flea&quot; with his wobble board. In 2011 Harris made a guest appearance on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Magicians&quot;, hosted by Lenny Henry. On 5 November 2011, Harris appeared in an episode of &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, in which he wept as he spoke about a period in which he felt his &quot;life was over&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to do with myself. I didn&#x27;t know what to think. I now know what people mean when they say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got clinical depression.&#x27; I&#x27;d never felt so low. There&#x27;s no way to come out of the blackness. I felt out of control&quot;. Harris also stated that he regrets missing so much of his daughter&#x27;s childhood.

In December 2011, Harris&#x27;s portrait of Bonnie Tyler was valued at an estimated £50,000 on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Antiques Roadshow&quot;. From 19 May to 12 August 2012, a major retrospective of Harris&#x27;s paintings, titled &quot;Rolf Harris: Can You Tell What It Is Yet?&quot;, was exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. The opening day yielded the busiest Saturday on record, with visitor figures peaking at 3,632.

On 2 May 2012, Harris appeared on &quot;The One Show&quot;, in which he described his artistic style as being &quot;impressionistic&quot;. On 4 June 2012, he performed at the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace.

In October 2012, Harris started presenting a series on Channel 5, based at Liverpool University&#x27;s Veterinary School, called &quot;Rolf&#x27;s Animal Clinic&quot;. At the time of his arrest by British police on suspicion of sexual offences, the show was broadcasting a repeat run and was consequently ceased without any details of its future. In 2013, Channel 5 replaced Harris with former BBC host Ben Fogle and recommissioned the show under the title &#x27;Ben Fogle&#x27;s Animal Clinic&#x27;.

===Musical recordings and experimentation===
Harris released 30 studio albums, two live albums and 48 singles. In 1960 his single &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; reached number 1 in Australia, and in 1969 &quot;Two Little Boys&quot; reached number 1 on both the Irish and UK charts. His 1992 &quot;Rolf Rules OK?&quot; album was nominated for the ARIA Music Award for Best Comedy Release.

Harris is credited with inventing a simple homemade instrument called the wobble board. As well as his beatboxing, similar to eefing, Harris went on to use an array of unusual instruments in his music, including the didgeridoo (the sound of which was imitated on &quot;Sun Arise&quot; by four double basses), the Jew&#x27;s harp and later, the Stylophone (for which he also lent his name and likeness for advertising).

His version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, featuring didgeridoo and wobble board, reached the UK top ten in 1993. Harris also recorded a version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and performed the Divinyls&#x27; &quot;I Touch Myself&quot;, accompanied only by his wobble board, for &quot;Denton&#x27;s Musical Challenge&quot; on Triple M Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Denton Breakfast Show&quot; (the recording was released on the first Musical Challenge compilation album in 2000). Harris also recorded an Australian Christmas song called &quot;Six White Boomers&quot;, about a joey kangaroo trying to find his mother during the Christmas period. The song describes how Santa Claus used six large male kangaroos (&quot;boomers&quot;), instead of reindeer. In October 2008 Harris announced he would re-record his popular 1969 song &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;, backed by North Wales&#x27; Froncysyllte Male Voice Choir, to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I. Proceeds from the release were donated to the Poppy Appeal. Harris was inspired to make the recording after participating in &quot;My Family at War&quot;, a short series of programmes that aired during the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance&quot; season, broadcast in November 2008. He discovered that the experiences of his father and uncle during the Great War mirrored the lyrics of the song.

==Sexual offences==
In March 2013, Harris was one of twelve people arrested in England during Operation Yewtree, for questioning regarding historical allegations of sexual offences. The allegations were not linked to the sexual misconduct revelations surrounding Jimmy Savile, who died in 2011, and Harris denied any wrongdoing. He was bailed without charge, did not comment publicly on the allegations, and was understood to have denied them strongly. When returning to the stage in May 2013 for the first time since his arrest, he thanked the audience for their support.

===Charges===
In August 2013, Harris was again arrested by Operation Yewtree officers and charged with nine counts of indecent assault dating to the 1980s, involving two girls between 14 and 16 years old, and four counts alleging production of indecent child images in 2012. The Crown Prosecution Service&#x27;s Alison Saunders explained to the media:
Having completed our review, we have concluded there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Harris to be charged ... The decision has been taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors and the Director of Public Prosecutions&#x27;s interim guidelines on prosecuting cases of child sexual abuse. We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.

Harris appeared at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on 23 September 2013, charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four counts of making indecent images of children. His lawyer indicated that Harris would plead not guilty and he was subsequently bailed. In December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Harris was facing three further counts of sexual assault. The CPS said that the new charges were of alleged assault against females aged nineteen in 1984, aged seven or eight in 1968 or 1969, and aged fourteen in 1975. At a further hearing at Southwark Crown Court on 14 January 2014, Harris pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.

The four counts of making indecent images were related to the Protection of Children Act 1978, which interprets viewing images on a computer as making images. The charges were brought after detectives examined Harris&#x27;s computer and found 33 images of possibly underage models among thousands of adult pornographic images. Harris never entered a plea on the charges, as his lawyers argued successfully that the charges should be severed from the 12 sexual assault charges and tried separately. In the aftermath of Harris&#x27;s conviction, it was reported that his legal team had obtained the identity documents of the models involved, confirming they were adults over 18. The websites Harris had visited, according to the Internet Watch Foundation, are not known for illegal images of children. The prosecution informed the court that they would not be proceeding with the indecent images charges.

===Trial===
The trial of Harris began on 6 May 2014 at Southwark Crown Court. Seven of the twelve charges involved allegations of a sexual relationship between Harris and one of his daughter&#x27;s friends. Six charges related to when she was between the ages of 13 and 15, and one when she was 19. Harris denied that he had entered into a sexual relationship with the girl until she was 18. During the trial, a letter Harris had written to the girl&#x27;s father in 1997 after the end of the relationship was shown in court, saying: &quot;I fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed from a feeling of love and friendship—there was no rape, no physical forcing, brutality or beating that took place.&quot;

Three charges related to the assault of a 15-year-old Australian girl visiting the UK in 1986. One charge was that he sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl who asked for his autograph at a community centre in Hampshire in 1968 or 1969. When questioned by police about this allegation, Harris replied &quot;I would simply never touch a child inappropriately.&quot; Harris was also accused of groping the bottom of a 14-year-old girl at a celebrity &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; event in Cambridge in 1975. He denied that he had visited Cambridge until four years before the trial, but television archive material was produced in court showing that he had taken part in an episode of the ITV show &quot;Star Games&quot;, which had been filmed in Cambridge in 1978. Harris denied that he had told a deliberate lie and said that his failure to remember the show was &quot;a lapse of memory.&quot; Additional witnesses who claimed to have been assaulted in Malta, New Zealand, and Australia were called to testify against Harris, although these charges could not be pursued in the British courts.

===Conviction and imprisonment===
After several delays in the trial, in which the judge&#x27;s summing-up took three days, the jury retired to consider its verdict on 19 June 2014. On 30 June, Harris was found guilty of all 12 counts of indecent assault.

At Southwark Crown Court on 4 July 2014, Mr Justice Sweeney sentenced Harris to a total of five years and nine months in prison. When passing sentence, the judge said to Harris: &quot;You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.&quot; Some sentences were expected to run consecutively, and Harris was expected to serve half of his sentence in prison. He was told to pay prosecution costs, though not compensation to the victims. The sentence was referred to the Attorney General Dominic Grieve after complaints that it was too lenient. On 30 July 2014, the new Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, announced that he would not be referring the sentence to the Court of Appeal for review &quot;as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending.&quot;

On 1 August 2014, the Judicial Office said that Harris had applied to appeal against his conviction and that his lawyers had lodged papers at the Court of Appeal. In October 2014, Harris was refused permission to appeal, and could apply again before three judges. Harris did not lodge an appeal within the required 28 days, or ask for an extension.

Following his conviction, it was reported in July 2014, October 2014 and February 2015 that he was being investigated by police over other alleged sexual offences.

On 14 June 2015, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; published a letter, claimed to have been written by Harris in prison and sent to one of his friends. It contained song lyrics that were highly abusive towards his female accusers. Harris was accused by Liz Dux, lawyer for the women who gave evidence, of victim blaming. In response to the lyrics one of the victims said, &quot;What he did was damage young women&#x27;s self-worth, their confidence and for some of those women, he affected them deeply for the rest of their lives.&quot; The publication of the letter led Dux to question whether Harris should get parole:

In 2014, Vanessa Feltz alleged that Harris sexually assaulted her while she interviewed him live on the bed during an edition of Channel 4 morning programme &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, and Linda Nolan alleged that he groped her in 1975, when she was 15, when the Nolan Sisters were his support act in South Africa.
Harris served his sentence at HM Prison Stafford, which is specifically for men convicted of sex offences. He was released on 19 May 2017, after serving three years of his sentence.

===Further charges===
On 12 February 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Harris would face seven further indecent assault charges. The offences allegedly occurred between 1971 and 2004 and involve seven complainants who were aged between 12 and 27 at the time. Harris pleaded not guilty to all of the charges via videolink at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on 17 March and was told to appear at Southwark Crown Court on 14 April. On 14 April, he pleaded not guilty to seven charges of indecent assault and one charge of sexual assault.

Harris&#x27;s trial began on 9 January 2017, with him appearing and watching by videolink from Stafford Prison. Harris did not have to attend in person because of his age and poor health. The prosecution started its case on 11 January; the allegations involved unwanted groping. Unlike at the previous trial, Harris did not give any evidence. His defence said that the jury in the first trial &quot;got it wrong&quot; and that the ensuing media frenzy &quot;made him vulnerable to people making accusations against him&quot;. On 8 February, Harris was acquitted of three charges. Judge Alistair McCreath discharged the jury from deliberating on the further four counts of which he was accused.

The prosecution team asked for one week to decide if it would apply for a retrial. On 15 February, it was announced he would face a retrial for three offences, and one new charge (to which he pleaded not guilty). His retrial began on 15 May. On 30 May, the jury were unable to reach verdicts and the prosecution announced that they would not pursue another retrial.

===One conviction overturned===
On 16 November 2017, Harris&#x27;s conviction on the charge that he had indecently assaulted an eight-year-old girl at a community centre in Portsmouth in 1969 was overturned on the grounds that it was unsafe. The Court of Appeal dismissed applications to challenge the other eleven convictions from the 2014 trial.

===Documentary===
A documentary, &quot;Rolf Harris: Hiding in Plain Sight&quot;, featuring interviews with Harris&#x27;s victims, police investigators and colleagues premiered on ITVX on 18 May 2023. The two 60-minute episodes were made by Optomen and executive-produced by Tina Flintoff and Nick Hornby.

==Personal life, illness and death==
On 1 March 1958, in London, Harris married Alwen Hughes, a Welsh sculptor and jeweller, while they were both art students. In 1964, he and his wife had a daughter.

In September 2016, it was reported that Harris, who had been serving his prison sentence at the time, had been hospitalised with suspected sepsis.

In October 2022, it was reported that Harris was suffering with neck cancer, unable to talk, and was being fed via a tube. He also required 24-hour care. Harris died at his home in Bray, Berkshire, on 10 May 2023, aged 93. His death was not publicly announced until 23 May to allow for &quot;a dignified funeral&quot;, when it was confirmed to the media by register office officials in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. His death certificate gave the cause of death as neck cancer and &quot;frailty of old age&quot;.

On 15 August 2024, Alwen Hughes died aged 92.

==Honours==
Harris received multiple awards and honours, but following his conviction many of these were rescinded. Harris was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1968; he was advanced to Officer (OBE) in 1977, then to Commander (CBE) in 2006, but these honours were revoked in March 2015.

In 1986, Harris planted a &quot;Cathormion umbellatum&quot; tree at Kununurra&#x27;s celebrity tree park. The plaque recording the planting was stolen in July 2014, a week before the local council voted to keep it. The council, however, felt that ongoing vandalism at the park made it unlikely that the plaque would be replaced.

In 1989, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM), and was advanced to Officer (AO) in the Queen&#x27;s 2012 Birthday Honours. These appointments were rescinded in February 2015.

In 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal &quot;for service to entertainment, charity and the community&quot;. On 30 July 2014, the board of the National Trust of Australia (New South Wales) voted to remove Harris from the list of those honoured as &quot;Australian National Living Treasures&quot; and to withdraw the award. Harris had been among the original 100 Australians selected for the Medal in 1997.

Harris received two honorary doctorates: from the University of East London in 2007 and Liverpool Hope University in 2010. Both were rescinded following his indecent assault conviction.

In 2008, Harris was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. He was joined onstage by the Seekers to perform &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; and his &quot;Jake the Peg&quot; routine. After his conviction, the Australian Recording Industry Association removed him from the ARIA Hall of Fame.

The same year, to coincide with the release of &quot;Art: The Definitive Visual Guide&quot;, publishers Dorling Kindersley conducted the &quot;What the British really think about art today&quot; survey and placed Harris above notable English artist Damien Hirst.

In 2011, Harris was awarded the title of &quot;Best Selling Published Artist&quot; by the Fine Art Trade Guild. He was made a Fellow of BAFTA the following year, but following his conviction, the academy announced that his fellowship would be annulled. In July 2014, Froncysyllte Male Voice Choir announced that Harris&#x27;s honorary vice-presidency had been annulled.

<text>A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients, i.e. it offers the facilities required for them to create and maintain a site and makes it accessible on the World Wide Web. Companies providing web hosting services are sometimes called &quot;web hosts&quot;.

Typically, web hosting requires the following:
* one or more servers to act as the host(s) for the sites; servers may be physical or virtual;
* colocation for the server(s), providing physical space, electricity, and Internet connectivity;
* Domain Name System configuration to define name(s) for the sites and point them to the hosting server(s);
* a web server running on the host;
* for each site hosted on the server:
** space on the server(s) to hold the files making up the site;
** site-specific configuration;
** often, a database;
** software and credentials allowing the client to access these, enabling them to create, configure, and modify the site;
** email connectivity allowing the host and site to send email to the client.

== History ==
Until 1991, the Internet was restricted to use only &quot;... for research and education in the sciences and engineering...&quot; and was used for email, telnet, FTP and USENET traffic—but only a tiny number of web pages. The World Wide Web protocols had only just been written and not until the end of 1993 would there be a graphical web browser for Mac or Windows computers. Even after there was some opening up of Internet access, the situation was confused until 1995. 
To host a website on the internet, an individual or company would need their own computer or server. As not all companies had the budget or expertise to do this, web hosting services began to offer to host users&#x27; websites on their own servers, without the client needing to own the necessary infrastructure required to operate the website. The owners of the websites, also called webmasters, would be able to create a website that would be hosted on the web hosting service&#x27;s server and published to the web by the web hosting service.

As the number of users on the World Wide Web grew, the pressure for companies, both large and small, to have an online presence grew. By 1995, companies such as GeoCities, Angelfire and Tripod were offering free hosting.

== Classification ==
===Static page hosting===

The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web &quot;as is&quot; or with minimal processing. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer this service free to subscribers. Individuals and organizations may also obtain web page hosting from alternative service providers.

Free web hosting service is offered by different companies with limited services, sometimes supported by advertisements, and often limited when compared to paid hosting.

Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages. Personal website hosting is typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business website hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and type of the site.

=== Peer-to-peer hosting ===
===Larger hosting services===
A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides database support and application development platforms (e.g. ASP.NET, ColdFusion, Java EE, Perl/Plack, PHP or Ruby on Rails). These facilities allow customers to write or install scripts for applications like forums and content management. Web hosting packages often include a web content management system, so the end-user does not have to worry about the more technical aspects. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used for websites that wish to encrypt the transmitted data.

== Types of hosting ==

Internet hosting services can run web servers. The scope of web hosting services varies greatly.
* Shared web hosting service – One&#x27;s website is placed on the same server as many other sites, ranging from a few sites to hundreds of websites. Typically, all domains may share a common pool of server resources, such as RAM and the CPU. The features available with this type of service can be quite basic and not flexible in terms of software and updates. Resellers often sell shared web hosting and web companies often have reseller accounts to provide hosting for clients.
* Reseller web hosting – Allows clients to become web hosts themselves. Resellers could function, for individual domains, under any combination of these listed types of hosting, depending on who they are affiliated with as a reseller. Resellers&#x27; accounts may vary tremendously in size: they may have their own virtual dedicated server to a colocated server. Many resellers provide a nearly identical service to their provider&#x27;s shared hosting plan and provide the technical support themselves.
* Virtual Dedicated Server – Also known as a Virtual Private Server (VPS), divides server resources into virtual servers, where resources can be allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware. VPS will often be allocated resources based on a one server to many VPSs relationship, however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons, including the ability to move a VPS container between servers. The users may have root access to their own virtual space. Customers are sometimes responsible for patching and maintaining the server (unmanaged server) or the VPS provider may provide server admin tasks for the customer (managed server).
* Dedicated hosting service – The user gets their own web server and gains full control over it (user has root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, the user typically does not own the server. One type of dedicated hosting is self-managed or unmanaged. This is usually the least expensive for dedicated plans. The user has full administrative access to the server, which means the client is responsible for the security and maintenance of their own dedicated server.
* Managed hosting service – The user gets their own web server but is not allowed full control over it (user is denied root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, they are allowed to manage their data via FTP or other remote management tools. The user is disallowed full control so that the provider can guarantee quality of service by not allowing the user to modify the server or potentially create configuration problems. The user typically does not own the server. The server is leased to the client.
* Colocation web hosting service – Similar to the dedicated web hosting service, but the user owns the colo server; the hosting company provides physical space that the server takes up and takes care of the server. This is the most powerful and expensive type of web hosting service. In most cases, the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client&#x27;s machine, providing only the electrical, Internet access, and storage facilities for the server. In most cases for colo, the client would have their own administrator visit the data center on site to do any hardware upgrades or changes. Formerly, many colocation providers would accept any system configuration for hosting, even ones housed in desktop-style minitower cases, but most hosts now require rack mount enclosures and standard system configurations.
* Cloud hosting – Hosting based on clustered load-balanced servers. A cloud hosted website may be more reliable than alternatives since other computers in the cloud can compensate when a single piece of hardware goes down. Also, local power disruptions or even natural disasters are less problematic for cloud hosted sites, as cloud hosting is decentralized. Cloud hosting also allows providers to charge users only for resources consumed by the user, rather than a flat fee for the amount the user expects they will use, or a fixed cost upfront hardware investment. Alternatively, the lack of centralization may give users less control on where their data is located which could be a problem for users with data security or privacy concerns as per GDPR guidelines. Cloud hosting users can request additional resources on-demand such as only during periods of peak traffic, while offloading IT management to the cloud hosting service.
* Clustered hosting – Having multiple servers hosting the same content for better resource utilization. Clustered servers are a perfect solution for high-availability dedicated hosting, or creating a scalable web hosting solution. A cluster may separate web serving from database hosting capability. (Usually web hosts use clustered hosting for their shared hosting plans, as there are multiple benefits to the mass managing of clients).
* Grid hosting – This form of distributed hosting is when a server cluster acts like a grid and is composed of multiple nodes.
* Home server – A private server can be used to host one or more websites from a usually consumer-grade broadband connection. These can be purpose-built machines or more commonly old PCs. Some ISPs block home servers by disallowing incoming requests to TCP port 80 of the user&#x27;s connection and by refusing to provide static IP addresses. A common way to attain a reliable DNS host name is by creating an account with a dynamic DNS service. A dynamic DNS service will automatically change the IP address that a URL points to when the IP address changes.

Some specific types of hosting provided by web host service providers:
* File hosting service: hosts files, not web pages
* Image hosting service
* Video hosting service
* Blog hosting service
* Paste bin
* Shopping cart software
* E-mail hosting service

==Host management==

The host may also provide an interface or control panel for managing the web server and installing scripts, as well as other modules and service applications like e-mail. A web server that does not use a control panel for managing the hosting account, is often referred to as a &quot;headless&quot; server. Some hosts specialize in certain software or services (e.g. e-commerce, blogs, etc.).

=== Reliability and uptime ===
The availability of a website is measured by the percentage of a year in which the website is publicly accessible and reachable via the Internet. This is different from measuring the uptime of a system. Uptime refers to the system itself being online. Uptime does not take into account being able to reach it as in the event of a network outage. A hosting provider&#x27;s Service Level Agreement (SLA) may include a certain amount of scheduled downtime per year in order to perform maintenance on the systems. This scheduled downtime is often excluded from the SLA timeframe, and needs to be subtracted from the Total Time when availability is calculated. Depending on the wording of an SLA, if the availability of a system drops below that in the signed SLA, a hosting provider often will provide a partial refund for time lost. How downtime is determined changes from provider to provider, therefore reading the SLA is imperative. Not all providers release uptime statistics.

== Security ==
Because web hosting services host websites belonging to their customers, online security is an important concern. When a customer agrees to use a web hosting service, they are relinquishing control of the security of their site to the company that is hosting the site. The level of security that a web hosting service offers is extremely important to a prospective customer and can be a major factor when considering which provider a customer may choose.

Web hosting servers can be attacked by malicious users in different ways, including uploading malware or malicious code onto a hosted website. These attacks may be done for different reasons, including stealing credit card data, launching a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) or spamming.

<doc id="157469" wikidata="Q1929918" url="?curid=157469" title="Slave to the Grind">
<text>Slave to the Grind is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Skid Row, released on June 11, 1991, by Atlantic Records. The album displayed a harsher sound than its predecessor and lyrics that avoided hard rock cliches. &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; is the first heavy metal album to chart at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the Nielsen SoundScan era, selling 134,000 copies in its opening week. The album was certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1998 for shipping two million copies in the United States. It produced five singles: &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;, &quot;Wasted Time&quot;, &quot;In a Darkened Room&quot; and &quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot;. Skid Row promoted the album opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1991 and as a headliner the following year.

==Composition and recording==
Skid Row wrote most of &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; in a New Jersey studio and demoed the tracks with Michael Wagener, who produced their previous album. Recording began in late 1990 and took place at two studios: New River in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Scream in Studio City, California. &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; marked the band&#x27;s move toward a heavier sound, with the title track verging on speed metal, but the album also includes power ballads and a few lighter tracks. Some sources still classified the album as glam metal, despite its heavier sound. The lyrics were more complex, criticizing modern ways of life, authority, politics, drugs, and organized religion, among other topics. Wagener said the demoing and pre-production went well, and the title track was recorded and mixed in an hour, and was placed on the album without being remixed.

During a February 2017 interview for the &quot;Backspin&quot; segment of Yahoo! Music, vocalist Sebastian Bach revealed that the version of the title track included in the finished album is actually the original demo the band recorded during pre-production with producer Michael Wagener. The band recorded a proper version during the album sessions, but were unable to match the intensity of the demo, and therefore opted to use the latter instead.

==Cover art==
Sebastian Bach&#x27;s father, David Bierk, painted the cover art, which is actually a long mural, continued inside the album&#x27;s booklet. Although it is set in the medieval era, it depicts people using modern technological gadgets. The cover was inspired by Caravaggio&#x27;s Burial of St. Lucy from 1608 and shows John F. Kennedy in the crowd.

==Release and promotion==
When recording finished, Skid Row opened for Guns N&#x27; Roses on the 1991 North American leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour. In 1992, Skid Row took Pantera and Soundgarden as supporting bands on its Slave to the Grind Tour. Two different versions of the album were released: the original and a &quot;clean&quot; version, in which &quot;Get the Fuck Out&quot; is replaced with the less-offensive &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Day&quot;. Music videos were produced for all five singles: &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;, &quot;Wasted Time&quot;, &quot;In a Darkened Room&quot; and &quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot;, all of which feature on the video album &quot;No Frills Video&quot;. Skid Row&#x27;s label Atlantic Records was not supportive of the group&#x27;s transformation when filming the video for the title track. The label wanted a bikini model to star in the video, but the idea was turned down by the band because the song was not about female sexuality. A music video was also made for &quot;Psycho Love&quot; in 3D which featured on the video album &quot;Road Kill&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; received generally positive reviews by music critics. &quot;Spin&quot;″s Daina Darzin said the album had integrity and passion, and reminded her of early Mötley Crüe and Judas Priest. Martin Popoff called the album &quot;a surprising and welcome jolt to the system&quot;, with Skid Row &quot;proving their mettle, their self-worth, their guts&quot; on songs taking the listener &quot;to dark unsettling places where reflection collides with worry.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; was more aggressive than its predecessor and called it one of the best examples of mainstream hard rock and heavy metal. Brenda Herrmann of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; observed that Bolan and Sabo improved their songwriting and wrote positively about the group&#x27;s attitude and humor. Conversely, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s David Fricke thought Skid Row had not matured lyrically at all, rehashing the glam metal cliches. However, he complimented Wagener&#x27;s production and the band&#x27;s interplay and sound. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and graded the album a &quot;dud&quot;, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought&quot;. Janiss Garza of the &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the ballads&#x27; lyrical depth and the fury of &quot;Riot Act&quot; and the title track, giving the album an A−.

&quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 134,000 copies in its first week. The album was the first to debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the Nielsen SoundScan era, since it was uncommon for albums to open at number one before SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. Previously, the only albums to debut at number one had been Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; in 1975 and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; in 1987.

<text>Mariel Margaret &quot;Mia&quot; Hamm (born March 17, 1972) is an American former professional soccer player, two-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup champion. Hailed as a soccer icon, she played as a forward for the United States national team from 1987 to 2004. Hamm was the face of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA), the first professional women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States, where she played for the Washington Freedom from 2001 to 2003. She played college soccer for the North Carolina Tar Heels and helped the team win four NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship titles.

Hamm competed in four FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cups: the inaugural 1991 tournament in China, 1995 in Sweden, 1999 and 2003 in the United States. She led the team at three Olympic Games — 1996 in Atlanta (the first time women&#x27;s soccer was played), 2000 in Sydney, and 2004 in Athens. At these seven international tournaments she played in 42 matches and scored 14 goals.

A co-owner of Los Angeles FC and Angel City FC, Hamm is also a global ambassador for FC Barcelona and is on the board of directors of Serie A club A.S. Roma. Author of &quot;Go For the Goal: A Champion&#x27;s Guide to Winning in Soccer and Life&quot;, Hamm has been featured in several films and television shows, including the HBO documentary, &quot;Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Soccer Team&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Selma, Alabama, Hamm was the fourth of six children of Bill and Stephanie Hamm. She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot. Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases around the world with her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport. At age five, then living in Wichita Falls, Texas, Hamm joined her first soccer team. Her father coached Mia and her newly adopted brother, 8-year-old Garrett.

Hamm played sports from a young age and excelled as a football player on the boys&#x27; team at junior high school. She played at the 1987 U.S. Olympic Festival, the youngest player to play for the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team. As a new player, she often started as a forward but did not score a goal during her first year on the team. Hamm attended Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia, and helped the Lake Braddock soccer team win the 1989 state championships.

==Club career==
===North Carolina Tar Heels, 1989–1993===
From 1989 to 1993, Hamm attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she helped the Tar Heels win four NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Soccer Championships in five years. She red-shirted the 1991 season to focus on preparation for the inaugural 1991 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in China. North Carolina lost one game of the 95 she played on the team. She earned All-American honors, was named the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Player of the Year for three consecutive years, and was named ACC Female Athlete of the Year in 1993 and 1994. She graduated from North Carolina in 1994 with the ACC records for goals (103), assists (72), and total points (278). In 2003, she and Michael Jordan were named the ACC&#x27;s Greatest Athletes of the conference&#x27;s first fifty years.

Hamm was a member of the United States women&#x27;s national college team that won a silver medal, being defeated by China in the final, at the 1993 Summer Universiade in Buffalo, New York.

===Washington Freedom, 2001–2003===
In 2001, Hamm was a founding player in the first professional women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States, the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA), and played for the Washington Freedom from 2001 to 2003. Throughout the league&#x27;s history, Hamm was hailed as the star of the league and used heavily in marketing and promotion. In a poll of 1,000 advertising executives conducted in 2001, she was voted &quot;the most appealing female athlete&quot;, garnering almost twice as many votes as the runner-up Anna Kournikova.

During the league&#x27;s inaugural match between the Freedom and Bay Area CyberRays at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Hamm was fouled in the penalty area resulting in a penalty kick that her teammate Pretinha converted to mark the first goal scored in the league. The Freedom won 1–0. In addition to the 34,148 fans in attendance being greater than any MLS game that weekend, the Turner Network Television (TNT) broadcast reached 393,087 households: more than two MLS games broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Playing as a midfielder and forward, Hamm played in 19 of the Freedom&#x27;s 21 matches during the 2001 season. She led the team in goals (6) and assists (4).
The Freedom finished in seventh place during the regular season with a record.

Hamm suffered a knee injury in November 2001 that kept her off the pitch for several months of early 2002. Despite playing only half the 2002 season with the Freedom, she finished the season with eight goals. The team finished in third place during the 2002 season with a record and advanced to the playoffs. After winning the semi-final against the Philadelphia Charge 1–0, the team was defeated 3–2 by the Carolina Courage in the 2002 WUSA Founders Cup. Hamm scored the Freedom&#x27;s second goal in the 64th minute.

During the 2003 season, Hamm started in 16 of the 19 games in which she played. Her 11 goals ranked second on the team behind Abby Wambach&#x27;s 13 while her 11 assists ranked first.
The Freedom finished in fourth place during the regular season with a record and secured a berth in the playoffs. Hamm finished her club career as a WUSA champion when the Freedom defeated the Atlanta Beat 2–1 in overtime to win the Founders Cup on August 24, 2003.

===Retirement===
On May 14, 2004, Hamm announced her retirement effective after the 2004 Athens Olympics. Following the 2004 Olympics, Hamm and her teammates played in a 10-game farewell tour in the United States. The final match of the tour against Mexico at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California, on December 8, 2004, marked the final international match for Hamm, Julie Foudy, and Joy Fawcett. The U.S. defeated Mexico 5–0 and Hamm assisted on two of the goals.

Hamm retired at age 32 with a record 158 international goals. She and teammates Foudy and Fawcett were honored with a pre-game ceremony where they were presented with framed jerseys and roses in front of 15,549 fans at Home Depot Center in Carson, California.

A prolific goalscorer, she was known for her powerful and accurate striking ability, although she was also a creative and hard-working forward, and a team player, who was equally capable of assisting many goals for her teammates, due to her accurate passing, and was also willing to aid her teammates defensively when possession was lost.

<text>The Knights ( &quot;Hippeîs&quot;; Attic: ) was the fourth play written by Aristophanes, who is considered the master of Old Comedy. The play is a satire on the social and political life of classical Athens during the Peloponnesian War, and in this respect it is typical of all the dramatist&#x27;s early plays. It is unique, however, in the relatively small number of its characters, and this was due to its vitriolic preoccupation with one man, the pro-war populist Cleon. Cleon had prosecuted Aristophanes for slandering the polis with an earlier play, &quot;The Babylonians&quot; (426 BC), for which the young dramatist had promised revenge in &quot;The Acharnians&quot; (425 BC), and it was in &quot;The Knights&quot; (424 BC) that his revenge was exacted. &quot;The Knights&quot; won first prize at the Lenaia festival when it was produced in 424 BC.

==Plot==
&quot;The Knights&quot; is a satire on political and social life in 5th-century BC Athens. The characters are drawn from real life, and Cleon is clearly intended to be the villain. However, it is also an allegory. The characters are figures of fantasy, and the villain in this context is Paphlagonian, a comic monstrosity responsible for almost everything that&#x27;s wrong with the world. The identity of the Paphlagonian as Cleon is awkward, and the ambiguities aren&#x27;t easily resolved. This summary features the real-world names Cleon, Nicias and Demosthenes (though these names are never mentioned in the play). See Discussion for an overview of the ambiguous use of characterization in &quot;The Knights&quot;.

Short summary: A sausage seller, Agoracritus, vies with Cleon for the confidence and approval of Demos (&quot;The People&quot; in Greek), an elderly man who symbolizes the Athenian citizenry. Agoracritus emerges triumphant from a series of contests, and he restores Demos to his former glory.
Detailed summary: Nicias and Demosthenes run from a house in Athens, complaining of a beating that they have just received from their master Demos, and cursing their fellow slave Cleon as the cause of their troubles. They inform the audience that Cleon has wheedled his way into Demos&#x27;s confidence, and they accuse him of misusing his privileged position for the purpose of extortion and corruption. They advise us that even the mask-makers are afraid of Cleon and that not one of them could be persuaded to make a caricature of him for this play. They assure us, however, that we are clever enough to recognize him even without a mask. Having no idea how to solve their problems, they pilfer some wine from the house, the taste of which inspires them to an even bolder theft – a set of oracles that Cleon has always refused to let anyone else see. On reading these stolen oracles, they learn that Cleon is one of several peddlers destined to rule the polis and that it is his fate to be replaced by a sausage-seller. As chance would have it, a sausage-seller passes by at that very moment, carrying a portable kitchen. Demosthenes informs him of his destiny. The sausage seller is not convinced at first, but Demosthenes points out the myriads of people in the theatre, and he assures him that his skills with sausages are all that is needed to govern them. Cleon&#x27;s suspicions, meanwhile, have been aroused, and he rushes from the house in search of trouble. He immediately finds an empty wine bowl, and he loudly accuses the others of treason. Demosthenes calls upon the knights of Athens for assistance, and a Chorus of them charges into the theatre. They converge on Cleon in military formation under instructions from their leader:
::Hit him, hit him, hit the villain hateful to the cavalry,
::Tax-collecting, all-devouring monster of a lurking thief!
::Villain, villain! I repeat it, I repeat it constantly,
::With good reason since this thief reiterates his villainy!
Cleon is given rough handling, and the Chorus leader accuses him of manipulating the political and legal system for personal gain. Cleon bellows to the audience for help, and the Chorus urges the sausage-seller to outshout him. There follows a shouting match between Cleon and the sausage-seller with vulgar boasts and vainglorious threats on both sides as each man strives to demonstrate that he is a more shameless and unscrupulous orator than the other. The knights proclaim the sausage-seller the winner of the argument, and Cleon then rushes off to the Boule to denounce them all on a trumped-up charge of treason. The sausage-seller sets off in pursuit, and the action pauses for a parabasis, during which the Chorus steps forward to address the audience on behalf of the author.

The Chorus informs us that Aristophanes has been very methodical and cautious in the way he has approached his career as a comic poet, and we are invited to applaud him. The knights then deliver a speech in praise of the older generation, the men who made Athens great, and this is followed by a speech in praise of horses that performed heroically in a recent amphibious assault on Corinth, whither they are imagined to have rowed in gallant style.

Returning to the stage, the sausage-seller reports to the knights on his battle with Cleon for control of the council: he has outbid Cleon for the support of the councillors with offers of meals at the state&#x27;s expense. Indignant at his defeat, Cleon rushes onto the stage and challenges the sausage-seller to submit their differences to Demos. The sausage-seller accepts the challenge. They call Demos outdoors and compete with each other in flattering him like rivals for the affections of an eromenos. He agrees to hear them debating their differences, and he takes up his position on the Pnyx (here represented possibly as a bench). The sausage-seller makes some serious accusations in the first half of the debate: (i) Cleon is indifferent to the war-time sufferings of ordinary people, (ii) he has used the war as an opportunity for corruption, and (iii) he prolongs the war out of fear that he will be prosecuted when peace returns. Demos is won over by these arguments, and he spurns Cleon&#x27;s wheedling appeals for sympathy. Thereafter the sausage-seller&#x27;s accusations become increasingly absurd: Cleon is accused of waging a campaign against buggery in order to stifle opposition (because all the best orators are buggers), and he is said to have brought down the price of silphium so that jurors who bought it would suffocate each other with their flatulence. Cleon loses the debate, but he doesn&#x27;t lose hope, and there are two further contests in which he competes with the sausage-seller for Demos&#x27;s favour: (i) the reading of oracles flattering to Demos; (ii) a race to see which of them can best serve pampered Demos&#x27;s every need. The sausage-seller wins each contest by outdoing Cleon in shamelessness. Cleon makes one last effort to retain his privileged position in the household: he possesses an oracle that describes his successor, and he questions the sausage-seller to see if he matches the description in all its vulgar details. The sausage-seller does match the description. In tragic dismay, Cleon at last accepts his fate, and he surrenders his authority to the sausage-seller. Demos asks the sausage-seller for his name, and we learn that it is Agoracritus, confirming his lowly origin. The actors depart and the Chorus treats us to another parabasis.

The knights step forward and they advise us that it is honorable to mock dishonorable people. They proceed to mock Ariphrades, an Athenian with a perverse appetite for female secretions. Next they recount an imaginary conversation between some respectable ships that have refused to carry the war to Carthage because the voyage was proposed by Hyperbolus, a man they despise. Then Agoracritus returns to the stage, calling for respectful silence and announcing a new development – he has rejuvenated Demos with a good boiling (just as if he were a piece of meat). The doors of Demos&#x27;s house open to reveal impressive changes in Demos&#x27;s appearance – he is now the very image of glorious &quot;violet-crowned&quot; Athens, as once commemorated in a song by Pindar. Agoracritus presents his transformed master with a &quot;well-hung&quot; boy and with the &quot;Peacetreaties&quot; – two girls that Cleon had been keeping locked up in order to prolong the war. Demos invites Agoracritus to a banquet at the town hall and the entire cast exits in good cheer – all except Cleon, who is required to sell sausages at the city gate as punishment for his crimes.

==Historical background==
Some significant events leading up to the play:
*432 BC: The Megarian decree began a trade embargo by Athens against the neighbouring polis of Megara. The Peloponnesian War commenced soon after.
*430 BC: The Plague of Athens resulted in the deaths of many thousands of Athenians, including leading citizens such as Pericles.
*427 BC: Aristophanes produced his first play &quot;The Banqueters&quot; at the City Dionysis. Cleon carried a bill proposing fierce retribution against a rebellious Athenian ally Mytilene, including the execution of all its adult males and the enslavement of all its women and children; the bill was repealed the next day in spite of his opposition. There was a recurrence of the plague at about this time.
*426 BC: &quot;The Babylonians&quot; (now lost) won first prize at the City Dionysia. Cleon subsequently prosecuted the young playwright for slandering the polis in the presence of foreigners.
*425 BC: &quot;The Acharnians&quot; was produced at the Lenaia. Cleon criticized Athenian generals for procrastination and incompetence and he replaced Nicias in time to assist Demosthenes in the victory at the Battle of Sphacteria. He later increased the tribute payments of allied states and also increased juror&#x27;s pay from two to three obols per day.
*424 BC: Aristophanes won first prize at the Lenaia with &quot;The Knights&quot;

===Cleon, knights and Aristophanes===
Cleon&#x27;s political career was founded on his opposition to the cautious war strategy of Pericles, and its highpoint came with the Athenian victory at Sphacteria, for which he was feted and honored by the majority of his fellow citizens. Included in the civic honors were free meals at the town hall or prytaneion and front row seats at festivals such as the Lenaia and City Dionysia. Cleon&#x27;s entitlement to these honors is continually mocked by Aristophanes in &quot;The Knights,&quot; and possibly Cleon was sitting in the front row during the performance. Aristophanes makes numerous accusations against Cleon, many of them comic and some in earnest. He mocks Cleon for his questionable pedigree, but inscriptions indicate that the social origins of demagogues like Cleon were not as obscure as Aristophanes and other comic poets tried to make out. He appears to have used the law courts for personal and political ends, but it is possible that he was neither venal nor corrupt. He had prosecuted Aristophanes for an earlier play, &quot;The Babylonians&quot;, but an attempt at political censorship during a time of war was not necessarily motivated by personal malice or ambition on Cleon&#x27;s part. The play depicted the cities of the Athenian League as slaves grinding at a mill, and it had been performed at the City Dionysia in the presence of foreigners. The knights (citizens rich enough to own horses) were the comic poet&#x27;s natural allies against a populist such as Cleon. According to a passage in &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, they had recently forced him to hand over a large sum of money, implying that he had obtained it corruptly. As an educated class, knights occupied many of the state offices that were subject to annual audits, and Cleon specialized in the prosecution of such officials, often using his rapport with jurors to obtain the verdicts he wanted. This abuse of the auditing system is one of the complaints made by the Chorus when it enters the stage and it accuses Cleon of selecting officials for prosecution like figs according to their wealth and psychological vulnerability (lines 257–65). The play also accuses Cleon of manipulating census lists to impose crippling financial burdens on his choice of victims (lines 911–25).

=== Other plays in association to &quot;The Knights&quot; ===
The Knights by Aristophanes is a play known for its satire relating to the uprising middle class. This theme shows itself throughout history on multiple occurrences. A notable play with this theme is Molière&#x27;s play, &quot;Le Bourgeois gentilhomme&quot; (1670). This Renaissance play has been compared to The Knights due to the satire involving the middle class. Another Renaissance play, The Alchemist, by Ben Johnson (1610), is thought to be influenced by The Knights.

===Places and people mentioned in &quot;The Knights&quot;===
Old Comedy is a highly topical form of comic drama and its meanings are often obscured by multiple references to contemporary news, gossip and literature. Centuries of scholarship have unriddled many of these references and they are explained in commentaries in various editions of the plays. The following lists are compiled from two such sources. &quot;Note: Paphlagonian is here referred to by his real name, Cleon&quot;.

=== Themes present in &quot;The Knights&quot; ===
Political corruption: the play makes fun of political corruption through the use of satire. The character Cleon is used to show what Athenians would experience in relation to corrupt political tactics such as bribery, demagoguery, abuse of power, and unjust treatment of the people.

Social inequality: The Knights uses displays of social inequality through its character&#x27;s roles and dialogue. This theme was most likely implemented due to the Athenian people experiencing social and economic inequality where the rich exploited and marginalized the poor and middle class.

Power and Abuse: This theme shows the theme of power and abuse through the acts of characters rising up and going against the abusive power, and how the common people can fight back against corrupt authority.

Patriotism and War: Since this play takes place during the Peloponnesian War, the play satirizes and criticizes the act of going to war, and how that affects the working class. Aristophanes makes fun of Athens&#x27; urge to display military might while ignoring the conditions and consideration of the common people.

Satire: Satire in itself is a large theme throughout The Knights. Aristophanes&#x27; use of satire crafts the play in a way where criticism of Athenian life is present and sends a message, as well as calling out who and what he dislikes. He writes The Knights in a way that exposes the failures of effort and shortcomings of the Athenian society and its rulers.
:::Places
*Pylos: A bay in the Peloponnese, shut in by the island of Sphacteria, it is associated with Cleon&#x27;s famous victory and there are many references to it in the play: as a cake that Cleon pinched from Demosthenes (lines 57, 355, 1167); as a place where Cleon like a colossus has got one foot (76); as an oath by which Cleon swears (702); as the place where Cleon snatched victory from the Athenian generals (742); as the origin of captured Spartan shields (846); as an epithet of the goddess Athena (1172); and as an equivalent of the hare that Agoracritus stole from Cleon (1201). Pylos is mentioned again in three later plays.
*Paphlagonia: A region in modern Turkey, it is imputed to be the birthplace of Cleon since he is named after it. There is a pun on the word &quot;paphlazo&quot; (I bubble, splutter, fret) which is made explicit in reference to Cleon in line 919.
*Chaonia: A region in the northwestern Greece, it is where Cleon the colossus dangles his arse (line 78) and it is also mentioned in &quot;The Acharnians&quot;. One of his hands is in Aetolia (79).
*&quot;Cycloborus&quot;: A mountain torrent in Attica, it is the image of Cleon&#x27;s voice here (line 137) and also in &quot;The Acharnians&quot;.
*Carthage or Carchedon: A Phoenician city, it marks a western limit of Athenian influence (line 174) and it is somewhere that the ships don&#x27;t want to go (1303); an eastern limit is marked by Caria (173).
*Chalcidice: A region in the northern Aegean that was under Athenian control but where the cities were increasingly rebellious. The wine bowl that the two slaves steal from the house is Chalcidian in design and Cleon subsequently accuses them of stealing it to provoke a Chalcidian revolt (line 237). &quot;Ironically, Cleon later perished in a military campaign to quell the revolt there&quot;.
*Chersonesos: The Gallipoli Peninsula, it is mentioned by the Chorus as the sort of place where Cleon fishes for people he can put on trial in Athens (line 262)
*Prytaneion: The ancient equivalent of a town hall, it is where Cleon obtains free meals (lines 281, 535, 766) and where Agoracritus is destined to obtain free sex (167).
*Pergase: A deme of the &quot;Erechthides&quot; tribe, not far outside Athens, it was as far as Demosthenes got when a pair of leather shoes that Cleon had sold him began to dissolve (line 321)
*Miletus: One of the principal cities of Ionia, it is famous for its fish (line 361). Cleon is imagined choking on a fried cuttlefish while contemplating a bribe from Miletus (932).
*Potidaea: A rebellious city in Chalcidice, it was recaptured by the Athenians in 429 BC. Cleon offers Agoracritus a bribe of one talent not to mention the bribe of ten talents he is said to have taken from there (line 438).
*Boeotia: A northern neighbour of the Athenians but an ally of Sparta, it was famous for its cheeses. Cleon accuses Agoracritus of making cheese with the Boeotians (line 479). Boeotia is mentioned extensively in &quot;The Acharnians&quot; and receives other mentions in two other plays.
*Argos: A Peloponnesian state, it had remained neutral throughout the war. Agoracritus claims that Cleon used negotiations with Argos as an opportunity to negotiate a bribe from the Spartans (line 465) and he murders a quote from Euripides in which the ancient state is apostrophized (813). Argos is mentioned in four other plays.
*Sunium and &quot;Geraestus&quot;: The sites of two temples of Poseidon (southern tips of Attica and Euboea), they are mentioned in an invocation to the god as a defender of the polis (lines 560–1). Sunium is mentioned again in &quot;The Clouds&quot;.
*Corinth: A Peloponnesian state, it had recently been attacked by marines under the command of Nicias. The cavalry had played a decisive role in the expedition. The horses had even rowed the ships and their attitude had been meritorious throughout the campaign (line 604). Corinth is mentioned again in two later plays.
*Pnyx: The hill where Athenian citizens assembled to debate state issues, it is said by Agoracritus to have a bad effect on Demos – ordinarily the cleverest chap in the world, he often gapes at the speaker&#x27;s platform like someone tying wild figs to a cultivar (line 749–55).
*Kerameikos: The potter&#x27;s quarter and town cemetery – Agoracritus offers to be dragged through it by a meathook in his balls as an assurance of his love for Demos (line 772)
*Marathon: Here as elsewhere, it is a name that conjures up patriotic pride and respect for the old ways (lines 781, 1334).
*Salamis: Another name to conjure with, Demos acquired a sore bum there while rowing in the Battle of Salamis (which means he must be very old), in gratitude for which Agoracritus thoughtfully provides him with a cushion (line 785). The island is mentioned again in &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.
*Arcadia: Ordinarily a wild backwoods in the very heart of enemy territory, it is where Demos will sit in judgement for five obols a day, according to one of Cleon&#x27;s oracles (line 798).
*Peiraeus: The main Athenian port, it was plastered onto the Athenian pie by Themistocles (line 815), and it has become his epithet (885). It is mentioned again in &quot;Peace&quot;.
*Coprus or &quot;Kopros&quot;: A deme of the tribe &quot;Hippothoontides&quot;, it also means &quot;feces&quot;. A man from there told Demos about Cleon&#x27;s plot to murder jurors en masse by inducing flatulence (line 899).
*Cyllene: A Peloponnesian harbour, it is also a pun for &quot;kylle&quot; (beggar&#x27;s hand). Apollo warns Demos in an oracle to avoid it and it is suggested that the hand belongs to a religious fanatic and oracle monger, &quot;Diopeithes&quot; (lines 1081–85).
*Ecbatana: The seat of the Persian kings, it is foretold in an oracle to be another place where Demos will someday sit in judgement (line 1089). Ecbatana is mentioned again in two other plays.
*Theseion: A temple and a safe refuge for fugitives, it is where the ships of the Athenian fleet consider fleeing to escape Hyperbolus (even though it is inland). A shrine of the Eumenides is considered in the same light (line 1312).
:::Athenian politicians and generals
*Cleon, Nicias and Demosthenes: See Discussion
*Themistocles: The visionary leader of Athens during the Persian wars, he is mentioned as a role-model for suicide (line 84), as a laughable benchmark for Cleon&#x27;s own greatness (812–19) and as somebody who never gave Demos a cloak (884).
*&quot;Simon&quot; and &quot;Panaetius&quot;: Cavalry officers, they are imagined to be part of the Chorus. Demosthenes directs them in the knights&#x27; manoeuvres against Cleon during the parodos – a further clue that he represents the general (lines 242–43).
*&quot;Eucrates&quot;: A hemp-seller, he is one of a series of populist leaders mentioned in Cleon&#x27;s oracles (line 129), he is said to have hidden in a pile of bran (254).
*Pericles: Among the most famous of Athenian leaders, he was blamed in The Acharnians for starting the Peloponnesian War but he receives some faint praise here as somebody who never stole food from the prytaneion – unlike Cleon (line283). He is mentioned again in two more plays.
*&quot;Archeptolemus&quot; (son of Hippodamus): An influential figure among Cleon&#x27;s opponents, he is said to weep at Cleon&#x27;s shamelessness (line 327) and he is said to have participated in peace negotiation that were subsequently frustrated by Cleon (794). &quot;Thirteen years after this play, he became an influential figure in the oligarchic revolt of 411 BC&quot;.
*Alcmaeonids: A powerful aristocratic clan, it was believed to be under a curse for sacrilegious murders committed in the 7th century. Cleon alludes to it as the sinful race from which Agoracritus sprang (line 445).
*Phormio: An admiral who had secured Athenian control of the sea early in the war, he probably died just before &quot;The Knights&quot; was produced and he is mentioned here in a hymn to Poseidon (line 562). He is mentioned in two other plays.
*&quot;Theorus&quot;: He is quoted quoting a Corinthian crab&#x27;s complaint against Athenian horses (line 608). It is not known if this is the same Theorus that Aristophanes mocks elsewhere as an associate of Cleon.
*Hyperbolus: An associate of Cleon often ridiculed in other plays, he is alluded to here as one of the lampsellers who buy the affections of Demos (line 739) and he is despised by ships(1304, 1363).
*&quot;Lysicles&quot;: A leading politician killed on active service at about the time that Pericles died, he is the sheep-seller mentioned in an oracle as one of a series of Athenian leaders (line 132) and he is a benchmark against which Cleon compares himself (765).
*&quot;Phanus&quot;: Another associate of Cleon, he is mentioned here as his secretary in the law courts (line 1256). He receives another mention in The Wasps.
*&quot;Phaeax&quot;: A rising star in the political firmament, his abilities are said by Demos to be admired by effete dandies (line 1377).
:::Poets and other artists
*Euripides: One of the great tragic poets, he is the butt of jokes in many of Aristophanes plays and he even appears as a character in three of them (&quot;The Acharnians&quot;, &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; and &quot;The Frogs&quot;). He is mentioned here as a model of linguistic artfulness (line 18) and there is an allusion to his mother as a reputed vegetable seller (19). There are quotes from his plays Hippolytus (16), &quot;Bellerophon&quot; (1249) and Alcestis (1252), as well as a pair of mismatched sayings taken from his works (813).
*Cratinus: A comic poet of the previous generation, he was still writing plays with some success. The Chorus would rather be his bedcover than be friends with Cleon (400) it laments his sad decline as an ageing poet with a drinking problem and it quotes from some of his old songs (526–36). &quot;In the following year (423 BC) he won first prize with &quot;The Bottle&quot; – a satire on his drinking problem – which was the same year Aristophanes came third and last with The Clouds&quot;.
*&quot;Morsimus&quot;: A tragic poet, he is mentioned with disgust by Aristophanes in other plays. The Chorus would rather sing in one of his tragedies than be friends with Cleon (line 401).
*Simonides: An eminent lyrical poet, he is quoted from an ode celebrating a victory in a chariot race (line 406).
*Magnes: Another comic poet, his predicament as a has-been is lamented by the Chorus and there are allusions to five of his plays – &quot;The Lute, The Lydians, The Birds, The Flies, The Frogs&quot; (lines 520–25)
*&quot;Connas&quot;: A prizewinning musician from yesteryear, he is said to go about still in his ancient victory chaplets, as thirsty as Cratinus (line 534).
*Crates: Another comic poet of the older generation, his predicament as a has-been is also lamented (line 537).
*Aristophanes: The author explains his cautious approach to his own career and he mentions his own baldness (lines 507–50).
*&quot;Ariphrades&quot;: Possibly a comic poet, he is later mentioned in &quot;The Wasps&quot; as one of three sons of &quot;Automenes&quot;, the other two being a musician and possibly an actor. According to the Chorus of knights, his lewdness is ingenious, his beard is foul with secretions licked up in brothels and he is as vile as &quot;Oenichus&quot; and &quot;Polymnestus&quot; (colleagues in smut if not in the arts), yet his musical brother &quot;Arignotus&quot; is a good man and a friend of the author (1276–89). Ariphrades is mentioned again in &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Ecclesiazusae&quot;.
*Pindar: A renowned lyrical poet, he is quoted in praise of Athens (lines 1323,1329).
:::Athenian personalities
*&quot;Cleaenetus&quot;: The father of Cleon, he is mentioned here as typical of a time when generals never demanded free meals at the prytaneion (line 574).
*&quot;Cunna&quot; and &quot;Salabaccho&quot;: Two courtesans, they are considered by Cleon to be great examples of service to Athens (line 765). Cunna is mentioned in two more plays and Salabaccho is mentioned again in Thesmophoriazusae.
*&quot;Gryttus&quot;: A notorious bugger, his citizenship was revoked by Cleon on moral grounds (line 877).
*Cleonymus: An associate of Cleon and a notorious glutton, he is a frequent target for Aristophanes&#x27; satire. Cleon was serving his interests rather than those of Demos (line 58), his appetite exhausts the stores of anyone who entertains him (1294) and he has abused the system to avoid military duties (1372).
*&quot;Smicythes&quot;: An androgynous name like &#x27;Kim&#x27;, it identifies a man whose interests are represented by a legal guardian (as if he were a woman) and who is therefore a tempting target for prosecution by Cleon (line 969).
*&quot;Philostratus&quot;: An infamous brothelkeeper nicknamed &#x27;Dogfox&#x27;, he is thought by Demos to be the Dogfox that an oracle warns him to avoid – in fact the oracle warns him to avoid Cleon (1069). Philostratus is mentioned again in Lysistrata.
*&quot;Lysistratus&quot;: A notorious practical-joker and a high-society figure, he is mentioned as somebody who shouldn&#x27;t be mentioned in a song about horses, on account of his mysterious poverty (1266). He is mentioned in three more plays.
*&quot;Thumantis&quot;: Another poor man who shouldn&#x27;t be mentioned in a song about horses (line 1267).
*Cleisthenes: A conspicuously effete Athenian, he is an inexhaustible butt of jokes featuring in many plays, including a silent role in The Acharnians and a short speaking role in &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;. He is mentioned here as the sort of dandy who is effusive in praise of rhetorical skill and who will be forced to practise more manly pursuits in future (line 1374). A companion, &quot;Straton&quot; is mentioned in the same capacity. Straton was also a companion of Cleisthenes in &quot;The Acharnians&quot; and he is mentioned later in &quot;The Birds&quot;.
:::Religious, cultural, historic and foreign identities
*Sybil: A mythical prophetess whose oracles were widely circulated in Athens, she is said to be one of Demos&#x27; idiotic obsessions (line 61). She is mentioned again in &quot;Peace&quot;.
*Bakis: Another widely read prophet, his oracles are treasured by Cleon, stolen by Nicias, perused by Demosthenes between gulps of wine (line 123) and later they are read to Demos by Cleon in opposition to the sausage-seller&#x27;s reading of the oracles of his brother &quot;Glanis&quot; (104). Bakis is mentioned again in two other plays.
*Pythia: The famous Delphic oracle, she foretells the triumph of the sausage-seller early in the play (line 220) and her words confirm Cleon&#x27;s defeat at the end of the play (1229, 1273). There is an allusion to her famous saying that Athens would ride the sea like a wine skin and never sink but the receptacle is misrepresented by Cleon as a pan – &quot;molgos&quot; (963).The oracle and her sanctuary are mentioned in a variety of contexts in other plays.
*Hippias: The tyrant of Athens, whose wife &quot;Myrsina&quot; is here pronounced &quot;Byrsina&quot; (&#x27;made of leather&#x27;) because one of their foreign mercenaries is said to be Cleon&#x27;s father (line 449), who made his fortune trading in leather. Hippias is mentioned again in &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.
*Medes: An Asiatic people associated with the Persians, they are said by Cleon to be involved in the sausage-seller&#x27;s conspiratorial comings and goings in the city at night (line 478). They were vanquished by Demos in the good old days (line 781). The Athenian horses recently ate crabs instead of prized Median grass while roughing it as marines in the assault on Corinth (line 606).
*Peplos: Athena&#x27;s robe, the sacred centrepiece of the festival of the Panathenaea, Athenian men are said by the Chorus to have been worthy of it once (line 566).
*Harmodius A famous tyrannicide and an Athenian hero, he is mentioned here as the sausage-seller&#x27;s putative ancestor (line 786) and he also receives a mention in three other plays.
*Erechtheus: The mythical king of prehistoric Athens, his name is used as an epithet of Demos during the reading of an oracle (line 1022). Cecrops, another legendary king of Athens, is mentioned in the same vein (1055) and he is named again in three other plays.
*Cerberus: The watchdog of Hades, it is an oracular metaphor for Cleon (line 1030) and it receives a mention in two other plays.
*&quot;Antileon&quot;: An early tyrant of Chalcis, his name only pops up because Demos, being hard of hearing (line 43), misinterprets an oracle (1044).
*&quot;Diopeithes&quot;: A notorious religious fanatic and an oracle-monger, he is mentioned in an oracle as a beggar to be avoided (line 1085). His name pops up again two more plays.
*Aristeides: A national hero, he founded the confederacy that became the Athenian empire and he is mentioned with Miltiades, the victorious general at the Battle of Marathon, as examples of Demos&#x27; glorious past (line 1325).

==Discussion==
The play&#x27;s dual significance as a satire/allegory leads to an ambivalence in its characters that is not easily resolved.
Agoracritus – miracle-worker and/or sausage-seller: The protagonist is an ambiguous character. Within the satirical context, he is a sausage seller who must overcome self-doubts to challenge Cleon as a populist orator, yet he is a godlike, redemptive figure in the allegory. His appearance at the start of the play is not just a coincidence but a godsend (&quot;kata theon&quot;, line 147), the shameless pranks that enable him to defeat Paphlagonian were suggested to him by the goddess Athena (903), he attributes his victory to Zeus, god of the Greeks (1253), and he compares himself to a god at the end (1338). He demonstrates miraculous powers in his redemption of The People and yet it was done by boiling, a cure for meat practised by a common sausage seller.

Cleon and/or Paphlagonian: The antagonist is another ambiguous character – he represents a real person, Cleon, and a comic monstrosity, Paphlagonian. He is never called &#x27;Cleon&#x27; and he doesn&#x27;t look like Cleon since the maskmakers refused to caricature him. The character, however, &quot;is&quot; called &#x27;Cleon&#x27; in the manuscripts&#x27; indications of speakers and in their list of &quot;dramatis personae&quot;; however, he is simply not ever identified as such in the text itself. Cleon&#x27;s father, Cleaenetus, is mentioned by name (line 574) but there is no mention of his relationship with Paphlagonian. The name &#x27;Paphlagonian&#x27; implies that the antagonist is of foreign descent and he is said to be the grandson of a foreign mercenary employed by the tyrant, Hippias (line 449). However, an oracle refers to Paphlagonian as the watchdog of Athens (&quot;Kuon&quot; or Dog, line 1023) and &quot;Kuon&quot; was in fact Cleon&#x27;s nickname (later exploited in the trial scene in &quot;The Wasps&quot;). The first half of the debate at the Pnyx (lines 756–835) features some serious accusations that are clearly aimed at Cleon. On the other hand, the second half of the debate (lines 836–940) features absurd accusations that are aimed at an entirely comic villain.

Nicias and Demosthenes and/or two slaves: The two slaves are listed as Demosthenes and Nicias in ancient manuscripts. The lists were probably based on the conjecture of ancient critics and yet there is little doubt that they reflect Aristophanes&#x27; intentions. Demosthenes summons the Chorus of knights as if he were a general in command of cavalry. Moreover, he says he made a Spartan cake in Pylos that was later pilfered by Paphlagonian (lines 54–7) and this seems to be a reference to Cleon&#x27;s success in taking the lion&#x27;s share of the credit for the victory at Sphacteria. However, the identity slaves=generals is problematic. In the standard edition of the collected plays, the two slaves leave the stage early and they don&#x27;t return. This is consistent with their role as minor characters and yet Nicias and Demosthenes were not minor figures in Athenian political life. One editor has Demosthenes deliver a short valedictory speech congratulating Agoracritus at the end of the play (lines 1254–56) – a speech that is otherwise assigned to the leader of the Chorus. However this is a token appearance after a long absence and it still leaves the audience in the dark about how Nicias feels at the end.

Imagery: It has been observed that imagery is the most important aspect of Aristophanes&#x27; comic poetry. In this play, the imagery provides a context in which the ambiguities mentioned above can be resolved. Paphlagonian is a monstrous giant (74–9), a snoring sorcerer (103), a mountain torrent (137), a hook-footed eagle (197), garlic pickle (199), a mud-stirrer (306), a fisherman watching for shoals of fish (313), a butchered pig (375–81), a bee browsing blooms of corruption (403), a dog-headed ape (416), a storm by sea and land (430–40), a giant hurling crags (626–29), a storm surge at sea (691–93), a thieving nurse (716–18), a fishermen hunting eels (864–67), a boiling pot (919–22), a lion fighting gnats (1037–8), a dogfox (1067), a beggar (182–3) and finally a sausage seller in the city gates (1397). These mixed metaphors present Paphlagonian as a versatile form of comic evil whose relevance transcends any particular place or time. Thus Cleon can be understood as one of Paphlagonian&#x27;s many manifestations and the satire is subsumed in the larger allegory without contradiction.

Gluttony is one of the dominant themes that emerge from the imagery. The play&#x27;s focus on food and drink is evident in the choice of a sausage seller as the protagonist. It is evident also in puns on the names of two characters. The name &quot;Paphlagonian&quot; bears a resemblance with &quot;Paphlazo&quot; (I splutter, boil, fret) and this pun is made explicit in lines 919–22, where Paphlagonian is imagined as a boiling pot that needs to be taken off the fire. In Greek &quot;Demos&quot; bears a resemblance to the Greek word for &quot;fat&quot;, a pun that is made explicit in lines 214–16, where Demosthenes compares the task of government to the task of preparing and cooking meat. The connection Demos=fat is consistent with the notion that Agoracritus can refine his master at the end of the play by boiling him (a notion that originates in the myth of Pelias, whose children boil him like an old ram in an attempt to rejuvenate him). Many of the grossest images in the play feature references to cannibalism: Paphlagonian swallows his victims like figs (258–63), Agoracritus is urged to eat Paphlagonian&#x27;s crest and wattles (496–7), protagonist and antagonist threaten to devour each other (693, 698–701) and Demos devours his own officials (1131–40). Such images present the audience with a nightmarish vision of the world – it is a world where horses and ships talk and act more like human beings than human beings do. The darkness of this vision makes the final vision of a reformed Athens all the brighter by contrast.

==&quot;The Knights&quot; and Old Comedy==
&quot;The Knights&quot; is one of the earliest of Aristophanes&#x27; surviving plays and generally it obeys the conventions of Old Comedy. There are some significant variations in this play:
*Agon: An agon is a symmetrical scene in which a debate is conducted in long lines, typically anapests. In a few cases however anapests are used to indicate arguments that the poet wants to be taken seriously while iambs are used to indicate arguments not to be taken seriously. Examples of this are found in &quot;The Clouds&quot; (lines 949–1104) and in &quot;The Frogs&quot; (lines 895–1098). The agon in &quot;The Knights&quot; is another example. It takes the form of a debate on the Pnyx between Cleon and the sausage-seller. The first half is in anapests and it features serious criticisms of Cleon (lines 756–835) but the second half is in iambs and the criticisms of Cleon are comically absurd (lines 836–940).
*Concluding episodes: It is typical for an agon to result in the protagonist&#x27;s victory and thereafter the action becomes a farcical anticlimax characterized by the comings and goings of &#x27;unwelcome visitors&#x27;. The agon in &quot;The Knights&quot; results in the conventional victory for the protagonist but the anticlimax involves a highly comic variation – the only unwelcome visitor in this play is Cleon, who will not accept defeat and who thus inflicts upon himself a series of defeats that is conventionally reserved for a series of secondary characters.
*Exodos: Old Comedy mandates a happy ending that culminates in a final song to mark the cast&#x27;s departure. There is no such song in &quot;The Knights&quot; and it is possible that it has been lost in the transmission of the ancient manuscripts.

Minor variations include:
*Prologue: Other plays by Aristophanes begin quietly, with characters seated, lying or standing. This play begins with an unusually dramatic entry – two characters run onto the stage howling. The prologue here is otherwise quite conventional.
*Parodos: The Chorus of knights runs into the theatre and immediately skirmishes with Paphlagonian – such a rapid entry into the action is unusual.
*Symmetrical scenes: Old Comedy has many scenes in which two sections resemble each other in meter and length. This play features a symmetrical scene inside another symmetrical scene – one pair of scenes (303–21 and 382–96) features trochaic tetrameter and the other (322–381 and 398–456) features iambic tetrameter.
*Parabasis: It is conventional for the Chorus to address the audience while the actors are offstage and usually there are two such addresses – one in the middle and a second address later in the play. The &quot;Knights&quot; exemplifies these conventions but it also provides a thematic link between the first and second parabasis. The first parabasis (lines 498–610) features a description of horses that talk and act like good men. The second parabasis (lines 1264–1315) features a description of ships that talk and act like good women. However, it has been suggested, on the basis of ancient commentaries, that the second parabasis was actually written by Eupolis, another comic poet.
