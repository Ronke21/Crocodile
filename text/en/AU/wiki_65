<text>Arturo Toscanini (; ; March 25, 1867January 16, 1957) was an Italian conductor. He was one of the most acclaimed and influential musicians of the late 19th and early 20th century, renowned for his intensity, his perfectionism, his ear for orchestral detail and sonority, and his eidetic memory. He was at various times the music director of La Scala in Milan and the New York Philharmonic. Later in his career, he was appointed the first music director of the NBC Symphony Orchestra (1937–1954), and this led to his becoming a household name, especially in the United States, through his radio and television broadcasts and many recordings of the operatic and symphonic repertoire.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Toscanini was born in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, His father was a tailor. He won a scholarship to the Parma Conservatory, where he studied the cello. Living conditions at the conservatory were harsh and strict. For example, the menu at the conservatory consisted almost entirely of fish; in his later years, Toscanini steadfastly refused to eat anything that came from the sea.

He joined the orchestra of an opera company organized by Claudio Rossi, with which he toured Brazil in 1886. After performing in Sao Paulo, the locally hired conductor, Leopoldo Miguez relinquished the post a few hours before the performance of &quot;Aida&quot; in Rio de Janeiro on June 25, telling the newspapers that his decision had been caused by the behavior of the orchestra. His substitute, Carlo Superti, was heavily contested by the public, failing even to give the attack to the orchestra. 
In desperation, the singers suggested the name of their assistant chorusmaster, who knew the whole opera from memory. Although he had no conducting experience, Toscanini was eventually persuaded by the musicians to take up the baton at 9:15 pm, and led a performance of the two-and-a-half hour opera, completely from memory. 

The public was taken by surprise, at first by the youth, charisma and sheer intensity of this unknown conductor, then by his solid musicianship. The result was astounding acclaim. For the rest of that season, Toscanini conducted 18 operas, each one an absolute success. Thus began his career as a conductor, at age 19.
Upon returning to Italy, Toscanini set out on a dual path. He continued to conduct, his first appearance in Italy being at the Teatro Carignano in Turin, on November 4, 1886, in the world premiere of the revised version of Alfredo Catalani&#x27;s &quot;Edmea&quot; (it had had its premiere in its original form at La Scala, Milan, on February 27, of that year). This was the beginning of Toscanini&#x27;s lifelong friendship and championing of Catalani; he even named his first daughter Wally after the heroine of Catalani&#x27;s opera &quot;La Wally&quot;. He also returned to his chair in the cello section, and participated as cellist in the world premiere of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; (La Scala, Milan, 1887) under the composer&#x27;s supervision. Verdi, who habitually complained that conductors never seemed interested in directing his scores the way he had written them, was impressed by reports from Arrigo Boito about Toscanini&#x27;s ability to interpret his scores. The composer was also impressed when Toscanini consulted him personally about Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;, suggesting an &quot;allargando&quot; where it was not set out in the score. Verdi said that he had left it out for fear that &quot;certain interpreters would have exaggerated the marking&quot;.

===National and international fame===
Gradually, Toscanini&#x27;s reputation as an operatic conductor of unusual authority and skill supplanted his cello career. In the following decade, he consolidated his career in Italy, entrusted with the world premieres of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. In 1896, Toscanini conducted his first symphonic concert (in Turin, with works by Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner). He exhibited a considerable capacity for hard work, conducting 43 concerts in Turin in 1898. By 1898, Toscanini was Principal Conductor at La Scala, where he remained until 1908, returning as Music Director, from 1921 to 1929.
In December 1920, he brought the La Scala Orchestra to the United States on a concert tour during which time he made his first recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey.
In 1908, Toscanini joined the Metropolitan Opera in New York, along with Giulio Gatti-Casazza who left La Scala to assume the 
post as the Met&#x27;s general manager. During Toscanini&#x27;s seven seasons at the Met (1908–1915), he made several reforms and set many standards in opera production and performance which are still in practice today. At the end of his final season with the Metropolitan Opera in May 1915, Toscanini was set to return to Europe aboard the doomed RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, but instead cut his concert schedule short and left a week early, aboard the Italian liner &quot;Duca degli Abruzzi&quot;. Toscanini conducted the New York Philharmonic from 1926 until 1936; he toured Europe with the Philharmonic in 1930. At each performance, he and the orchestra were acclaimed by both critics and audiences. Toscanini was the first non-German conductor to appear at Bayreuth (1930–1931), and the New York Philharmonic was the first non-German orchestra to play there.

In the 1930s, he conducted at the Salzburg Festival (1934–1937), as well as the 1936 inaugural concert of the Palestine Orchestra (later renamed the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) in Tel Aviv, later conducting them in Jerusalem, Haifa, Cairo and Alexandria. During his engagement with the New York Philharmonic, his concert master was Hans Lange, the son of the last Master of the Sultan&#x27;s Music in Istanbul, who, later, became conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the founder of the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra as a professional ensemble.

During his career as an opera conductor, Toscanini collaborated with such artists as Enrico Caruso, Feodor Chaliapin, Ezio Pinza, Giovanni Martinelli, Geraldine Farrar and Aureliano Pertile.

===Departure from Italy to the United States===
In 1919, Toscanini unsuccessfully ran on the Socialist ticket for a minor municipal office in Milan. He had been called &quot;the greatest conductor in the world&quot; by Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. Toscanini had already become disillusioned with fascism before the October 1922 March on Rome and repeatedly defied the Italian dictator. He refused to display Mussolini&#x27;s photograph or conduct the Fascist anthem &quot;Giovinezza&quot; at La Scala. He raged to a friend, &quot;If I were capable of killing a man, I would kill Mussolini.&quot;

At a memorial concert for Italian composer Giuseppe Martucci on May 14, 1931, at the &quot;Teatro Comunale&quot; in Bologna, Toscanini was ordered to begin by playing &quot;Giovinezza&quot;, but he flatly refused, despite the presence of fascist communications minister Costanzo Ciano in the audience. Afterwards, he was, in his own words, &quot;attacked, injured and repeatedly hit in the face&quot; by a group of Blackshirts. Mussolini, incensed by the conductor&#x27;s refusal, had his phone tapped, placed him under constant surveillance, and confiscated his passport. His passport was returned only after a world outcry over Toscanini&#x27;s treatment. Upon the outbreak of World War II, Toscanini left Italy. He returned in 1946 to conduct a concert for the opening of the restored La Scala Opera House, which was heavily damaged by bombing during the war.

===NBC Symphony Orchestra===

In 1936, Toscanini resigned from the New York Philharmonic, returned to Italy and was considering retirement; David Sarnoff, president of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), proposed creating a symphony orchestra for radio concerts and engaging Toscanini to conduct it. Toscanini was initially uninterested in the proposal, but Sarnoff sent Toscanini&#x27;s friend Samuel Chotzinoff to visit the conductor in Milan; Chotzinoff was able to persuade the wary Toscanini to accept Sarnoff&#x27;s offer. Toscanini returned to the United States to conduct his first broadcast concert with the NBC Symphony Orchestra on December 25, 1937, in NBC Studio 8-H in New York City&#x27;s Rockefeller Center. The infamous dry acoustics of the specially built radio studio gave the orchestra, as heard on early broadcasts and recordings, a harsh, flat quality; some remodeling in 1942, at Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s insistence, added a bit more reverberation. In 1950, 8-H was converted into a television studio, and the NBC Symphony broadcast concerts were moved to Carnegie Hall. Studio 8-H has been home to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; since 1975. In January 1980, Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic began a series of special televised NBC concerts called &quot;Live From Studio 8H&quot;, the first one being a tribute to Toscanini, punctuated by clips from his NBC television concerts.

The NBC broadcasts were initially preserved on large 16-inch transcription discs recorded at 33-1/3 rpm, until NBC began using magnetic tape in 1949. NBC employed special RCA high fidelity microphones for the broadcasts, and they can be seen in some photographs of Toscanini and the orchestra. Some of Toscanini&#x27;s recording sessions for RCA Victor were mastered on sound film in a process developed around 1930, as detailed by RCA Victor producer Charles O&#x27;Connell in his memoirs, &quot;On and Off The Record&quot;. In addition, hundreds of hours of Toscanini&#x27;s rehearsals with the NBC Symphony were preserved and are now housed in the Toscanini Legacy archive at the New York Public Library.

Toscanini was sometimes criticized for neglecting American music, but on November 5, 1938, he conducted the world premieres of two orchestral works by Samuel Barber, &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; and &quot;Essay for Orchestra&quot;. The performance received significant critical acclaim. In 1945, Toscanini led the orchestra in recording sessions for An American in Paris by George Gershwin&#x27; and the &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; by Ferde Grofé, with Grofé in attendance. Both works had previously been performed on broadcast concerts. He also conducted broadcast performances of Copland&#x27;s &quot;El Salón México&quot;; Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with soloists Earl Wild and Benny Goodman and &quot;Piano Concerto in F&quot; with pianist Oscar Levant; and music by several other American composers, including some marches of John Philip Sousa. He even wrote his own orchestral arrangement of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, which was incorporated into the NBC Symphony&#x27;s performances of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot;, together with the Soviet Internationale. (Earlier, while music director of the New York Philharmonic, he conducted music by Abram Chasins, Bernard Wagenaar, and Howard Hanson.)

In 1940, Toscanini took the NBC Symphony on a tour of South America, sailing from New York on the ocean liner on May 14. Later that year, Toscanini had a disagreement with NBC management over their use of his musicians in other NBC broadcasts. This, among other reasons, resulted in a letter of resignation which Toscanini wrote on March 10, 1941, to RCA&#x27;s president David Sarnoff. He stated that he now wished &quot;to withdraw from the militant scene of Art&quot; and thus declined to sign a new contract for the up-coming winter season, but left the door open for an eventual return &quot;if my state of mind, health and rest will be improved enough&quot;. Leopold Stokowski was engaged on a three-year contract to conduct the orchestra and served as the NBC Symphony&#x27;s music director from 1941 until 1944. Toscanini&#x27;s state of mind soon underwent a change and he returned as Stokowski&#x27;s co-conductor for the latter&#x27;s second and third seasons, resuming full control in 1944.

One of the more remarkable broadcasts was in July 1942, when Toscanini conducted the American premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 7. Because of World War II, the score was microfilmed in the Soviet Union and brought by courier to the United States. Stokowski had previously given the US premieres of Shostakovich&#x27;s First, Third and Sixth Symphonies in Philadelphia, and in December 1941, urged NBC to obtain the score of the Seventh Symphony as he desired to conduct its premiere as well. Toscanini coveted this for himself resulting in a dispute between both conductors which he ultimately won. A major thunderstorm virtually obliterated the NBC radio signals in New York City, but the performance was heard elsewhere and preserved on transcription discs. RCA Victor first issued the recording on LP in 1967, and on compact disc in 1991. In Toscanini&#x27;s later years, the conductor expressed disdain for the work and amazement that he had actually bothered to memorize the music and conduct it.

In the spring of 1950, Toscanini led the NBC Symphony on the orchestra&#x27;s only extensive tour of the United States. It was during this tour that the well-known photograph of Toscanini riding the ski lift at Sun Valley, Idaho, was taken. Toscanini and the musicians traveled on a special train chartered by NBC.

The NBC Symphony concerts continued in Studio 8-H until 1950. That summer, 8-H was remodeled for television broadcasting, and the concerts were moved briefly to Manhattan Center, then soon thereafter moved again to Carnegie Hall at Toscanini&#x27;s insistence, where many of the orchestra&#x27;s recording sessions had been held due to the acrid acoustics of Studio 8-H. On April 4, 1954, Toscanini conducted his final broadcast performance, an all-Wagner program, in Carnegie Hall. During this final concert, the aging Toscanini suffered a minor lapse of concentration which became a &quot;&quot; when broadcast technicians overreacted with panic and took the music off the air for about a minute, substituting Toscanini&#x27;s recording of the Brahms &quot;First Symphony&quot; and making the lapse appear to be much worse than it actually was; many people still believe the orchestra stopped playing, but it did not; Toscanini quickly regained his composure and the concert continued.
In June 1954, Toscanini participated in his final RCA Victor sessions, recording re-takes of isolated unsatisfactory passages from his NBC radio broadcasts of the Verdi operas &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot;, for release on records. Toscanini was 87 years old when he finally retired. After his retirement in 1954, NBC disbanded the orchestra. Most of the orchestra&#x27;s membership reorganized as the Symphony of the Air, The ensemble appeared in concert and made recordings until its disbandment in 1963. NBC used the &quot;NBC Symphony Orchestra&quot; name once more for its 1963 telecast of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s Christmas opera for television, &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;.

Toscanini prepared and conducted seven complete operas for NBC radio broadcasts: &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;La Traviata&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot; (the two-part concert performances of &quot;Aida&quot; were also broadcast on television). All of these performances were eventually released on records and CD by RCA Victor, thus enabling modern listeners an opportunity to hear what an opera conducted by Toscanini sounded like. He also conducted, broadcast and recorded entire acts and various excerpts from several other operas.

===Last years===
With the help of his son Walter, Toscanini spent his remaining years evaluating and editing tapes and transcriptions of his broadcast performances with the NBC Symphony for possible future release on records. Many of these recordings were eventually issued by RCA Victor.

Sachs and other biographers have documented the numerous conductors, singers, and musicians who visited Toscanini during his retirement. He enjoyed watching boxing and wrestling matches, as well as comedy programs on television.
Toscanini suffered a stroke on New Year&#x27;s Day 1957, and he died on January 16, at the age of 89 at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in New York City. It was his daughter Wally&#x27;s 57th birthday. His body was returned to Italy and was entombed in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan. His epitaph is taken from one account of his remarks concluding the 1926 premiere of Puccini&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Turandot&quot;: &quot;Qui finisce l&#x27;opera, perché a questo punto il maestro è morto&quot; (&quot;Here the opera ends, because at this point the maestro died&quot;).
During his funeral service, Leyla Gencer sang an excerpt from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;.

In his will, he left his baton to his protégée Herva Nelli, who sang in the broadcasts of &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, the Verdi Requiem, and &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;.

Toscanini was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987.

==Personal life==

Toscanini married Carla De Martini on June 21, 1897, when she was not yet 20 years old. Their first child, Walter, was born on March 19, 1898. A daughter, Wally, was born on January 16, 1900. Carla gave birth to a boy, Giorgio, in September 1901, but he died of diphtheria on June 10, 1906, in Buenos Aires. Then, that same year (1906), Carla gave birth to their second daughter, Wanda.

Toscanini worked with many great singers and musicians throughout his career, but few impressed him as much as pianist Vladimir Horowitz. They worked together a number of times and recorded Brahms&#x27; second piano concerto and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s first piano concerto with the NBC Symphony for RCA Victor. Horowitz also became close to Toscanini and his family. In 1933, Wanda Toscanini married Horowitz, with the conductor&#x27;s blessings and warnings; they remained married until Vladimir Horowitz&#x27; death in 1989. Wanda&#x27;s daughter Sonia was photographed by &quot;Life&quot; playing with the conductor.

During World War II, Toscanini lived in Wave Hill, a historic home in Riverdale.

Despite the reported infidelities revealed in Toscanini&#x27;s letters documented by Harvey Sachs (most famously, with soprano Geraldine Farrar), he remained married to Carla until she died on June 23, 1951, and Toscanini remained widowed.

==Innovations==
At La Scala, which had what was then the most modern stage lighting system installed in 1901 and an orchestral pit installed in 1907, Toscanini pushed through reforms in the performance of opera. He insisted on dimming the house-lights during performances. As his biographer Harvey Sachs wrote: &quot;He believed that a performance could not be artistically successful unless unity of intention was first established among all the components: singers, orchestra, chorus, staging, sets, and costumes.&quot;

Toscanini favored the traditional orchestral seating plan with the first violins and cellos on the left, the violas on the near right, and the second violins on the far right.

==Premieres==
Toscanini conducted the world premieres of many operas, four of which have become part of the standard operatic repertoire: &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; and &quot;Turandot&quot;. He also took an active role in Alfano&#x27;s completion of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;. He conducted the first Italian performances of &quot;Siegfried&quot;, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, and &quot;Euryanthe&quot;, as well as the South American premieres of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and the North American premieres of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 7. He also conducted the world premiere of Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings.&quot;

==Recorded legacy==
===Overview===
Toscanini made his first recordings in December 1920 with the La Scala Orchestra in the Trinity Church studio of the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, and his last with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in June 1954 in Carnegie Hall. His entire catalog of commercial recordings was issued by RCA Victor, save for two recordings for Brunswick in 1926 (his first by the electrical process) with the New York Philharmonic and a series of recordings with the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1937 to 1939 for EMI&#x27;s His Master&#x27;s Voice label (issued in the US by RCA Victor, EMI&#x27;s American affiliate). Toscanini also conducted the New York Philharmonic in Carnegie Hall for RCA Victor in several recordings in 1929 and 1936. He made a series of long-unissued recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra for RCA Victor in Philadelphia&#x27;s Academy of Music in 1941 and 1942. All of Toscanini&#x27;s commercially issued RCA Victor and EMI recordings have been digitally remastered and released on compact disc. There are also recorded concerts with various European orchestras, especially with La Scala Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra.
In 2012, RCA Red Seal released a new 84 CD boxed set reissue of Toscanini&#x27;s complete RCA Victor recordings and commercially issued EMI recordings with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 2013, EMI Classics issued a 6-CD set containing Toscanini&#x27;s complete EMI recordings with the BBC Symphony. 
Toscanini&#x27;s dislike of recording was well-known; he especially despised the acoustic method, and for several years he recorded only sporadically as a result. He was fifty-three years old and had been conducting for thirty-four years when he made his first records in 1920, and did not begin recording on a regular basis until 1938, after he became conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra at the age of seventy. Over the years as the recording process improved, so did Toscanini&#x27;s attitude towards making records and eventually he became more interested in preserving his performances for posterity. The majority of Toscanini&#x27;s recordings were made with the NBC Symphony and cover the bulk of his repertoire. These recordings document the final phase of his 68-year conducting career.

===Specialties===
Toscanini was especially famous for his performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Richard Strauss, Debussy and his own compatriots Rossini, Verdi, Boito and Puccini. He made many recordings, especially towards the end of his career, most of which are still in print. In addition, there are many recordings available of his broadcast performances, as well as his rehearsals with the NBC Symphony.

===Charles O&#x27;Connell on Toscanini===
Charles O&#x27;Connell, who produced many of Toscanini&#x27;s early NBC Symphony recordings, stated that RCA Victor decided to record the orchestra in Carnegie Hall whenever possible, after numerous customer complaints about the flat and dull-sounding early recordings made in Studio 8-H in 1938 and 1939. Nevertheless, some recording sessions continued to be held in Studio 8-H as late as June 1950, probably because of alterations to the studio beginning in 1939, including installation of an acoustical shell in 1941 at the insistence of Leopold Stokowski before he temporarily replaced Toscanini as principal conductor of the NBC Symphony in the fall of 1941. O&#x27;Connell and others often complained the Maestro was little interested in the details of recorded sound and, as Harvey Sachs wrote, Toscanini was frequently disappointed that the microphones failed to pick up everything he heard as he led the orchestra. O&#x27;Connell even complained of Toscanini&#x27;s failure to cooperate with him during the sessions. Toscanini himself was often disappointed that the 78-rpm discs failed to fully capture all of the instruments in the orchestra or altered their sound to such an extent they became unrecognizable. Those who attended Toscanini&#x27;s concerts later said the NBC string section was especially outstanding.

===The Philadelphia Orchestra recordings===
O&#x27;Connell also extensively documented RCA&#x27;s technical problems with the series of recordings by Toscanini and the Philadelphia Orchestra, made in 1941–42, which required extensive electronic editing before they could be issued (well after Toscanini&#x27;s death, beginning in 1963, with the rest following in 1977). Harvey Sachs also recounts that the wax masters were damaged during processing, possibly because of the use of somewhat-inferior materials imposed by wartime restrictions. Toscanini had listened to several of the test pressings and had given his approval to some of the recordings, rejected others and was prepared to re-record the unsatisfactory sides. Unfortunately, the 1942-44 Petrillo/AFM recording ban had begun and prevented immediate retakes; by the end of the ban over two years later, the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s contract with RCA Victor had expired and the orchestra had signed with Columbia Records. RCA Victor apparently was now hesitant to promote the orchestra and recordings since it was now under contract to arch-rival Columbia and declared the defective Philadelphia masters unsalvageable. When told that RCA had finally decided to scrap the Philadelphia recordings, Toscanini vehemently exclaimed, &quot;I worked like a dog!&quot;. The conductor eventually recorded all of the same music with the NBC Symphony. The best sounding of the Philadelphia recordings is the Schubert C-Major Symphony (The &quot;Great&quot;), which had been successfully restored and issued by RCA Victor in 1963. In 1968, the Philadelphia Orchestra returned to RCA and the company was now more favorable toward issuing all of the discs. RCA finally released a complete edition of the Toscanini/Philadelphia recordings in 1977, and it was suggested by Sachs and others at that date some of the masters may have deteriorated further. As for the historic nature of the recordings, even on the first RCA Victor compact disc issue, released in 1991, some of the sides have considerable surface noise and some distortion, especially during the louder passages. Nevertheless, despite the occasional problems, the sound has been markedly improved on CD, and the entire set is an impressive document of Toscanini&#x27;s collaboration with the Philadelphia musicians. A second RCA CD reissue of the Philadelphia recordings from 2006 makes even more effective use of digital editing and processing in an attempt to produce improved sound. Longtime Philadelphia conductor Eugene Ormandy expressed his admiration for what Toscanini achieved with the orchestra.

===High fidelity and stereo===
When magnetic tape replaced direct wax disc recording and high fidelity long-playing records were both introduced in the late 1940s, Toscanini said he was much happier making recordings. Sachs wrote that an Italian journalist, Raffaele Calzini, said Toscanini told him, &quot;My son Walter sent me the test pressing of the [Beethoven] Ninth from America; I want to hear and check how it came out, and possibly to correct it. These long-playing records often make me happy.&quot;

NBC recorded all of Toscanini&#x27;s broadcast performances on 16-inch  rpm transcription discs from the start of the Maestro&#x27;s broadcasts in December 1937, but the infrequent use of higher-fidelity sound film for recording sessions began as early as 1933 with the Philharmonic, and by December 1948, improved high fidelity made its appearance when RCA began using magnetic tape on a regular basis. High fidelity quickly became the norm for the company and the industry. NBC Radio followed, adopting the new technology in the fall of 1949 for its NBC Symphony broadcasts, among others. The first Toscanini recording sessions in Carnegie Hall followed immediately thereafter, although individual takes continued as with 78s, each running only about minutes. RCA continued in this vein with 7-inch tape reels until 1953, when long takes on 10-inch reels were finally implemented for the recording of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;. With RCA&#x27;s experiments in stereo beginning in early 1953 when two-track decks were first delivered by the engineers to the record producers (per Jack Pfeiffer, 11/77 interview, NYC, by CWR), stereo tapes were eventually made of Toscanini&#x27;s final two broadcast concerts, plus the dress rehearsal for the final broadcast, as documented by Samuel Antek in &quot;This Was Toscanini&quot; and by Pfeiffer. These followed test sessions in New York&#x27;s Manhattan Center in December of Delibes with members of the Boston Symphony under Pierre Monteux, in February 1954 with the full Boston Symphony under Charles Munch in Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Damnation of Faust&quot;, and in early March with the NBC Symphony in Manhattan Center again under Stokowski doing the Beethoven &quot;Pastoral&quot; symphony. For Toscanini, later in March and in early April, the microphones were placed relatively close to the orchestra with limited separation, so the stereo effects were not as dramatic as the commercial &quot;Living Stereo&quot; recordings RCA Victor began to make in March with the Chicago Symphony, just a few weeks earlier. Two days after the final concert, Guido Cantelli took the podium in a hastily organized session to record the Franck Symphony in D minor, for RCA Victor using the same microphone and equipment set-up put in place for the Maestro. The stereo version of the recording was finally released on LP by RCA in 1978 (Warner Music Group now holds the rights and has issued several CD versions). Toscanini&#x27;s June sessions were recorded monophonically to correct unsatisfactory portions of the broadcast recordings of &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot;.

One more example of Toscanini and the NBC Symphony in stereo now also exists in a commercially available edition. This one is of the January 27, 1951, concert devoted to the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot;, previously recorded and released in high-fidelity monophonic sound by RCA Victor. Recently a separate NBC tape of the same performance, using a different microphone in a different location, was acquired by Pristine Audio. Using modern digital technology the company constructed a stereophonic version of the performance from the two recordings which it made available in 2009. The company calls this an example of &quot;accidental stereo&quot;.

===Rehearsals and broadcasts===

Many hundreds of hours of Toscanini&#x27;s rehearsals were recorded. Some of these have circulated in limited edition recordings. Many broadcast recordings with orchestras other than the NBC have also survived, including: The New York Philharmonic from 1933 to 1936, 1942, and 1945; The BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1935 to 1939; The Lucerne Festival Orchestra; and broadcasts from the Salzburg Festival in the late 1930s. Documents of Toscanini&#x27;s guest appearances with the La Scala Orchestra from 1946 until 1952 include a live recording of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with the young Renata Tebaldi. Toscanini&#x27;s ten NBC Symphony telecasts from 1948 until 1952 were preserved in kinescope films of the live broadcasts. These films, issued by RCA on VHS tape and laser disc and on DVD by Testament, provide unique video documentation of the passionate yet restrained podium technique for which he was well known.

===Recording guide===
A guide to Toscanini&#x27;s recording career can be found in Mortimer H. Frank&#x27;s &quot;From the Pit to the Podium: Toscanini in America&quot; in &quot;International Classical Record Collector&quot; (1998, 15 8–21) and Christopher Dyment&#x27;s &quot;Toscanini&#x27;s European Inheritance&quot; in &quot;International Classical Record Collector&quot; (1998, 15 22–8). Frank and Dyment also discuss Toscanini&#x27;s performance history in the 50th anniversary issue of Classic Record Collector (2006, 47) Frank with &#x27;Toscanini – Myth and Reality&#x27; (10–14) and Dyment &#x27;A Whirlwind in London&#x27; (15–21) This issue also contains interviews with people who performed with Toscanini – Jon Tolansky &#x27;Licia Albanese – Maestro and Me&#x27; (22–6) and &#x27;A Mesmerising Beat: John Tolansky talks to some of those who worked with Arturo Toscanini, to discover some of the secrets of his hold over singers, orchestras and audiences.&#x27; (34–7). There is also a feature article on Toscanini&#x27;s interpretation of Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony – Norman C. Nelson, &#x27;First Among Equals ... Toscanini&#x27;s interpretation of Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony in the context of others&#x27; (28–33)

===Arturo Toscanini Society===
In 1969, Clyde J. Key acted on a dream he had of meeting Toscanini by starting the Arturo Toscanini Society to release a number of &quot;unapproved&quot; live performances by Toscanini. As the magazine &quot;Time&quot; reported, Key scoured the U.S. and Europe for off-the-air transcriptions of Toscanini broadcasts, acquiring almost 5,000 transcriptions (all transferred to tape) of previously unreleased material—a complete catalogue of broadcasts by the Maestro between 1933 and 1954. It included about 50 concerts that were never broadcast, but which were recorded surreptitiously by engineers supposedly testing their equipment.

A private, nonprofit club based in Dumas, Texas, it offered members five or six LPs annually for a $25-a-year membership fee. Key&#x27;s first package offering included Brahms&#x27; &quot;German Requiem&quot;, Haydn&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 88 and 104, and Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;, all NBC Symphony broadcasts dating from the late 1930s or early 1940s. In 1970, the Society releases included Sibelius&#x27; Symphony No. 4, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Scottish&quot; Symphony, dating from the same NBC period; and a Rossini-Verdi-Puccini LP emanating from the post-War reopening of La Scala on May 11, 1946, with the Maestro conducting. That same year it released a Beethoven bicentennial set that included the 1935 &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; with the Philharmonic and LPs of the 1948 televised concert of the ninth symphony taken from an FM radio transcription, complete with Ben Grauer&#x27;s comments. (In the early 1990s, the kinescopes of these and the other televised concerts were released by RCA with soundtracks dubbed in from the NBC radio transcriptions; in 2006, they were re-released by Testament on DVD.)

Additional releases included a number of Beethoven symphonies recorded with the New York Philharmonic during the 1930s, a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 27 on February 20, 1936, at which Rudolf Serkin made his New York debut, and a 1940 broadcast version of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;.

Because the Arturo Toscanini Society was nonprofit, Key said he believed he had successfully bypassed both copyright restrictions and the maze of contractual ties between RCA and the Maestro&#x27;s family. RCA&#x27;s attorneys were soon looking into the matter to see if they agreed. As long as it stayed small, the Society appeared to offer little real competition to RCA. But classical-LP profits were low enough even in 1970, and piracy by fly-by-night firms so prevalent within the industry at that time (an estimated $100 million in tape sales for 1969 alone), that even a benevolent buccaneer outfit like the Arturo Toscanini Society had to be looked at twice before it could be tolerated.

Magazine and newspaper reports subsequently detailed legal action taken against Key and the Society, presumably after some of the LPs began to appear in retail stores. Toscanini fans and record collectors were dismayed because, although Toscanini had not approved the release of these performances in every case, many of them were found to be further proof of the greatness of the Maestro&#x27;s musical talents. One outstanding example of a remarkable performance not approved by the Maestro was his December 1948 NBC broadcast of Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;, released on an LP by the Society. (A kinescope of the same performance, from the television simulcast, has been released on VHS and laser disc by RCA/BMG and on DVD by Testament.) There was speculation that the Toscanini family itself, prodded by his daughter Wanda, had sought to defend the Maestro&#x27;s original decisions (made mostly during his last years) on what should be released. Walter Toscanini later admitted that his father likely rejected performances that were satisfactory. Whatever the real reasons, the Arturo Toscanini Society was forced to disband and cease releasing any further recordings.

==Television==
Arturo Toscanini was one of the first conductors to make extended appearances on live television. Between 1948 and 1952, he conducted ten concerts telecast on NBC, including a two-part concert performance of Verdi&#x27;s complete opera &quot;Aida&quot; starring Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker, and the first complete telecast of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. All of these were simulcast on radio. These concerts were all shown only once during that four-year span, but they were preserved on kinescopes.

The telecasts began on March 20, 1948, with an all-Wagner program, including the Prelude to Act III of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;; the overture and bacchanale from &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;; &quot;Forest Murmurs&quot; from &quot;Siegfried&quot;; &quot;Dawn and Siegfried&#x27;s Rhine Journey&quot; from &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;; and &quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot; from &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. On the very same day that this concert was telecast live, conductor Eugene Ormandy also made his live television concert debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra. They performed Weber&#x27;s overture to &quot;Der Freischutz&quot; and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony no. 1, which had been recently rediscovered. The Ormandy concert was telecast by rival network CBS, but the schedules were arranged so that the two programs would not interfere with one another.

Less than a month after the first Toscanini televised concert, a complete performance by the conductor of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony was telecast on April 3, 1948. On November 13, 1948, there was an all-Brahms program, including the Concerto for Violin, Cello, and Orchestra in A minor (Mischa Mischakoff, violin; Frank Miller, cello); &quot;Liebeslieder-Walzer&quot;, Op. 52 (with two pianists and a small chorus); and &quot;Hungarian Dance No. 1 in G minor.&quot; On December 3, 1948, Toscanini conducted Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40 in G minor; Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;; and Wagner&#x27;s original overture to &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

There were two Toscanini telecasts in 1949, both devoted to the concert performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; from studio 8H. Acts I and II were telecast on March 26 and III and IV on April 2. Portions of the audio were rerecorded in June 1954 for the commercial release on LP records. As the video shows, the soloists were placed close to Toscanini, in front of the orchestra, while the robed members of the Robert Shaw Chorale were on risers behind the orchestra.

There were no Toscanini telecasts in 1950, but they resumed from Carnegie Hall on November 3, 1951, with Weber&#x27;s overture to &quot;Euryanthe&quot; and Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 1. On December 29, 1951, there was another all-Wagner program that included the two excerpts from &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; featured on the March 1948 telecast, plus the Prelude to Act II of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;; the Prelude and Liebestod from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;; and &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death and Funeral Music&quot; from &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

On March 15, 1952, Toscanini conducted the Symphonic Interlude from Franck&#x27;s &quot;Rédemption&quot;; Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;En saga&quot;; Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nuages&quot; and &quot;Fêtes&quot; from &quot;Nocturnes&quot;; and the overture of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot;. The final live Toscanini telecast, on March 22, 1952, included Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, and Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;.

The NBC cameras were often left on Toscanini for extended periods, documenting not only his baton techniques but his deep involvement in the music. At the end of a piece, Toscanini generally nodded rather than bowed and exited the stage quickly. Although NBC continued to broadcast the orchestra on radio until April 1954, telecasts were abandoned after March 1952.

As part of a restoration project initiated by the Toscanini family in the late 1980s, the kinescopes were fully restored and issued by RCA on VHS and laser disc beginning in 1989. The audio portion of the sound was taken, not from the noisy kinescopes, but from 33-1/3 rpm 16-inch transcription disc and high fidelity audio tape recordings made simultaneously by RCA technicians during the televised concerts. The hi-fi audio was synchronized with the kinescope video for the home video release. Original introductions by NBC&#x27;s longtime announcer Ben Grauer were replaced with new commentary by Martin Bookspan. The entire group of Toscanini videos has since been reissued by Testament on DVD, with further improvements to the sound.

==Film==
In December 1943, Toscanini appeared in a 31-minute film for the United States Office of War Information titled &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot;, directed by Alexander Hammid. Mostly filmed in NBC&#x27;s Studio 8-H, the film, narrated by Burgess Meredith, consists of Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Verdi&#x27;s overture to &quot;La forza del destino&quot; and &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot; (Hymn of the Nations), a cantata which contains the national anthems of England, France, and Italy (the World War I allied nations), to which Toscanini added the Soviet &quot;Internationale&quot; and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Tenor Jan Peerce and the Westminster Choir performed in the latter work.

The film was commercially released by RCA/BMG on DVD in 2004. The &quot;Internationale&quot; was cut from the 1943 film after its original release, but the complete recording of &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot; including the &quot;Internationale&quot; can be heard on all RCA LP and CD releases of the cantata. &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot; was nominated for a 1944 Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.

&quot;&quot; is a 1985 documentary made for cable television. The film features archival footage of the conductor and interviews with musicians who worked with him. This film was released on VHS and in 2004 on the same DVD which included the film, &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot;.

Toscanini is the subject of the 1988 fictionalized biography &quot;Il giovane Toscanini&quot; (&quot;Young Toscanini&quot;), starring C. Thomas Howell and Elizabeth Taylor, and directed by Franco Zeffirelli. It received scathing reviews and was never officially released in the United States. The film is a fictional recounting of the events that led up to Toscanini making his conducting debut in Rio de Janeiro in 1886. Although nearly all of the plot is embellished, the events surrounding the sudden and unexpected conducting debut are based on fact.

John Kavanagh plays Toscanini in a brief scene in Florence Foster Jenkins (film).

==Acclaim and criticism==
Throughout his career, Toscanini was virtually idolized by the critics, as well as by most fellow musicians and the public alike. He enjoyed the kind of consistent critical acclaim during his life that few other musicians have had. He was featured three times on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in 1926, 1934, and again in 1948. In the magazine&#x27;s history, he is the only conductor to have been so honored.
On March 25, 1989, the United States Postal Service issued a 25 cent postage stamp in his honor. Some online critics such as Peter Gutmann have dismissed much of what was written about Toscanini during his lifetime and for about ten years afterwards as &quot;adoring puffery&quot;. Nevertheless, composers and others who worked with Toscanini, including Aaron Copland in an audio interview, readily acknowledged what they felt was his greatness.
Over the past thirty years or so, as a new generation has appeared, an increasing amount of revisionist criticism has been directed at Toscanini. These critics contend that Toscanini was ultimately a detriment to American music rather than an asset because of the tremendous marketing of him by RCA as the greatest conductor of all time and his preference to perform mostly older European music. According to Harvey Sachs, Mortimer Frank, and B. H. Haggin, this criticism can be traced to the lack of focus on Toscanini as a conductor rather than his legacy. Frank, in his 2002 book &quot;Toscanini: The NBC Years&quot;, rejects this revisionism quite strongly, and cites the author Joseph Horowitz (author of &quot;Understanding Toscanini&quot;) as perhaps the most extreme of these critics. Frank writes that this revisionism has unfairly influenced younger listeners and critics, who may have not heard as many of Toscanini&#x27;s performances as older listeners, and as a result, Toscanini&#x27;s reputation, extraordinarily high in the years that he was active, has suffered a decline. Conversely, Joseph Horowitz contends that those who keep the Toscanini legend alive are members of a &quot;Toscanini cult&quot;, an idea not altogether refuted by Frank, but not embraced by him, either.

Some contemporary critics, particularly Virgil Thomson, also took Toscanini to task for not paying enough attention to the &quot;modern repertoire&quot; (i.e., 20th-century composers, of which Thomson was one). It may be speculated, knowing Toscanini&#x27;s antipathy toward much 20th-century music, that perhaps Thomson had a feeling that the conductor would never have played any of his (Thomson&#x27;s) music, and that perhaps because of this, Thomson bore a resentment against him. During Toscanini&#x27;s middle years, however, such now widely accepted composers as Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy, whose music the conductor held in very high regard, were considered to be radical and modern. He performed works by Zoltán Kodály, and in 1930 Toscanini requested him to compose a symphony which would be premiered in 1961 and dedicated to the memory of Toscanini. He also performed excerpts from Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot; and his &quot;Feu d&#x27;artifice&quot;, two of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonies (Nos. 1 and 7), and three of George Gershwin&#x27;s most famous works, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, and the Piano Concerto in F, though his performances of these last three works have been criticized as not being &quot;jazzy&quot; enough.

Another criticism leveled at Toscanini stems from the constricted sound quality that comes from many of his recordings, notably those made in NBC&#x27;s Studio 8-H. Studio 8-H was foremost a radio and later a television studio, not a true concert hall. Its dry acoustics lacking in much reverberation, while ideal for broadcasting, were unsuited for symphonic concerts and opera. It is widely held that Toscanini favored it because its close miking enabled listeners to hear every instrumental strand in the orchestra clearly, something in which the conductor strongly believed.

Toscanini has also been criticized for metronomic (rhythmically too rigid) performances:

Toscanini has also been noted for his temper in rehearsals. Apparently less controlled later in life, he was known to vent his anger in front of the orchestra when he thought they were not playing well. One well-known example comes from a recording of a rehearsal for &quot;La Traviata&quot; in which he yells in frustration when the double basses aren&#x27;t quite together.

The song (If You Can&#x27;t Sing It) You&#x27;ll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini) is a satire of Toscanini.

==Legacy==
Beginning in 1963, NBC Radio broadcast a weekly series of programs entitled &quot;Toscanini: The Man Behind The Legend&quot;, commemorating Toscanini&#x27;s years with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The show, hosted by NBC announcer Ben Grauer, who had also hosted many of the original Toscanini broadcasts, featured interviews with members of the conductor&#x27;s family, as well as musicians of the NBC Symphony, David Sarnoff, and noted classical musicians who had worked with the conductor, such as Giovanni Martinelli. It spotlighted partial or complete rebroadcasts of many of Toscanini&#x27;s recordings. The program ran for at least three years, and did not feature any of the revisionist commentary about the conductor one finds so often today in magazines such as American Record Guide. The series was rebroadcast by PBS radio in the late 1970s.

In 1986, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts purchased the bulk of Toscanini&#x27;s papers, scores and sound recordings from his heirs. Named The Toscanini Legacy, this vast collection contains thousands of letters, programs and various documents, over 1,800 scores and more than 400 hours of sound recordings. A finding aid for the scores and sound recordings is available on the library&#x27;s website. In-house finding aids are available for other parts of the collection.

The library also has many other collections that have Toscanini materials in them, such as the Bruno Walter papers, the Fiorello H. La Guardia papers, and a collection of material from Rose Bampton.

==&quot;The Maestro Revisited&quot;==
In 1967, &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; telecast a program entitled &quot;Toscanini: The Maestro Revisited&quot;, written and narrated by &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Harold C. Schonberg, and featuring commentary by conductors Eugene Ormandy, George Szell, Erich Leinsdorf and Milton Katims (who had played viola in the NBC Symphony Orchestra). The program also featured clips from two of Toscanini&#x27;s television concerts, in the days before they were remastered for video and DVD.

<text>Scilab is a free and open-source, cross-platform numerical computational package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language. It can be used for signal processing, statistical analysis, image enhancement, fluid dynamics simulations, numerical optimization, and modeling, simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems and (if the corresponding toolbox is installed) symbolic manipulations.

Scilab is one of the two major open-source alternatives to MATLAB, the other one being GNU Octave. Scilab puts less emphasis on syntactic compatibility with MATLAB than Octave does, but it is similar enough that some authors suggest that it is easy to transfer skills between the two systems.

==Introduction==

Scilab is a high-level, numerically oriented programming language. The language provides an interpreted programming environment, with matrices as the main data type. By using matrix-based computation, dynamic typing, and automatic memory management, many numerical problems may be expressed in a reduced number of code lines, as compared to similar solutions using traditional languages, such as Fortran, C, or C++. This allows users to rapidly construct models for a range of mathematical problems. While the language provides simple matrix operations such as multiplication, the Scilab package also provides a library of high-level operations such as correlation and complex multidimensional arithmetic.

Scilab also includes a free package called Xcos for modeling and simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems, including both continuous and discrete sub-systems. Xcos is the open source equivalent to Simulink from the MathWorks.

As the syntax of Scilab is similar to MATLAB, Scilab includes a source code translator for assisting the conversion of code from MATLAB to Scilab. Scilab is available free of cost under an open source license. Due to the open source nature of the software, some user contributions have been integrated into the main program.

== Syntax ==
Scilab syntax is largely based on the MATLAB language. The simplest way to execute Scilab code is to type it in at the prompt, codice_1, in the graphical command window. In this way, Scilab can be used as an interactive mathematical shell.

Hello World! in Scilab:

disp(&#x27;Hello World&#x27;);
Plotting a 3D surface function:

// A simple plot of z = f(x,y)
t=[0:0.3:2*%pi]&#x27;;
z=sin(t)*cos(t&#x27;);
plot3d(t,t&#x27;,z)
Determining the equivalent single index corresponding to a given set of subscript values:

function I=sub2ind(dims,varargin) 
//I = sub2ind(dims,i1,i2..) returns the linear index equivalent to the
//row, column, ... subscripts in the arrays i1,i2.. for an matrix of
//size dims.
//I = sub2ind(dims,Mi) returns the linear index
//equivalent to the n subscripts in the columns of the matrix Mi for a matrix
//of size dims.
 d=[1;cumprod(matrix(dims(1:$-1),-1,1))]
 for i=1:size(varargin)
 if varargin(i)==[] then I=[],return,end
 end

 if size(varargin)==1 then //subindices are the columns of the argument
 I=(varargin(1)-1)*d+1
 else //subindices are given as separated arguments
 I=1
 for i=1:size(varargin)
 I=I+(varargin(i)-1)*d(i)
 end
 end
endfunction
== Toolboxes ==
Scilab has many contributed toolboxes for different tasks, such as
* Scilab Image Processing Toolbox (SIP) and its variants (such as SIVP)
* Scilab Wavelet Toolbox
* Scilab Java and .NET Module
* Scilab Remote Access Module

More are available on ATOMS Portal or the Scilab forge.

== History ==

Scilab was created in 1990 by researchers from INRIA and École nationale des ponts et chaussées (ENPC). It was initially named Ψlab &quot;(Psilab)&quot;. The Scilab Consortium was formed in May 2003 to broaden contributions and promote Scilab as worldwide reference software in academia and industry. In July 2008, in order to improve the technology transfer, the Scilab Consortium joined the Digiteo Foundation.

Scilab 5.1, the first release compiled for Mac, was available in early 2009, and supported Mac OS X 10.5, a.k.a. Leopard. Thus, OSX 10.4, Tiger, was never supported except by porting from sources. Linux and Windows builds had been released since the beginning, with Solaris support dropped with version 3.1.1, and HP-UX dropped with version 4.1.2 after spotty support.

In June 2010, the Consortium announced the creation of Scilab Enterprises. Scilab Enterprises develops and markets, directly or through an international network of affiliated services providers, a comprehensive set of services for Scilab users. Scilab Enterprises also develops and maintains the Scilab software. The ultimate goal of Scilab Enterprises is to help make the use of Scilab more effective and easy.

In February 2017 Scilab 6.0.0 was released which leveraged the latest C++ standards and lifted memory allocation limitations.

Since July 2012, Scilab is developed and published by Scilab Enterprises and in early 2017 Scilab Enterprises was acquired by Virtual Prototyping pioneer ESI Group

Since 2019 and Scilab 6.0.2, the University of Technology of Compiègne provides resources to build and maintain the macOS version.
Since mid 2022 the Scilab team is part of Dassault Systèmes.
== Scilab Cloud App &amp; Scilab Cloud API ==
Since 2016 Scilab can be embedded in a browser and be called via an interface written in Scilab or an API.

This new deployment method has the notable advantages of masking code &amp; data as well as providing large computational power.

These features have not been included in the open source version of Scilab and are still proprietary developments.

<doc id="153565" wikidata="Q2418275" url="?curid=153565" title="Acaster Malbis">
<text>Acaster Malbis () is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of the City of York, England. It is located on the River Ouse, almost south of York. Nearby are the villages of Copmanthorpe to the north-west, Bishopthorpe 2 miles to the north and Appleton Roebuck to the south-west. The parish covers an area of about .

The Latin word for a camp is &quot;castra&quot; indicating that the Roman army may once have been based here. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Acastre&quot;. The &quot;Malbis&quot; is derived from the Norman Malbysse or De Malebys family. Malbis was a Norman personal name which in French means &quot;very swarthy&quot;.

There was a Royal Air Force station next to the village during and immediately after the Second World War.

According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 578, increasing to 669 at the 2011 census. There are two churches and an inn in the village. The village is also the home for a holiday park.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Selby District in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==History==

===Early history===
The land on which the village stands was named by the Romans as Val-Caester. In Latin, Val means &quot;a wall&quot; and Castrum means a &quot;camp&quot;. When the Romans departed the land was acquired by an Anglo-Saxon called Aca.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Acastre&quot; in the wapentake of Ainsty and was recorded as belonging to two men, Elsi and Robert. Ownership passed to the Malbysse family during the reign of Richard I. The family held the lands for about 200 years. In 1190, Richard Malebysse was a leader involved in the massacre of the Jews at Cliffords Tower in York. Richard I dismissed the sheriff and constable of York and imposed severe penalties on the city and arrested many of those who had taken part. Richard Malbysse had been described by a Hebrew scribe eight years earlier as &quot;the evil beast&quot;. As punishment, the King ordered his estates seized into the king&#x27;s hand and two of his esquires were thrown into prison.

In 1314, John De Malbysse was appointed as a sheriff of the county. His daughter married into the Fairfax family who then inherited the lands after the deaths of John De Malbysse and his son Walter. The Fairfax family held the estates until 1745 when it was sold to Lady Dawes and was eventually inherited by Lord Wenlock.

During the English Civil War, the city of York was under siege from Scottish and Parliamentarian Armies. They had settled around the city in a great arc, with Lord Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s army to the east and the Scots to the south and west. A bridge of boats, similar to those constructed at Nether Poppleton, was constructed over the River Ouse at Acaster Malbis to allow communications between the two armies.

===RAF Acaster Malbis===

RAF Acaster Malbis, situated between the villages of Acaster Malbis and Acaster Selby, was commissioned in 1942. Originally it was a grass airfield used by the No 601 Squadron Auxiliary Air Force from 6 January 1942 until April of that year. They flew American Bell P39 Airacobra fighter planes. From 6 April 1942 until the beginning of 1943 No 15 Pilots Advanced Flying Unit was established here to train recently qualified pilots to convert to twin-engine aeroplanes using the Airspeed Oxford aircraft.

On 25 January 1943 the airfield was reconstructed into a full size &#x27;Class A&#x27; bomber station, with three concrete runways, steel hangars and new administration buildings. Initially the airfield was used as a relief landing ground for heavy bombers stationed at Rufforth and Marston Moor. From November 1944, No 4 Aircrew School took over for pilots, navigators, and air gunners to complete their ground training whilst waiting for a posting to a squadron. In 1945 there were between 200 and 300 RAF personnel living on the camp.

After the end of the war, RAF Acaster Malbis was home to No 91 MU (Maintenance Unit) who were responsible for the storage and disposal of vast amounts of ammunition. This function was not complete until well into the 1950s. RAF Acaster Malbis was decommissioned in 1963 and the land sold by public auction. It resumed operations as a private airfield in the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s. Large parts of the runways have since been dug up and the buildings have fallen into disuse with many being demolished, although one hangar and the control tower still remain.

==Governance==

Acaster Malbis lies in the Bishopthorpe Ward of the Unitary Authority of the City of York. It forms part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer. It was part of the EU Constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber until Brexit in 2020. In 2011 the Ward was won by Councillor John Galvin, a member of the local Conservative Party, after holding the seat in 2015 he again won the seat in 2019, this time as an Independent.

==Demography==

In 1848 the population of the village was recorded as 322, just under half of the whole population of the parish of the same name. By 1881 this had fallen to 230. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 578, which rose to 669 by the time of the 2011 UK Census.

==Community==

There are few amenities in the village save for the 17th-century public house, The Ship Inn. This Inn features in the book, &quot;The Girl with the Red Suspenders&quot; by Barbara Whitehead. The inn reopened in May 2009 after nine months of major refurbishment, following serious flooding when the River Ouse burst its banks.

The owners of the inn have reported a number of incidents allegedly involving ghosts.

==Transport==

Harrogate Coach Travel operate a service through the village as part of the York Askham Bar to Tadcaster route.

==Education==

Acaster Malbis used to have brick built school, founded by John Knowles in 1603. As of 2010, primary education is provided at Archbishop of York&#x27;s CE Junior School in Bishopthorpe.

The village is in the Secondary School catchment area for Fulford School and Millthorpe School in York and also for Tadcaster Grammar School.

==Religion==

There are two churches in the village. Holy Trinity Church, the Church of England parish church, stands on the site of the original Norman Church. In 1360 the estates of the Malbysse family passed into the hands of the Fairfax family, who pulled the old church down. The church stands a little way out of the village on the road to Bishopthorpe. It is a Grade I listed building.

There is also a Methodist Church in the centre of the village, founded in 1880.

<text>Bishopthorpe is a village and civil parish three miles south of York in the City of York unitary authority area and ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. Bishopthorpe is close to the River Ouse, and has a population of 3,174, increasing to 3,237 at the 2011 Census. The area of Main Street and the Palace were made a conservation area in 1989 along with other open areas of the village.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Selby District in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

It was formerly known as St Andrewthorpe, but in the 13th century, Archbishop Walter de Grey bought the manor house and gave it to the Dean and Chapter of York Minster. This became Bishopthorpe Palace, the residence of the Archbishop of York. Many of the roads in Bishopthorpe are named after past Archbishops.

==History==

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is referred to as Torp/Thorpe or Badetorps, depending on which translation is used. It came to be known as Thorp-super-Usam or Thorpe-on-Ouse in 1194. By 1275 the earliest written record of the name Bishopthorpe, spelt &quot;Biscupthorpe&quot;, appears in documents. In 1202, the Prior and monks of St Andrew’s at Fishergate built the first church here and dedicated it to their patron saint. The name Thorp-super-Usam was therefore gradually superseded by Andrewthorpe or Thorpe St. Andrew. In 1226, Archbishop Walter de Gray bought property which once belonged to the Abbot of Kirkstall Abbey and the Priory of St. Andrews. By the year 1241, Archbishop Gray had built a Manor House and Chapel by the river. He conveyed this property to the Dean and Chapter of York, thus ensuring that it remained with successive Archbishops and did not fall into the king&#x27;s hands during a vacancy.

Bishopthorpe was the site, in 1323, of great council to agree a truce between King Edward II and Robert the Bruce, whose forces had been harrying Yorkshire following the Battle of Bannockburn, ending the Scots’ Great Raid of 1322.

In 1405, Archbishop Scrope was accused of being a traitor by Henry IV and was beheaded in a field near the nunnery of St Clements, now Clementhorpe. In 1763, Archbishop Drummond transformed the Palace by building the now familiar &#x27;Strawberry Gothick&#x27; west front and gatehouse. Controversy surrounding the 1832 Reform Bill saw rioters from York attempt to invade the Palace, angered by initial lack of support from Archbishop Harcourt.
The (30 Geo. 2. c. &quot;32&quot; ) saw common land enclosed, thus placing strictures on where local people could graze their animals.

In 1763, a school was founded by local yeoman, Charles Crosby and supported by the parish. The twenty boys and girls were taught to read and write and &quot;instructed in the principles of the Christian religion.&quot; In 1846, Archbishop Harcourt built a new village school. The former school, built in 1763 and situated in School Lane, was used as a girls&#x27; school and a house for the master, but was divided into three houses in the 1890s.

The main line of the North Eastern Railway was being constructed in 1871 and cut through the west end of the parish running east of Bridge Road.

In 1894, Bishorpthorpe became part of the Bishopthorpe Rural District, a rural district which was abolished in 1937 by a County Review Order. In 1895, Bishopthorpe Parish Council was formed.

Bishopthorpe Garth was designed by Walter Brierley in 1908. The War Memorial was erected in 1921 to parish men who made the supreme sacrifice during the First World War.

The Almshouses, built in 1846 by the Archbishop of York Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, were demolished in 1963 due to their deterioration and the need to widen the increasingly busy junction at Sim Balk Lane and Main Street.

==Governance, demography and economy==

===Governance===

Bishopthorpe lies in the Ward of the same name of Unitary Authority of the City of York. It forms part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer. The Ward also includes the nearby Village of Acaster Malbis. As of the 2023 elections it is represented by Councillor Michael Nicholls, Conservative.

===Demography===

By 1801 the population was 218 and by 1901 it had risen to 439 (104 houses) centred on Main Street and Chantry Lane. J Simpson began building houses in the 1930s. Later developer were Bradley Homes and Shepherd Homes who built on the defunct railway land in the 1980s.

In 1971 the village population of 2,350 almost doubles due to house building during the 1960s on the Bradley Estate in Acaster Lane. By 1949, the first council houses, made up of twenty semi-detached dwellings, were built in the village in Maple Avenue. The 2001 census showed that the population was 3,174. There were 1,424 dwellings, of which 33.9% were detached and 62.3% were semi-detached or terraced. House ownership was recorded at 86.9%. The largest Age Group within the population, 29.5%, were between 45 and 64 years old with 25.3% between 25 and 44 years old. Of the population aged between 16 and 74 years old, 64.99% declared they were in some form of employment and 31.1% said they were retired. The 2011 census recorded the population as 3,237.

===Economy===

Bishopthorpe has been a traditional farming community, though nowadays it serves as a commuter base for workers in nearby York and Leeds. There is a range of retail shops including a Post office.

==Culture and community==
There are three pubs. The Ebor Inn (previously known as the Brown Cow) takes its name from &quot;Eboracum&quot;, the Roman name for York. The other two are The Marcia (previously known as The Grey Mare) and The Woodman. There is also the Bishopthorpe Sports and Social Club. Between 1949 and 1966, the club hosted the York Model Engineers who installed an open air ride on miniature railway in the grounds.

In 1969, Vernon House, the specially built community centre for Bishopthorpe&#x27;s elderly people, was officially opened. It provided a place of rest and recreation, and a kitchen and laundry. It was erected at a cost of £7,000 by Tadcaster Rural District Council to complement the area of sheltered accommodation in the village built two years earlier in Maple Avenue and Vernon Close.

In 1968, Bishopthorpe Library opened. The former library was held in the air raid shelter which was built on the same site in the Second World War. The site was formerly the village green where fairs were held for the annual two-day Trinity Feast in June.

In 1904, the Reading Room funded by Archbishop Maclagan was built as a place of rest and recreation for local men, but without the sale of alcohol. A trust was set up whereby a committee administered the building. In 1947 gas fire heaters (replacing the old open coal fires) were installed and in 1949 further works started that saw a proper stage installed and other internal renovations. It was used by cubs and brownies and other uses included jumble sales and dances, activities that now take place in St Andrew&#x27;s Hall. The Bishopthorpe Women&#x27;s Institute was formed in 1919 and used it as their base. It was re-furbished in 1950 and was renamed St Andrew&#x27;s Hall becoming known as the Village Hall.

There are 35 plots on the Parish Council run allotments on Acaster Lane and a further 20 privately run plots at Glebe Farm on Moor Lane.

===Culture===
The first &quot;Bishopthorpe Play&quot; (also known as the Bishopthorpe Pageant) was staged during June 1928 in the grounds of the Bishopthorpe Palace and involved nearly every villager of Bishopthorpe and Acaster Malbis in one way or another. Written Canon F.L. Perkins, the play depicted the history of the 2 villages since AD211 and each performance was watched by hundreds of people. Additional scenes and music were added for the next production in 1930. Further productions were held in 1954, 1956, 1965 and 1970.

Bishopthorpe features prominently in the novel &quot;The Lost Luggage Porter&quot; by Andrew Martin. In the book the village is known as &quot;Thorpe on Ouse&quot; and is where the main character resides.

==Geography and transport==

The village is close by the River Ouse, along which are &quot;ings&quot;, fields into which the water overflows, most recently in June 2007. In March 1947, the entire length of Main Street was under flood water. The Water Tower in Acaster Lane was built by Archbishop Thomson in 1863.

The village is served by two bus services. One route, operated by Harrogate Coach Travel, runs along Tadcaster Road in York, before entering the village along Sim Balk Lane and the other is a direct route along Bishopthorpe Road into York run by First Group.

It is also on the Sustrans Solar System Cycle Track which runs from York to Riccall and is part of the National Cycle Network and Trans-Pennine Way. In 1986/7, the Selby/York Cycle Path opened on the old railway line which had ceased to have railway traffic from 1983 because of the Selby Diversion.

==Education and religion==
The Archbishop of York&#x27;s School dates back to 1763 and was built on the site of what is now 8, 10 and 12 School Lane. In 1846 The Archbishop of York&#x27;s CE Primary School was opened, located on Acaster Road. The interior is depicted in a stained glass window in the parish church. Originally 2 classrooms, further classrooms were added in 1893 and 1932. The original school became a girls&#x27; school until it was converted into cottages in 1893. In 1967, Archbishop of York&#x27;s CE Junior School opened across the Appleton Road on the site of the playing fields and serves the communities of Acaster Malbis, Middlethorpe as well the village itself.

In 1973, Bishopthorpe Infant&#x27;s School opened on Sim Balk Lane.

Archbishop Drummond built Old St Andrew&#x27;s Church on the site of the original (dating back to 1215) in 1768 but its foundations were gradually being washed away by the River Ouse. The St Andrew&#x27;s Church was constructed between 1898 and 1899 on Back Lane (now known as Church Lane), located away from the River Ouse. The tower was added in 1903. The architect was C. Hodgson Fowler.

The current Bishopthorpe Methodist Church opened in 1899. The first Methodist Chapel built in 1833 is now private accommodation, Wesley House, situated behind the Supermarket.

==Sports==
*Bishopthorpe Bowling Club was formed in 1927 and is located on Acaster Lane. The Club have six teams playing in four different league competitions in the York area.

==Transport==

Bus services are provided by First York, Transdev York and Connexionsbuses.

In the early eighteenth century, Lord Wenlock who also owned land at Naburn and Acaster Malbis built a ferry to enable him to visit his estates. It remained in use until 1955. Another passenger ferry provided a regular service between Bishopthorpe and King&#x27;s Staith in York until the mid-1960s.

==Landmarks and notable people==

Bishopthorpe Palace is a Grade I listed building and is the residence of the Archbishop of York. North of the village is Middlethorpe Hall, a Grade I listed building since 2008 owned by The National Trust and now used as a country house hotel.

Bishopthorpe has a long history of notable ecclesiastical residents. The latest Archbishop of York is Stephen Cottrell, who has been resident since July 2020 when he succeeded John Sentamu. Many of the streets in Bishopthorpe are named after previous Archbishops: for example, Ramsey Avenue (Michael Ramsey, 1956–1961), Maclagan Road (William Maclagan, 1891–1908), Lamplugh Crescent (Thomas Lamplugh, 1688–1691), Coggan Way (Donald Coggan, 1961–1974), Garbett Way (Cyril Garbett, 1942–1955), Temple Road (William Temple, 1929–1942), Lang Road (Cosmo Gordon Lang, 1909 – 1928), Vernon Close (Edward Venables-Vernon, 1808–1847, Drummond Way (Robert Hay Drummond, 1761–1776), Wolsley Drive (Thomas Wolsey, 1514–1530) and De Grey Place (Walter de Gray, 1216–1255).

<text>Bishopthorpe Palace is the official residence of the Archbishop of York at Bishopthorpe, North Yorkshire, England. The palace is located on the River Ouse and is approximately south of York, which is the location of the diocese&#x27;s cathedral, York Minster.

==Background==

In 1226, Archbishop Walter de Gray bought the manor house at what was then St. Andrewthorpe and gave it to the Dean and Chapter of York Minster. Since then, the village became known as Bishopthorpe. In 1241 he built a Manor House and Chapel on the site. A red brick north wing was built in the fifteenth century and the Gatehouse was built in 1765. In 1863, a water tower was built to extract water from a well, rather than using river water for drinking. The tower was demolished in 1946 but some foundations are still visible in garden of Iona Lodge.
The palace is a Grade I listed building in a wooded, rural setting and includes a gatehouse, stables, a brewhouse and brewster&#x27;s cottage. It was remodelled by Thomas Atkinson between 1763 and 1769.

Archbishop John Sentamu did not initially move into the palace, as it was just beginning a major renovation and restoration at the time.

<text>A Christmas carol is a carol on the theme of Christmas, traditionally sung at Christmas itself or during the surrounding Christmas and holiday season. The term noel has sometimes been used, especially for carols of French origin. Christmas carols may be regarded as a subset of the broader category of Christmas music.

==History==

The first known Christmas hymns may be traced to 4th-century Rome. Latin hymns such as Veni redemptor gentium, written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. Corde natus ex Parentis (&quot;Of the Father&#x27;s heart begotten&quot;) by the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas sequence (or prose) was introduced in Northern European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of Saint Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol.

In the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of Francis of Assisi, a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in regional native languages developed. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, a Shropshire chaplain, who lists twenty five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of &#x27;wassailers&#x27;, who went from house to house. The songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal songs sung during celebrations like harvest tide as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church, and to be specifically associated with Christmas.

Many carols which have gained popularity were printed in &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot;, a collection of late medieval Latin songs which was first published in 1582. Early, Latin forms of carols such as &quot;Christ was born on Christmas Day&quot;, &quot;Good Christian Men, Rejoice&quot; and &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; can be found in this book. &quot;&quot; (&quot;O Come all ye faithful&quot;) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century. The origin of the tune is disputed.

Carols gained in popularity after the Reformation in the countries where Protestant churches gained prominence (as well-known Reformers like Martin Luther authored carols and encouraged their use in worship). This was a consequence of the fact that the Lutheran reformation warmly welcomed music. During the years that the Puritan ban on Christmas was in place in England, semi-clandestine religious services marking Christ&#x27;s birth continued to be held, and people sang carols in secret.
The publication of Christmas music books in the 19th century helped to widen the popular appeal of carols. &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot; and &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; appear in English antiquarian William Sandys&#x27; 1833 collection &quot;Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern&quot;. Composers such as Arthur Sullivan helped to repopularise the carol, and it is this period that gave rise to such favourites as &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; and &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear&quot;, a New England carol written by Edmund H. Sears and Richard S. Willis. The publication in 1871 of &quot;Christmas Carols, New and Old&quot; by Henry Ramsden Bramley and Sir John Stainer was a significant contribution to a revival of carols in Victorian Britain. In 1916, Charles Lewis Hutchins published &quot;Carols Old and Carols New&quot;, a scholarly collection which suffered from a short print run and is consequently rarely available today. The &quot;Oxford Book of Carols&quot;, first published in 1928 by Oxford University Press (OUP), was a notably successful collection; edited by the British composers Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams, along with clergyman and author Percy Dearmer, it became a widely used source of carols in among choirs and church congregations in Britain and remains in print today.

The singing of carols was further popularised in the 20th century when OUP published one of the most popular carol books in the English-speaking world, &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot;. First published in 1961 and edited by David Willcocks and Reginald Jacques, this bestselling series has since expanded to a five-volume set. Along with editor John Rutter, the compilers included many arrangements of carols derived from sources such as Piae Cantiones, as well as pieces by modern composers such as William Walton, Benjamin Britten, Richard Rodney Bennett, William Mathias and John Rutter.

Today carols are regularly sung at Christian religious services. Some compositions have words that are clearly not of a religious theme, but are often still referred to as &quot;carols&quot;. For example, the 16th-century song &quot;A Bone, God Wot!&quot; appears to be a wassailing song (which is sung during drinking or while requesting ale), but is described in the British Library&#x27;s Cottonian Collection as a Christmas carol. As recently as 1865, Christmas-related lyrics were adopted for the traditional English folk song &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, becoming the internationally popular Christmas carol &quot;What Child is This?&quot;. Little research has been conducted on carol singing, but one of the few sociological studies of caroling in the early 21st century in Finland determined that the sources of songs are often misunderstood, and that it is simplistic to suggest caroling is mostly related to Christian beliefs, for it also reinforces preservation of diverse national customs and local family traditions.

A modern form of the practice of caroling can be seen in &quot;Dial-A-Carol,&quot; an annual tradition held by students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wherein potential audiences call the singers to request a performance over phone call.

===Carols for dancing===
It is not clear whether the word carol derives from the French &quot;carole&quot; or the Latin &quot;carula&quot; meaning a circular dance.

===Music===
Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like &quot;Personent hodie&quot;, &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, and &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot; can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages, and are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung.

Compositions continue to be written that become popular carols. For example, many of the carols written by Alfred Burt are sung regularly in both sacred and secular settings, and are among the better known modern Christmas carols.

==Church and liturgical use==
Almost all the well-known carols were not sung in church until the second half of the 19th century. &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern 1861–1874&quot; included several carols.
Isaac Watts, the &quot;father of English hymnody&quot;, composed &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, which has become a popular Christmas carol even though it is widely believed that Watts did not write it to be sung only at Christmas.

Charles Wesley wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols, of which the best known was originally entitled &quot;Hark! How All the Welkin Rings&quot;, later edited to &quot;Hark! the Herald Angels Sing&quot;.
A tune from a cantata, &quot;Festgesang&quot;, by Felix Mendelssohn in 1840 was adapted by William H. Cummings to fit Wesley&#x27;s words. This combination first appeared in &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; in 1861.

&quot;Silent Night&quot; comes from Austria. The carol was first performed in the Nikolauskirche in Oberndorf on 24 December 1818. Mohr had composed the words much earlier, in 1816, but on Christmas Eve brought them to Gruber and asked him to compose a melody and guitar accompaniment for the church service. The first English translation was in 1871 where it was published in a Methodist hymnal.

==Episodes described==
Several different Christmas episodes, apart from the birth of Jesus itself, are described in Christmas carols, such as:
* The Annunciation, for example &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Message&quot;
* The Census of Augustus, a rare subject, but touched upon in &quot;On a Day When Men Were Counted&quot; by Daniel Thambyrajah Niles (1964)
* The Annunciation to the shepherds, for example &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks&quot;
* The Adoration of the shepherds, for example the Czech carol &quot;Nesem vám noviny&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Come, All Ye Shepherds&quot;)
* The Star of Bethlehem, for example, &quot;Star of the East&quot;
* The Visit of the Magi, for example &quot;We Three Kings&quot;
* The Massacre of the Innocents, for example the &quot;Coventry Carol&quot;

In addition, some carols describe Christmas-related events of a religious nature, but not directly related to the birth of Jesus. For example:
* &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, based on a legend about Saint Wenceslaus helping a poor man on 26 December (the Feast of Stephen)
* &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot; and &quot;I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day&quot;, reflecting on the practice of ringing church bells at Christmas

==Early examples==

Antiquarians in the 19th-century rediscovered early carols in museums. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, about 500 have been found. Some are wassailing songs, some are religious songs in English, some are in Latin, and some are &quot;macaronic&quot; — a mixture of English and Latin. Since most people did not understand Latin, the implication is that these songs were composed for church choristers, or perhaps for an educated audience at the Royal courts. The most famous survival of these early macaronic carols is &quot;The Boar&#x27;s Head&quot;. The tradition of singing carols outside of church services early in the 19th century is best illustrated by Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; (1872). In England and other countries, such as Poland (kolęda), Romania (colindă) and Bulgaria (koledari), there is a tradition of Christmas caroling (earlier known as wassailing), in which groups of singers travel from house to house, singing carols at each, for which they are often rewarded with gifts, money, mince pies, or a glass of an appropriate beverage. Money collected in this way is now normally given to charity.

Singing carols in church was instituted on Christmas Eve 1880 in Truro Cathedral, Cornwall, (see article on Nine Lessons and Carols), and now seen in churches all over the world. The songs that were chosen for singing in church omitted the wassailing carols, and the words &quot;hymn&quot; and &quot;carol&quot; were used almost interchangeably. Shortly before, in 1878, the Salvation Army, under Charles Fry, instituted the idea of playing carols at Christmas, using a brass band. Carols can be sung by individual singers, but are also often sung by larger groups, including professionally trained choirs. Most churches have special services at which carols are sung, generally combined with readings from scripture about the birth of Christ; this is often based on the famous Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==In classical music==
In the 1680s and 1690s, two French composers incorporated carols into their works. Louis-Claude Daquin wrote 12 noels for organ. Marc-Antoine Charpentier wrote a few instrumental versions of noels, plus one major choral work &quot;Messe de minuit pour Noël&quot;. Johann Sebastian Bach included Christmas carols in his cantatas for Christmastide, including his &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;. Peter Cornelius included carol melodies in the accompaniment of his song cycle &quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot;, Op. 8. Other examples include:
* Ralph Vaughan Williams: &quot;Fantasia on Christmas Carols&quot;, 1912.
* Victor Hely-Hutchinson: &quot;Carol Symphony&quot;, 1927.
* Benjamin Britten: &quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot; (for choir and harp), 1942
* Christina Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; has been set to music by Gustav Holst (1905), Harold Darke (1911) and others.
* Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki extensively quotes the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot; in his Symphony No. 2, nicknamed the &quot;Christmas Symphony&quot;.

==Star singers==
In Austria, Belgium and Germany, Epiphany, the last feast of the Christmas season, is marked by star singers, children dressing as the Three Kings, carrying a star on a pole. Going from house to house from New Year&#x27;s Day to 6 January, the children sing religious songs and collect money for charity. They are often rewarded with extra sweets or money.

==By country==

===Australia, South Africa and New Zealand===
In Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, where it is the middle of summer at Christmas, there is a tradition of Carols by Candlelight concerts held outdoors at night in cities and towns across the country, during the weeks leading up to Christmas. First held in Melbourne, &quot;Carols by Candlelight&quot; is held each Christmas Eve in capital cities and many smaller cities and towns around Australia. Performers at the concerts include opera singers, musical theatre performers and popular music singers. People in the audience hold lit candles and join in singing some of the carols in accompaniment with the celebrities. Similar events are now held all over Australia, usually arranged by churches, municipal councils, or other community groups. They are normally held on Christmas Eve or the Sunday or weekend before Christmas. A similar recent trend in South Africa and New Zealand are for smaller towns to host their own Carols by Candlelight concerts.

William Garnet &quot;Billy&quot; James (1892–1977) wrote music for Christmas carol lyrics written by John Wheeler (both men worked for the Australian Broadcasting Commission). These referred to the hot dry December of the Australian outback, dancing brolgas (a native Australian crane), and similar Australian features.

===Canada===
The &quot;Huron Carol&quot; (or &quot;Twas in the Moon of Wintertime&quot;) is a Canadian Christmas hymn (Canada&#x27;s oldest Christmas song), written probably in 1642 by Jean de Brébeuf, a Jesuit missionary at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons in Canada.

===Finland===
In accordance with a medieval tradition, the Christmas Peace is declared every year on Christmas Eve in Porvoo, Finland, with a local band and male choir performing Christmas carols.

===France===
* In 1535, a 16th-century carol, &quot;Ça, Bergers, assemblons nous&quot;, was sung aboard Jacques Cartier&#x27;s ship on Christmas Day.
* In 1554, a collection of French carols, &quot;La Grande Bible des Noëls&quot;, was printed in Orléans.
* In 1703, another collection, &quot;Chants des Noëls Anciens et Modernes&quot;, was printed by Christophe Ballard (1641–1715), in Paris.
* Dating from the 18th century, &quot;Les Anges Dans Nos Campagnes&quot; (known as &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High&quot; in English) is another famous French carol.
* The 19th-century &quot;Cantique de Noël&quot; (also known as &quot;Minuit, chrétiens&quot;, adapted as &quot;O Holy Night&quot; in English) is another classic.

&quot;Dans cette étable&quot; and &quot;Venez Divin Messie&quot; are also popular Christmas carols. Perhaps the best known traditional French carol, &quot;Il est né, le divin Enfant&quot;, comes from the region of Provence.

===Germany, Austria and Switzerland===

Some carols familiar in English are translations of German Christmas songs (&quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot;). Pastoral &quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot; are sometimes called &quot;Hirtenlieder&quot; (&quot;shepherd songs&quot;). Martin Luther wrote the carol &quot;Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her&quot;, which can be acted as a play of the Christmas story. He also wrote &quot;Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ&quot; and &quot;Christum wir sollen loben schon&quot;. The carol &quot;Vom Himmel hoch, o Engel, kommt&quot; was written by Friedrich Spee in 1622 to an older melody, a lullaby singing &quot;of Jesus and Mary&quot;, and for peace.

Two well-known later examples are &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; (O Christmas tree), from a German folksong arranged by Ernst Anschütz and &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; (&quot;Silent Night&quot;) by the Austrians Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr. The carol most familiar in German besides those two is probably the 19th-century &quot;O du fröhliche&quot;.

Other popular and widely sung Christmas carols are &quot;Herbei, o ihr Gläub’gen&quot;, which is a German version of &quot;Adeste fideles&quot; (English: &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;), Alle Jahre wieder (&quot;Every year again&quot;), Es ist ein Ros entsprungen (lit: &quot;A rose has sprung up&quot;), &quot;Leise rieselt der Schnee&quot; &quot;(Silently the snow is falling)&quot;, &quot;Tochter Zion, freue dich&quot; (Daughter Zion, rejoice) and &quot;Es ist für uns eine Zeit angekommen&quot; (&quot;Unto us a time has come&quot;).

&quot;Lasst uns froh und munter sein&quot; (&quot;Let us be happy and cheerful&quot;), &quot;Kling, Glöckchen&quot;, (&quot;Ring, Little Bell&quot;), &quot;Ihr Kinderlein, kommet&quot; (&quot;Oh, come, little children&quot;) and &quot;Schneeflöckchen, Weißröckchen&quot; (lit.: &quot;tiny snowflake, white, tiny skirt&quot;) are popular German songs introduced in Kindergarten and primary school. Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann wrote a scientific book on German Christmas carols which is also a song book.

===Greece and Cyprus===

====Custom====
Greek tradition calls for children to go out with triangles from house to house on Christmas Eve, New Year&#x27;s Eve and Epiphany Eve, and sing the corresponding folk carols, called the Kalanta or Kalanda or Kalanta Christougenon, the word deriving from the Roman calends). There are separate carols for each of the three great feasts, referring respectively to the Nativity, to St. Basil and the New Year, and to the Baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, along with wishes for the household. In addition to the carols for the winter festive season, there are also the springtime or Lenten carols, commonly called the &quot;Carols of Lazarus&quot;, sung on the Saturday before Palm Sunday as a harbinger of the Resurrection of Christ to be celebrated a week later.

In older times, caroling children asked for and were given edible gifts such as dried fruit, eggs, nuts or sweets; during the 20th century this was gradually replaced with money gifts – ranging from small change in the case of strangers to considerable amounts in the case of close relatives. Caroling is also done by marching bands, choirs, school students seeking to raise funds for trips or charity, members of folk societies, or merely by groups of well-wishers. Many internationally known carols, e.g. &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;, are also sung in Greek translation.

====Variants====
Many carols are regional, being popular in specific regions but unknown in others, whereas some are popular throughout the two countries. Examples of the latter are the Peloponnesian Christmas carol &quot;Christoúgenna, Prōtoúgenna&quot; (&quot;Christmas, Firstmas&quot;), the Constantinopolitan Christmas carol &quot;Kalēn hespéran, árchontes&quot; (&quot;Good evening, lords&quot;), and the New Year&#x27;s carol &quot;Archimēniá ki archichroniá&quot; (&quot;First of the month, first of the year&quot;). The oldest known carol, commonly referred to as the &quot;Byzantine Carol&quot; (Byzantine Greek: Άναρχος θεός καταβέβηκεν, &quot;Ánarkhos Theós katabébēken&quot;, &quot;God, who has no beginning, descended&quot;), is linguistically dated to the beginning of the High Middle Ages, &quot;ca.&quot; 1000 AD; it is traditionally associated with the city of Kotyora in the Pontos (modern-day Ordu, Turkey).

====Form====
Most carols follow a more or less standard format: they begin by exalting the relevant religious feast, then proceed to offer praises for the lord and lady of the house, their children, the household and its personnel, and usually conclude with a polite request for a treat, and a promise to come back next year for more well-wishing. Almost all the various carols are in the common dekapentasyllabos (15-syllable iamb with a caesura after the 8th syllable) verse, which means that their wording and tunes are easily interchangeable. This has given rise to a great number of local variants, parts of which often overlap or resemble one another in verse, tune, or both. Nevertheless, their musical variety remains very wide overall: for example carols from Epirus are strictly pentatonic, in the kind of drone polyphony practised in the Balkans, and accompanied by C-clarinets and fiddles; just across the straits, on Corfu Island, the style is tempered harmonic polyphony, accompanied by mandolins and guitars. Generally speaking, the musical style of each carol closely follows the secular music tradition of each region.

===Italy===
The most popular Italian Christmas carol is &quot;Tu scendi dalle stelle&quot;, written in 1732 by Saint Alphonsus Liguori.

===Philippines===

Christmas carols in predominantly Catholic Philippines exhibit the influence of indigenous, Hispanic and American musical traditions, reflecting the country&#x27;s complex history. Carollers () begin wassailing in November, with mostly children and young adults participating in the custom.

===Poland===
Christmas carols are very popular in Poland, where they have a long history, the oldest dating to the 15th century or earlier. There is a tradition of singing Christmas carols until 2 February which is celebrated by western Christians as the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Among the most prominent Polish carols are God Is Born (&quot;Bóg się rodzi&quot;) and Midst Quiet Night (&quot;Wśród nocnej ciszy&quot;).

===Romania===
During the Socialist Republic of Romania in the 20th century, Christmas carols were banned by the government of Ceausescu. Days following the Romanian Revolution in 1989, Christmas carols were sung for the first time in 42 years.

===Spain and Portugal===
The &quot;villancico&quot; (or &quot;vilancete&quot; in Portuguese) was a common poetic and musical form of the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America popular from the late 15th to 18th centuries. With the decline in popularity of the villancicos in the 20th century, the term became reduced to mean merely &quot;Christmas carol&quot;. Important composers of villancicos were Juan del Encina, Pedro de Escobar, Francisco Guerrero, Gaspar Fernandes and Juan Gutiérez de Padilla. Popular Spanish villancicos include &quot;Los pastores a Belén&quot; and &quot;Riu, riu, chiu: El lobo rabioso&quot; and &quot;Los peces en el río&quot;.

====Andorra and Catalan-speaking territories====
The &quot;Nadala&quot; or &quot;Cançó de Nadal&quot; (in plural &quot;nadales&quot;) are a popular group of songs, usually requiring a chorus, that are song from Advent until Epiphany. Their written versions starts in the 15th century. In the past were usually being song by shepherds and their families in market squares and in front of churches.

The &quot;Nadala&quot; origins are uncertain but usually cited to be related with the Montseny and Pedraforca mountains in Catalonia (by the counties of Osona and Girona). As quite a few have references to mythological events and powers, some authors claim that they contain part of the religion that was present in the territory before Christianity arrived as it was kept alive in these mountainous regions.

The &quot;nadala&quot; is usually paired with the &quot;caramella&quot;, being one for the winter solstice events while the other to the spring equinox.

===Ukraine===
Ukrainian Christmas carols are named kolyadka (). They were originally sung to celebrate the birth of the Sun (winter solstice). After the incorporation into Christianity, their theme has been shifted to Christmas, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.

The Ukrainian carol most known in the Western world is the &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;, with English lyrics by the American composer of Ukrainian descent Peter J. Wilhousky, composed by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych as &quot;Shchedryk&quot;, and premiered in December 1916 by a choral group made up of students at Kyiv University. Although it is a Christmas carol in Wilhousky&#x27;s English lyrics, in original Ukrainian lyrics it is a Generous Eve carol (, ), having nothing with Christianity.

===United States===
Christmas music performed in the United States ranges from popular songs, such as &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, to Christmas carols, such as &quot;Away in a Manger&quot;, &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;, and numerous others of varying genres. Church and college choirs celebrate with special programs and online recordings.

<doc id="153569" wikidata="Q1443316" url="?curid=153569" title="Christmas music">
<text>Christmas music comprises a variety of genres of music regularly performed or heard around the Christmas season. Music associated with Christmas may be purely instrumental, or in the case of carols, may employ lyrics about the nativity of Jesus Christ, traditions such as gift-giving and merrymaking, cultural figures such as Santa Claus, or other topics. Many songs simply have a winter or seasonal theme, or have been adopted into the canon for other reasons.

Traditional Christmas carols include pieces such as &quot;Silent Night&quot;, &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Message&quot;, &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, &quot;Down in Yon Forest&quot; and &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;. While most Christmas songs before the 20th century were of a traditional religious character and reflected the Nativity story of Christmas, the Great Depression brought a stream of U.S. songs that did not explicitly mention the Christian nature of the holiday, but rather the more cultural themes and customs associated with it. These included songs aimed at children such as &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; and &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, as well as sentimental ballad-type songs performed by famous crooners of the era, such as &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot;, the latter of which remained the best-selling single of all time as of 2024. &quot;Elvis&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; (1957) by Elvis Presley is the best-selling Christmas album of all time, having sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.

Performances of Christmas music at public concerts, in churches, at shopping malls, on city streets, and in private gatherings are a staple of the Christmas season in many cultures across the world. Many radio stations convert to a 24/7 Christmas music format leading up to the holiday, though the standard for most stations in the US is on or near Veterans Day, some stations adopt the format as early as the day after Halloween (or, exceptionally rarely, even sooner) as part of a phenomenon known as &quot;Christmas creep&quot;. Liturgically, Christmas music traditionally ceases to be performed at the arrival of Candlemas, the traditional end of the Christmas-Epiphanytide season.

==History==
===Early music===

Music associated with Christmas is thought to have its origins in 4th-century Rome, in Latin-language hymns such as &quot;Veni redemptor gentium&quot;. By the 13th century, under the influence of Francis of Assisi, the tradition of popular Christmas songs in regional native languages developed. Christmas carols in the English language first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, an English chaplain, who lists twenty five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of wassailers who would travel from house to house. In the 16th century, various Christmas carols still sung to this day, including &quot;The 12 Days of Christmas&quot;, &quot;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&quot;, and &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot;, first emerged.

Music was an early feature of the Christmas season and its celebrations. The earliest examples are hymnographic works (chants and litanies) intended for liturgical use in observance of both the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany, many of which are still in use by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The 13th century saw the rise of the carol written in the vernacular, under the influence of Francis of Assisi.

In the Middle Ages, the English combined circle dances with singing and called them carols. Later, the word carol came to mean a song in which a religious topic is treated in a style that is familiar or festive. From Italy, it passed to France and Germany, and later to England. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Audelay, a Shropshire priest and poet, who lists 25 &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of wassailers, who went from house to house. Music in itself soon became one of the greatest tributes to Christmas, and Christmas music includes some of the noblest compositions of the great musicians. Martin Luther, the father of Lutheran Christianity, encouraged congregational singing during the Mass, in addition to spreading the practice of caroling outside the liturgy.

===Puritan prohibition===
During the Commonwealth of England government under Cromwell, the Rump Parliament prohibited the practice of singing Christmas carols as Pagan and sinful. Like other customs associated with Christianity of the Catholic and Magisterial Protestant traditions, it earned the disapproval of Puritans. Famously, Cromwell&#x27;s interregnum prohibited all celebrations of the Christmas holiday. This attempt to ban the public celebration of Christmas can also be seen in the early history of Father Christmas.

The Puritan Westminster Assembly of Divines established Sunday as the only holy day in the liturgical calendar in 1644. The new liturgy produced for the English church recognized this in 1645, and so legally abolished Christmas. Its celebration was declared an offense by Parliament in 1647. There is some debate as to the effectiveness of this ban, and whether or not it was enforced in the country. During the years that the Puritan ban on Christmas was in place in England, semi-clandestine religious services marking Christ&#x27;s birth continued to be held, and people sang carols in secret.

Puritans generally disapproved of the celebration of Christmas—a trend that continually resurfaced in Europe and the US through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

===Royal restoration===

When in May 1660 Charles II restored the Stuarts to the throne, the people of England once again practiced the public singing of Christmas carols as part of the revival of Christmas customs, sanctioned by the king&#x27;s own celebrations.

The Victorian Era saw a surge of Christmas carols associated with a renewed admiration of the holiday, including &quot;Silent Night&quot;, &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;, and &quot;O Holy Night&quot;. The first Christmas songs associated with Saint Nicholas or other gift-bringers also came during 19th century, including &quot;Up on the Housetop&quot; and &quot;Jolly Old St. Nicholas&quot;. Many older Christmas hymns were also translated or had lyrics added to them during this period, particularly in 1871 when John Stainer published a widely influential collection entitled &quot;Christmas Carols New &amp; Old&quot;. William Sandys&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern&quot; (1833), contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the holiday. Singing carols in church was instituted on Christmas Eve 1880 (Nine Lessons and Carols) in Truro Cathedral, Cornwall, England, which is now seen in churches all over the world.

According to one of the only observational research studies of Christmas caroling, Christmas observance and caroling traditions vary considerably between nations in the 21st century, while the actual sources and meanings of even high-profile songs are commonly misattributed, and the motivations for carol singing can in some settings be as much associated with family tradition and national cultural heritage as with religious beliefs. Christmas festivities, including music, are also celebrated in a more secular fashion by such institutions as the Santa Claus Village, in Rovaniemi, Finland.

===Alms===

The tradition of singing Christmas carols in return for alms or charity began in England in the seventeenth century after the Restoration. Town musicians or &#x27;waits&#x27; were licensed to collect money in the streets in the weeks preceding Christmas, the custom spread throughout the population by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries up to the present day. Also from the seventeenth century, there was the English custom, predominantly involving women, of taking a wassail bowl to their neighbors to solicit gifts, accompanied by carols. Despite this long history, many Christmas carols date only from the nineteenth century onwards, with the exception of songs such as the &quot;Wexford Carol&quot;, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;As I Sat on a Sunny Bank&quot;, &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot;, the &quot;Coventry Carol&quot; and &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot;. The practice of ordinary Christian church members of various denominations going door to door and singing carols continues in many parts of the world, such as in India; residents give money to the carolers, which churches distribute to the poor.

===Church feasts===
The importance of Advent and the feast of Christmastide within the church year means there is a large repertoire of music specially composed for performance in church services celebrating the Christmas story. Various composers from the Baroque era to the 21st century have written Christmas cantatas and motets. Some notable compositions include:
* Thomas Tallis: &quot;Mass &quot;Puer natus est nobis&quot;&quot; (1554)
* Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina: &quot;O magnum mysterium&quot; (1569)
* Orlande de Lassus: &quot;Resonet in laudibus&quot; (1569)
* Heinrich Schütz: &quot;Weihnachtshistorie&quot; (1664)
* Johann Sebastian Bach: several cantatas for Christmas to Epiphany and &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; (1734)
* Jakub Jan Ryba: &quot;Czech Christmas Mass &quot;Hey, Master!&quot;&quot; (1796)
* Anton Bruckner: &quot;Virga Jesse floruit&quot; (1885)

==Classical music==

Many large-scale religious compositions are performed in a concert setting at Christmas. Performances of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot; are a fixture of Christmas celebrations in some countries, and although it was originally written for performance at Easter, it covers aspects of the Biblical Christmas narrative. Informal Scratch Messiah performances involving public participation are very popular in the Christmas season. Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; (, ), written for Christmas 1734, describes the birth of Jesus, the annunciation to the shepherds, the adoration of the shepherds, the circumcision and naming of Jesus, the journey of the Magi, and the adoration of the Magi. Antonio Vivaldi composed the Violin Concerto RV270 &quot;Il Riposo per il Santissimo Natale&quot; (&quot;For the Most Holy Christmas&quot;). Arcangelo Corelli composed the &quot;Christmas Concerto&quot; in 1690. Peter Cornelius composed a cycle of six songs related to Christmas themes he called &quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot;. Setting his own poems for solo voice and piano, he alluded to older Christmas carols in the accompaniment of two of the songs.

Other classical works associated with Christmas include:

* Marc-Antoine Charpentier, 9 vocal settings and 2 instrumental settings :
** &quot;Messe de Minuit&quot; H.9 for soloists, choir, flûtes, strings and bc (1690)

* &quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot; (1942) by Benjamin Britten.

==Christmas carols==


Songs which are traditional, even some without a specific religious context, are often called Christmas carols. Each of these has a rich history, some dating back many centuries.

===Standards===
A popular set of traditional carols that might be heard at any Christmas-related event include:

* &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; (in the UK the text of &quot;Angels from the Realms of Glory&quot; is sung to this tune)
* &quot;Away in a Manger&quot;
* &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;
* &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot;
* &quot;The First Noel&quot;
* &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot;
* &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot;
* &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;
* &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;
* &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot;
* &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear&quot;
* &quot;Joy to the World&quot;
* &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; (&quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;)
* &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; (&quot;Adeste Fideles&quot;)
* &quot;O come, O come, Emmanuel&quot;
* &quot;O Holy Night&quot; (&quot;Cantique de Noël&quot;)
* &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;
* &quot;Once in Royal David&#x27;s City&quot;
* &quot;Silent Night&quot; (&quot;Stille Nacht, heilige Nach&quot;t)
* &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;
* &quot;We Three Kings of Orient Are&quot;
* &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; 
* &quot;What Child Is This?&quot;
* &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks&quot;
These songs hearken from centuries ago, the oldest (&quot;Wexford Carol&quot;) originating in the 12th century. The newest came together in the mid- to late-19th century. Many began in non-English speaking countries, often with non-Christmas themes, and were later converted into English carols with English lyrics added—not always translated from the original, but newly created—sometimes as late as the early 20th century.

===Early secular Christmas songs===

Among the earliest secular Christmas songs was &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, which first appeared in 1780 in England, though its melody would not come until 1909. The English West Country carol &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; has antecedents dating to the 1830s but was not published in its modern form until Arthur Warrell introduced it to a wider audience in 1935. As the secular mythos of the holiday (such as Santa Claus in his modern form) emerged in the 19th century, so too did secular Christmas songs. Benjamin Hanby&#x27;s &quot;Up on the House Top&quot; and Emily Huntington Miller&#x27;s &quot;Jolly Old Saint Nicholas&quot; were among the first explicitly secular Christmas songs in the United States, both dating to the 1860s; they were preceded by &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, written in 1857 but not explicitly about Christmas, and &quot;O Christmas Tree,&quot; written in 1824 but only made about a Christmas tree after being translated from its original German.

===Published Christmas music===

Christmas music has been published as sheet music for centuries. One of the earliest collections of printed Christmas music was &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot;, a Finnish songbook first published in 1582 which contained a number of songs that have survived today as well-known Christmas carols. The publication of Christmas music books in the 19th century, such as &quot;Christmas Carols, New and Old&quot; (Bramley and Stainer, 1871), played an important role in widening the popular appeal of carols. In the 20th century, Oxford University Press (OUP) published some highly successful Christmas music collections such as &quot;The Oxford Book of Carols&quot; (Martin Shaw, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Percy Dearmer, 1928), which revived a number of early folk songs and established them as modern standard carols. This was followed by the bestselling &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot; series (David Willcocks, Reginald Jacques and John Rutter), first published in 1961 and now available in a five volumes. The popular books have proved to be a popular resource for choirs and church congregations in the English-speaking world, and remain in print today.

* &quot;Christmas Carols, New and Old&quot; (1871)
* &quot;Oxford Book of Carols&quot; (1928)
* &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot; (1961)
* &quot;New Oxford Book of Carols&quot; (1992)
* &quot;A Shorter New Oxford Book of Carols&quot; (1992)

===Choirmasters poll===
In 2008, &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; published a poll of the &quot;50 Greatest Carols&quot;, compiled from the views of choral experts and choirmasters in the UK and the US. The resulting list of the top ten favored Christmas carols and motets was:

# &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; – Harold Darke
# &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot; – traditional
# &quot;A Spotless Rose&quot; – Herbert Howells
# &quot;Bethlehem Down&quot; – Peter Warlock
# &quot;Lully, Lulla&quot; – traditional
# &quot;Tomorrow Shall Be My Dancing Day&quot;
# &quot;There Is No Rose&quot; - traditional (15th c.)
# &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;
# &quot;Of the Father&#x27;s Heart Begotten&quot;
# &quot;What Sweeter Music&quot; – John Rutter

==Popular Christmas songs==
===United States===
According to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 2016, &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, written by Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie in 1934, is the most played holiday song of the last 50 years. It was first performed by Eddie Cantor, live, on his radio show in November 1934. Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra recorded their version in 1935, followed later by a range of artists including Frank Sinatra in 1948, The Supremes, The Jackson 5, The Beach Boys, and Glenn Campbell. Bruce Springsteen recorded a rock rendition in December 1975.

Long-time Christmas classics from prior to the &quot;rock era&quot; still dominate the holiday charts – such as &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot;, &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;. Songs from the rock era to enter the top tier of the season&#x27;s canon include &quot;Wonderful Christmastime&quot; by Paul McCartney, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff and &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Wham! Radio industry writer Sean Ross noted after the 2004 holiday season that it usually takes about ten years for a song to become a Christmas standard, noting in 2024 that this rule of thumb was still true based on early-to-mid-2010s songs such as &quot;Santa Tell Me&quot; by Ariana Grande and &quot;Underneath the Tree&quot; by Kelly Clarkson gaining perennial relevance.

The most popular set of these titles—heard over airwaves, on the Internet, in shopping malls, in elevators and lobbies, even on the street during the Christmas season—have been composed and performed from the 1930s onward. (Songs published before are all out of copyright, are no longer subject to ASCAP royalties and thus do not appear on their list.) In addition to Bing Crosby, major acts that have popularized and successfully covered a number of the titles in the top 30 most performed Christmas songs in 2015 include Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Andy Williams, and the Jackson 5.

Since the mid-1950s, much of the Christmas music produced for popular audiences has explicitly romantic overtones, only using Christmas as a setting. The 1950s also featured the introduction of novelty songs that used the holiday as a target for satire and source for comedy. Exceptions such as &quot;The Christmas Shoes&quot; (2000) have re-introduced Christian themes as complementary to the secular Western themes, and myriad traditional carol cover versions by various artists have explored virtually all music genres. The 1980s and 1990s saw a revival of interest in instrumental Christmas music, including the New Age synthpop of Mannheim Steamroller and the symphonic metal of Trans-Siberian Orchestra, particularly among older listeners. Newer Christmas recordings found more difficulty gaining traction by the 2020s, due to several factors, among them Christmas playlists relying heavily on the standards, the decline of contemporary hit radio&#x27;s influence on pushing new Christmas music (as adult contemporary music stations were the dominant destination for Christmas songs), and the major hitmaking stars not pushing Christmas records—nor having the dominance nor clout to do so—as much as their predecessors from the 1970s to the 1980s had.

====Most-performed Christmas songs====
The top thirty most-played holiday songs for the 2015 holiday season are ranked here, all titles written or co-written by ASCAP songwriters and composers.

Most of these songs in some way describe or are reminiscent of Christmas traditions, how Western Christian countries tend to celebrate the holiday, i.e., with caroling, mistletoe, exchanging of presents, a Christmas tree, feasting, jingle bells, etc. Celebratory or sentimental, and nostalgic in tone, they hearken back to simpler times with memorable holiday practices—expressing the desire either to be with someone or at home for Christmas. The winter-related songs celebrate the climatic season, with all its snow, dressing up for the cold, sleighing, etc.

Many titles help define the mythical aspects of modern Christmas celebration: Santa Claus bringing presents, coming down the chimney, being pulled by reindeer, etc. New mythical characters are created, defined, and popularized by these songs; &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, adapted from a major retailer&#x27;s promotional poem, was introduced to radio audiences by Gene Autry in 1949. His follow-up a year later introduced &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, the central character of his song. Though overtly religious, and authored (at least partly) by a writer of many church hymns, no drumming child appears in any biblical account of the Christian nativity scene. This character was introduced to the tradition by Katherine K. Davis in her &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; (written in 1941, with a popular version being released in 1958). Loretta Lynn introduced &quot;Shadrack, the Black Reindeer&quot; in 1974.

The list does not include songs written before nor songs written solely by songwriters from other guilds such as BMI and SESAC.
&quot;The above-ranking results from an aggregation of performances of all different artist versions of each cited holiday song, across all forms of media, from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015.&quot;
* Of the top 30 most performed Christmas songs in 2015, 13 (43%) were written in the 1930s or 1940s and 12 (40%) were written in the 1950s and 1960s; only five (17%) were written from the 1970s on, two (7%) were from after 1990, and none after 1995.
* The newest song in the top 30 most performed Christmas songs – &quot;All I Want for Christmas is You&quot;, co-written and performed by Mariah Carey in 1994 – entered the list for the first time in 2015; the song hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 for the first time in 2017, and was named &quot;the UK&#x27;s favourite Christmas song&quot; the same year by &quot;The Independent&quot;. Troy Powers and Andy Stone wrote a song with the same title and theme, which Stone&#x27;s band Vince Vance &amp; the Valiants recorded in 1989 and independently became popular at the same time as Carey&#x27;s song. The melody is similar to Bobby Vinton&#x27;s &quot;My Heart Belongs to Only You&quot;. Stone has made multiple attempts to sue Carey over the similarity in name.
* Johnny Marks wrote three songs that appear in these most-performed Christmas songs in 2015: &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot;. Irving Berlin wrote two: &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;. These are the only songwriters to appear on the list more than once – and both are non-Christian.
* Gene Autry was the first to sing three songs on the list of top 30 most performed Christmas songs in 2015 – &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)&quot; – co-writing the latter song.
* Two of the songs, &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; and &quot;Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24&quot;, rely on the same melody, Mykola Leontovych&#x27;s &quot;Shchedryk&quot;, which was published in 1918 and is thus out of copyright, no longer subject to ASCAP royalties. The lyrics to &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; are still under copyright. The copyright on &quot;Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24&quot; extends only to the arrangement.
* &quot;Tony Springer&quot; was a pseudonym for Philip Springer. As Springer was a member of BMI at the time, he used the first name Tony as a legal fiction to allow himself to collaborate with ASCAP members Javits and Ebb.

===Christmas song surveys===
In 2007 surveys of United States radio listeners by two different research groups, the most liked songs were standards such as Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1942), Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (1946), and Burl Ives&#x27; &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; (1965). Other favorites like &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; (Brenda Lee, 1958), &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; (Bobby Helms, 1957) and John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Happy Xmas&quot; (1971), scored well in one study. Also &quot;loved&quot; were Johnny Mathis&#x27;s &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot; and Harry Simeone Chorale&#x27;s &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; (1958).

Among the most-hated Christmas songs, according to Edison Media Research&#x27;s 2007 survey, are Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Jingle Bells?&quot;, the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, Elmo &amp; Patsy&#x27;s &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot;, and &quot;O Holy Night&quot; as performed by cartoon characters from Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;South Park&quot;. The &quot;most-hated Christmastime recording&quot; is a rendition of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; by Carl Weissmann&#x27;s Singing Dogs, a revolutionary novelty song originally released in 1955, and re-released as an edited version in 1970. A 2004 focus group from Edison, conducted solely among the key demographic of women age 30 to 49, listed &quot;Jingle Bells?,&quot; the Singing Dogs &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; the &quot;South Park&quot; &quot;O Holy Night&quot; rendition, a Guido parody of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; as performed by Porky Pig impersonator Seymour Swine.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Darlene Love&#x27;s version of &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; (1963) first on its list of The Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs in December 2010. Carey&#x27;s &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, was No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Holiday Digital Songs chart in December 2013. &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; by The Pogues is cited as the best Christmas song of all time in various television, radio and magazine related polls in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

A 2021 YouGov survey of 1,000 adults ranked the most hated Christmas songs, counting only those songs that a majority of those polls recognized and listing the songs independent of any artist who may have recorded them. &quot;Santa Baby&quot; ranked atop the list; a side note from a news article covering the list noted that much of that hatred came from the Madonna cover version from &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot;, which gets more airplay than Eartha Kitt&#x27;s original. Other songs that ranked high in terms of listener revulsion included &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,&quot; &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Christmastime&quot;.

====Pinnacle Media Worldwide survey====
The Pinnacle Media Worldwide survey divided its listeners into music-type categories:

* &quot;Adult contemporary&quot; listeners rated Brenda Lee&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; best.
* &quot;Adult Top 40&quot; fans liked Bobby Helms&#x27; &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;.
* &quot;Hip-hop/R&amp;B&quot; fans liked the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;.
* &quot;Country&quot; listeners ranked Burl Ives&#x27; &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; No. 1.
* &quot;Smooth jazz&quot; fans liked &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; as sung by Nat King Cole.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
====Most played songs====

A collection of chart hits recorded in a bid to be crowned the UK Christmas No. 1 single during the 1970s and 1980s have become some of the most popular holiday tunes in the United Kingdom. Band Aid&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; is the second-best-selling single in UK Chart history. &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, released by The Pogues in 1987, is regularly voted the British public&#x27;s favourite-ever Christmas song. It is also the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK. British glam rock bands had major hit singles with Christmas songs in the 1970s. &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; by Slade, &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot; by Wizzard, and &quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; by Mud all remain hugely popular.

In four out of the five years between 2008 and 2012, PRS for Music (who collect and pay royalties to its 75,000 song-writing and composing members) conducted a survey of the top ten most played Christmas songs in the UK over the past year, and published a top-ten list for each year except 2011 (the 2008 list was for the previous five years, and the 2009 measured the entire previous decade):
The best Christmas song &quot;to get adults and children in the festive spirit for the party season in 2016&quot; was judged by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to be &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;. Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;All I Want For Christmas is You&quot; was declared &quot;the UK&#x27;s favourite Christmas song&quot;, narrowly beating out &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; according to a &quot;points system&quot; created by &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2017. Both score well ahead of all others on the list of top twenty Christmas songs in the UK.
====Christmas Number Ones====

The &quot;Christmas Number One&quot; – songs reaching the top spot on either the UK Singles Chart, the Irish Singles Chart, or occasionally both, on the edition preceding Christmas – is considered a major achievement in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Christmas number one benefits from broad publicity, so much so that the songs that attempt but fail to achieve the honor and finish second also get widespread attention. Social media campaigns have been used to try to encourage sales of specific songs so that they could reach number one.

These songs develop an association with Christmas or the holiday season from their chart performance, but the association tends to be shorter-lived than for the more traditionally-themed Christmas songs. Notable longer-lasting examples include Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; (No. 1, 1984, the second-biggest selling single in UK Chart history; two re-recordings also hit No. 1 in 1989 and 2004), Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; (No. 1, 1973), and Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot; (No. 2, 1984). &quot;Last Christmas&quot; would go on to hold the UK record for highest-selling single not to reach No. 1, until it finally topped the chart on January 1, 2021, helped by extensive streaming in the final week of December 2020; it eventually reached Christmas number one in 2023.

The Beatles, Spice Girls, and LadBaby are the only artists to have achieved consecutive Christmas number-one hits on the UK Singles Chart, with LadBaby having the longest winning streak at five years. The Beatles won annually between 1963 and 1965 (with a fourth in 1967), the Spice Girls between 1996 and 1998, and LadBaby between 2018 and 2022 (all five of LadBaby&#x27;s Christmas number-ones were parodies of other popular songs that included a running gag mentioning sausage rolls). &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is the only recording to have ever been Christmas number one twice, in both 1975 and 1991. Three of the four different Band Aid recordings of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; have been number one in Christmas week.

At the turn of the 21st century, songs associated with reality shows became a frequent source of Christmas number ones in the UK. In 2002, &quot;&quot; produced the top three singles on the British Christmas charts. The &quot;rival&quot; groups produced by the series—the girl group Girls Aloud and the boy band One True Voice—finished first and second respectively on the charts. Failed contestants The Cheeky Girls charted with a novelty hit, &quot;Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum)&quot;, at third. Briton Will Young, winner of the first &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, charted at the top of the Irish charts in 2003.

&quot;The X Factor&quot; also typically concluded in December during its run; the winner&#x27;s debut single earned the Christmas number one in at least one of the two countries every year from 2005 to 2014, and in both countries in five of those ten years. Each year since 2008 has seen protest campaigns to outsell the &quot;X Factor&quot; single (which benefits from precisely-timed release and corresponding media buzz) and prevent it from reaching number one. In 2009, as the result of a campaign intended to counter the phenomenon, Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; reached number one in the UK instead of that year&#x27;s &quot;X Factor&quot; winner, Joe McElderry. In 2011, &quot;Wherever You Are&quot;, the single from a choir of military wives assembled by the TV series &quot;The Choir&quot;, earned the Christmas number-one single in Britain—upsetting &quot;X Factor&quot; winners Little Mix. With the Military Wives Choir single not being released in Ireland, Little Mix won Christmas number-one in Ireland that year.

===Australia===
Situated in the southern hemisphere, where seasons are reversed from the northern, the heat of early summer in Australia affects the way Christmas is celebrated and how northern hemisphere Christmas traditions are followed. Australians generally spend Christmas outdoors, going to the beach for the day, or heading to campgrounds for a vacation. International visitors to Sydney at Christmastime often go to Bondi Beach where tens of thousands gather on Christmas Day.

The tradition of an Australian Christmas Eve carol service lit by candles, started in 1937 by Victorian radio announcer Norman Banks, has taken place in Melbourne annually since then. Carols by Candlelight events can be &quot;huge gatherings . . televised live throughout the country&quot; or smaller &quot;local community and church events.&quot; Carols in the Domain in Sydney is now a &quot;popular platform for the stars of stage and music.&quot;

Some homegrown Christmas songs have become popular. William G. James&#x27; six sets of &quot;Australian Christmas Carols&quot;, with words by John Wheeler, include &quot;The Three Drovers&quot;, &quot;The Silver Stars are in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Christmas Day&quot;, &quot;Carol of the Birds&quot; and others. &quot;Light-hearted Australian Christmas songs&quot; have become &quot;an essential part of the Australian Christmas experience.&quot; Rolf Harris&#x27; &quot;Six White Boomers&quot;, Colin Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;Aussie Jingle Bells&quot;, and the &quot;Australian Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, proudly proclaim the differing traditions Down Under. A verse from &quot;Aussie Jingle Bells&quot; makes the point:
&lt;poem&gt;
Engine&#x27;s getting hot
Dodge the kangaroos
Swaggie climbs aboard
He is welcome too
All the family is there
Sitting by the pool
Christmas Day, the Aussie way
By the barbecue!
&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; has been revised to fit the Australian context, as an example: &quot;On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me: 12 parrots prattling, 11 numbats nagging, 10 lizards leaping, 9 wombats working, 8 dingoes digging, 7 possums playing, 6 brolgas dancing, 5 kangaroos, 4 koalas cuddling, 3 kookaburras laughing, 2 pink galahs, and an emu up a gum tree.&quot;

Other popular Australian Christmas songs include: &#x27;White Wine in the Sun&quot; by Tim Minchin, &quot;Aussie Jingle Bells&quot; by Bucko &amp; Champs, &quot;Christmas Photo&quot; by John Williamson, &quot;Go Santa, Go&quot; by The Wiggles, and &quot;Six White Boomers&quot; by Russel Coight.

&quot;My Little Christmas Belle&quot; (1909) composed by Joe Slater (1872–1926) to words by Ward McAlister (1872–1928) celebrates eastern Australian flora coming into bloom during the heat of Christmas. &quot;Blandfordia nobilis&quot;, also known as Christmas Bells, are the specific subject of the song—with the original sheet music bearing a depiction of the blossom. Whereas &quot;The Holly and The Ivy&quot; (1937) by Australian Louis Lavater (1867–1953) mentions northern hemisphere foliage.

Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly first released &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot; as part of a four-track EP November 4, 1996, through White Label Records. The title track, written by Kelly, tells the story in a letter to his brother from a newly imprisoned man who laments how he will be missing the family Christmas. It received a Song of the Year nomination at the 1998 Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Music Awards. Kelly&#x27;s theme reflects a national experience with Christmas:

===Philippines===

The Philippines, a tropical country, has a long tradition of Christmas music influenced by its climate and cultural traditions. Originally building from Spanish and American influences, Filipinos has developed its own Christmas music traditions. These began as far back as 1933, with carols written by Vicente D. Rubil and Levi Celerio. Most Filipino Christmas music is written in the Tagalog language, and some in English and other Philippine languages.

Most Filipino Christmas songs describe the local Christmas traditions and traditions such as caroling, &quot;parol&quot;, Simbang Gabi/Misa de Gallo, returning to one&#x27;s hometown for the holidays and the Nochebuena. Songs can be celebratory or sentimental, with the sentimental songs aimed toward overseas Filipinos who long for the Christmas season in the Philippines. Other songs describe the Biblical narrative of Christmas or call to love and charity. The most popular Filipino Christmas song is Jose Mari Chan&#x27;s &quot;Christmas in Our Hearts&quot;. The success of that song led to a Christmas album from Chan with the same name, which went on to become the best-selling album in Original Pilipino Music (OPM) music with more than 800,000 albums sold.

Radio stations in the Philippines usually play Christmas music, both local and foreign, as early as September up to Christmas Day or New Year&#x27;s Eve, but Philippine radio stations usually do not switch to an all-Christmas format, instead interspersing Christmas music onto their regular music programming. Major television networks in the Philippines also have a tradition of producing Christmas-themed station IDs, which take the form of promotional music videos, some of which became popular such as &quot;Star ng Pasko&quot; and &quot;Thank You, Thank You, Ang Babait Ninyo&quot; produced for ABS-CBN.

===Other popular Christmas songs===
&quot;Jolly Old Saint Nicholas&quot; originated with a poem by Emily Huntington Miller (1833–1913), published as &quot;Lilly&#x27;s Secret&quot; in &quot;The Little Corporal Magazine&quot; December 1865. Lyrics have also been attributed to Benjamin Hanby, who wrote Up on the Housetop in 1864, but the words commonly heard today resemble Miller&#x27;s 1865 poem. James R. Murray is attributed as composer in the first publication of the music in &quot;School Chimes, A New School Music Book&quot; by S. Brainard&#x27;s Sons in 1874. Early notable recordings were made by Ray Smith (1949), Chet Atkins (1961), Eddy Arnold (1962), and Alvin and the Chipmunks (1963).

&quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot;, introduced in the musical film &quot;On the Avenue&quot; by Dick Powell and Alice Faye in 1937, was written by Irving Berlin. &quot;The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot&quot; – written by Michael Carr, Tommie Connor, and Jimmy Leach in 1937 – was notably performed by Vera Lynn and Nat King Cole. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;, by lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent, was recorded by Bing Crosby in 1943. &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; is credited to Lou Baxter and Johnny Moore, whose group originally recorded it in 1947, featuring singer and pianist Charles Brown. Kay Thompson introduced her &quot;The Holiday Season&quot; in 1945, which later became part of a medley by Andy Williams. &quot;A Marshmallow World&quot; (sometimes called &quot;It&#x27;s a Marshmallow World&quot;) was written in 1949 by Carl Sigman (lyrics) and Peter DeRose (music).

More popular songs which reference the Nativity include &quot;I Wonder as I Wander&quot; (1933), &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot; (1956), &quot;Carol of the Drum&quot; (&quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;) (1941), and &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot; (1962).

===Christmas songs from musicals===
&quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot;, written by Irving Berlin, was introduced in the musical film &quot;On the Avenue&quot; by Dick Powell and Alice Faye in 1937. &quot;White Christmas&quot; was introduced in the film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), while &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; was from &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), and &quot;Silver Bells&quot; &quot;The Lemon Drop Kid&quot; (1950). The operetta &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1903) featured the song &quot;Toyland&quot;. The 1934 film adaptation, a Laurel and Hardy musical film known by alternative titles, opened with the song. Introducing Christmas-themed songs that have yet to achieve popularity, &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970) included &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, &quot;December the 25th&quot;, and the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Thank You Very Much&quot;.

&quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot; was written for a 1976 musical entitled &quot;Scraps&quot;, which was an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Little Match Girl;&quot; it underwent substantial revision for Cliff Richard&#x27;s 1988 version. &quot;Hard Candy Christmas&quot; was written by Carol Hall for the 1982 musical, &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, and later released by Dolly Parton (who starred in the film version) as a single. &quot;Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993) features Christmas-themed songs like &quot;Making Christmas&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This?&quot;, &quot;Town Meeting Song&quot;, and &quot;Jack&#x27;s Obsession&quot;.

===Christmas novelty songs===
Musical parodies of the season – comical or nonsensical songs performed principally for their comical effect – are often heard around Christmas. Many novelty songs employ unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be particularly musical. The term arose in the Tin Pan Alley world of popular songwriting, with novelty songs achieving great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s.

The Christmas novelty song genre, which got its start with &quot;I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas&quot; written by Yogi Yorgesson and sung by him with the Johnny Duffy Trio in 1949, includes such notable titles as:
* &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; by the Singing Dogs was recorded in 1955 by Don Charles from Copenhagen; considered the work of Carl Weismann, it was revolutionary in its use of the latest recording technology.
* &quot;Green Chri$tma$&quot;, a radio play parody by Stan Freberg that came out in 1958 and satirized commercial advertising.
* &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Spend My Christmas with a Dalek,&quot; a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off song, released in 1964 by The Go-Go&#x27;s (the 1960s British band, not the later American band of the same name). Originally intended to help fuel Dalekmania, it tried to turn the sinister Daleks into another version of The Chipmunks.
* &quot;Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy&quot;, co-written and recorded by Buck Owens in 1965, has been covered by other country music stars, including Garth Brooks, Travis Tritt, and Brad Paisley.

In the 1970s comedic singing duo Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s debut single in 1971 was &quot;Santa Claus and His Old Lady&quot;. The Kinks did &quot;Father Christmas&quot; in 1977, and Elmo &amp; Patsy came out with &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot; in 1979. More recent titles added to the canon include:

* &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; parodies (including one by Bob and Doug McKenzie in 1982)
* &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot; by Weird Al Yankovic (1986)
* &quot;Rusty Chevrolet&quot; by Da Yoopers, a parody of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot;, a rap single by Run–D.M.C. (1987)
* &quot;A Rubber Band Christmas&quot; – an entire album featuring traditional and popular Christmas songs played on rubber bands, staplers and other office equipment (1996)
* &quot;Christmas Convoy&quot;, a southern rock song by Paul Brandt, a parody of the C.W. McCall song &quot;Convoy&quot; (2006)

Seattle radio personality Bob Rivers became nationally famous for his line of novelty Christmas songs and released five albums (collectively known as the &quot;Twisted Christmas&quot; quintilogy, after the name of Rivers&#x27; radio program, &quot;Twisted Radio&quot;) consisting entirely of Christmas parodies from 1987 to 2002. &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot Me Santa&quot; was released by The Killers in 2007, benefiting various AIDS charities. Christmas novelty songs can involve gallows humor and even morbid humor like that found in &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot; and &quot;The Night Santa Went Crazy&quot;, both by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. The Dan Band released several adult-oriented Christmas songs on their 2007 album &quot;Ho: A Dan Band Christmas&quot; which included &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho&quot; (ho being slang for a prostitute), &quot;I Wanna Rock You Hard This Christmas&quot;, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Bomb Nobody This Holiday&quot; and &quot;Get Drunk &amp; Make Out This Christmas&quot;.

Kristen Bell and a cappella group Straight No Chaser &quot;teamed up to poke fun at the modern seasons greeting&quot; with &quot;Text Me Merry Christmas&quot;:

:Text me Merry Christmas
:Let me know you care
:Just a word or two
:Of text from you
:Will remind me you&#x27;re still there

Straight No Chaser singer Randy Stine said of the song: &quot;We wanted a Christmas song that spoke to how informal communication has become.&quot;

====Juvenile====

Christmas novelty songs include many sung by young teens, or performed largely for the enjoyment of a young audience. Starting with &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; sung by 13-year-old Jimmy Boyd in 1952, a few other notable novelty songs written to parody the Christmas season and sung by young singers include:

* &quot;I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas&quot; sung by 10-year-old Gayla Peevey (1953)
* &quot;Nuttin&#x27; for Christmas&quot; by Art Mooney and Barry Gordon, who was seven years old when he sang it (1955)
* &quot; (Where is Santa Claus?)&quot; sung by 12-year-old Augie Rios, featuring the Mark Jeffrey Orchestra (1959)

Christmas novelty songs aimed at a young audience include:

* &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot;, written by Donald Yetter Gardner in 1944 and introduced by Spike Jones and his City Slickers (1948)
* &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; with music and lyrics by British songwriter Tommie Connor was first recorded by 13-year-old Jimmy Boyd in 1952, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in December of that year. The Jackson 5 recorded a popular cover in 1970 with a young Michael Jackson singing lead.
* &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot;, written by Ross Bagdasarian Sr./David Seville and performed by Alvin and the Chipmunks (1958)
* &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot; originally done for the 1966 cartoon special &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;; lyrics written by Dr. Seuss, music by Albert Hague, and performed by Thurl Ravenscroft
* &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Christmas&quot; performed by The Royal Guardsmen in 1967; a follow-up to their earlier song &quot;Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron&quot; recorded in 1966
* &quot;Santa Claus Is a Black Man&quot; by Akim and the Teddy Vann Production Company (1973)

The number of Christmas novelty songs is so vast that radio host Dr. Demento devotes an entire month of weekly two-hour episodes to the format each year, and the novelty songs receive frequent requests at radio stations across the country.

===Non-Christian writers===
Approximately half of the 30 best-selling Christmas songs by ASCAP members in 2015 were written by Jewish composers. Johnny Marks has three top Christmas songs, the most for any writer—&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot;, and &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;. By far the most recorded Christmas song is &quot;White Christmas&quot; by Irving Berlin (born Israel Isidore Beilin in Russia)—who also wrote &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;—with well over 500 versions in dozens of languages.

Others include: 
* &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot; by Sammy Cahn (born Cohen) and Jule Styne (who also wrote &quot;The Christmas Waltz&quot; together)
* &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (composer Felix Bernard was born Felix William Bernhardt)
* &quot;The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)&quot; by Robert Wells (born Levinson) and Mel Tormé 
* &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; (lyricist Mitchell Parish was born Michael Hyman Pashelinsky in Lithuania)
* &quot;It&#x27;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; (composer George Wyle was born Bernard Weissman)
* &quot;Silver Bells&quot; by Jay Livingston (born Jacob Levinson) and Ray Evans
* &quot;(There&#x27;s No Place Like) Home for the Holidays&quot; by Bob Allen (born Robert Allen Deitcher) and Al Stillman (born Albert Silverman)
* &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot; by Walter Kent (born Walter Kauffman) and Buck Ram (born Samuel). 
* &quot;Santa Baby&quot; by Joan Ellen Javits (Zeeman), niece of Senator Jacob Javits, and Philip Springer.
* &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; by Frank Loesser
Lyricist Jerome &quot;Jerry&quot; Leiber and composer Mike Stoller wrote &quot;Santa Claus Is Back in Town&quot;, which Elvis Presley debuted on his first Christmas album in 1957. &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; was written by Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry (with Phil Spector), originally for Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes. It was made into a hit by Darlene Love in 1963.

&quot;Peace on Earth&quot; was written by Ian Fraser, Larry Grossman, and Alan Kohan as a counterpoint to &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; (1941) to make David Bowie comfortable recording &quot;Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy&quot; with Bing Crosby on September 11, 1977 – for Crosby&#x27;s then-upcoming television special, &quot;Bing Crosby&#x27;s Merrie Olde Christmas&quot;.

==Adopted Christmas music==

What is known as Christmas music today, coming to be associated with the holiday season in some way, has often been adopted from works initially composed for other purposes. Many tunes adopted into the Christmas canon carry no Christmas connotation at all. Some were written to celebrate other holidays and gradually came to cover the Christmas season.

* &quot;Tempus Adest Floridum&quot;, a romantic spring carol with Latin words dating to the 13th-century &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; and a melody attested no later than 1584, became associated with Christmas after John Mason Neale set his epic ballad &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; to its melody in 1853. Neale&#x27;s poem does not directly mention Christmas or the nativity but describes Bohemian Duke Wenceslas I&#x27;s journey to aid a poor traveler on a cold St. Stephen&#x27;s Day; that day falls on the day after Christmas and within the traditional Twelve Days of Christmas.
* &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, with words written by Isaac Watts in 1719 and music by Lowell Mason (who in turn borrowed liberally from Handel) in 1839, was originally written anticipating the Second Coming.
* &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, first published under the title &quot;One Horse Open Sleigh&quot; in 1857, was originally associated with Thanksgiving rather than Christmas.
*With a Welsh melody dating back to the sixteenth century, and English lyrics from 1862, &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; celebrates the pagan holiday of Yule and the New Year, but not explicitly Christmas (&quot;Troll the ancient Yuletide carol/See the blazing Yule before us/While I tell of Yuletide treasure&quot;).

&quot;Shchedryk&quot;, a Ukrainian tune celebrating the arrival of springtime, was adapted in 1936 with English lyrics to become the Christmas carol &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; and in 1995 as the heavy-metal instrumental &quot;Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24.&quot; &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, an Academy Award-winning song about dreams, hope, and magic featured in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940). What later became the main theme for Disney studios was sung by Cliff Edwards, who voiced Jiminy Cricket in the film. In Scandinavian countries and Japan, the song is used in reference to the Star of Bethlehem and the &quot;ask, and it will be given to you&quot; discourse in Matthew 7:7–8; in the movie it is in reference to the Blue Fairy.

Many popular Christmas tunes of the 20th-century mention winter imagery, leading to their being adopted into the Christmas and holiday season. These include:

* &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (1934)
* &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; (1937)
* &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; (1944)
* &quot;A Marshmallow World&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; (1957)
* &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (1959)

&quot;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&quot; (2013), from the movie &quot;Frozen&quot;, features lyrics that are more of an illustration of the relationship between the two main characters than a general description of winter or the holidays, but its title rhetoric and the winter imagery used throughout the film have led it to be considered a holiday song.

&quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, composed originally in 1948 as an instrumental by Leroy Anderson, was inspired by a heatwave in Connecticut. The song premiered with the Boston Pops Orchestra in May 1948 with no association with Christmas. The lyrics added in 1950 have &quot;nothing to do with Santa, Jesus, presents or reindeer,&quot; but the jingling bells and &quot;sleigh&quot; in the title made it a natural Christmas song. Lyricist Sammy Cahn and composer Jule Styne also found themselves in a heatwave in July 1945 when they wrote &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot;, inserting no reference to Christmas in the song. &quot;Holiday&quot; (2010) is about the summer holidays, but has been used in some Christmas ad campaigns.

Perry Como famously sang Franz Schubert&#x27;s setting of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in his televised Christmas special each year, including the song on &quot;The Perry Como Christmas Album&quot; (1968). The song, a prayer to the Virgin Mary (quoted from the Gospel of Luke) sung in Latin, would become a &quot;staple of family holiday record collections.&quot; American &quot;a capella&quot; group Pentatonix released their version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, the 1984 song written by Leonard Cohen and covered famously by a number of acts, on their Christmas album shortly before the songwriter&#x27;s death in 2016. Besides the title, and several biblical (Old Testament) references, the song contains no connection to Christmas or the holidays &quot;per se&quot;; an earlier 2014 rewrite introduced by Cloverton repurposed the tune and some of Cohen&#x27;s lyrics to make it more explicitly Christian and Christmas-themed. Various versions have been added to Christmas music playlists on radio stations in the United States and Canada.

In the United Kingdom, songs not explicitly tied to Christmas are popularly played during the year-end holidays. &quot;Stop the Cavalry&quot;, written and performed by English musician Jona Lewie in 1980, was intended as a war protest, which his record label was unwilling to release in its original form. The label reworked the record, added a tubular bell and a brass band sound, and built upon a throwaway line about wanting to be &quot;home for Christmas&quot; to make the song a Christmas song.

==Radio broadcasting of Christmas music==
In the United States, it is common for local radio stations to gradually begin adding Christmas music to their regular playlists in late-November, typically after Thanksgiving (which is generally considered the official start of the holiday season), and sometimes culminating with all-Christmas music by Christmas itself. More prominently, some stations temporarily drop their regular music format entirely and switch exclusively to Christmas music for the holiday season, a practice that emerged in 2001.

<text>The Vale of York is an area of flat land in the northeast of England. The vale is a major agricultural area and serves as the main north–south transport corridor for Northern England.

The Vale of York is a broad area of flat land in northeast England. Common misconception extends its borders from the River Tees in the north to the Humber Estuary in the south. However, the true Vale of York occupies the central portion of this region. The Vale of Mowbray lies to its north, and the Humberhead Levels border it to the south. York lies in the middle of the area.

==Geography==

===Climate===
As part of Great Britain, the Vale of York generally has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night and January is the coldest time of the year. The vale is in the rain shadow of the Pennines so has a lower rainfall total than areas to the west. It is also subject to more fog and frosts in winter than other areas because of the tendency of cold air to drain into the vale from surrounding higher ground.

===Geology===
Beneath the drift deposits of the Vale of York lie Triassic sandstone and mudstone, and lower Jurassic mudstone but these are completely masked by the surface deposits. These deposits include glacial till, sand and gravel and both terminal and recessional moraines left by receding ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The Escrick moraine extends across the vale from west to east and the York moraine, 8 miles further north, forms a similar curving ridge from York eastwards to Sand Hutton. To the north of these ridges are deposits of clay, sand and gravel left by a glacial lake. There are also areas of river alluvium consisting of clay, silt and sand deposited by the main rivers and streams.

===Drainage===
The Vale of York is drained southwards by the River Ouse and its tributaries, the Ure, the Nidd and the Foss. To the east of the area the River Derwent drains southwards into the Ouse. There are also frequent stream courses and drainage channels which link with the main rivers crossing the vale. Many of these watercourses are maintained and managed by local internal drainage boards to ensure sustainable water levels are kept across the vale.

==Natural history==
The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi natural woodlands. There are some large areas of conifer plantation, mainly Scots Pine, on the infertile sandy areas.

Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left along the river valleys although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.

==History==
The drier land in the Vale of York, away from the river valleys, would have been extensively cleared for pastoral farming and small scale cropping before the Roman era. The area around York was significantly influenced by the Romans who established their legionary fortress of Eboracum there. There is evidence of villas, forts, signal stations and roads constructed by them.

The vale suffered badly from the Harrying of the North when King William I devastated the northern counties of England to punish the population for their resistance to his conquest. Later, in the English Medieval period, manors and villages were established with open fields, some of which survived until the inclosure acts of the 18th century. During the English Civil War, between Royalists and Parliamentarians, the Battle of Marston Moor was fought on land to the west of York.

==Economy==
The soils, formed from glacial till, sand and gravel are generally fertile and nearly all the land is in arable use growing large areas of wheat, sugar beet and potatoes. There is a steady move away from livestock rearing and dairy farming.

The city of York tends to dominate the vale economically and is a centre for tourism, retail, commerce, light engineering and food processing. The University of York and its associated science park are also major economic assets.

==Transport==
The A1 and A19 trunk roads pass through the vale carrying traffic in a north–south direction and a number of other major roads radiate from York. The East Coast Main Line railway connecting London with Edinburgh traverses the vale from north to south and there are a number of east–west rail links to Leeds, Harrogate and Scarborough.

==Places of interest==
===Settlements===
The largest settlement in the vale, apart from York, is Haxby. Other villages typically exhibit a linear form with houses of mottled pink brick and pantiled roofs facing each other on either side of a main street.

<text>Askham Bog is small area of peat bog and Site of Special Scientific Interest situated within the Vale of York in North Yorkshire, England. It lies to the south-west of York, north of Copmanthorpe and near Askham Richard and Askham Bryan. It is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in Northern England.

During the 2010s, a development of 500 houses was proposed for the edge of the bog on the outskirts of York city, but this was overturned in 2020.

==History and geographical formation==

Askham Bog formed in the Vale of York in a hollow which was flooded by meltwater from the last glacial retreat about 15,000 years ago. Two ridges of terminal moraine had formed on either side of the hollow, trapping the glacial meltwater between and behind them.

The bog has a lowermost layer of boulder clay, sand, and gravel, which is sealed. Above this lies a distinct stratum of organic deposits, which collectively reflect a series of biological and geological periods. The basal clay layer is overlain by more lake clay and nutrient-rich nekron mud supplied by surrounding moraines. Higher up there are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat, of which the latter also contains traces of &quot;Scorpidium&quot; and &quot;Eriophorum&quot;. The Nekron peat layer reflects a permanent change to a relatively warm post-glacial climate. This layer formed during that time and contains an abundance of plant remains, indicating a period of rich floral growth. Some of these plants include &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, holly-leaved naiad and bogbean.

When common reed colonised the bog, as evidenced by the presence of fossilised root fragments immediately above the Nekron bog layer, this led to a reduction in the extent of open water. Consequently, a layer of fen peat gradually built up above the bog mud in the centre of the bog, forming a raised bog. The increased elevation in the centre cut the bog off from the direct influx of base-rich water from the surrounding land. Rainfall leached out existing bases in the raised peat, leading to a net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog. This gradual loss of bases increased the soil&#x27;s acidity and caused the loss of the original rich bog community that previously covered the whole area.

The nutrient-poor, acidic environment created by the bog&#x27;s gradual isolation from minerotrophic water sources allowed acidophilic sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute significantly to the bulk of the peat formed above the fen margins. The continued net accumulation of peat led to a further increase in the elevation of the central peat dome, eventually completely cutting off the supply of base-rich groundwater and rendering the peat centre ombrotrophic. Conversely, the rich fen community at the margins, which receives an influx of base-rich groundwater from the surrounding moraines, creates ecological conditions like those of the East Anglian fens.

A site on the edge of Askham Bog was earmarked by a developer for a plot of 500 homes. The appeal by the community and Yorkshire Wildlife Trust enlisted the help of Sir David Attenborough, who said that &quot;it is our collective responsibility to save it.&quot; The development was denied by planning inspectors in May 2020.

==Ecology and habitats==

Askham Bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in Northern England; especially regarding plants, invertebrates and birds. The ecological diversity is due to a wide range of habitats ranging from fen-meadow with base-rich soils on the periphery to carr woodland and raised bog with acid soil in the centre, interspersed with dykes and stands of open water. The large habitat diversity may be partly explained by the many successional stages present which generally become more advanced towards the centre, in turn related to spatial differences in topography and soil pH. Askham Bog is one of the few northern examples in England to show such an array of habitat transitions.

Although the raised bog originally largely replaced the original fen, medieval peat cutting brought the vegetation back under the influence of base-rich groundwater. This extensive peat cutting, in turn, led to a return to fen conditions around some of the previously acid soils.

Askham Bog is a heavily wooded area, with birch being widespread throughout. Willow also grows extensively throughout. Alder and grey sallow are locally dominant on the fen margins, while oak is dominant in the acid centre. Other tree species growing alongside oak in the acid centre include hazel, alder buckthorn and rowan. Birch has declined in favour of oak, alder and ash, especially where much of the wood in the north central part has been clear-felled. The reduction in canopy cover in the centre of the bog appears to have had a negative effect on peat growth here, probably through reduced shading and hence increased desiccation of the peat and easier influx of atmospheric pollutants. In recent decades, sulphur deposition on the bog has increased due to polluted air moving downwind from a large industrial area with coal-fired power stations.

==Natural history==
===Herbaceous plants===

The diverse flora of Askham Bog is similar to plant communities in southern England. Notable species include greater spearwort, marsh stitchwort, saw sedge, marsh fern, great water dock, meadow thistle, purple small reed, &quot;Carex appropinquata&quot; and water violet. Askham Bog also holds the largest and most north-eastern colony in England of the rare gingerbread sedge &quot;Carex elongata&quot;, and is renowned for the presence of royal fern.

The vegetation of Askham Bog can be divided into two main groups, reflecting the broad underlying dichotomy between basic and acidic soil. One is a species-rich fen community around the margins. This includes characteristic species such as meadowsweet, common meadow rue, stinging nettle, marsh bedstraw, dewberry, bittersweet, skullcap, yellow loosestrife, creeping Jenny and rough meadow grass. The other community is a species-poor acid one towards the centre, including species such as &quot;Sphagnum palustre&quot;, purple moor grass, &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; and honeysuckle. Although the drop in pH and elevational increase on the peat domes is attributable to sphagnum growth, no sphagnum has been found in one vegetation assemblage characterized by honeysuckle and &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; within the acid centre of the bog. This appears to be inconsistent with the usual course of succession and may be explained by unusually high concentration of inorganic phosphate. Low water tables in the raised area may promote mineralization of phosphate, with low pH counteracting microbial conversion to organic phosphate, so that the resultant high inorganic phosphate component in the raised peat favours growth of this plant community.

===Birds===
Over 90 bird species have been recorded at Askham Bog, attracting both winter and summer visitors. Despite the proximity of potential sources of human disturbance, the bog provides suitable refuge for wildlife within a relatively unfavourable agricultural landscape and offers a rich supply of fruit and seed supply in winter and invertebrates in summer. Known resident species include marsh tit, willow tit, treecreeper, kingfisher, goldcrest, bullfinch, tawny owl, buzzard, sparrowhawk and sometimes green woodpecker Winter visitors include fieldfare, redwing, brambling, siskin, lesser redpoll, goldfinch, snipe, jack snipe, woodcock, coot and sometimes grasshopper warbler. All migrant warblers have been found at the bog in spring and summer, with the reed beds in the northeast part in Near Wood comprising an important colony for reed warblers.

===Invertebrates===
Askham Bog is nationally recognised for its diverse invertebrate fauna, including a variety of water beetles such as Haliplidae, Noteridae, Dytiscidae and Gyrinidae. The bog is also home to some rare beetle species including &quot;Dromius sigma&quot;, &quot;Agabus undulatus&quot;; alongside one record of &quot;Pselaphus dresdensis&quot; which has been found in moss from pond margins at the bog, the only known location in England. Beetle abundance and species richness have been decreasing at Askham Bog since the early 20th century. This coincides with the establishment of a municipal landfill site at the adjacent Challoner&#x27;s Whin. Other characteristic insect species include the fen square-spot moth and the emperor dragonfly.

There is a large proportion of wetland indicator spider species given the relatively dry status of the reserve and gradual encroachment by trees. This may be because the present spider community reflects historic moisture levels within the bog and is yet to completely respond to the habitat changes. A very rare spider species &quot;Cornicularia kochi&quot; (O.P.-C) in its hundreds was once recorded in piles of cut-down &quot;Phragmites&quot; during winter.

===Mammals and amphibians===
Typical amphibians of Askham Bog include common frog, common toad, and smooth newt. Typical mammals include roe deer and red foxes. The water vole was once common at Askham Bog, but has now been largely displaced by invasive American mink.

==Past use and current management==
===Peat cutting===
From the early Roman period until the mid-18th century, Askham Bog and its environsy appeared to have been intensely exploited for peat as fuel. The earliest evidence of nearby peat cutting from the Roman period was discovered in a Roman well in York in the form of lumps of sphagnum peat.

In the Middle Ages, peat was cut by the villagers of Dringhouses and Acomb, as evidenced by the written bylaws of the Manor of Drighouses and Acomb Court Rolls, which restricted peat cutting by tenants. The severe penalties imposed by these legal restrictions reflect the attempt by the local authorities back then to counteract the damaging intensity of peat extraction at Askham Bog. Intensive peat cutting had probably caused substantial topographical changes on the bog since its original geographic formation. In turn, a lowering of the acid peat layer through extraction would have allowed base-rich groundwater to inundate the centre, transforming it into an open fen. Further physical evidence exists in the form of dykes surrounding the current main peat domes. These dykes would have been dug to aid removal of peat by boat.

The whole bog became vegetated with woody shrubs and trees after cessation of peat cutting around the 1750s. It was then extensively used as game covert from the late 19th century until the Second World War, which probably explains the extensive felling of Far Wood during this time. The bog was acquired in 1946 by Sir Francis Terry and Joseph Rowntree, who subsequently both of whom gifted it to Yorkshire Naturalists&#x27; Trust (now known as Yorkshire Wildlife Trust) in 1946. It is Yorkshire Wildlife Trust&#x27;s oldest nature reserve.

===Hemp cultivation===
Fossil evidence found in distinct horizons between layers of fen peat and &quot;Scorpidium&quot;-&quot;Sphagnum&quot; peat at Askham Bog suggests that hemp was once cultivated there. The evidence takes the form of preserved hemp achenes and pollen, which may be relics of retting (steeping in water) Pollen of aquatic plants such water lilies and cattails have also been found in the same peat cores as hemp seeds and pollen. It is therefore suggested that these hemp residues were submerged during this period.

The cultivation of hemp at Askham was probably intense during the Tudor period, although the exact dates are not known. The crop was extensively cultivated and retted in England by royal decree for hemp rope for the British navy. Askham Bog&#x27;s Acomb Court Roll of 1594 provides documentary evidence of hemp retting restrictions due to the malodour produced by retted fibres and the potential for retting water to pollute rivers. However, hemp retting stopped in the 19th century with the increased importation of hemp rope from Europe and Russia and the increasing switch to sisal from America and jute from India..

===Habitat conservation===
The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust was originally established to conserve Askham Bog. The first management plan was designed to maintain habitat diversity throughout the bog. To achieve this, the National Conservation Corps was enlisted to create more open water by digging ponds and blocking dykes, along with scrub clearance in the damp cotton-grass areas. In 1998, Yorkshire Wildlife Trust received a substantial Heritage Lottery Fund for restoration of many of its nature reserves. A large portion of this funding was used to manage Askham Bog and maintain suitable water conditions for the wildlife.

Most of the species-rich fen areas are grazed by Exmoor ponies to encourage early successional plant species such as marsh orchid and meadow thistle, and to suppress vigorous grasses, reed and saplings. This is considered a more effective management tool than cutting, though some meadows on the site are still cut for hay..

<text>John I ( ; 11 April 1357 – 14 August 1433), also called John of Aviz, was King of Portugal from 1385 until his death in 1433. He is recognized chiefly for his role in Portugal&#x27;s victory in a succession war with Castile, preserving his country&#x27;s independence and establishing the Aviz (or Joanine) dynasty on the Portuguese throne. His long reign of 48 years, the most extensive of all Portuguese monarchs, saw the beginning of Portugal&#x27;s overseas expansion. John&#x27;s well-remembered reign in his country earned him the epithet of Fond Memory (&quot;de Boa Memória&quot;); he was also referred to as &quot;the Good&quot; (&quot;o Bom&quot;), sometimes &quot;the Great&quot; (&quot;o Grande&quot;), and more rarely, especially in Spain, as &quot;the Bastard&quot; (&quot;Bastardo&quot;).

== Early life ==
John was born in Lisbon as the natural son of King Peter I of Portugal by a woman named Teresa, who, according to the royal chronicler Fernão Lopes in the Chronicle of the King D. Pedro I, was a noble Galician. In the 18th century, António Caetano de Sousa found a 16th-century document in the archives of the Torre do Tombo in which she was named as Teresa Lourenço. In 1364, by request of Nuno Freire de Andrade, a Galician Grand Master of the Order of Christ, he was created Grand Master of the Order of Aviz.

When John&#x27;s half-brother Ferdinand I died in October 1383 without a male heir, strenuous efforts were made to secure the succession for Beatrice, Ferdinand&#x27;s only daughter and heir presumptive. Beatrice had married King John I of Castile, but popular sentiment was against an arrangement in which Portugal would have been virtually annexed by Castile. The 1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum followed, a period of political anarchy, when no monarch ruled the country.

== Acclamation ==
On 6 April 1385, the Council of the Kingdom (the Portuguese Cortes) met in Coimbra and declared John, then Master of Aviz, to be king of Portugal. This was followed by the liberation of almost all of the Minho in the course of two months as part of a war against Castile in opposition to its claims to the Portuguese throne. Soon after, the king of Castile again invaded Portugal with the purpose of conquering Lisbon and removing John I from the throne. John I of Castile was accompanied by French allied cavalry while English troops and generals took the side of John of Aviz (see Hundred Years&#x27; War). John and Nuno Álvares Pereira, his constable and talented supporter, repelled the attack in the decisive Battle of Aljubarrota on 14 August 1385. John I of Castile then retreated. The Castilian forces abandoned Santarém, Torres Vedras and Torres Novas, and many other towns were delivered to John I by Portuguese nobles from the Castilian side. As a result, the stability of the Portuguese throne was permanently secured.

On 2 February 1387, John I married Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, who had proved to be a worthy ally. The marriage consolidated an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance that endures to the present day.

== Reign ==


John I of Castile died in 1390 without issue from his wife Beatrice, which meant that a competing legitimate bloodline with a claim to the throne of Portugal died out. John I of Portugal was then able to rule in peace and concentrate on the economic development and territorial expansion of his realm. The most significant military actions were the siege and conquest of the city of Ceuta by Portugal in 1415, and the successful defence of Ceuta from a Moroccan counterattack in 1419. These measure were intended to help seize control of navigation off the African coast and trade routes from the interior of Africa.

The raids and attacks of the Reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula created captives on both sides who were either ransomed or sold as slaves. The Portuguese crown extended this practice to North Africa. After the attack on Ceuta, the king sought papal recognition of the military action as a Crusade. Such a ruling would have enabled those captured to be legitimately sold as slaves. In response to John&#x27;s request, Pope Martin V issued the Papal bull &quot;Sane charissimus&quot; of 4 April 1418, which confirmed to the king all of the lands he might win from the Moors. Under the auspices of Prince Henry the Navigator, voyages were organized to explore the African coast. These led to the discovery of the uninhabited islands of Madeira in 1417 and the Azores in 1427; all were claimed by the Portuguese crown.

Contemporaneous writers describe John as a man of wit who was very keen on concentrating power on himself, but at the same time possessed a benevolent and kind demeanor. His youthful education as master of a religious order made him an unusually learned king for the Middle Ages. His love for knowledge and culture was passed on to his sons, who are often referred to collectively by Portuguese historians as the &quot;illustrious generation&quot; (&quot;Ínclita Geração&quot;): Edward, the future king, was a poet and a writer; Peter, the Duke of Coimbra, was one of the most learned princes of his time; and Prince Henry the Navigator, the duke of Viseu, invested heavily in science and the development of nautical pursuits. In 1430, John&#x27;s only surviving daughter, Isabella, married Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and enjoyed an extremely refined court culture in his lands; she was the mother of Charles the Bold.
==Marriage and descendants==

On 2 February 1387, John I married Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, in Porto. From that marriage were born several famous princes and princesses of Portugal &quot;(infantes)&quot; that became known as the &quot;illustrious generation&quot;.

<doc id="153576" wikidata="Q1060796" url="?curid=153576" title="John IV of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; John IV (, ; 19 March 1604 – 6 November 1656), nicknamed John the Restorer (), was the King of Portugal whose reign, lasting from 1640 until his death, began the Portuguese restoration of independence from Habsburg Spanish rule. His accession established the House of Braganza on the Portuguese throne, and marked the end of the 60-year-old Iberian Union by which Portugal and Spain shared the same monarch.

Before becoming king, he was John II, the 8th Duke of Braganza. He was the grandson of Catherine, Duchess of Braganza, a claimant to the crown during the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580. On the eve of his death in 1656, the Portuguese Empire was at its territorial zenith, spanning the globe.

== Early life ==

John IV was born at Vila Viçosa and succeeded his father Teodósio II as Duke of Braganza when the latter died insane in 1630. He married Luisa de Guzmán (1613–66), the eldest daughter of Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia, in 1633. John was described as having blonde hair and an average height.

== Reign ==
=== Accession ===

When Philip II of Portugal (III of Spain) died, he was succeeded by his son Philip III (IV of Spain), who had a different approach to Portuguese issues. Taxes on the Portuguese merchants were raised, the Portuguese nobility began to lose its influence, and government posts in Portugal were increasingly occupied by Spaniards. Ultimately, Philip III tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, meaning Portuguese nobles stood to lose all of their power.

This situation culminated in a revolution organized by the nobility and the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, executed on 1 December 1640, sixty years after the accession of Philip II of Spain to the throne of Portugal. A plot was planned by several associates, known as the Forty Conspirators, who killed the Secretary of State, Miguel de Vasconcelos, and imprisoned the king&#x27;s cousin, Margaret of Savoy, the Vicereine of Portugal, governing the country in the King&#x27;s name. Philip&#x27;s troops were at the time fighting the Thirty Years&#x27; War and also dealing with a revolution in Catalonia, which severely hampered Spain&#x27;s ability to quash the rebellion.

Within a matter of hours and with popular support, John, then the 8th Duke of Braganza, was acclaimed as King John IV of Portugal (as legend goes, with the persuasion of his wife), claiming legitimate succession through his grandmother Catherine, Duchess of Braganza. The ensuing conflict with Spain brought Portugal into the Thirty Years&#x27; War as, at least, a peripheral player. From 1641 to 1668, the period during which the two nations were at war, Spain sought to isolate Portugal militarily and diplomatically, and Portugal tried to find the resources to maintain its independence through political alliances and maintenance of its colonial income.

=== Restoration War ===
His accession led to a protracted war with neighbouring Spain, a conflict known as the Portuguese Restoration War, which ended with the recognition of Portuguese independence in a subsequent reign (1668). Portugal signed lengthy alliances with France (1 June 1641) and Sweden (August 1641) but by necessity its only contributions in the Thirty Years&#x27; War were in the field against Spain and against Dutch encroachments on the Portuguese colonies.

The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years&#x27; War until 1648 and the Franco-Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch–Portuguese War until 1663. In Spain, a Portuguese invasion force defeated the Spanish at Montijo, near Badajoz, in 1644.

=== Imperial Recovery ===
Abroad, the Dutch took Portuguese Malacca (January 1641), and the Imam of Oman captured Muscat (1650). Nevertheless, the Portuguese, despite having to divide their forces among Europe, Brazil, and Africa, managed to retake Luanda, in Portuguese Angola, from the Dutch in 1648 and, by 1654, had recovered northern Brazil, which effectively ceased to be a Dutch colony. This was countered by the loss of Portuguese Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) to the Dutch, who took Colombo in 1656.

==Death and legacy==
King John IV died in 1656 and was succeeded by his son Afonso VI. His daughter, Catherine of Braganza, married King Charles II of England. Bombay in India was given as dowry to the English.

John was a patron of music and the arts, and a considerably sophisticated writer on music; in addition to this, he was a composer. During his reign he collected one of the largest libraries in the world, but it was destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Among his writings are a defense of Palestrina, and a &quot;Defense of Modern Music&quot; (Lisbon, 1649). One famous composition attributed to him is a setting of the &quot;Crux fidelis&quot;, a work that remains highly popular during Holy Week amongst church choirs. However, no known manuscript of the work exists, and it was first published only in 1869, in France. On stylistic grounds, it is generally recognized that the work was written in the 19th century.

In 1646, John IV proclaimed Mary, in her conception as the Immaculate Conception (the &#x27;Immaculata&#x27;), the Patroness of Portugal by royal decree of the House of Braganza. The doctrine had appeared in the Middle Ages and had been fiercely debated in the 15th and 16th centuries, but a bull issued in 1616 by Pope Paul V finally &quot;[forbade] anyone to teach or preach a contrary opinion.&quot; Three years later, in 1649, the iconography of the Immaculata was established by Francisco Pacheco (1564–1654), a Spanish artistic advisor to the Inquisition, based on &quot;Revelation XII:1&quot;.

==Marriages and descendants==
John married Luisa de Guzmán, daughter of Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán, 8th Duke of Medina-Sidonia. From that marriage several children were born. Because some of John&#x27;s children were born and died before their father became king they are not considered infantes or infantas (heirs to the throne) of Portugal.

<doc id="153577" wikidata="Q5133152" url="?curid=153577" title="Clifton, York">
<text>Clifton is a suburb of York in the unitary authority area of the City of York, in North Yorkshire, England about miles from the city centre. The A19, passes north out of York through Clifton.

The old village area was made a conservation area in 1968. Nestle Foods Factory and the Public School of St Peter&#x27;s and the former Queen Anne&#x27;s Grammar School are located in Clifton.

The name Clifton is derived from the Old English pre-7th century &quot;clif&quot;, meaning a gentle slope, or more usually a riverbank, and &quot;tun&quot;, an enclosure or settlement.

==History==
During Roman times a road through Clifton approached the Roman fortress in York from the north-west and headed towards the river crossing. A second road that left the fortress&#x27;s north-west gate may eventually have joined the other. The evidence from early timber buildings from the museum gardens and early burials from Bootham and Clifton suggest the roads existed from the 1st century. Sporadic 2nd century Roman occupation material and fragments of streets indicate that by that time expansion may have begun in Clifton. This development was not sustained and evidence indicates that from the 3rd century onwards the area beyond St Mary&#x27;s was given over to cemeteries.

Records show Clifton or Lady Windmill existed from the late-14th to the early-19th centuries in Burton Stone Lane. Between 1374 and 1413 it belonged to John de Roucliff. Other owners were Sir William Ingleby in the mid-15th century, and Sir William Robinson in the early-18th century. The last record of the mill being operational was in 1852, but there is no trace of the building now. 

The district was badly damaged during the Siege of York. On the street named Clifton, the timber-framed Old Manor House was rebuilt after the siege but is now grade II* listed.
Horse racing began in York towards the end of the 17th century. In 1708 the corporation recognised the potential for profit from horse racing and after Clifton landowner, Sir William Robinson, offered his land on Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings as a racecourse and donated £15 a year towards a plate. Following the winter of 1730 racing moved to the recently drained Knavesmire.

The York Diocesan Church Building Society, founded in 1861, contributed to building the parish church between 1867 and 1869.

==Governance==

Clifton is a ward in the Unitary Authority of the City of York. As of 2015, it is represented by Danny Myers and Margaret Wells, both of whom are members of the local Labour Party.

Clifton was a township in the parish of St Olave-Mary-Gate, in 1866 Clifton became a civil parish, in 1894 the parish was abolished and the part in the County Borough of York became Clifton Within and that in the rural district became Clifton Without. In 1891 the parish had a population of 7770. Until 1974 Clifton was in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

==Demography==

The figures below were taken from the Census 2001 Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales, from the Office for National Statistics on 29 April 2001.

The population in Clifton Ward was 12,017 of which 91.1% were born in England and 4.9% from outside the United Kingdom. The largest age group, 22.2%, were between 30 and 44 years old. Of the total population, 94.6% described their ethnic origin as White-British. The figures show that 67.8% declared they were Christian, whilst 30.2% declared no religious belief. Of the population aged between 16 and 74 years old, 59.7% declared they were in some form of employment and 10.5% said they were retired. Of the 5,337 households, 21% lived in semi-detached and 57.5% in terraced houses. The level of household ownership was 58%.
In 2011, the population of Clifton rose to 13,548 in 5,652 houses.

==Geography==

Clifton is bounded by the parish of Rawcliffe and Clifton Without to the north, Holgate to the south-west, Heworth to the east and Guildhall Ward to the south-east. The Ward boundary runs from the River Ouse in the west, opposite Acomb Landing, along the back of the Homestead Park and York Sports Club and across the A19 following Water Lane and Lilbourne Drive. It continues north-east along the Bur Dike to behind Burton Green Primary School before heading south-east and then east across Bootham Stray, the B1363 and the Nestle Factory to the River Foss. The river forms the eastern boundary as far as Diamond Street and Walpole Street, where it heads west and then south to the junction of Clarence Street with the Haxby and Wigginton Roads. It heads west past the York District Hospital and then south along the York to Scarborough Railway Line until it reaches the River Ouse at Scarborough Bridge. The remainder of the boundary follows the river north-west to Acomb Landing.

==Economy==

Most of the population find employment in the city centre or the many retail and industrial parks on the outskirts of York such as Clifton Moor in the nearby area of Clifton Without. Employment can be found within the ward at the Nestle Foods Factory on Haxby Road, and the York District Hospital on Wigginton Road.

==Community==

The City of York General Hospital was built by the city corporation in 1938, but was work suspended during the war. The building, comprising half of the intended scheme cost about £100,000, it was opened in 1941 between Huntington Road and Haxby Road. The hospital was next to the Grange and shared facilities, including the nurses&#x27; home. The hospital was expanded and renamed York District Hospital in 1977 and from 2010 is now known as The York Hospital.

The North Riding Lunatic Asylum joined the National Health Service as Clifton Hospital in 1948 but closed in 1994.

Clifton Cinema was built for Mr J Prendergast and Mr Mawson to the designs of Frederick Dyer. It is of Georgian style and the designers were responsible for the Rialto Cinema, now a bingo hall, in Fishergate. The Clifton opened on 17 November 1937 with the film “Edge of the World” starring John Laurie, Finlay Currie and Campbell Robson, directed by Michael Powell. The cinema seated 1,150 in the stalls and balcony. It was equipped with a two manual Compton organ, first played in 1938 but removed in the early 1960s. The Clifton survived longer than many of York&#x27;s cinemas, but closed on 17 October 1964 with the final film being &quot;Valley of the Eagle&quot;. As of 2010, it is the home of Clifton Bingo and Social Club.

Bootham Crescent, the old home of York City F.C., was located in Clifton before it was demolished to make way for a housing estate.

Homestead Park on Water End has a Youth Hostel in its grounds. The park was given to the people of the city by Seebohm Rowntree, son of Joseph. It is maintained by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

There are council run allotments at Crichton Avenue and Wigginton Terrace, just off Wigginton Road.

==Education==
St. Peter&#x27;s School, an independent, co-educational secondary school was founded in the 7th century, and is the third oldest school in the world. St Peter&#x27;s was originally the school attached to York Minster. The school is where Guy Fawkes was educated. Queen Anne Grammar School for Girls began as the Municipal Secondary School for Girls in 1906, located in Brook Street, and was officially recognised as a secondary school in 1908. The Brook Street premises were closed in 1909 and pupils transferred to a new school building, on a -acre site on Queen Anne&#x27;s Road, Clifton. New classrooms and additional cloakrooms were erected in 1914. The school closed in 2000 and the campus was taken over by St Olave&#x27;s School, the junior school of St Peter&#x27;s.

Clifton National School for Girls and Infants or Burton Stone Lane School, was opened in 1841. In 1878 the girls were transferred to the new Clifton girls&#x27; school and Burton Lane continued as an infants&#x27; school until 1892 when they rejoined the girls&#x27; school. The Burton Lane School was closed in 1892 and the building demolished. In 1914, additional accommodation for the infants was obtained in the parochial hall in Water Lane and the school itself was used for girls only. By 1932 the school had been reorganised to provide infant accommodation only. The school became a controlled voluntary primary school in 1950 and is known as Burton Green School.

Burton Stone Lane County Secondary Modern School was a girls&#x27; school, and sometimes known as Water Lane School, was opened in October 1942. The senior girls&#x27; department from Shipton Street School was transferred here and formed the nucleus of the school. The building was completed in 1945. As of 2010, it is the council run Burton Stone Community Centre. 

Burdyke County Primary School in Kingsway North, on the Water Lane estate, was opened in September 1954. It is now Burton Green Primary School. Clifton Green Primary School is now known as Kingsway Junior School. Clifton is in the secondary school catchment area of the Vale of York Academy in Clifton Without.

==Religious sites==

The Grade II listed St Philip and St James&#x27; Church, Clifton, was built between 1866 and 1867 next to Clifton Green, G.F. Jones of York being the architect.

The first Methodist society in Clifton met in a cottage in the 1870s and in April 1884 the Avenue Terrace Chapel was opened. A larger chapel on the site of &#x27;Clifton Cottage&#x27; was opened in 1909.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church is located on the roundabout at the northern end of Kingsway North on Burdyke Avenue.

==Notable people==

<doc id="153578" wikidata="Q676301" url="?curid=153578" title="John VI of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; John VI (Portuguese: &quot;João VI&quot;; 13 May 1767 – 10 March 1826), nicknamed &quot;the Clement&quot;, was King of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves from 1816 to 1825. Although the United Kingdom of Portugal ceased to exist &quot;de facto&quot; beginning in 1822, he remained its monarch &quot;de jure&quot; between 1822 and 1825. After the recognition of the independence of Brazil under the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro of 1825, he continued as King of Portugal until his death in 1826. Under the same treaty, he also became titular Emperor of Brazil for life, while his son, Emperor Dom Pedro I, was both &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; the monarch of the newly independent country.

John VI was born in Lisbon during the reign of his maternal grandfather, King Dom Joseph I of Portugal. He was the second son of the Princess of Brazil and Infante Peter of Portugal, who later became Queen Dona Maria I and King Dom Peter III. In 1785, John married Carlota Joaquina of Spain, with whom he had nine children. He became heir to the throne when his older brother, Prince José, died of smallpox in 1788. Before his accession to the throne, John bore the titles Duke of Braganza, Duke of Beja, and Prince of Brazil. From 1799, he served as prince regent due to his mother&#x27;s mental illness. In 1816, he succeeded his mother as monarch of the Portuguese Empire, with no real change in his authority, since he already possessed absolute powers as regent.

One of the last representatives of absolute monarchy in Europe, John lived during a turbulent period; his reign never saw a lasting peace. Throughout his period of rule, major powers such as Spain, France, and Great Britain continually intervened in Portuguese affairs. Forced to flee across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil when troops of Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, he found himself faced there with liberal revolts; he was compelled to return to Europe amid new conflicts. His marriage was no less conflictual, as his wife Carlota Joaquina repeatedly conspired against John in favor of personal interests or those of her native Spain.

John lost Brazil when his son Pedro declared independence, and his other son Miguel (later Dom Miguel I of Portugal) led a rebellion that sought to depose him. According to recent scholarly research, his death may well have been caused by arsenic poisoning. Notwithstanding these tribulations, John left a lasting mark, especially in Brazil, where he helped to create numerous institutions and services that laid a foundation for national autonomy, and many historians consider him to be a true mastermind of the modern Brazilian state. John&#x27;s contemporaries viewed him as a kind and benevolent king, although later generations of Portuguese and Brazilians have made him the subject of frequent caricature. However, in recent decades his reputation has been restored as a clever king who was able to balance many competing interests.

==Early life==

João Maria José Francisco Xavier de Paula Luís António Domingos Rafael was born 13 May 1767 during the reign of his maternal grandfather, King Dom Joseph I of Portugal. He was the second son of the King&#x27;s eldest daughter and heir, Dona Maria, Princess of Brazil (later Queen Dona Maria I) and Infante Peter of Portugal (later King Dom Peter III). Peter was not only Maria&#x27;s husband, but also her paternal uncle.

John was ten years old when his grandfather died and his mother ascended to the throne. His childhood and youth were lived quietly in the shadow of Queen Maria I&#x27;s older son and heir apparent, José, Prince of Brazil and Duke of Braganza. Folklore has Infante John as a rather uncultured youth, but according to Jorge Pedreira e Costa, he received as rigorous an education as his brother José did. Still, a French ambassador of the time painted him in unfavorable colors, seeing him as hesitant and dim. The record of this period of his life is too vague for historians to form any definitive picture. Little is known of the substance of his education. He surely received instruction in religion, law, French, and etiquette, and would presumably have learned history through reading the works of Duarte Nunes de Leão and João de Barros.

In 1785, Henrique de Meneses, 3rd Marquis of Louriçal, arranged a marriage between John and Infanta Carlota Joaquina of Spain, daughter of the Prince and Princess of Asturias (later King Charles IV and Queen Maria Luisa). Fearing a new Iberian Union, some in the Portuguese court viewed John&#x27;s marriage to a Spanish infanta unfavorably. Carlota Joaquina endured four days of testing by the Portuguese ambassadors before the marriage pact was confirmed. Because John and Carlota Joaquina were related and because of the bride&#x27;s youth (she was only 10 years old at the time), the marriage required a papal dispensation. They were second cousins, as John&#x27;s grandmother, Mariana Victoria, was the sister of Carlota&#x27;s grandfather, King Charles III of Spain. After being confirmed, the marriage capitulation was signed in the throne room of the Spanish court with great pomp and with the participation of both kingdoms. It was followed immediately by a proxy marriage. The marriage was consummated five years later.

Carlota Joaquina was received at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa at the beginning of May 1785, and on 9 June, the couple received a nuptial benediction at the palace chapel. However, the marriage seemed to be an uncomfortable one. An assiduous correspondence between John and Mariana at that time reveals that the absence of his sister weighed upon him and, comparing her to his young wife, he wrote, &quot;She is very smart and has a lot of judgment, whereas you have rather little, and I like her a lot, but for all that I cannot love her equally.&quot; John&#x27;s young bride was not inclined to docility, requiring at times the correction of Queen Maria herself. In addition, the difference in their ages (John being 17 years old) made him uncomfortable and anxious. Because Carlota Joaquina was so young, the marriage had not been consummated, and John wrote, &quot;Here&#x27;s to the arrival of the time when I shall play a lot with the Infanta. The way these things go, I think six years from now. Better that she be a bit more grown up than when she came.&quot; The consummation waited until 1790. In 1793, Carlota Joaquina gave birth to the first of nine children: Teresa, Princess of Beira.

The death of John&#x27;s older brother, José, on 11 September 1788, left John as the heir apparent to the throne, with the titles of Prince of Brazil and Duke of Braganza. Great things had been hoped for from José, who associated himself with the progressive ideas of the Enlightenment and appeared to have been inclined toward the anti-clerical policies of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal.

John, in contrast, was well known for his religiosity and his attachment to absolutism. The crisis of succession was aggravated with the death in November 1788 of the Queen&#x27;s confessor, Inácio de São Caetano, the titular archbishop of Thessalonica. The Archbishop had been a powerful political figure, influencing a controversial choice of the Queen&#x27;s ministers that favored John, but not without encountering strong opposition from important &quot;fidalgos&quot; who had ambitions for those posts. In the year after the deaths of his brother and the Archbishop, John became ill to the extent that his own survival was uncertain. He recovered, but in 1791, he again fell ill &quot;bleeding from the mouth and intestines&quot;, according to notes left by the chaplain of the Marquis of Marialva, who added that John&#x27;s spirit was always depressed. This created a tense climate and uncertainty about his future reign.

==Regency==

Meanwhile, the Queen showed increasing signs of mental instability. As a result, of her illness, the queen was deemed unfit to rule and John essentially took control of the country. John was reluctant to take the reins of power, rejecting the idea of a formal regency. This opened the way for elements of the nobility to form a &quot;de facto&quot; government via a Council. Rumors circulated that John exhibited symptoms of the same insanity, and that he might be prevented from ruling. According to longstanding laws that guided the institution of regency, were the regent to die or become incapable for any reason, and having children of less than fourteen years (which was John&#x27;s situation at the time), government would be exercised by the guardians of those children or, if guardians had not been formally named, by the wife of the regent. In John&#x27;s case, that would have been a Spanish infanta. Fear, suspicion and intrigue engulfed the entire institutional framework of the nation.

At the same time, the French Revolution perplexed and horrified the reigning houses of Europe. In January 1793, the revolutionaries executed their former king Louis XVI, precipitating an international response. On 15 July, Portugal signed a treaty with Spain, and on 26 September allied itself with Great Britain. Both treaties pledged mutual aid against revolutionary France and brought six thousand Portuguese soldiers into the War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795), a campaign that began with an advance to Roussillon in France and ended in defeat with the French conquest of northeastern Spain. This created a delicate diplomatic problem, as Portugal could not make peace with France without damaging an alliance with Britain that involved several overseas interests. The Portuguese thus sought a neutrality that proved fragile and tense.

After the defeat, Spain abandoned its alliance with Portugal and allied with France under the Peace of Basel. With Britain too powerful for France to attack directly, France set its sights on Portugal. In 1799, John officially assumed the reins of government as prince regent in the name of his mother; that same year, Napoleon Bonaparte staged his &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Brumaire in France and coerced Spain into issuing an ultimatum to force the Portuguese to break with Great Britain and submit the country to the interests of Napoleon. With John&#x27;s refusal, neutrality became unviable. Spain and France invaded in 1801, setting off the War of the Oranges; a defeated Portugal signed the Treaty of Badajoz and the subsequent Treaty of Madrid, under which it ceded territory to Spain, in particular Olivenza, and made concessions to the French over certain colonial territories. With conflicting interests among all the countries involved, the war was marked by ambiguous movements and secret agreements. Portugal, as the weakest player, could not avoid continued struggle. At the same time, John had to face an enemy at home. His wife, Princess Carlota Joaquina, loyal to Spanish interests, initiated an intrigue with the objective of deposing her husband and taking power herself. After this attempt failed in 1805, the Princess was exiled from court; she resided at Queluz Palace, while John took up residency at Mafra Palace. It was events like this that led to the Portuguese people questioning if John was capable of commanding the nation and whether he was as incapable of ruling as his mother was.

=== Flight to Brazil ===
John played a desperate game with France for time. For as long as he could, he pretended an apparent submission to France, to the point of suggesting to King George III of the United Kingdom the declaration of a fictitious state of war between their countries, but he did not obey the dictates of Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System (a blockade against Great Britain). A new secret treaty with the British guaranteed him help in case of an eventual flight of the royal family. The accord greatly favored the British and preserved their influence over the country, as British merchants continued to make vast profits in trade with the Portuguese intercontinental empire. It fell to Portugal to choose between an alliance with France or with Britain, and the hesitancy to decide firmly placed Portugal at risk of war with both. In October 1807, news arrived that a French army was approaching, and on 16 November, a British squadron arrived in the port of Lisbon with a force of seven thousand men with orders either to escort the royal family to Brazil or, if the government surrendered to France, to attack and conquer the Portuguese capital. The court was divided between Francophiles and Anglophiles, and after anguished consideration under pressure from both sides, John decided to accept British protection and leave for Brazil.

The invading army led by Jean-Andoche Junot advanced with some difficulty, arriving at the gates of Lisbon only on 30 November 1807. By this time, the Prince Regent, accompanied by the entire royal family and a large following of nobles, state functionaries and servants, had already embarked, leaving the government under a regency with the recommendation that the army not engage in hostilities with the invader. The hasty departure during a rainstorm caused havoc in Lisbon as an astonished population could not believe that their prince had abandoned them. According to the account of José Acúrsio das Neves, the departure brought forth deep emotion on the part of the Prince Regent:

To explain himself to the people, John ordered that posters be put up along the streets stating that his departure was unavoidable despite all efforts made to assure the integrity and peace of the Kingdom. The posters recommended that everyone remain calm, orderly and not resist the invaders, so that blood not be shed in vain. Because of the rush to depart, the Prince Regent was in a ship together with his mother and his sons Pedro, Prince of Beira (later Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil and King Dom Pedro IV of Portugal), and Miguel (later King Dom Miguel I). This was an imprudent decision given the dangers of a transatlantic voyage in that era, since it placed at risk the succession of the crown in case of shipwreck. Carlota Joaquina and her daughters were on two other ships. The number of people who embarked with John remains a matter of controversy; in the 19th century there was talk of up to 30 thousand emigrants; more recent estimates vary between five hundred and fifteen thousand, the latter being close to the maximum capacity of the squadron of fifteen ships, including their crews. Still, the ships were overcrowded. According to Pedreira e Costa, taking into account all of the variables, the most likely numbers fall between four and seven thousand passengers plus the crews. Many families were separated, and even high officials failed to secure a place on the ships and were left behind. The voyage was not a tranquil one. Several ships were in precarious condition, and overcrowding created humiliating conditions for the nobility, the majority of whom had to sleep huddled in the open in the poops. Hygienic conditions were bad, including an epidemic of head lice. Many had failed to bring changes of clothing. Several people fell ill. Supplies were scarce, causing rationing. The flotilla spent ten days nearly becalmed in the equatorial zone under a scorching heat that caused moods to turn quite sour. The flotilla also faced two storms and was eventually dispersed near Madeira. In the middle of the voyage, Prince John changed his plans and decided to head for Salvador, Bahia, probably for political reasons. He wanted to please the inhabitants of the colony&#x27;s first capital, which had given many signs of discontent with the loss of its old status. The ships carrying his wife and daughters held to the original destination of Rio de Janeiro.

===Colonial Transformation===

On 22 January 1808, the Prince Regent&#x27;s ship and the two others arrived in Baía de Todos os Santos, Brazil. The streets of Salvador were deserted, because the governor, the Count of Ponte, preferred to await the prince&#x27;s orders before permitting the people to receive him. Finding this attitude odd, John ordered that all could come as they wished. However, to allow the nobility to compose themselves after such an arduous journey, the landing was postponed until the next day, when they were received joyfully amidst a procession, the ringing of bells and a celebration of a &quot;Te Deum&quot; at the Cathedral of Salvador. In the following days, John received all who wished to give homage, granting the ceremony of the &quot;beija-mão&quot; (the kissing of the monarch&#x27;s hand) and conceding various mercies. Among the latter, he decreed the creation of a public lecture series on economics and a school of surgery, but his most decisive action at this moment was the Decree of Opening the Ports to Friendly Nations (&quot;Decreto de Abertura dos Portos às Nações Amigas&quot;), a measure of vast political and economic importance and the first of many that went to improve conditions in the colony. Britain, however, whose economy depended in great part on maritime commerce, and for whom the Portuguese and Brazilian monarchy was now something of a protectorate, was the most direct beneficiary.

Salvador spent a month in commemorations of the presence of the court and tried to seduce the court into making it the new seat of the Kingdom. The residents offered to construct a luxurious palace as a home for the royal family, but John declined and continued his voyage, having already announced to various nations his intention to make his capital at Rio de Janeiro. His ship entered Guanabara Bay on 7 March, where he met his daughters and other members of his entourage whose ships had arrived earlier. On the 8th, the whole court finally disembarked to encounter a city adorned to receive them with nine days of uninterrupted celebrations. A well-known chronicler of the era, Father Perereca, eyewitness to the arrival, while lamenting the news of the invasion of metropolitan Portugal, also intuited the significance of the arrival of the court on Brazilian soil:

John helped change Brazil from an ordinary colony into a booming society. This was done, in large part, to the establishment of a new government in the capital, Rio de Janeiro. With a government, the essential apparatus of a sovereign state became inevitable: the senior civil, religious, and military officials, aristocrats and liberal professionals, skilled artisans, and public servants. For many scholars, the transfer of the court to Rio began the establishment of the modern Brazilian state and constituted Brazil&#x27;s first step toward true independence. While Brazil at this time remained formally and juridically a Portuguese colony, in the words of Caio Prado, Jr. 

But first it was necessary to provide accommodations for the newcomers, a difficult problem to resolve given the cramped proportions of the city of Rio at that time. In particular, there were few homes suitable for the nobility, especially in the case of the royal family, who were installed in the viceregal palace, known today as the Paço Imperial (Imperial Palace). Though large, it was comfortless and nothing like Portuguese palaces. As large as it was, it was not enough to accommodate everyone, so neighboring buildings were also requisitioned, such as the Carmelite Convent, the town hall, and even the jail. To meet the needs of other nobles, and to install new government offices, innumerable small residences were hastily expropriated, their proprietors arbitrarily ejected, at times violently in the face of resistance. Despite the efforts of Viceroy Marcos de Noronha e Brito and of Joaquim José de Azevedo, the regent was still poorly accommodated. Merchant Elias Antônio Lopes offered his country house, the Quinta da Boa Vista, a sumptuous villa in excellent location that immediately met with the prince&#x27;s satisfaction. Renovations and expansion transformed this into the Paço de São Cristóvão (&quot;Palace of Saint Christopher&quot;). Carlota Joaquina, for her part, preferred to settle on a farm near the beach of Botafogo, continuing her habit of living apart from her husband.

The city, which at that time had about 70,000 inhabitants, saw itself transformed overnight. The additional populace, full of new requirements, imposed a new organization in the supply of food and other consumer goods, including luxury items. It took years for the Portuguese to settle in, causing years of chaos in the daily life of Rio; rents doubled, taxes rose, and food was in short supply, requisitioned by the imported nobility. This soon dispelled popular enthusiasm over the prince regent&#x27;s arrival. The very shape of the city began to change, with the construction of innumerable new residences, villas and other buildings, and various improvements to services and infrastructure. Likewise, the presence of the court introduced new standards of etiquette, new fashions and new customs, including a new social stratification.

Among the customs, John continued in Brazil the ancient Portuguese ceremony of the &quot;beija-mão&quot;, which he esteemed greatly and which fascinated the Brazilians and became part of their folklore. He received his subjects daily, except for Sundays and holidays. The long lines waiting to pay their respects and receive favors were a mix of nobles and commoners. According to painter Henry L’Evêque, &quot;the Prince, accompanied by a Secretary of State, a Chamberlain and some household officials, received all the petitions that were presented to him; listened attentively to all the complaints, all the requests of the applicants; consoled one, encouraged others... The vulgarity of the manners, the familiarity of speech, the insistence of some, the prolixity of others, none of this bored him. He seemed to forget that he was their master, and remember only that he was their father.&quot; Oliveira Lim wrote that he &quot;never confused the faces or the pleas, and the applicants marveled at how well he know their lives, their families, even small incidents that had occurred in the past and which they could not believe had risen to the notice of the King.&quot;

Throughout his stay in Brazil, John formalized the creation of a huge number of institutions and public services and boosted the economy, culture and other areas of national life. All these measures were taken principally because of the practical needs of administering a large empire in a territory previously lacking of these resources, because the predominant idea continued to be that Brazil would remain a colony, given that it was expected that the court would return to its old metropolis once the European political situation returned to normal. However, these advances became the basis for Brazil&#x27;s future autonomy. This is not to say that all was amenities and progress. A series of political crises began shortly after the Prince Regent&#x27;s arrival with the invasion of Cayenne in French Guiana in 1809 in retaliation for the French invasion of Portugal, serious economic problems, and an unfavorable trade agreement negotiated in 1810 with the British government, which in practice flooded the small internal market with useless trinkets, disadvantaged exports, and the creation of new national industries. Laurentino Gomes writes that John granted more hereditary titles in his first eight years in Brazil than had been granted in the previous three hundred years of the Portuguese monarchy, not even counting more than five thousand insignia and commendations of the honorific orders of Portugal.

When Napoleon was defeated in 1815, the European powers held the Congress of Vienna to reorganize the political map of the continent. Portugal participated in these negotiations, but given British overtures contrary to the interests of the House of Braganza, Portugal&#x27;s ambassador to the Congress, the Count of Palmela, counseled the regent to remain in Brazil, as did the powerful Prince Talleyrand, in order to strengthen the ties between metropolis and colony, including the suggestion to elevate Brazil to the condition of a kingdom united to Portugal. The British representative to the Congress also ended up supporting the idea, which resulted in the effective foundation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves on 16 December 1815, a juridical institution rapidly recognized by other nations.

==Accession to the throne==
=== Road to rule ===
With the death of his mother on 20 March 1816, John assumed the throne as King Dom John VI. However, he was not immediately consecrated as king; he was acclaimed only on 6 February 1818, with grand festivities. Meanwhile, several political matters came to the fore. John&#x27;s wife, the ambitious Carlota Joaquina, had begun to conspire against Portuguese interests while still in Europe. Shortly after her arrival in Brazil, she established understandings with both Spaniards and with nationalists of the Río de la Plata region (now Argentina and Uruguay) to try to secure a monarchy of her own, perhaps as a regent of Spain, perhaps as queen of a new monarchy created from Spanish colonies in South America, perhaps by deposing her husband. This made any meaningful marriage to John impossible, despite his show of patience, and only the force of convention had them appear together in public. While the Queen gained many sympathizers, her plots uniformly failed. Despite that, she managed to influence her husband to involve himself more directly in Spanish colonial politics. These efforts led to the capture of Montevideo in 1817 and the annexation of Cisplatina Province in 1821.

During the same period, problems arose in finding a wife for John&#x27;s son Dom Pedro, Prince Royal of Portugal (the new title for the heir apparent). Europe at the time considered Brazil distant, backward and unsafe, so it was not a simple task to find suitable candidates. After a year of seeking, the ambassador Pedro José Joaquim Vito de Meneses Coutinho, 6th Marquis of Marialva, finally secured an alliance with one of Europe&#x27;s most powerful royal houses, the Austrian Habsburgs, after seducing the Austrian court with numerous lies, a display of pomp, and the distribution of gold bars and diamonds among the nobility. Dom Pedro married Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, daughter of Emperor Francis I, in 1817. The Emperor and his minister Metternich considered the alliance &quot;an advantageous pact between Europe and the New World,&quot; strengthening the monarchical regime in both hemispheres and granting Austria a new sphere of influence.

Meanwhile, the situation in Portugal was by no means tranquil. With the King absent and the country devastated by the Peninsular War and the consequent mass hunger and enormous exodus of emigrants, Portugal became a &quot;de facto&quot; British protectorate upon the final expulsion of the French. It was administered by William Carr Beresford, who took a high hand in his dealings with the Portuguese government. From the time John ascended the throne, the Portuguese pressed for his return, initiated liberal rebellions, and formed secret societies with the objective of bringing into session the Portuguese Cortes, which had not met since 1698. Similar liberal agitation occurred in Brazil. In 1817, the Pernambucan Revolt broke out in Recife, a republican movement that established a provisional government in Pernambuco and spread into other Brazilian states; it was put down severely. Back in Portugal, the Liberal Revolution of 1820 broke out in Porto on 24 August 1820. A governing junta was set up, with repercussions in Lisbon. It met as the General Extraordinary and Constituent Cortes (&quot;Cortes Gerais Extraordinárias e Constituintes&quot;), formed a government and convened elections for deputies without bothering to consult King John. The movement gained support from the Island of Madeira, the Azores and reached the captaincy of Grão-Pará and Bahia in Brazil. It led even to an uprising by the military garrison of Rio de Janeiro itself.

On 30 January 1821, the Cortes met in Lisbon and decreed the formation of a Council of Regency to exercise power in the name of King John. It freed many political prisoners and demanded the King&#x27;s immediate return. On 20 April, John convoked a meeting in Rio to choose deputies to the Constituent Cortes, but the following day, protests in the plaza were put down violently. In Brazil, the general opinion was that the King&#x27;s return to Portugal could mean loss of the autonomy Brazil had gained and a return to its prior colonial status. Under pressure, John tried to find a middle way by sending his son Prince Pedro to Lisbon to grant a constitution and establish the basis of a new government. The prince, however, already leaning toward liberal ideas, refused. The crisis had gone too far and there was no turning back. John named Pedro regent for Brazil in his name and left for Lisbon on 25 April 1821 after a stay of thirteen years in Brazil, a country he would always miss.

=== Reign ===

The ships bringing John and his court arrived in Lisbon on 3 July. His return was orchestrated in such a manner as not to imply that the King had been coerced, but in fact a new political environment had already been established. A constitution had been drafted, and the King was required to swear loyalty to it on 1 October 1822. It called for him to surrender various prerogatives. The Queen refused to follow her husband in agreeing to this, and thus was dispossessed of her political rights and deposed of her title as queen. Meanwhile, John lost out in Brazil as well. His son Pedro, opting to stay in that country, led a revolt that proclaimed Brazilian independence on 1822-09-07; as part of this action, he assumed the title of emperor of Brazil. Tradition says that before journeying to Portugal, John had anticipated future events and had said to his son: &quot;Pedro, Brazil will soon be separated from Portugal: if so, put the crown on your head before some adventurer grabs it.&quot; According to the memoirs of the Count of Palmela, Brazilian independence had come about through common accord between King John and Prince Pedro. In any event, later correspondence between the two shows the prince&#x27;s concern not to disturb his father. However, Portugal did not officially recognize Brazilian independence at this time.

The liberal constitution to which the King had sworn loyalty was in effect only for a few months. Not everyone in Portugal supported liberalism, and an absolutist movement arose. On 23 February 1823 in Trás-os-Montes, Francisco Silveira, Count of Amarante, proclaimed an absolute monarchy; this did not immediately have an effect, and new agitations followed. The King&#x27;s younger son, Miguel, instigated by his mother Carlota Joaquina, led another revolt known as the Vilafrancada on 27 May, with the intent of restoring absolutism. John changed the game by supporting Miguel to avoid his own deposition (which was desired by Carlota Joaquina&#x27;s party). He appeared in public on his birthday alongside his son, who wore a uniform of the National Guard, a military corps that had been disbanded by the liberals, receiving the applause of the militia. the King personally went to Vila Franca to better administer the uprising, ultimately returning to Lisbon in triumph. The political climate was undecided, and even the staunchest defenders of liberalism feared to take a strong stand on its behalf. Before its dissolution, the Cortes protested against any change in the recently approved constitution, but the absolute regime was restored, the Queen&#x27;s rights re-established, and the King acclaimed for a second time on 5 June. John repressed demonstrations against this restoration, deported some of the liberals and arrested others, ordered the restoration of judiciary and institutions more in line with the new political orientation and created a commission to draft a basis for a new charter to replace the constitution.

John&#x27;s alliance with Infante Miguel did not bear fruit. Influenced as always by his mother, Miguel led the April Revolt or &quot;Abrilada&quot; by the Lisbon military garrison on 29 April 1824. The revolt started on the pretext of crushing the Freemasons and defending the King from threats of death that the Masons has supposedly made against him, but John was taken into custody at the Bemposta Palace, while several of Miguel&#x27;s political enemies were also imprisoned elsewhere. The infante&#x27;s intent was to force his father to abdicate. Alerted to the situation, the diplomatic corps managed to enter Bemposta Palace. Those who held the King could not resist such authorities and restored a measure of freedom to the King. On 9 May, on the advice of friendly ambassadors, John pretended to travel to Caxias but, in fact, went and sought refuge with a British fleet anchored in the port. From aboard the Royal Navy ship &quot;Windsor Castle&quot;, he reprimanded his son, deposed him from command of the army, and ordered him to release his political prisoners. Miguel was exiled. With the defeat of the rebellion, both liberals and absolutists came out into the streets to celebrate the survival of the legitimate government. On 14 May, the King returned to Bemposta, reconstituted the council of ministers and showed generosity to the others who had rebelled. Still, this did not dissuade the Queen from further conspiracies. The police discovered another rebellion planned for 26 October, on the basis of which John placed his wife under house arrest in Queluz Palace.

===Final years===

At the end of his reign, John ordered the creation of a free port in Lisbon, but the measure was not implemented. He ordered further inquiry into the death of his former friend the Marquis of Loulé, but final judgment was never rendered. On 5 June he granted amnesty to those involved in the Porto uprising, except for nine officers who were exiled. On the same day, the old constitution of the Kingdom came back into force, and the Cortes reconvened to prepare a new text. The change of constitution faced several obstacles, mainly from Spain and from supporters of the Queen.

Portugal&#x27;s biggest problems at this time, however, related to the independence of Brazil, which had been the country&#x27;s largest source of wealth. The loss of Brazil had a great negative impact on the Portuguese economy. An expedition to reconquer the former colony was even considered, but the idea was soon abandoned. Difficult negotiations and consultations undertaken in Europe in Rio de Janeiro with British diplomatic mediation resulted in the final recognition of the independence on 29 August 1825. At the same time, John freed all the Brazilians who were prisoners and authorized trade between both nations. It was agreed that Pedro would govern Brazil as Emperor, while John kept for himself the honor of Titular Emperor of Brazil; from this time, he signed official documents as &quot;His Majesty the Emperor and King Dom John VI&quot; (&quot;Sua Majestade o Imperador e Rei Dom João VI&quot;). Brazil was required to pay certain funds that it had borrowed from Portugal. Nothing in the treaty spoke of the succession of the two crowns, but Pedro, still acting as the Prince Royal of Portugal and Algarve, implicitly remained heir to the Portuguese throne.

On 4 March 1826, John returned from the Hieronymites Monastery where he had lunched and retired to Bemposta Palace feeling poorly. He was racked for several days by symptoms including vomiting and convulsions. He appeared to be getting better, but by way of prudence designated his daughter Infanta Isabel Maria as regent. On the night of 9 March, he took a turn for the worse and died at approximately 5 a.m. on 10 March. The infanta immediately assumed the internal government of Portugal, and Pedro was recognized as the legitimate heir as King Dom Pedro IV. Doctors could not definitively determine a cause of death, but it was suspected that John had been poisoned. His body was embalmed and buried in the mausoleum of the Kings of Portugal, the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza, in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora. In the 1990s, a team of investigators exhumed the Chinese ceramic pot that contained his bowels. Fragments of his heart were rehydrated and submitted to an analysis that detected enough arsenic to kill two people, confirming longstanding suspicions of assassination by poison.

==Private life==
As a youth, John was a retiring figure, heavily influenced by the clergy, and lived surrounded by priests and attending daily Mass in the church. Nonetheless, Oliveira Lima affirms that rather than being an expression of personal piety, this merely reflected Portuguese culture at that time, and that the King

John had a great appreciation of sacred music and was a great reader of works about art, but he detested physical activity. He appeared to have suffered periodic crises of depression. An aversion to changes in his routine extended to his clothing: he wore the same coat until it tore, forcing his chamberlains to sew it on his body while he slept in it. He suffered from panic attacks when he heard thunder, staying in his rooms with the windows shut and receiving no one.

John&#x27;s marriage was never a happy one. Rumors circulated that at the age of 25 he fell in love with Eugênia José de Menezes, his wife&#x27;s chaperone. She became pregnant, and John was suspected of being the father. The case was hushed up, and the young woman was sent to Spain to bear the child. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is unknown. The mother lived the rest of her life in nunneries and John supported her financially.

In the precarious and spare environment of Rio, the King&#x27;s personal habits were simple. In contrast to his relative isolation in Portugal, he became more personally dynamic and interested in nature. He moved frequently between the Paço de São Cristóvão and the viceregal palace in the city, staying also at times at Paquetá Island, Governador Island, at Praia Grande (the beach at Niterói), and at the House of Santa Cruz. He went hunting and happily slept in a tent or under a tree. He liked the countryside, despite the swarms of mosquitoes and other pests and the scorching heat of the tropics that were detested by the majority of the Portuguese and other foreigners.

== Legacy ==

In the course of his few years living in Brazil, John ordered the creation of a series of institutions, projects and services that brought the country immense economic, administrative, juridical, scientific, cultural, artistic and other benefits, although not all went successfully, and some were downright dysfunctional or unnecessary, as Hipólito José da Costa mordantly observed. Among these, he was responsible for establishing the Imprensa Régia (the country&#x27;s first publishing house), the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden the Arsenal de Marinha, the Fábrica de Pólvora (gunpowder factory), Rio&#x27;s fire department, Brazil&#x27;s merchant marine, and the charity hospital known as the Casa dos Expostos. He also established various educational programs in Rio, Pernambuco, Bahia and other places, teaching such subjects as dogmatic and moral theology, integral calculus, mechanics, hydrodynamics, chemistry, arithmetic, geometry, French, English, botany and agriculture, among others. He instigated the foundation of various societies and academies for scientific, literary and artistic studies, such as the Junta Vacínica (administering the smallpox vaccine), the Royal Bahiense Society of Men of Letters, the Academic Institute of Sciences and Fine Arts, the Fluminense Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Escola Anatômica, Cirúrgica e Médica do Rio de Janeiro, the Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, the Academia dos Guardas-Marinhas, the Academia Militar, the National Library of Brazil, the Royal Museum (now National Museum of Brazil), the Teatro Real de São João (now Teatro João Caetano), as well as recruiting internationally famous soloists and patronizing other musicians of the Royal Chapel, including Father José Maurício, the leading Brazilian composer of his time, supporting also the coming of the Missão Artística Francesa, which resulted in the establishment of the Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios, predecessor of the present-day Escola Nacional de Belas Artes of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, of fundamental importance the renewal of teaching and art production in Brazil.

John&#x27;s policies led to far-reaching economic changes, beginning with the opening of the ports and the abolition of the Portuguese commercial monopolies, with the United Kingdom being the great beneficiary. On the one hand, traders based in Brazil had to face strong foreign competition; on the other, it encouraged the creation of new manufacturing and other economic activities that were previously banned, poor or nonexistent in Brazil. At the same time, he created such high-level administrative bodies as the War Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry of Marine and Overseas; the Councils of State and of Finance, the Supreme Military Council, the Military Archive, the Bureaus of Justice and of Conscience and Orders, the Casa de Suplicação (Supreme Court), the Intendency General of Police, the first Bank of Brazil the Royal Board of Commerce, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation, and the General Postal Administration, as well as bringing Brazilians into administrative and staff positions, which helped diminish tensions between the natives and the Portuguese. He also encouraged agricultural production, especially cotton, rice and sugar cane, opened roads and encouraged the development of inland waterways, stimulating the movement of people, goods and products between regions.

===Controversies===

According to Pedreira and Costa, few Portuguese monarchs have as large a place in the popular imagination as John VI. That image is very varied, &quot;but rarely for good reason. ... It is not strange that the tribulations of his marriage and family life and the references to his personality and personal customs, would invite easy caricature and circulation of an unflattering, if not comic, tradition.&quot; the King is popularly shown as indolent, silly and clumsy, subjugated by a shrewish wife, a disgusting glutton who always had baked chicken in his coat pockets to eat them at any time with greasy hands, a version typified by the Brazilian film &quot;Carlota Joaquina – Princesa do Brasil&quot; (1995), a parody mixed with sharp social criticism. That work had enormous repercussions, but, according to the critical commentary of Ronaldo Vainfas, &quot;it is a story full of errors of all types, misrepresentations, imprecisions, inventions&quot;; for historian Luiz Carlos Villalta, &quot;it constitutes a broad attack on historical knowledge&quot;, in contrast to director Carla Camurati&#x27;s stated intent &quot;to produce a cinematic narrative that would constitute a type of historical novel with pedagogic function and, at the same time, would offer the viewer knowledge of the past and would help, as a people, to think about the present. It does not offer new historical knowledge to the viewer, even if one were to treat history as a novel: it reinforces, in truth, the ideas that the viewers bring, being zero in terms of increased knowledge... In this way, it leads the viewer more to debauchery than to critical reflection on the history of Brazil&quot;.

Diverse visual representations of John range from an overweight, oversized, sloppy appearance to a dignified and elegant character. As for historians&#x27; portrayals, researcher Ismênia de Lima Martins writes, &quot;If there is agreement among all authors who relied on the testimony of those who knew him closely for his kindness and affability, all the rest is controversy. While some pointed to his countenance of a statesman, others considered him a coward and completely unprepared to govern. In any event, Dom João VI left his indelible mark on Portuguese-Brazilian history, a fact that resonates to the present, through a historiography that insists on judging the King, despite the transformations that discipline experienced over the course of the twentieth century&quot;.

In governing, John always depended on strong auxiliaries. Prominent among these were Rodrigo de Sousa Coutinho, 1st Count of Linhares; António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca; and Tomás Antônio de Vila Nova Portugal. They may be considered the mentors of many of John&#x27;s most important undertakings, but according to John Luccock: &quot;The prince regent has been various times accused of apathy; to me, he seemed to have greater sensitivity and strength of character than was generally attributed to him by both friends and opponents. He was placed in new circumstances by which he was tested, bowing before them with patience; if incited, he acted with vigor and promptness&quot;. He also praised King John&#x27;s character, reaffirming his kindness and attention. Oliveira Lima, with his classic &quot;Dom João VI no Brasil&quot; (1908), was one of the major figures responsible for the beginning of John&#x27;s large-scale rehabilitation. He researched innumerable documents of the era without finding unfavorable descriptions of the King by Brazilians or by ambassadors and other diplomats accredited to the court. On the contrary, he found many accounts that painted him in favorable colors, such as the testimonies left by the British consul Henderson and the U.S. minister Sumter, who &quot;greatly preferred to address himself directly to the monarch, always willing to do justice, than to confer with his ministers... deeming him in this matter much more advanced than his courtiers&quot;. Diplomatic documents also confirm the breadth of his political vision, aiming to give Brazil an importance in the Americas comparable to the United States, adopting a discourse similar the U.S. doctrine of Manifest Destiny. He asserted his authority without violence, more in a persuasive and affable manner; his conduct of international affairs, although sometimes unsuccessful and somewhat given to imperialist ambitions, in many other ways was far-seeing and harmonious, as indicated by the many actions described above that improved the living conditions of the Brazilian colony.

Nonetheless, the French general Jean-Andoche Junot described John as &quot;a weak man, suspicious of everyone and everything, jealous of his authority but incapable of making it respected. He is dominated by the fathers [that is, priests] and can act only under the duress of fear&quot;, and several Brazilian historians such as João Pandiá Calógeras, Tobias Monteiro and Luiz Norton draw him in comparably dark colors. Among the Portuguese, such as Oliveira Martins and Raul Brandão, he was invariably portrayed as a burlesque figure until the conservative resurgence of 1926, when he began to find defenders, such as Fortunato de Almeida, Alfredo Pimenta and Valentim Alexandre. It is also certain that many were disaffected with him, that he raised taxes and aggravated the debt, multiplied titles and hereditary privilege, that he could not allay the vast array of internal dissensions or eliminate entrenched administrative corruption, and that he left Brazil on the brink of bankruptcy when he emptied the treasury to return to Portugal.

Whatever the King&#x27;s character may have been, the importance of his reign for a remarkable spurt of development for Brazil and, indeed, for the very unity of that nation is incontestable. Gilberto Freyre affirms that &quot;Dom John VI was one of the personalities who had the greatest influence over the formation of the nation... he was an ideal mediator... between tradition – which he incarnated – and innovation – which he welcomed and promoted – during that decisive period for the Brazilian future&quot;. As Laurentino Gomes puts it, &quot;no other period of Brazilian history testifies to such profound decisive and rapid changes as the thirteen years in which the Portuguese court lived in Rio de Janeiro&quot;. Scholars such as Oliveira Lima, Maria Odila da Silva Dias, Roderick Barman and the aforementioned Laurentino believe that had John not come to the Americas and installed a strong central government, the large territory of Brazil, with important regional differences, would probably have fragmented into several distinct nations, as occurred with the vast neighboring Spanish colony. This opinion was shared by the British admiral Sir Sidney Smith, who served as commander of the squadron that escorted the Portuguese royal court as they fled to Brazil.

Recent biographies try to separate fact from legend and counter the folklore of ridicule that had formed around King John and which lacks documentary basis. Lúcia Bastos warns that even today we need to be careful to place certain matters in their historical context, such as the question of corruption, noting that although there were enormous costs and clear abuses, at that time there was no clear separation between the public treasury and the monarch&#x27;s private accounts, and in the logic of the Old Regime &quot;the King is the owner of the state... of which the distribution of spoils forms part: the King is the dispenser of justice and spoils&quot;. Before dying on Saint Helena, John&#x27;s most powerful enemy, Napoleon, said of him: &quot;He was the only one who deceived me.&quot; José Joaquim Carneiro de Campos, the Marquis of Caravelas, praised John in the Brazilian Senate on the occasion of the King&#x27;s death, saying, &quot;All of us who are here have many reasons to praise the memory of King John VI, we all ought to be grateful, for the benefits he gave us: he raised Brazil to a kingdom, provided well for all of us, treated us always with great affection, and all Brazilians are obligated to him.&quot;

== Marriage and descendants ==

John married Carlota Joaquina of Spain (25 April 1775 – 7 December 1830) in 1785 and had several children:

When Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil, references to the former united kingdom were finally removed from the royal title; under the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, King John VI became titular Emperor of Brazil and, from 15 November 1825 onwards he adopted the style:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;By the Grace of God, John VI, Emperor of Brazil, King of Portugal and the Algarves, of either side of the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India, etc&quot;.

== Ancestry ==
=== Patrilineal descent ===
John VI&#x27;s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.

Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations, which means that John VI is, ultimately, a member of the Robertian dynasty.

<doc id="153582" wikidata="Q4674476" url="?curid=153582" title="Acomb, North Yorkshire">
<text>Acomb , is a village and suburb within the City of York unitary authority area, in North Yorkshire, England, to the western side of York. It covers the site of the original village of the same name, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is bordered by the suburbs of Holgate, to the east, Clifton, to the north and Woodthorpe to the south. The boundary to the west abuts the fields close to the A1237, York Outer Ring Road.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Acomb was incorporated into the City of York in 1934.

Formerly a farming village, Acomb expanded over the centuries to become a dormitory area for workers in heavy industry, such as rail engineering, in the 19th and 20th centuries and more recently for a more diverse workforce. Though it no longer has any large-scale manufacturing, it does have a diverse retail centre. There are at least 19 Grade II listed buildings within its boundaries. It was made a conservation area in 1975, with the historic area along Front Street and the Green retaining its village character. It is also an Area of Archaeological Importance under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.

Acomb comprises two wards of the City of York: Acomb and Westfield. At the 2011 census of England and Wales, it had a population of 22,215, the largest of all areas of the city. There are six primary schools and one comprehensive school. There are also a variety of sporting clubs and one public sports centre.

Acomb is famous in York for having a very high concentration of street bollards. These were installed in an upgrade in 2023 and have since prompted great controversy among local residents due to their vast numbers and variance from the original proposed plans for the area.

==History==
===Etymology===
Acomb existed before the Norman Conquest, is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; and was the property of the Dean and Chapter of York Minster. It is the largest suburban area in York. The name is most likely derived from the Old English &quot;acum&quot;, meaning &#x27;at the oak trees&#x27;, and indicates that the original village was first established in a heavily wooded area of oaks. In the &quot;Domesday book&quot;, the name of the village is spelt as both &quot;Achum&quot; and &quot;Acum&quot; and during the next one hundred years other spellings can be found, such as &quot;Achu&quot;, &quot;Acun&quot;, &quot;Akum&quot; and &quot;Acham&quot;. In the 13th century, the spellings &quot;Acome&quot;, &quot;Acorn&quot; and &quot;Akome&quot; can be seen, whilst &quot;Akam&quot; and &quot;Acombe&quot; are 15th century. Once printing was established, it enabled the standardisation of spellings to the one seen today. The traditional pronunciation of the name was &quot;Yackam&quot;.

===Roman Era===
The Roman Emperor Septimius Severus was reputed by some historians to have been cremated in a military funeral near the site of modern-day Acomb, having died in York (then Eboracum) in 211 AD.

===10th and 11th century===
During the reign of Edward the Confessor, the village of Acomb was designated as a manor. This was known through the entry in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; for Acomb, which stated that most of the land of Acomb, including the manor, was in the jurisdiction of the archbishop. Land at that time was measured in &quot;carucates&quot;, of which the village measured two carucates. The village of Acomb is mentioned three times in the Domesday Book as follow:
*&quot;In Achum 14½ carucates for geld, and 8 ploughs can be. St. Peter had, and has for 1 manor. 14 rent payers are there now, having 7 ploughs. 6 acres of meadow. Underwood 2 furlongs in length and 2 in breadth. T.R.E. it was worth 30 s.; now the same.&quot;
*&quot;In Acum Ulchel has 2 carucates of land for geld. Land for one plough. He has half a plough there. Wood 9 furlongs. It is worth 4 s.&quot;
*&quot;In Acum the Archbishop 14½ carucates. In the same place the King 2 carucates.&quot;

T.R.E stands for &quot;Tempore Regis Eduardi&quot;, meaning &quot;In the time of King Edward (the Confessor)&quot; and &quot;s&quot; stands for &quot;shillings&quot;. &quot;St Peter&quot; refers to the church in York where the Minster would be built. Underwood and Ulchel are the names of two persons occupying parcels of land in the manor.

===12th to 16th century===
During the 12th century St Stephen&#x27;s Church was built and measured 52 feet by 25 feet. The original structure would last until 1832, when a new and slightly larger building was erected. At the time of the Norman conquest, Acomb manor was forested and was subject to the king&#x27;s laws of the woods. To free themselves of these laws, the inhabitants of Acomb paid 19 pounds and 11 pence to King Richard I and 80 pounds to King John. Shortly after King John&#x27;s reign, the area was deforested. Between 1220 and 1538, the lord of the manor of Acomb was called the &quot;treasurer&quot;, rather than the archbishop. This change meant that Acomb manor and its church were no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the bishop of the diocese. The treasurer was authorised to hold court, grant marriage licences, probate wills and issue letters of administration for persons who were dying. The office of treasurer was dissolved when Edward VI came to the throne. In 1547 the Peculiar Court of Acomb was surrendered by the Church in York to the Crown. King James I granted the court to Thomas Newark Esq. in 1609.

The village was typical Anglo Saxon in the 14th century, being made up of local farms and smallholdings. During the reign of Edward III, the king began to raise money from regional traders to fund military ambition on the continent. Many Yorkshire wool merchants played a large part due to their involvement in the establishment of a near monopoly in English wool trade through the exclusion of foreign imports. Edward III made use of the capital made by establishing loan agreements, to which one &quot;John de Acomb&quot;, a local farmer from the village, made an independent contribution though the venture ultimately failed.

Acomb Grange was the residence of the masters of the medieval hospital of St Leonard, the lands having been given to the Order by Henry II. The Grange was purchased by lease in 1552, after the reformation, by the then MP for York, George Gale. The family eventually bought the freehold during the reign of James I and also continued to own land and buildings in the area until the late 20th century, with Gale Lane being named after them. There are two 15th century timber-framed houses in Acomb.

===17th to 19th century===
From 1623 to 1855, Acomb manor reverted to control by archbishops of the church. An early census in 1670 showed that Acomb manor had 41 households with 230 people, of whom 10 were affluent, 60 middle class and 160 poor. The population of Acomb rose steadily in the early 19th century from 587, in 1801, to 762 some 30 years later. The former railway carriageworks in the neighbouring district of Holgate and around Leeman Road were built around 1854 and many of the workers lived in nearby Acomb and aided in the growth of the village. A portion of the land of Acomb manor was sold to the North Eastern Railway Company to allow right of way for the track. According to the 1871 census, the village of Acomb had less than 1,000 residents. Acomb was part of the district council of Great Ouseburn, until 1894, when it became a district council in its own right. In 1855 the manor as then constituted, including the manor house, was sold to Frances Barlow for £20,500. His heir, Mr. Algernon Barlow, was the last lord, since the lordship of Acomb was ended in 1925. In 1937 Acomb was incorporated into the City of York at which time it was estimated that the population had risen to 7,500 and the 1951 census showed more than double the number, 16,235, now lived in its boundaries.

The York New Waterworks Company, formed in 1846, built their new works at Acomb Landing, just off Boroughbridge Road in neighbouring Holgate. It was to supply the city of York, Acomb and other nearby areas. The site has since expanded, but still serves the area as The York Waterworks Company. Gas did not arrive in Acomb until the amalgamation of the York Gas Light Company and York Union Gas Light Company in 1844. Electricity was first supplied to Acomb in 1913 following the sanctioning of an application to the District Council and the Board of Trade.

===20th century===

In 1920, the Corporation of York purchased Acomb Hall to provide maternity facilities in the city. The Maternity Hospital opened in 1922, but was re-classified for geriatric treatment in 1954, when maternity facilities were opened in Fulford.

On 12 February 1934, the Regent Cinema opened in Acomb, located right on the boundary between Acomb and Holgate. It had 899 seats arranged over stalls and a single balcony. Along with many cinemas in the country, it suffered from falling audiences in the 1950s and eventually closed on 4 April 1959. The last film shown was &quot;Sierra Baron&quot;.

==Governance==

Acomb is part of the City of York Unitary Authority and is represented on the council by two wards, Acomb Ward and Westfield Ward. Acomb Ward returns two Councillors, currently both Labour, and Westfield Ward three councillors, all Liberal Democrat. This represents approximately 6.4% of the total number of City Councillors.

Following the 2023 local elections, the current Councillors for Acomb Ward are Katie Lomas and Jason Rose. The current Councillors for the Westfield Ward are Andrew Waller, Jo Coles and Emily Nelson.

On 1 April 1934 were transferred to York parish, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and the remaining became part of Askham Bryan. In 1931 the parish had a population of 5,580.

==Geography==

In addition to Acomb Green, there are several other open areas in Acomb. Bachelor Hill, the highest point in Acomb at approximately 90 ft above sea level, is situated between Askham Lane and Tennent Road is a sandy based hill with a wide area of grass and a small group of trees at the summit. Fishponds Wood, situated between Danebury Drive and Rosedale Avenue, is a mix of trees and shrubs on the site of an old pond. The largest open space is Acomb Wood.

In 2007, the City of York Council designated Acomb Wood and Meadow as a statutory local nature reserve. This is the larger part of the area known as Acomb Wood. The western portion is located on the other side of Acomb Wood Drive and is managed by the Woodland Trust. The East Wood covers approximately 10 acres and the West Wood about 3 acres. A variety of birds have been seen in the woods, including the great spotted woodpecker, tawny owls, nuthatch, coal tit, long-tailed tit, robin, song thrush, willow warbler and treecreeper. Among the species of trees found here are ash, sycamore and poplar. There are also many species of flora including the uncommon sanicle and common twayblade. The Old Hay Meadow in the East Wood is home to small skipper, common blue and small copper butterflies.

There are two classified roads passing through Acomb. The A59 York to Liverpool road which is named Boroughbridge Road and the B1224 York to Wetherby road which is named Wetherby Road, The Green, York Road and Acomb Road before it joins the aforementioned A59. The centre of Acomb, measured from The Green, lies approximately two and a quarter miles from the centre of York. There are several smaller areas that make up Acomb. In addition to Westfield, there is Low Field, Chapelfields and Carr Hill.

The Conservation Area (York No&#x27;3) encompasses Acomb Green and its surrounding buildings; those buildings along Wetherby Road up to the double roundabout junction that leads to Front Street, but including the Old Hospital; the south side of Front Street that includes the Old Acomb Primary School to the junction of Green Lane; the remainder of Front Street from Green Lane to Gale Lane and includes the buildings that now occupy the site of the old Gale Farm to the east side of Gale Lane. In total the area is approximately 14.5 hectares.

==Economy==

Up to the early years of the 20th century, the main economy of Acomb had been agriculture. Several farms, such as Gale Farm, were located in the village. The increasing population overspill from York saw this decline to the point where all the farms had disappeared by the latter half of the century.

Acomb has a small shopping area located around Front Street, Acomb Road (B1224) and some adjacent roads, with free car parking at the local supermarket. Businesses are a mixture of traditional local food produce retailers, familiar High Street brands, major banking chains and professional services such as accountants, dentists and architects.

There are also a number of public houses, cafes, small restaurants and take-away food outlets in the area, plus a number of small and medium-sized enterprises. In July 2006, the closure of the 80-year-old British Sugar plant near Boroughbridge Road meant the loss of 100 jobs and problems for many local farmers.

Residential homes are a mixture of council estates and private freeholds. Provision was made for small shopping areas of four or five stores to be located in the centre of the estates. Examples can be found on Beckfield Lane, Cornlands Road, Gale Lane and Foxwood Lane. Pubs such as the King William on Barkston Avenue, the White Rose (now demolished) on Cornlands Road and the Beagle on Foxwood Lane can be found near these small estate shops.

==Education==

After the system of Grammar Schools was discontinued in York in 1985, Acomb had three comprehensive schools: Oaklands Secondary School (Acomb Secondary Modern), Lowfields School and Manor Church of England School. In 2007, Oaklands and Lowfield were merged to form York High School with a new building on the Oaklands site in Cornlands Road. In 2009 Manor Church of England School moved out of Acomb from their site on Boroughbridge Road to Millfield Road in the parish of Nether Poppleton. York High School does not have a sixth form and students who wish to take &#x27;A&#x27; levels go mostly to York College. The most recent addition to the school site includes a 56 place nursery, a sports hall and a swimming pool. The school has dedicated a section of its grounds to community allotments which featured on BBC Gardeners&#x27; World in December 2014.

Acomb has four Primary Schools. Carr Junior on Ostman Road was established in 1948 for Infants, with a Junior section added in 1950. Hob Moor Primary on Green Lane was opened in 1954 for Infants, and a Junior section was added a year later. In 2007 Hob Moor Primary School moved into a new school building with Hob Moor Oaks Special School and the two schools federated in 2009. Until 2011, Our Lady&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary was located on Windsor Garth. With its amalgamation with English Martyrs Roman Catholic Primary in September 2011, the school became Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Roman Catholic Primary, based at Hamilton Drive in Holgate. Westfield Primary Community on Askham Lane originally opened as an Infants&#x27; School in 1951 with the Junior section opening a year later. The former Acomb Primary School which has since moved to Holgate was one of the oldest primary schools in North Yorkshire. It had been in its buildings since 1908 and was the second largest primary school in York, with 575 pupils.

==Sports==

Before the establishment of the York Racecourse on the Knavesmire, Acomb Moor was used for staging horse racing. Acomb Moor occupied the land south of Westfield and covered the land where the modern housing estates of Woodthorpe and Acomb Park are located. Acomb also lends its name to &quot;The Acomb Stakes&quot;, a Group 3 seven furlong flat race for two-year-old thoroughbreds, which is run at the Knavesmire every August.

Acomb FC was a founding member of the York Football League in 1897 and then a founding member of the Yorkshire Football League in 1920. Acomb has one football club who play in the York League Division Four. They are Moor Lane, who play their home games at the artificial pitch at York High School on Cornlands Road.

Situated behind The Green is Acomb Sports &amp; Social Club, which is home to Acomb Cricket Club and Acomb Hockey Club. York Acorn Rugby League Club, who play in the National Conference League Premier Division, have their home ground at Thanet Road in Acomb.

York City Council provide swimming facilities at the £6.5 million Energise project, formerly Oaklands Sport Centre on Cornlands Road next to the York High School.

==Religion==
The principal parish church for Acomb is St Stephen&#x27;s Church, a Grade II listed building built in 1831–1832 by G T Andrews on the site of the previous medieval church. Records date from 1662. St Stephen&#x27;s has recently joined with the Church of St Aidan&#x27;s on Ridgeway to become a two church parish. On 19 December 1992, St Stephen&#x27;s was nearly destroyed in a fire caused by arson, but was repaired using contributions from the local community and other funds. It was rededicated in September 1994. St Aidan&#x27;s Church was built in 1968 by the York architects &quot;Ferrey &amp; Mennim&quot;.

The Roman Catholic Our Lady&#x27;s Church, Acomb, on Cornlands Road, was built by the architect J. H. Langtry-Langton and opened in 1955. Before then services in the area had been held, from 1941, in Acomb Council School.

The Quakers first started to meet in Acomb at the Forester&#x27;s Hall around 1906, but moved to their current location in the Primitive Methodist Chapel on The Green after it was purchased by the Religious Society of Friends in 1911.

Sir Robert Newbald Kay gifted buildings and a site for a temporary Methodist Chapel in Lidgett Grove in Acomb in 1934. A permanent building was completed on the site in 1937.

Acomb Methodist Church is on Front Street, and was built in 1964. There is also the Anglican Holy Redeemer Church on Boroughbridge Road, the Baptist Church on Ridgeway and Gateway Church, York (part of the Newfrontiers family of churches) in the Old School on Front Street.

==Notable residents==

The renowned 18th century painter and engraver, Thomas Stothard, spent part of his education in Acomb, staying with his uncle in the village, before moving on to Tadcaster. His uncle left him in the care of a local widow and nurse, named Mrs Stainburn, who supplemented her income by teaching local children. He depicted the widow in his illustration of the poem &quot;Schoolmistress&quot; by William Shenstone.

Sir Charles Burdet, 4th Baronet of Burthwaite, is recorded as living in Acomb in 1777.

The English romantic poet, Charlotte Richardson (née Smith), lived most of her life in Acomb. She was published mostly in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and the subscription paper, &quot;Poems on Different Occasions&quot; writing chiefly about domestic service and religion. Born in York on 5 March 1775, she attended a school for girls preparing for domestic service. After a long illness she died at her Acomb home on 26 September 1825.

Award-winning novelist, Justin Hill, lived in Acomb for much of his childhood. His father, Reg Hill, was headmaster at Our Lady&#x27;s Roman Catholic School, on Windsor Garth, from 1976 to 1995.

<text>Askham Bryan is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of City of York in the north of England, south-west of York, west of Bishopthorpe, and close to Askham Richard and Copmanthorpe. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 582, reducing to 564 at the 2011 census.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Selby District in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

Askham Bryan is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The name comes from &quot;Ascam&quot; or &quot;Ascha&quot; meaning &quot;enclosure of ash tree&quot;. &quot;Bryan&quot; is Bryan FitzAlan. He and his heirs held the manor from the 12th century.

In the village is Askham Hall and nearby is Askham Bryan College of Agriculture. The village became a Conservation Area in 1980.

==History==

The name of the village is derived partly from Bryan FitzAlan, who was granted the lands by the warden of Richmond Castle. Other notable local families to have been titled Lord of the Manor for the village include the Mowbrays, Stapletons, and Greys. The village has sometimes been called East or Great Askham. Harry Croft Esq. was one of the last to be recorded as being Lord of the Manor of Askham Bryan in 1890.

The villages of Askham Bryan and close by Askham Richard were once just one manor around the time of Edward the Confessor and belonged to Edwin, Earl of Mercia. When Edwin&#x27;s lands were confiscated by William the Conqueror, the village was granted to Roger de Mowbray who then passed the manor to his friend, William de Tykhill, a former Warden of Foss Bridge. It eventually came into the hands of Bryan Fitzalan. During the reign of Edward III of England (reigned 1327- 1377), the manor passed from the Grey family via marriage to Sir John Deincourt. The last known hereditary Lord of the Manor of Askham Bryan was Sir John Devede in the reign of Richard III of England (1483–1485).

==Governance==

Askham Bryan lies in the Rural West York Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. It is a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer.

==Demography==

The population of the village has fluctuated from 332 in 1811 to 342 inhabitants in 1848 to about 300 inhabitants in 1890. The population in 2001 stood at 582. In 2011 the population had reduced to 564.

==Geography==

The soil in and around the village is composed chiefly of gravel and clay. The village consists of two main streets, Main Street and Askham Fields Lane, which are surrounded by closes and cul-de-sacs. There is a small duck pond opposite the church which was believed to have been dug as part of a medieval drainage system. Several species of waterbirds, including mallard, moorhen and the Canada goose have been seen on and around the pond. The centre of the village is the oldest part of Askham Bryan but it also includes the 18th century Nag&#x27;s Head pub, the Victorian Doctor&#x27;s House and the old school, which was closed in the 1960s when it merged with St. Mary&#x27;s C. of E. Primary School in Askham Richard. The Village Hall was built in 1836 and is a former Methodist Chapel.

==Economy==

The village is mainly a commuter village for nearby cities, though there is still some agriculture. The nearby Askham Bryan College of Agriculture and Horticulture provides some local employment.

==Transport==

York Pullman buses serve Askham Bryan 2/3 times a day (Monday-Saturday) in each direction as part of route 37 between York and Tadcaster.

==Education==

The old Victorian school is the first building encountered when entering the village from the East. Built in 1856 by a charitable body known as the &quot;Friends and Guardians of the Poor of the Village of Askham Bryan&quot;, it was later adopted by the Church of England. In 1862, the school had 69 children, later dwindling to 12 in 1967. In 1972, after 115 years as a school, the Askham Bryan Church of England school was sold to become a private residence. 

As of 2010, Primary Education is catered for at St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Voluntary Community School in nearby Askham Richard. For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb, though most pupils choose to attend Tadcaster Grammar School in whose catchment area it remains despite the village falling within the City of York boundaries. There is a daily bus service available to the Grammar School.

Nearby is Askham Bryan College of Agriculture and Horticulture. The college was originally known as the Yorkshire Institute of Agriculture, which opened in 1948. It became Askham Bryan College of Agriculture and Horticulture in 1967. It now includes equine management, animal management, land management, business, food production, engineering and bioscience. The college lay on coach transport to many Yorkshire destinations, including Northallerton, for students.

== Sports ==

Askham Bryan Cricket Club fondly called as ABCC, is cricket club based in Askham Bryan, York. The Club have two teams in the York Vale league, first XI in division 1 and the second XI in division 4. Askham Bryan Cricket Club has been competing in one form or another for roughly 100 years.

==Religion==

The parish church of St Nicholas can be found near the centre of the village and dates back to the 11th century and is of an original Norman design though with a working 17th century bell tower. The church is a Grade I listed building and the war memorial in the churchyard is Grade II listed.

<text>Askham Richard is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in the north of England, south-west of York, close to Copmanthorpe, Bilbrough and Askham Bryan. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 351. The village became a Conservation Area in 1975. Nearby is Askham Bryan College of Agriculture.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Selby District in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==History==
The village is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The name comes from &quot;ascam&quot; or &quot;ascha&quot; meaning &quot;enclosure of ash-tree&quot;. It has been also known as &quot;Little&quot; or &quot;West&quot; Askham&quot;. The &quot;Richard&quot; in the village name is reputed to be that of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall.

Before the Conquest the villages of Askham Richard and nearby Askham Bryan were one manor belonging to Edwin, Earl of Mercia. When Edwin&#x27;s lands were confiscated by William the Conqueror, the village was granted to Roger de Mowbray who then passed the Manor to his friend, William de Tykhill, a former Warden of Foss Bridge.

==Governance==
Askham Richard lies in the Rural West York Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. It is a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer.

==Demography==
In 1848, parish records show the population as 232. In 1881, the National Census showed the population as 226. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 273. The 2011 census recorded the population as 351.

==Geography==
The village consists of one main street, where the main village green and duck pond are located, and a couple of small lanes. The soil consists of gravel and clay.

The village is 1.7 miles west of Askham Bryan, 2.3 miles south of Rufforth, 1.5 miles north-east of Bilbrough.

==Economy==
Within the village is Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Askham Grange. Also in the village is the Rose and Crown pub. There are three farms, but the remainder are dwellings. The nearby Askham Bryan College of Agriculture and Horticulture provides some local employment.

==Transport==
York Pullman serves the village 2/3 times a day (Monday-Saturday) in each direction on service 37 which runs between Tadcaster to York.

==Education==
Primary education is catered for at St. Mary Church of England primary school. Nearby is Askham Bryan College of Agriculture and Horticulture. The college was originally known as the Yorkshire Institute of Agriculture, which opened in 1948. It became Askham Bryan College of Agriculture and Horticulture 19 years later. It now includes equine management, animal management, land management, business, food production, engineering and bioscience.

==Religious sites==
St Mary&#x27;s Church is Grade II* listed. There is record of a church here from 1086
but most of the existing building dates from 1887, a simple Victorian design with no tower (it has a bellcote). The rebuilding however retained some fabric of the earlier church, notably the porch doorway (much restored), with two orders of colonettes and zig-zag pattern across the roll moulding. This fits with a late 11th century date for the original church. It is one of a local group of churches with Norman doorways (see Ainsty). At nearby St Nicholas Askham Bryan the door has similar motifs (leaves in the teeth of the zigzags) and may well have been made by the same hands. The doorway to the church, as opposed to the porch, is less grand but also late C11th, and there is an unusually plain west doorway of comparable age.

== Notable people ==

Mary Flora Bell lived and worked here for a while. She also spent some time at the HM Prison Askham Grange.

<doc id="153586" wikidata="Q108442" url="?curid=153586" title="Ferdinand I of Portugal">
<text>Ferdinand I (; 31 October 1345 – 22 October 1383), sometimes called the Handsome () or occasionally the Inconstant (), was the King of Portugal from 1367 until his death in 1383. He was also briefly made King of Galicia, in 1369 (a claim which he would maintain until 1373). Facing a lack of legitimate male heirs, his death led to the 1383–85 crisis, also known as the Portuguese interregnum.

== Life==
Ferdinand was born in Coimbra, the second but eldest surviving son of Peter I and his wife, Constanza Manuel. On the death of Peter of Castile in 1369, Ferdinand, as great-grandson of Sancho IV by his grandmother Beatrice, laid claim to the vacant Castilian throne. The kings of Aragon and Navarre, and later John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who had married Peter of Castile&#x27;s eldest daughter, Constance, also claimed the throne.

The throne was held by his second cousin Henry of Trastámara (Henry II of Castile), Peter of Castile&#x27;s illegitimate brother, who had defeated him in the Castilian Civil War in 1366 and assumed the crown. After one or two indecisive campaigns, all parties were ready to accept the mediation of Pope Gregory XI. The conditions of the treaty, ratified in 1371, included a marriage between Ferdinand and Leonora of Castile. But before the union could take place Ferdinand had become passionately attached to Leonor Telles de Meneses, the wife of one of his own courtiers. Having procured a dissolution of her previous marriage, he lost no time in making Leonor his queen.

This conduct, although it raised a serious insurrection in Portugal, did not at once result in a war with Henry. However, the outward concord was soon disturbed by intrigues with John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, brother of Edward the Black Prince, who entered into a secret treaty with Ferdinand for the expulsion of Henry from his throne. The war which followed was unsuccessful, and peace was again made in 1373, with a treaty that enforced the exile of Ferdinand&#x27;s last Galician supporters.

On the death of Henry in 1379, the Duke of Lancaster once more put forward his claims, and again found an ally in Portugal. In 1381, conflict erupted on the Portuguese-Castilian frontier but the English army, led by Edmund Langley, was ineffectively equipped and financed. So Ferdinand made a peace for himself at Badajoz in 1382. In 1383, the Treaty of Salvaterra stipulated that Beatrice, Ferdinand&#x27;s daughter and heiress, would marry King John I of Castile, and thus secure the ultimate union of the two crowns.

Ferdinand left no male heir when he died, probably from poisoning, at Lisbon on 22 October 1383, and the direct Burgundian line, which had been in possession of the throne since the days of Count Henry (about 1112), became extinct. The stipulations of the Treaty of Salvaterra were set aside, and John, Grand Master of the order of Aviz, Ferdinand&#x27;s illegitimate brother, claimed the throne. This led to a period of war and political indefinition known as the 1383–1385 Crisis. John became the first king of the House of Aviz in 1385.

Ferdinand&#x27;s spectacular ornate tomb can be found on display at the Carmo Archaeological Museum in Lisbon. His body was destroyed during the Invasions of Portugal, when he was still buried in Santarém, and was never recovered.

==Marriage and descendants==
Fernando married Leonor Teles de Meneses, formerly the wife of the nobleman João Lourenço da Cunha, Lord of Pombeiro, and daughter of Martim Afonso Telo de Meneses, by whom he had his only surviving legitimate child, Beatrice. He also had a natural daughter, Isabel, whose mother&#x27;s identity is unknown, though it was rumored that the latter was his own half-sister, Beatrice, Countess of Albuquerque.

<doc id="153587" wikidata="Q4657176" url="?curid=153587" title="Copmanthorpe">
<text>Copmanthorpe () is a village and civil parish in the City of York in the English county of North Yorkshire, south-west of York, west of Bishopthorpe and close to Acaster Malbis, Askham Bryan and Askham Richard. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 4,262, reducing to 4,173 at the 2011 Census.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Selby District in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. The village is part of the York Outer constituency.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Copemantorp&quot;, from Old Norse &quot;Kaupmanna þorp&quot;, meaning &quot;Traders&#x27; Village&quot; or &quot;Craftsmen&#x27;s Village&quot;. The area of Copmanthorpe covering Main Street, Church Street and Low Green became a Conservation Area in 1978.

Copmanthorpe is bounded to the north by the A64, while the East Coast Main Line runs through its south-east periphery; to the west lies open countryside.

==History==

The Roman road from York (Eboracum) to Tadcaster (Calcaria) runs to the north of the village centre, along what are now Top Lane, Hallcroft Lane and Colton Lane.

It is recorded that the Lord of Copmanthorpe Manor was an Anglo-Saxon, named Gospatrick, at the time of the Norman Conquest of England. According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the title was handed to Erneis de Burun in 1084, when he became Sheriff of Yorkshire.

Members of the Vavasour family were resident in the village from the 17th until the 20th century. A &quot;William Vavasour of Copmanthorpe&quot; is recorded in the Battle Abbey Roll. The Vavasour family were the holders of the &quot;Barotnetcy of Haselwood&quot; near Tadcaster from 1628, which included estates in Killingthorpe, Spalington and Copmanthorpe. Sir William Vavasour was the first and only Baronet of Copmanthorpe in 1643 until his death in 1659 and was the son of the Knight Marshall, Sir Thomas Vavasour. In 1672 the manor was sold to the Wood family. 

Copmanthorpe was the site of a preceptory of the Knights Templar, on land given to the Templar Knights by the Malbis family (see Acaster Malbis). A Preceptor, Robert de Reygate, of the Temple is recorded as early as 1291.

During the First World War, there was a Royal Flying Corps airfield near to Drome Road. The 57 (Cheltenham) Squadron was formed here in June 1916. In 1919, one of the huts from the aerodrome was bought by Yearsley Bridge Hospital (a fever hospital), in the north of York, to provide additional nurses&#x27; accommodation.

A railway accident occurred on 25 September 2006, when the 14:25 Plymouth to Edinburgh Virgin Cross Country service collided with a car that had veered off Moor Lane and onto the tracks, killing the car driver and causing the front carriage of the Voyager train set to derail. The accident happened at approximately 21:01 BST. The train involved was already running late on its journey towards York.

==Governance==

Originally, the village was part of the Rural West Ward of the Unitary Authority of the City of York. As of 2015 it is a one councillor ward. It is currently represented on the City Council by Councillor Chris Steward who gained the councillorship from independent councillor and former Conservative Party colleague David Carr, who was the leader of the City Council from May 2016 to January 2018.

Copmanthorpe Parish Council consists of 10 Parish Councillors. It manages the village&#x27;s burial ground and allotments and is represented on the Recreation Centre committee, the Youth Club committee and the Drainage Board.  It runs the annual Coronation Cup Gardening Competition and the Chapman Andrews Annual Photographic Competition and works closely with the local Police Team on law enforcement matters.

==Geography==

Copmanthorpe lies 4 miles south-west of York city centre. The village lies on glacial moraine of sandstone overlain with boulder clay. The highest point of the village is on Top Lane at 81 feet above sea level. The village has two greens, Low Green and the smaller Memorial Green.

==Demography==

The population of the village has almost trebled over the past hundred years since the first census in 1881, rising from 311 in 1881 to 1,027 in 1961. In the 2001 census the village parish notes the population as 4,262. The largest Age Group within the population, 30.5% between 45 and 64 years old with 26.1% were between 30 and 44 years old. Of the population aged between 16 and 74 years old, 69.3% declared they were in some form of employment and 25.3% said they were retired. Of the 1,699 households, 35% were Semi-Detached or terraced and 64.3% were Detached. The level of household ownership was 91%.

==Economy==
Originally the village was a place for tradesmen and farming, but currently Copmanthorpe is a functional commuter village, with two churches, a post office, a library, two coffee shops, two hair dresser&#x27;s, a barber&#x27;s, a pharmacy, two convenience stores, one pub and several takeaways.

==Culture and community==

Copmanthorpe Recreation Centre (&quot;the Rec&quot;) provides most of the sporting and many of the social facilities in the village. It is a registered charity for the benefit of the whole village. There is also a children&#x27;s play area with a variety of equipment on a safety surface. Allotments, with fifty four plots, can be found on Temple Lane and are run by Copmanthorpe Parish Council.

The Royal Oak is the village&#x27;s remaining public house. Census returns show that the Inn was, at one time, also a blacksmith&#x27;s shop and a brewhouse. It was first listed as a pub in 1830.

There are numerous village functions throughout the year, including the Carnival in summer and the Fayre in spring. The local branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute was formed in 1924 and moved into a purpose built hall in 1928. Other clubs and societies include a Mothers&#x27; Union, drama group, youth club and both Scouts and Girl Guide troops.

In 2014 the first charity beer festival, &#x27;Coptoberfest&#x27;, was held at St Giles Church in Copmanthorpe. In 2023 Coptoberfest raised over £7,000. To date, the event has raised over £25,000 which has been given away to local charities, good causes and organisations such as Scouts, Guides and sports clubs.

1st Copmanthorpe Scouts was formed in 1968. As of 2023, the Scouts have groups of Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers.

==Transport==

The village is bypassed by the A64 Leeds to Scarborough road. This road used to pass through the village along the route of the old Roman road along Hallcroft Lane and Top Lane. The bypass was built in 1975–76 with the grade separated junction linking Manor Heath to Askham Fields Lane and the A1237 York Outer Ring Road being built in 1987. The traffic lights at the end of Top Lane that used to provide access to the bypass for village residents were removed in 2002.

There was a railway station in the village that opened in 1839 on the York &amp; North Midland line. The station was closed to passengers in 1959 and closed altogether in 1964. Plans have been put forward to reopen the station along with others in the area surrounding York, but these have failed to materialise.

The village is served by one regular local bus service from York, run by Connexions, Yorkshire Coastliner service, and by a service run by Harrogate Coach Travel as part of the York to Colton route.

==Education==

The original village school opened in 1869 on the site now occupied by the health centre. The current junior school, opened in 1968, was designed to take over from the Victorian building, but as the population grew an infants school was also built alongside in 1972.

Primary education is currently catered for at Copmanthorpe Primary School with students usually going to Tadcaster Grammar School, a co-educational comprehensive school, for their secondary and further education.

==Religion==

The Grade II listed St Giles&#x27; Church on Church Street was built in 1180 and much remains of the original Norman design. St Giles did not become a parish church in its own right until 1866, as Copmanthorpe was previously part of the parish of St Mary Bishophill Junior in York. The parish was detached from St Mary Bishophill in 1844 and for a time linked to the parish at Askham Richard.

Church Street was also the site of the first Methodist Chapel in the village, around 1788. The modern chapel was built in 1958 in Main Street by the architects Greenwood and Nicholls.

==Sports==

There is a dedicated sports area at the Recreation Ground which is the home of Copmanthorpe Football Club and Copmanthorpe Cricket Club. Copmanthorpe Tennis Club and Copmanthorpe Bowling Club are also based here.

The football club was founded in 1962 and, as of 2023, the 1st XI play in the York Minster Engineering Football League Division Three and the reserves in the Reserve B Division. The club also has a Senior Disability (Pan-Disability) team, Veteran&#x27;s team and representation at Junior 11 aside, 9 aside, 7 aside and 5 aside.

The cricket club, which has attained ECB Clubmark status, has around 90 members across all age groups.

As of 2023, the club&#x27;s 1st XI play in Division 3 of the Yorkshire Premier League North, Galtres, and the 2nd XI play in Division 4 of the same league.

Copmanthorpe Tennis Club is registered with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).

<doc id="153588" wikidata="Q2227450" url="?curid=153588" title="Elvington, North Yorkshire">
<text>Elvington is a village and civil parish in the City of York, lying approximately south-east of York, England, on the B1228 York-Howden road. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 1,212, it increased to 1,239 at the 2011 Census. The River Derwent forms part of the parish boundary and the historic Sutton Bridge connects Elvington with Sutton upon Derwent. The village has three separate large industrial estates including a site for Yara International, a Norwegian chemical company.

Elvington was historically in the East Riding of Yorkshire. However, it became part of the Selby District of the shire county of North Yorkshire between 1974 and 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==History==

The village is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, which states that in 1086 Ulfketill had six carucates of land taxable, where three ploughs were possible. There is a mention of the church, which is Norman in origin and exists in part today.

Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, was in control of the manor until his death. In the village there is the Grade II* listed Elvington Hall. Built during Elizabethan times, it was remodelled in the 18th century by John Carr; writer Laurence Sterne lived there for a period of his childhood; 
Roger Jacques and Simone Sterne, his grandparents, controlled the manor before 1700.

===1900s onwards===
Between 1913 and 1926 Elvington was served by a passenger service on the Derwent Valley Light Railway. The line was open for freight traffic until 1973.

During 1942, the airfield RAF Elvington was built; it was used in the Second World War. The airfield was vacated in 1958 and by May 1986 parts of it were turned into the Yorkshire Air Museum, open to the general public. The airfield had the status of a relief landing ground until September 1992. It is now used for motorsports and an airshow.

The village was once the home of the author and screenwriter, Hugo Charteris, who died of cancer in 1970 at his home in the village.

===Today===

Elvington was made a Conservation Area in 1990.

The &quot;Grey Horse Inn&quot; is a public house in the centre of the village. The village also has a church, shop, primary school, and sports field. A number of organised clubs and societies operate in the village, including drama, Scouts, various sewing groups, a youth group, a toddler group and playgroup.

Elvington has one of the most unusual homes in Britain. In 2006, a derelict bowling alley was converted into a private home whilst still incorporating a bowling lane. The original bowling alley was built in the 1950s for US troops stationed at RAF Elvington and it was a regular meeting place for members of Strategic Air Command.

Elvington is also home to the turf growers Rolawn who are one of Europe&#x27;s largest companies of its kind.

==The Murder of Chen Cai Guan==
In January 2009, Chinese national Chen Cai Guan was tortured and beaten to death in a warehouse on the Elvington Industrial Estate. The two men responsible for the murder, Huang Bao Lung, and Zhang Zhouli both admitted links to the 14K Triads, a Hong Kong based criminal gang. Huang and Zhang rented the warehouse as part of a nationwide cannabis factory operation, using a food storage business as a front.

In March 2009, the body of Mr Chen was found by fishermen at a canal in the village of Burn, just south of Selby. When the North Yorkshire Police raided the facility shortly after the murder took place, they seized 1,500 cannabis plants and arrested the suspects, also finding traces of the victim&#x27;s blood that they had failed to cover up.

In July, both Huang, from Fujian in China, and Zhang, from Dong Bei, were handed life sentences with minimum terms of 18 years and 16 years respectively after being convicted of Mr Chen&#x27;s murder.

==Elvington Harriers Football==
Founded in 1999, Elvington Harriers Football Club is an FA Charter Standard Club.
The football club has age group teams from the &#x27;Saturday Morning Club&#x27; and Under-7&#x27;s through to Under-15&#x27;s. Each age group team plays in the club&#x27;s traditional yellow shirts and blue shorts in the Selby District League. The home games for each age-group are played in Elvington at the Lower Derwent Sports &amp; Social Club. The club is financed through player subscriptions and fund-raising activities.

==Airfield==
The Yorkshire Air Museum is based at Elvington Airfield, a former Second World War bomber station. The main runway was expanded in the Cold War era to become one of the longest in Europe, which enabled it to accept large American bombers such as the B52. The Yorkshire Airshow, the largest in the North of England, was held here annually (now bi-annually) during August.

The airfield has a race track, which is used for drag racing and other motorsport events. In November 1966, Italian motor scooter rider Alberto Ancillotti on his Lambretta bike established the 106 mph terminal speed record at this venue.
In the 1970s the airfield was the outdoor location for a series of &quot;Oh No, It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt!&quot;, a situation comedy on British television.

=== Top Gear &quot;Vampire&quot; dragster crash ===
During filming of a &quot;Top Gear&quot; segment filmed at the airbase on 20 September 2006, Richard Hammond was injured in the crash of the jet-powered car he was piloting. He was travelling at at the time of the crash.

<text>William Juxon (1582 – 4 June 1663) was an English churchman, Bishop of London from 1633 to 1646 and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1660 until his death.

==Life==

===Education===
Juxon was the son of Richard Juxon and was born probably in Chichester, and was educated at the local grammar school, The Prebendal School. He then went on to Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London, and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he was elected to a scholarship in 1598.

===Ecclesiastical offices===
Juxon studied law at Oxford, but afterwards took holy orders, and in 1609 became vicar of St Giles&#x27; Church, Oxford, where he stayed until he became rector of Somerton, Oxfordshire in 1615. In December 1621, he succeeded his friend, William Laud, as President (i.e. head) of St John&#x27;s College, and in 1626 and 1627 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Juxon soon obtained other important positions, including that in 1632 of Clerk of the Closet to King Charles I.

In 1627, he was made Dean of Worcester and in 1632 he was nominated to the See of Hereford and resigned the presidency of St John&#x27;s in January 1633. Though he legally became Bishop of Hereford by the confirmation of his election in late July 1633, he never took up duties at Hereford, as in October 1633 he was consecrated Bishop of London in succession to Laud.

===Secular offices===
In March 1636 Charles I entrusted Juxon with important secular duties by making him Lord High Treasurer of England as well as First Lord of the Admiralty; for the next five years he had to deal with many financial and other difficulties. He resigned the treasurership in May 1641. During the Civil War, the bishop, against whom no charges were brought in parliament, lived undisturbed at Fulham Palace. His advice was often sought by the king, who had a very high opinion of him. The king selected Juxon to be with him on the scaffold and to offer him the last rites before his execution.

===Retirement and archbishopric===
Juxon was deprived of the See of London by Parliament on 9 October 1646, and episcopacy was abolished for the duration of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate. He retired to Little Compton in Gloucestershire (now in Warwickshire), where he had bought an estate, and became famous as the owner of a pack of hounds. At the restoration of Charles II, letters missive were issued (on 2 September 1660) naming Juxon (restored Bishop of London) Archbishop of Canterbury.

The &quot;congé d&#x27;élire&quot; was issued the next day and the chapter of Canterbury duly elected him on 13 September. The king&#x27;s assent to the election was given on 15 September and the confirmation of Juxon&#x27;s election (the legal ceremony by which he took office) was held in the Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey on 20 September 1660. He received the temporalities on 22 September and was enthroned at Canterbury on 25 September. Juxon, as Archbishop of Canterbury, then took part in the new king&#x27;s coronation, but his health soon began to fail and he died at Lambeth in 1663. By his will the archbishop was a benefactor to St John&#x27;s College, where he was buried; he also aided the work of restoring St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and rebuilt the great hall at Lambeth Palace.

==Memorials==
Juxon House, which stands north-west of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral at the top of Ludgate Hill in London and forms part of the Paternoster Square development, is named after him. Juxon Street on land at Walton Manor formerly owned by St John&#x27;s College in the inner-city suburb of Jericho, Oxford, is also named after him as is another Juxon Street at Lambeth Walk, close to Juxon&#x27;s former residence at Lambeth Palace.

<doc id="153590" wikidata="Q2244488" url="?curid=153590" title="Haxby">
<text>Haxby is a town and civil parish in the City of York district of North Yorkshire, England. According to the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 8,754, which reduced to 8,428 at the 2011 Census.

Open farmland extends to the north as far as the villages of Sutton-on-the-Forest and Strensall. The River Foss and Earswick is to the east. It is outside of the York Outer Ring Road (A1237) and near the New Earswick and Huntington areas of York, to the south. It shares a continuous built-up area with the village and parish of Wigginton to the west.

Its name is of Old Norse origin with the personal name of &quot;Hákr&quot;″s settlement, in Old Norse &quot;bý&quot;. It was recorded as &quot;Haxebi&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. Haxby Town Centre, known as &quot;The Village&quot;, has been a Conservation Area since 1976. The town&#x27;s charter was granted in 1992. 

The Yorkshire village of Haxby was administered by the North Riding County Council and Flaxton Rural District Council until 1974. From 1974 to 1996, Haxby became part of North Yorkshire County Council and Ryedale District Council. Since 1996 the town of Haxby has been part of the City of York, a unitary authority.

==History==

A settlement on the site of the modern town named by the Vikings as Haxebi was established around the 9th century. The Norse word &quot;BY&quot; meant a township or farm and was usually appended to the name of the holder of the lands, in this case a man called Hakr. A Grade III listed Viking cross base in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, and the discovery of a Viking cross shaft in a nearby garden in 1978 support this date. There is evidence of Roman occupation with the 1966 discovery of a site of a Roman villa on Haxby Moor. Roman pottery was found in 2003 on Station Road along with a silver Roman signet ring.

In the Middle Ages, because the village was in the royal Forest of Galtres, its inhabitants were subject to forest law and took part in the occasional courts that devised and enforced it. Charles I divested himself of the forest in 1629 and the village acquired the land to increase its size, resulting in the parish of some of today. Haxby was not a separate parish. Initially it was divided between the parishes of Strensall and Driffield. Once St Mary&#x27;s Church, Haxby was built in the 16th century it became a chapelry to the parish of Strensall and in 1862 became a parish in its own right.

Much of the current town centre is 18th and early 19th century architecture but significant redevelopment took place in Victorian times of which the Memorial Hall (formerly the Board School), now housing a local community radio station Vale Radio, the present St Mary&#x27;s Church and the Methodist Chapel are all important buildings. It was at this time, with the arrival of the railway in Haxby, that the village became a popular place to live and commute from. Growth continued gradually throughout the first half of the 20th century until the population explosion in the 1970s quadrupled the population. In 1976, the local authority took the very important step of designating the centre of Haxby as a conservation area. 

By 1992, Haxby had outgrown its image of a rural village and was declared a town, by which time its population had grown to be over 10,000. In 1996, a national revision of boundaries moved Haxby from Ryedale District Council to be part of City of York Unitary Authority and this new authority adopted the boundaries and conditions of the conservation area.

==Governance==
 Haxby Town Council 

Haxby has a Town Council, which is represented by (up to) 14 Councillors from four Wards (North, East, Central, and South West) which align with the four polling districts. The Town Council office is located at Haxby Memorial Hall, and Town Council meetings are traditionally held there; though since 2021 a number of meetings now take place at the Oaken Grove Community Centre.

The Town Council is responsible for maintenance of the Village Green along both sides of The Village, including Wyre Pond (Haxby Duck Pond), maintaining Ethel Ward Memorial Playing Fields and Mancroft Recreational Open Space (including the Ethel Ward Pavilion and children&#x27;s play areas/equipment), and community assets such as bus shelters, benches, and noticeboards.

The Town Council also administers the Allotment gardens on Station Road, and is jointly responsible for Haxby and Wigginton Cemetery (along with Wigginton Parish Council). Haxby Town Council also organises the annual Haxby Carnival.

 Haxby and Wigginton Ward Committee (City of York Council) 

The town lies within the Haxby and Wigginton Ward of the City of York Council (a Unitary Authority). Haxby and Wigginton Ward is represented by three City of York Council Members, and these three Members constitute the local Ward Committee; which has a small budget for local highways improvements and grants for local organisations. Elections to the City Council are held every four years. As of the last election in May 2023 Haxby and Wigginton Ward was represented by Councillors Ian Cuthbertson, Andrew Hollyer and Edward Pearson, though Edward Pearson stood down in 2024 and was replaced after a by-election by Richard Watson, all of whom are members of the Liberal Democrat Party.

City of York Council is responsible for a number of statutory local services, including adult social care, children and education, waste services (such as household waste and recycling bin collections), transport and highways (such as local roads and adopted footpaths), library services etc.

 York Outer Member of Parliament 

Haxby was in the Vale of York parliamentary constituency until the 2010 general election when it was transferred to the newly created constituency of York Outer. In that election the Conservative Party candidate, Julian Sturdy, was elected with 43% of the vote and a majority of 3,688 over the Liberal Democrat candidate. Sturdy has retained the seat in subsequent elections in 2015, 2017, and 2019.

 Elections 

Elections for the three City Council seats and fourteen Town Council seats are held every four years with the last elections having been held in May 2023 and the next elections due in May 2027. There are four polling districts in Haxby and polling stations are located at the Memorial Hall, the Scout Hut, and St Margaret Clitherow&#x27;s Church.

Contested elections were held in May 2023 for both Central and South West Wards of Haxby Town Council. Town Councillors in the North and East Wards of Haxby Town Council were elected unopposed due to there being fewer candidates than seats. Historically, Haxby Town Councillors have been elected unopposed or co-opted due to there being an equal or lower number of candidates to seats. However, a casual vacancy to Haxby North Ward arose on the Town Council in late 2021 due to a resignation; and a contested by-election was held in November 2021.

==Demography==

The 1881 Census records the population as 559. According to the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 8,754, which reduced to 8,428 at the 2011 Census.

Haxby and Wigginton Ward Demographics

City of York Council produce regular Ward Profile documents providing statistical population and demographic data for the local area. According to the 2021–22 Q2 Haxby and Wigginton Ward Profile:

* Haxby and Wigginton had 11,769 residents with 1.8% from a black and minority ethnic community group.
* 82.3% of Haxby and Wigginton residents are in good health, with 17.8% stating that they have some limitation in day-to-day activities.
* £664.62 was the Average Net Weekly Household Income in 2017–18 in Haxby and Wigginton.
* 88% of residents in Haxby and Wigginton own their own home, either outright or with a mortgage, 6% are private renters and 5% are social tenants. There are no Council Houses in Haxby and Wigginton ward.
* 71.3% of Haxby and Wigginton residents have a Level 1 – 4 qualification, but 19.5% have no qualifications at all.

* 1.2% of the working population (aged 16–64) in Haxby and Wigginton claim out of work benefits (either Job Seekers Allowance or Universal Credit)

==Geography==

The town sits on flat ground consisting mostly of clay with soil that is sand and alluvium, near the old Forest of Galtres. To the north is a small tributary of the River Foss called Goland Dike, and to the east is the River Foss which flows southward. The nearby village of Wigginton now merges with Haxby though the old Parish Boundary map still shows the dividing line. This runs east to west along the back of the houses on Wheatfield Lane on its southern edge as far as Barley View. Here it turns northward cutting across Greenshaw Drive until it reaches the road known The Village. The boundary follows this road until it turns west. The boundary at this point continues northward cutting across Windsor Drive near Ripley Grove and then out into the countryside.

==Transport==

In December 2023 a consultation was announced by City of York Council on a proposed bus network review, which included changes to the number 1, 13, and 14 services, including a reduction of services and frequencies to Station Road, Towthorpe Road and West Nooks. These changes were approved in February 2024, but the exact impacts are not yet known.

Rail Services

Between 1845 and 1930, Haxby was served by Haxby railway station on the York to Scarborough line. Various attempts have been made to reopen a new station over the years, including concerted efforts in the 1980s, late 1990s, early 2000s and in 2011.

In 2020, the City of York Council spent circa £50 thousand to put together a business case and bid for the Government&#x27;s New Stations Fund (Round 3), which received cross-party support and the full backing of the rail industry and transport campaigners. An online consultation and survey was conducted during the Covid pandemic first lockdown to include local residents views within the bid. The bid was successful and City of York Council was awarded a further £400 thousand by the Department for Transport to work with Network Rail to progress the new station proposals to detailed design stage and undertake the necessary operational feasibility studies. The station could open as soon as 2024.

Since the 2020 funding award, in late September 2021, City of York Council agreed to purchase some land at a cost of circa £300 thousand adjacent to the railway in Haxby which could be used as a site for the new station, with two potential station sites identified and aspirations for a half-hourly train service. In 2023 a further £1.1 million was awarded by the DfT to progress detailed designs for the station with Network Rail, including the station car park and access arrangements, as well as tests and surveys at Towthorpe Road site to ensure adequate foundations and drainage provision. In September 2023, Network Rail Carried out a number of on-site surveys to assess the ground conditions.

In October 2023, following the cancellation of HS2 phase 2, Haxby station was re-announced by the Department for Transport the as part of the ‘Network North’ transport improvement projects. Planning permission for the station was submitted in early 2024, with construction proposed in 2025, and opening in 2026. Funding for the &#x27;Network North&#x27; scheme was withdrawn in July 2024.

<text>Heslington is a suburban village and civil parish within the City of York district, in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England, south-east of the centre of York. Before 1974, it was a village in the Derwent Rural District, which was part of the East Riding of Yorkshire. From 1974 to 1996 it was part of the Selby district before becoming part of the new City of York unitary authority area.

The University of York&#x27;s Campus West, including Heslington Hall, are located in Heslington.

==History==
Heslington was likely an Anglian settlement and is mentioned in the Domesday Book.

Heslington Hall was built between 1565 and 1568 for Sir Thomas Eynns. In the 20th century it was owned by Richard de Yarburgh-Bateson, 6th Baron Deramore, and was used as the headquarters for the Royal Air Force&#x27;s No. 4 (Bomber) Group from 1940–45. It is now the administrative headquarters for the University of York.

Heslington became a Conservation Area in 1969.

===Heslington hoard===
The hoard of 2,800 Roman coins, known as the Heslington Hoard, was found on 1 March 1966 during excavations in advance of the construction of &#x27;College 3&#x27; on the west campus of the University of York.

==Amenities==
According to the 2011 census the ward had a population of 4,792. The parish also includes the Badger Hill area. Lord Deramore&#x27;s Primary School serves the residents of the Heslington, the nearby Badger Hill estate, and the families of the scholars of the University of York.

Heslington Church is a Grade II listed building and is a local ecumenical partnership between the Church of England and the Methodist Church.

Heslington Main Street has a post office, a bakery and two pubs; The Deramore Arms and The Charles XII.

The University of York&#x27;s Campus West is situated in Heslington. A further campus, Campus East, is located to the east of the village. Construction began in 2007 to some controversy from village residents concerned about traffic and Heslington&#x27;s small village status. The planning application went to public enquiry and the project was approved by the Department of Communities and Local Government in May 2007. The new campus opened in October 2009.

==Cricket==
After 92 years of existence, Heslington Cricket Club folded in 2003 amid a certain amount of turmoil. This was not the end of cricket in the village however, as 2003 was also the year that York Civil Service Cricket Club lost their ground at Boroughbridge Road, York and were offered the opportunity to play at Heslington from the 2004 season. They have now rebranded as Heslington Cricket Club. Heslington Cricket Club has since grown considerably, now fielding four Seniors teams as well as Juniors teams from Under 9s to Under 15s.

<text>Gilbert Sheldon (19 June 1598 – 9 November 1677) was an English religious leader who served as the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1663 until his death.

==Early life==
Sheldon was born in Stanton, Staffordshire in the parish of Ellastone, on 19 June 1598, the youngest son of Roger Sheldon; his father worked for Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford; he matriculated at Oxford on 1 July 1614, graduated BA from Trinity College on 27 November 1617, and MA(Oxon) on 28 June 1620. In 1619, he was incorporated at Cambridge. In 1622 he was elected fellow of All Souls&#x27; College, where he took the degrees of BD on 11 November 1628 and DD on 25 June 1634. In 1622, he was ordained, and shortly afterwards he became domestic chaplain to Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry.

In March 1636 he was elected warden of All Souls&#x27; on the death of Richard Astley. He had already made the acquaintance of William Laud, and corresponded with him on college business, university politics, and on the conversion of William Chillingworth from Roman Catholicism. Sheldon was not initially a Laudian, and he resisted (unsuccessfully) Laud&#x27;s appointment of Jeremy Taylor to a fellowship at All Souls&#x27;. In 1634 and 1640 he was pro-vice-chancellor. In 1638 he was on the commission of visitation for Merton College; the visit produced a report requiring reforms.

During the years 1632–1639 he received the livings of Hackney (1633); Oddington, Oxfordshire; Ickford, Buckinghamshire (1636); and Newington, Oxfordshire; besides being a prebendary of Gloucester from 1632. Sheldon gravitated towards the Great Tew circle of Lucius Cary (Falkland), and was on friendly terms with Edward Hyde; he had no Puritan sympathies. He became a royal chaplain through Coventry, and the king intended preferment for him, plans interrupted by the political crises.

==Civil War period==
He was intimate with the Royalist leaders, and participated in the negotiations for the Uxbridge treaty of 1645. During this period he became with Henry Hammond one of the churchmen closest to the king, and attended him as Clerk of the Closet in Oxford, later in Newmarket, Suffolk and finally in the Isle of Wight. When the parliamentarians occupied Oxford in 1646 he resisted the visitation, but was finally and physically ejected from All Souls in early 1648. Taken into custody, he was to have been imprisoned in Wallingford Castle with Hammond but the commander was unwilling to have them. He was freed, with restrictions on his movements, later that year.

He lived quietly for a dozen years in the Midlands, at Snelston in Derbyshire or with friends in Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire and Glamorgan, where he stayed with Sir John Aubrey. He was active in fundraising for the poor clergy and for Charles II in exile. He corresponded with Jeremy Taylor, whom he supported, and with Hyde. On the death of John Palmer, whom the visitors had made warden of All Souls&#x27; in his place, on 4 March 1659, he was quietly reinstated.

==Bishop of London==
On 21 September 1660, Sheldon was nominated Bishop of London; he was elected on 9 October and his election was confirmed on 23 October. On 28 October, he was consecrated in the Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey; he had been made Dean of the Chapel Royal not long before and became Master of the Savoy not long after. Since William Juxon was now Archbishop of Canterbury, but was aged and infirm, Sheldon in practical terms exercised many of the powers of the archbishopric in the period to 1663, and he was on the privy council. He was commissioned to consecrate the new Scottish bishops.

The Savoy Conference of 1661 was held at his lodgings. He hardly participated but was understood to be pulling strings in terms of the outcome. In his formulation, Puritan objections should be set out and considered; the point of the Conference was liturgical, to look into reform of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The subsequent Uniformity Act 1662 was very much in line with Sheldon&#x27;s thinking. The Act was a sequel to Sheldon&#x27;s successful orchestration of opposition to Charles II&#x27;s intended Declaration of Indulgence, earlier in 1662.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
He was translated to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1663: the &quot;congé d&#x27;élire&quot; was issued on 14 July, Sheldon was elected on 11 August, royal assent was given on 20 August and his election was confirmed (in a legal ceremony by which he officially took his new post) on 31 August at Lambeth Palace; he was enthroned by proxy and vested with the temporalities on 7 September. He was greatly interested in the welfare of the University of Oxford, of which he became Chancellor in 1667, succeeding Lord Clarendon, as Hyde now was. The Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford was built and endowed at his expense. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1665.

He accepted much purely secular work, acting as arbiter on petitions presented through him, and taking up investigations passed on by the king, especially in connection with the navy. Sheldon lost political influence after the fall of Clarendon in 1667, and by making Charles&#x27;s philandering a matter of religious reproach. He was vocal against the Royal Declaration of Indulgence of 1672. He is depicted in a window in Gray&#x27;s Inn Chapel.

Sheldon is mentioned in Pepys&#x27; Diary who relates a story from his &quot;Cozen Roger&quot; that &quot;...the Archbishop of Canterbury that now is, do keep a wench, and that he is a very wencher as can be and tells us that is publicly known that Sir Charles Sedley had got away one of the Archbishop&#x27;s wenches from him...&quot; Such stories, spread by his enemies, were common. There is in fact no credible evidence that Sheldon led an immoral life, though Samuel Pepys&#x27;s cousin Roger Pepys, a Puritan, may well have believed the gossip. A later entry in Pepys&#x27; Diary praises the Archbishop as a &quot;stout and high spirited man&quot;, who openly spoke his mind to the King on matters of morality.

Sheldon never married: this may have inspired the gossip reported by Pepys about his immoral private life. His niece, Catherine, married John Dolben, Archbishop of York.

Sheldon was buried in Croydon Parish Church, now renamed Croydon Minster.

<doc id="153594" wikidata="Q979349" url="?curid=153594" title="Heworth, York">
<text>Heworth ( ) is part of the city of York in North Yorkshire, England, about north-east of the centre. No longer in general referred to as a village, &quot;Heworth Village&quot; is now the name of a specific road. The name &quot;Heworth&quot; is Anglo-Saxon and means a &quot;high enclosure&quot;.

==Location and demographics==

Housing in Heworth varies from terraced houses along East Parade towards Layerthorpe, through large Victorian villas on Heworth Green, to older houses in Heworth village and the 1830s Elmfield Villa, home to Elmfield College and 1930s semi-detached houses on Stockton Lane.

Heworth has seen much modern suburban development, particularly in the outlying area of Heworth Without.

Heworth splits into two wards for the purposes of local elections—Heworth (including all land within the old city boundary) and Heworth Without (outside the old city boundary). Heworth Holme is a popular open space near Heworth village.

The population of the Heworth Ward at the 2011 Census was 13,725.

==Transport==
A number of bus routes serve Heworth, these are operated by First York, York &amp; Country and East Yorkshire. It is roughly 1.5 miles from York station, which gives access to the UK national rail network.

==History==

Very little is known about the prehistoric history of the Heworth area, some researchers believe the area was largely boggy land. The village is of Roman origin and two Roman cremation cemeteries have been found in the area. Heworth Green, the road from York city centre to the village, is on the site of a Roman road.

During the early Medieval period, contemporary burials took place in a similar area to the Roman ones; this was during the 5th and 6th centuries. However, evidence for settlement in Heworth during this period of time still remains minimal.

The village appears as &quot;Heworde&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and as &quot;Hewud&quot; in 1219.

Heworth was formerly a township in the parishes of St Saviour, St Cuthbert and St Olave-Marygate, in 1866 Heworth became a separate civil parish, in 1894 the parish was abolished and split, the part in the County Borough of York became Heworth Within and the rural part became Heworth Without. In 1891 the parish had a population of 740. Until 1974 it was in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

===1453 Battle of Heworth Moor===
On 24 August 1453, a skirmish took place and was the first meeting of the two families involved in the Percy-Neville feud, the feud which eventually helped provoke the Wars of the Roses. Historians have described an attack on the Neville family&#x27;s wedding party by Lord Egremont; numerous contemporaries regard it as the very first military action of the Wars of the Roses.

The Neville family was returning to Sheriff Hutton castle following a wedding between Sir Thomas Neville and Maud Stanhope. Stanhope was the heiress and niece of Ralph de Cromwell. Cromwell had previously confiscated Percy strongholds such as Wressle and Bunwell after Henry &#x27;Hotspur&#x27; Percy&#x27;s death in 1403; the thought of those properties one day being handed over to the Neville family angered Lord Egremont greatly.

Egremont decided to ambush the Neville family&#x27;s returning wedding party at Heworth Moor, along with 1,000 retainers from York. The Neville family were said to have given a good account of themselves and defended themselves well in the skirmish.

===1642 Meeting on Heworth Moor===
During the summer of 1642 both the Parliamentary party and King Charles I negotiated with each other while preparing for war.

When Charles endeavoured to raise a guard for his own person at York, intending it, as the event afterwards proved, to form the nucleus of an army, Lord Fairfax was required by Parliament to present a petition to his sovereign, entreating Charles to hearken to the voice of his Parliament, and to discontinue the raising of troops. This was at a great meeting of the freeholders and farmers of Yorkshire convened by the king on Heworth Moor on 3 June near York. Charles evaded receiving the petition, pressing his horse forward, but Thomas Fairfax followed him and placed the petition on the pommel of the king&#x27;s saddle.

===Local enclosures===

The lands called Monk Ward Stray consist of 131 acres and 38 perches of land, situate near York, and in the township of Heworth. Before the passing of an Enclosure Act 1817, the freemen of York, who were occupiers of houses within a division or ward of the city, called Monk Ward, were, together with certain other persons, entitled to common of pasture and right of stray or average, and had immemorially used and enjoyed the same, in and over a parcel of ground called Heworth Moor, of which G. A. Thweng, lord of the manor of Heworth, was then ; another piece of land, called Heworth Grange, of which the king was then seised in fee; and certain closes and other parcels of ground, called Hall Fields, of which E. Prest and others were then seised in fee.

===Settlement===
Construction of the Heworth Green Villas on Heworth Road began about 1817. Until the mid-19th century, the Lord of the Manor was the Reverend Robert William Bilton Hornby. The Ordnance Survey map of 1849, shows that Heworth was effectively a square of three parallel streets sandwiched between the then Scarborough Road and East Parade.

On the outskirts of the village near Monk Stray was Elmfield College, a Primitive Methodist foundation which existed from 1864 to 1932, when it merged with Ashville College in Harrogate. All that is left of the college now is numbers 1 and 9 Straylands Grove, next to Monk Stray, and staff housing along Elmfield Terrace and Willow Grove.

The church of Holy Trinity (architect: George Fowler Jones) was added in 1869; outlying features included a Wesleyan Chapel, the manor house, a public house (&quot;The Britannia&quot;), a windmill, several potteries, Heworth Hall and Heworth House. At that time Tang Hall was just that – a hall situated in parkland; since then it has developed into its own neighbourhood. Christ Church was built on Stockton Lane in 1964. Heworth became a Conservation Area in 1975.

==Notable people==

*Mary Ward, an English Roman Catholic nun and founder of the Sisters of Loreto (also known as the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary) moved to the village in 1643 after a brief stint in Hutton Rudby (1642–3). During the dangers of the English Civil War she was forced to move within the York City Walls but moved back to Heworth in July 1644. Ill for some time, Ward died on 30 January 1645 (20 January 1645, Old Calendar) at the Manor House (see Heworth Manor below) which, under the aid of the Thwing sisters (Ellen, Anne and Catherine) would become one of the temporary seats of the order, prior to the establishment of the Bar Convent. She is buried in Osbaldwick Churchard.
*Barbara Ward (economist, writer and environmentalist who was interested in developing countries) was born here in 1914. She was awarded the title of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire later in her life.
*Dame Judi Dench was born in Heworth Green.
*Robert William Bilton Hornby, priest, antiquarian and Lord of the Manor of Heworth.
* see also people associated with Elmfield College
* Alan Leach (The drummer from the band Shed Seven)
* Claudia Lawrence (born Malton, missing since March 2009), moved in Heworth in 2007

==Notable buildings==
* Heworth Manor (also called the Old Manor House or Heworth Hall), is said to have been located at what is now the corner of Heworth Village and Walney Road, it is now demolished. Occupied by the Catholic Recusant Thwenge/Thwing family during the time of Henry VIII, it was later sold to the family Agar. It was here that the Catholic priest Anthony Page (1563–1593) was found in a haystack and where the Catholic nun Mary Ward (1585–1645) is said to have died. Helen/Ellen Thwing (b.1636), nun, was in charge of the house and in 1678 it was purchased by Sir Thomas Gascoigne (Helen&#x27;s uncle) &quot;for my niece Ellen&quot; when Sir George Thwenge (Helen&#x27;s father) was forced to sell due to unrelated financial difficulties. A Catholic community thrived at the house and it was central to the happenings of the so-called &quot;Barnbow Plot,&quot; the foundations of the Dolebank and Bar Convent and was a seat of Mary Ward&#x27;s Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary whose founding members, outside those of the family, had lived here as early as 1643. Helen&#x27;s brother, the priest and martyr Thomas Thwing, chaplain at Carlton Hall, became chaplain at Heworth and was arrested here in 1679. It was a registered Papists&#x27; Estate and described thus: &quot;William Thweng... the Mannour of Heworth ... a capital messge., with barn &amp;c, two fronsteads and two gardens ...&quot; During the 19th Century it was owned by the Hornby family, Anglicans.
*The Cottage, No. 11 Stockton Lane, dates from and appears to be on Robert Cooper&#x27;s map of 1832. It was called Belle Vue Cottage in 1834, when it was occupied by Mr. John Scott, in 1846, when it was occupied by Henry Janson, gent., and in 1850 (Directories; OS). It is a double-fronted cottage with rendered walls and a hipped roof and was extended . It has an enriched door-case of mid 18th-century date, brought from elsewhere.
*The Manor House, No. 1 Stockton Lane, was formerly called the New Manor House (OS). It was built before 1830 when William Hornby Esq. (father of Robert Hornby) occupied it and it appears, with its name, on Robert Cooper&#x27;s map of 1832. The house is partly of two, partly of three, storeys, above a high semi-basement and is of unusual, nearly cubical, shape. A bay window was added later in the 19th century.
*Rose Villa, No. 32/34 Stockton Lane, was called Heworth Villa in 1850 (OS). It was built in the early 19th century and may be the house which appears on the site on Robert Cooper&#x27;s map of 1832. It is a double-fronted house with later extensions.
*The old Elmfield College (b. 1840s) still has one building standing (on Straylands Grove)
*Heworth House in Melrosegate was built in 1865 as the old Heworth Rectory. It was designed by G. Fowler Jones and is representative of high Victorian Gothic architecture.
*Holy Trinity Church, built in 1869. was designed by G. Fowler Jones, commissioned by the Reverend Jocelyn Willey of Camblesforth Hall, and his wife, Frances Carus-Wilson (later Lady Trevor Wheler).

==Sport==

Heworth has some history in the sports of cricket, football, rugby league and others. Heworth Cricket Club is said to have been founded in 1784 (in 2009 they celebrated their 225th anniversary). The football club was one of the earliest to play in the York area, and featured in the York Football League from 1898 onwards. They finished as runners-up of the top level during the 1908–09, 1909–10 and 1911–12 seasons.

Elmpark Way in the village has hosted the York International 9s competition since 2002. It is an annual rugby league nines competition and in the past has featured clubs from England, France and Russia. It has been given a five-star rating by the Rugby League European Federation.

<doc id="153596" wikidata="Q4812053" url="?curid=153596" title="Asylum and Immigration Tribunal">
<text>The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) was a tribunal constituted in the United Kingdom with jurisdiction to hear appeals from many immigration and asylum decisions. It was created on 4 April 2005, replacing the former Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA), and fell under the administration of the Tribunals Service.

On 15 February 2010, the Tribunal was abolished and its functions transferred to the new Asylum and Immigration Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal created by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) has been set up to hear appeals against removal of potential deportees in high security cases. The information given to appellants and their representatives is limited as compared to other removal hearings.

==History==

===Origins===
The system of appeals to adjudicators (who were appointed by the Secretary of State) with the right of subsequent appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT) (whose members were appointed by the Lord Chancellor) was first created by the Immigration Appeals Act 1969 (1969 c.21).

===The IAA===
The predecessor of the AIT, the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA), was an independent judicial body in the United Kingdom constituted under the Immigration Act 1971. It consisted of two tiers:Immigration Adjudicators and the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT).

Immigration Adjudicators considered appeals against decisions made by Immigration Officers, entry clearance officers and the Home Secretary, with permanent centres in Islington in inner London, Hatton Cross, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow.

The IAT dealt with applications for leave to appeal and appeals against decisions made by the Immigration Adjudicators, the main hearing centre was in Bream&#x27;s Buildings, just off Chancery Lane, in Central London.

===The creation of the AIT===
The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 abolished the two tier structure and created a single tier tribunal. All former adjudicators and members of the IAA became members of the new AIT. At this point, the Home Office Adjudicators became known as Immigration Judges, although many of these are not officially qualified as judges, and the former regional adjudicators became Senior Immigration Judges, who are mostly involved in reconsideration applications for previously dismissed appeals.

==Procedure==
At hearings, asylum seekers and would-be immigrants are usually, but not invariably, represented by legal representatives including barristers, advocates, solicitors, and those registered with the Office of the Immigration Service Commissioner. The UK government is usually represented by Home Office Presenting Officers (&quot;HOPOs&quot;); specially trained Civil Servants. For some significant cases, the Home Office instructs a barrister from TSol to conduct the case.

Procedure is governed by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).

==Further appeals==
Ordinarily, there is no right to appeal a decision of the AIT.

The AIT makes most initial decisions through a single immigration judge. Such decisions can be &quot;reconsidered&quot;. An order for reconsideration is sought by making a written request to the High Court in England and Wales or the Court of Session (Outer House) in Scotland. For an indefinite period requests for reconsideration orders will be considered initially by Immigration judges of the AIT (&quot;the filter&quot;); should the request be refused a party can opt into the High Court or Court of Session.

Either of the parties (the Home Secretary or the Appellant) can apply for reconsideration, within strict time limits (for example, 5 days from receipt of the decision if the Appellant is in the UK). Such an application must be made in writing. A Senior Immigration Judge considers whether or not the grounds for reconsideration are &quot;arguable&quot;. The only matters which can be considered are errors of law. A party cannot say that he seeks a re-hearing of the facts or that the factual conclusions reached by the Immigration Judge are wrong. He can only seek reconsideration if the Immigration Judge has misdirected himself in law, failed to consider relevant material, considered irrelevant material, or erred in his fact-finding to the extent that the findings are irrational and therefore amount to an error of law.

If permission is refused on the papers, the party may renew his application for an order for reconsideration to the High Court or Court of Session. Again, the time limits are short. If the High Court or Court of Sessions agree that the AIT has made a mistake in not considering the application for reconsideration, he may order the AIT to reconsider.

A successful application comes before the AIT for reconsideration. Most of these cases are heard at the old IAT, at Field House, Bream&#x27;s Buildings, just off Chancery Lane in central London. Some are heard elsewhere. The initial hearing is a first-stage reconsideration, usually called an &quot;error of law hearing&quot; by lawyers and Immigration Judges. The panel of Immigration Judges (usually one legally-qualified Senior Immigration Judge and one or two lay members) determine whether a material error of law was made in the determination (judgment). If they conclude that no error was made, that is the end of the matter in front of the AIT. If they conclude that there was a material error of law, they may either reconsider the case in full or in part themselves, or (more usually) order that it be re-heard at a later date. They may set out that all the case be re-considered, or only part of it, depending on the exact circumstances. The second-stage reconsideration may be heard by three Immigration Judges, or by a single Immigration Judge.

After a re-hearing, or if the AIT which hears a case for the first time has a 3 or more members, the decision may only be challenged by an appeal to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in England and Wales, or the Court of Session (Inner House) in Scotland. Permission is required for such an appeal either from the Tribunal itself or the relevant court.

<text>John Whitgift (c. 1530 – 29 February 1604) was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1583 to his death. Noted for his hospitality, he was somewhat ostentatious in his habits, sometimes visiting Canterbury and other towns attended by a retinue of 800 horses. Whitgift&#x27;s theological views were often controversial.

==Early life and education==
He was the eldest son of Henry Whitgift, a merchant, of Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, where he was born, probably between 1530 and 1533. The Whitgift family is thought to have originated in the relatively close Yorkshire village of Whitgift, adjoining the River Ouse.

Whitgift&#x27;s early education was entrusted to his uncle, Robert Whitgift, abbot of the neighbouring Wellow Abbey, on whose advice he was sent to St Anthony&#x27;s School, London. In 1549 he matriculated at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and in May 1550 he moved to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where the martyr John Bradford was his tutor. In May 1555 he was elected a fellow of Peterhouse.

==Links with Cambridge==
Having taken holy orders in 1560, he became chaplain to Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, who collated (that is, appointed) him to the rectory of Teversham, just to the east of Cambridge. In 1563 he was appointed Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, and his lectures gave such satisfaction to the authorities that on 5 July 1566 they considerably augmented his stipend. The following year he was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity, and became master first of Pembroke Hall (1567) and then of Trinity in 1570. He had a principal share in compiling the statutes of the university, which passed the great seal on 25 September 1570, and in the November following he was chosen as vice-chancellor.

While at Cambridge he formed a close relationship with Andrew Perne, sometime vice-chancellor. Perne went on to live with Whitgift in his old age. Puritan satirists would later mock Whitgift as &quot;Perne&#x27;s boy&quot; who was willing to carry his cloak-bag – thus suggesting that the two had enjoyed a homosexual relationship.

==Francis Bacon==
Whitgift taught Francis Bacon and his older brother Anthony Bacon at Cambridge University in the 1570s. As their tutor, Whitgift bought the brothers their early classical text books, including works by Plato, Cicero and others.
Whitgift&#x27;s authoritarian beliefs and conservative religious teachings had a profound impact on Bacon, as did his teaching on natural philosophy and metaphysics. 
Bacon would later disavow Whitgift, writing to Elizabeth I to warn her against Whitgift&#x27;s attempts to root out the &quot;careful and diligent preachers in each parish&quot;.

==Promotions and improvements==

Whitgift&#x27;s theological views were controversial. An aunt with whom he once lodged wrote that &quot;though she thought at first she had received a saint into her house, she now perceived he was a devil&quot;. Thomas Macaulay&#x27;s description of Whitgift as &quot;a narrow, mean, tyrannical priest, who gained power by servility and adulation...&quot; is, according to the author of his 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; entry, &quot;tinged with rhetorical exaggeration; but undoubtedly Whitgift&#x27;s extreme High Church notions led him to treat the Puritans with exceptional intolerance&quot;. In a pulpit controversy with Thomas Cartwright regarding the constitutions and customs of the Church of England, his oratorical effectiveness proved inferior, but he was able to exercise arbitrary authority: together with other heads of the university, he deprived Cartwright of his professorship, and in September 1571 Whitgift exercised his prerogative as master of Trinity to strip him of his fellowship. In June of the same year Whitgift was nominated Dean of Lincoln. In the following year he published &quot;An Answere to a Certain Libel&quot; entitled an &quot;Admonition to the Parliament&quot;, which led to further controversy between the two churchmen. From 1572 to 1577 he was Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s church in Laceby in Lincolnshire. On 24 March 1577, Whitgift was appointed Bishop of Worcester, and during the absence of Sir Henry Sidney in Ireland in 1577 he acted as vice-president of Wales.

==Archbishop of Canterbury, 1583–1604==

In August 1583 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury to replace Edmund Grindal, who had been placed under house arrest after his disagreement with Queen Elizabeth over &quot;prophesyings&quot; and died in office. Whitgift placed his stamp on the church of the Reformation, and shared Elizabeth&#x27;s hatred of Puritans. Although he wrote to Elizabeth remonstrating against the alienation of church property, Whitgift always retained her special confidence. In his policy against the Puritans and in his vigorous enforcement of the subscription test he thoroughly carried out her policy of religious uniformity.

He drew up articles aimed at nonconforming ministers, and obtained increased powers for the Court of High Commission. In 1586, he became a privy councillor. His actions gave rise to the Martin Marprelate tracts, in which the bishops and clergy were strongly opposed. By his vigilance the printers of the tracts were discovered and punished, though the main writer Job Throkmorton evaded him. Whitgift had nine leading presbyterians including Thomas Cartwright arrested in 1589–90, and though their trial in the Star Chamber for sedition did not result in convictions they did agree to abandon their movement in return for freedom.

Whitgift took a strong line against the Brownist movement and their Underground Church in London led by Henry Barrow and John Greenwood. Their services were repeatedly raided and members held in prison. Whitgift repeatedly interrogated them through the High Commission, and at the Privy Council. When Burghley asked Barrow his opinion of the Archbishop, he responded: &quot;He is a monster, a miserable compound, I know not what to make him. He is neither ecclesiastical nor civil, even that second beast spoken of in revelation.&quot; Whitgift was the prime mover behind the Act against Seditious Sectaries which was passed in 1593, making Separatist Puritanism a felony, and he had Barrow and Greenwood executed the following morning.

In the controversy between Walter Travers and Richard Hooker, he prohibited the former from preaching, and he presented the latter with the rectory of Boscombe in Wiltshire, to help him complete his &quot;Ecclesiastical Polity&quot;, a work that in the end did not represent Whitgift&#x27;s theological or ecclesiastical standpoints. In 1587, he had Welsh preacher John Penry brought before the High Commission, and imprisoned; Whitgift signed Penry&#x27;s death warrant six years later.

In 1595, in conjunction with the Bishop of London and other prelates, he drew up the Calvinist instrument known as the Lambeth Articles. Although the articles were signed and agreed by several bishops they were recalled by order of Elizabeth, claiming that the bishops had acted without her explicit consent. Whitgift maintained that she had given her approval.

Whitgift attended Elizabeth on her deathbed, and crowned James I. He was present at the Hampton Court Conference in January 1604, at which he represented eight bishops.

He died at Lambeth at the end of the following month. He was buried in Croydon at the Parish Church of St John Baptist (now Croydon Minster): his monument there with his recumbent effigy was practically destroyed when the church burnt down in 1867.

==Legacy==
Whitgift is described by his biographer, Sir George Paule, as of &quot;middle stature, strong and well shaped, of a grave countenance and brown complexion, black hair and eyes, his beard neither long nor thick.&quot; He left several unpublished works, included in the &quot;Manuscripts Angliae&quot;. Many of his letters, articles and injunctions are calendared in the published volumes of the &quot;State Papers&quot; series of the reign of Elizabeth. His &quot;Collected Works&quot;, edited for the Parker Society by John Ayre (3 vols., Cambridge, 1851–1853), include the controversial tracts mentioned above, two sermons published during his lifetime, a selection from his letters to Cecil and others, and some portions of his previously unpublished manuscripts.

In his later years he concerned himself with various administrative reforms, including fostering learning among the clergy, abolishing non-resident clergy, and reforming the ecclesiastical courts.

Whitgift set up charitable foundations (almshouses), now The Whitgift Foundation, in Croydon, the site of a palace, a summer retreat of Archbishops of Canterbury. It supports homes for the elderly and infirm, and runs three independent schools – Whitgift School, founded in 1596, Trinity School of John Whitgift and, more recently, Old Palace School for girls, which is housed in the former Croydon Palace.

Whitgift Street near Lambeth Palace (the official London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury) is named after him. Whitgift Close in Laceby in Lincolnshire, where he was Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s church from 1572 to 1577, is also named for him.

A comprehensive school in his home town of Grimsby, John Whitgift Academy, is named after him.

The Whitgift Centre, a major shopping centre in Croydon, is named after him. It is built on land still owned by the Whitgift Foundation.

<doc id="153598" wikidata="Q5815661" url="?curid=153598" title="Huntington, North Yorkshire">
<text>Huntington is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England. It is part of the &quot;Huntington &amp; New Earswick&quot; ward and lies on the River Foss, to the north of York and the south of Strensall.

The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

According to the 2001 census Huntington had a population of 9,277, increasing to 12,108 at the 2011 census.

Huntington is made up of mainly low-lying land, with the highest point in the village being only 64 feet above sea level. It covers some and measures some 4 miles (6 km) from north to south and 3 miles (5 km) east to west.

==History==
 There has been a parish church (All Saints) in this village since 1086. Huntington originally included three villages within the parish boundaries: Towthorpe, Earswick and Huntington. Huntington itself also comprised the small township of West Huntington, including West Huntington Hall. The village is unique in that the main settlement and church are separated by a river, the Foss. During the Middle Ages, the part of Huntington to the east of the Foss was part of the Forest of Galtres, a hunting royal forest that covered large areas of land to the north-east of York and is still referred to in many local place names. The Act of Dis-Afforestation of 1629 put an end to this.

Huntington remained a very small settlement until the second half of the 19th century, with no more than approximately 630 inhabitants by 1901. The expansion of Huntington started slowly around 1870–1880, with the construction of nearby New Earswick and the opening of Queen Elizabeth Barracks in nearby Strensall. The rehousing schemes during the 1930s speeded up the growth of the village and turned Huntington into a suburban area of the York. The village suffered only a little damage during the Second World War and saw a further housing expansion along Huntington and Strensall Road in the post-war years. The northwards expansion was halted by the construction of the York ring road. Most of the land associated with West Huntington has now become the separate parish of New Earswick. Huntington&#x27;s old village, including All Saints&#x27; Church and the nearby West Huntington Hall, was made a conservation area in 1991. The urbanisation of the village is now almost complete, and current housing development is mainly driven by evolutions in the UK property market, the shortage of housing in York and the attraction of the local secondary school, Huntington School.

Huntington was served by Earswick railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1847 and 1965.

==Economy==
===Local amenities===

The village has a post office, newsagent, grocer, butcher, pharmacy and two pubs – the &quot;Hogshead&quot; and &quot;The Blacksmiths Arms&quot;. In addition, there are a few light industrial enterprises, including several motor garages. A few community/parish halls provide venues for a good range of local community groups. Monks Cross Shopping includes several national chain stores and three supermarkets.

===Commerce and industry===

A recent expansion is the retail park Vangarde Shopping Park which include three new major shops and many cafes and restaurants The adjacent industrial estate provides employment through several financial and service sector companies and is the UK headquarters and main manufacturing site of Portakabin Ltd., part of the Shepherd Building Group.

===Public transport===
With the demise of the former railway station under the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, Huntington has since been served by local buses. The main bus operator is First York. As of September 2015, Huntington is served (in at least some capacity) by the following local bus routes:
* 5/5A (Orange Line) Strensall – City – Acomb
* 9 (Silver Line) Monks Cross Park &amp; Ride – City
* 12 (Pink Line) Foxwood – City – Monks Cross
* 13 (Brown Line) Copmanthorpe - City - Haxby (Mon – Sat only)
* 14 Foxwood – City – Haxby
* 16A Acomb – Hamilton Drive – City – Elmfield Ave (Sun only)
* 20 Acomb – Clifton Moor – Monks Cross – University
* 99 Monks Cross P&amp;R – Monks Cross Shops
* 180/181 York – Sheriff Hutton – Castle Howard

==Churches==

All Saints&#x27; Church is in the countryside between Huntington and New Earswick, on Church Lane, off the Old Village in Huntington. It is beside the River Foss, which runs between the two villages. It is a popular location for life ceremonies, especially weddings and baptisms and has an attractive and well-maintained churchyard. There is a large car park nearby, which is used all week by Huntington residents for walks along the river, exercising dogs, horses etc.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church is home to a lively Christian community whose building sits on Huntington Road, near the Link Road, which connects Huntington to New Earswick. It is close to Huntington Secondary School and is just opposite the New Earswick bowls club and the Hogshead (formerly, the Flag &amp; Whistle) pub. The building includes a hall used for numerous youth and community groups during the week as well as the Ladybirds Nursery School and a school of dance. There is also large scout hut to the rear and together with an active church community the site is in use seven days a week including most evenings. The church has recently been refurbished in order to serve the community better, including creating a new kitchen, office space and improved access to the hall and church buildings.

Both All Saints&#x27; and St Andrew&#x27;s are founder members of Churches Together in Huntington and New Earswick, together with Huntington Methodist Church, New Earswick Methodist Church, St Paulinus&#x27; Catholic Church and the New Earswick Religious Society of Friends (&#x27;Quakers&#x27;).

==Education==
Huntington Primary Academy is a large local primary school with approximately 400 pupils. Whilst most children of the village attend the school, Huntington Primary also attracts a relatively large proportion of children from neighbouring villages. Yearsley Grove Primary is another primary school in the area, with around 400 pupils as well.

Huntington School is a mixed comprehensive secondary school. The school is a technology college with approximately 1,500 pupils. The current headteacher of the school is Matt Smith, replacing John Tomsett.

==Sport==
Huntington was the location of Huntington Stadium, a multi-purpose facility which acted primarily as the home of York City Knights. Next to the stadium lied York WaterWorld. Both were mothballed in 2014 in preparation for works on the York Community Stadium. The project would see WaterWorld demolished and Huntington Stadium rebuilt to higher specifications. The new community stadium is home to both York City Knights and York City F.C., the latter relocating from Bootham Crescent, which is to be demolished to make way for a housing development.

A new regional standard athletics track was constructed at the University of York as part of the project to replace the track at Huntington. City of York Athletics Club relocated from Huntington to the university as a result. 
The old stadium&#x27;s main playing area was completely surrounded by an athletics track and there was also a small area which was used for hammer throwing, shot put and discus. The stadium was equipped with floodlights. There was an all-seater main stand plus a full-length standing-only covered stand on the opposite side.

A community archaeology project was undertaken by York Archaeological Trust in 2015 to record the site of a Roman Marching Camp Site. The work of the local community project &quot;Dig York Stadium&quot; produced a historical record.

After the York Dig had concluded on 19 June 2015 demolition of Huntington Stadium began. The project faced delays in 2016 following a legal challenge to a planning application and further delays due to being unable to put on required test events in 2020, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless the LNER Community Stadium complex opened in 2021, and was a host stadium for the 2021 Women&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup.

<text>The REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars (&quot;RECONS&quot;) is an international group of astronomers founded in 1994 to investigate the stars nearest to the Solar System - with a focus on those within 10 parsecs (32.6 light years), but as of 2012 the horizon was stretched to 25 parsecs. In part the project hopes a more accurate survey of local star systems will give a better picture of the star systems in the Galaxy as a whole.

==Notable discoveries==
The Consortium claims authorship of the series &quot;The Solar Neighborhood&quot; in &quot;The Astronomical Journal&quot;, that began in 1994. This series now numbers nearly 40 papers and submissions. The following discoveries are from this series:
* GJ 1061 was discovered to be the 20th nearest known star system, at a distance of 11.9 light years.

* The first accurate measurement of distance for DENIS 0255-4700 . At a distance of 16.2 light years, it is the nearest known class L brown dwarf object to the Solar System.
* The discovery of 20 previously unknown star systems within 10 parsecs of the Solar System. These are in addition to 8 new star systems announced between 2000 and 2005.

&quot;RECONS&quot; is listed explicitly as an author on papers submitted to the &quot;Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society&quot; since 2004.

The &quot;RECONS&quot; web page includes the frequently referenced &quot;List of the 100 nearest star systems&quot;. They update this list as discoveries are made. A list of all RECONS parallaxes is available, as are all papers in &quot;the solar neighborhood&quot; series and which illustrates data from the &quot;RECONS 25 Parsec Database&quot;.

== Members ==
Key astronomers involved in the project include
* Todd J. Henry (GSU) (consortium founder and director)

<doc id="153602" wikidata="Q1789790" url="?curid=153602" title="Malham Cove">
<text>Malham Cove is a large curved limestone formation north of the village of Malham, North Yorkshire, England. It was formed by a waterfall carrying meltwater from glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age more than 12,000 years ago. Today it is a well-known beauty spot and rock climbing crag within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. A large limestone pavement lies above the cove.

==Geology==

The cove was formed by a large Ice Age river that fell at this point as a cataract. The water drop was high and more than wide. The water flowing over the waterfall created the curved shape of the cove because the lip was more heavily eroded than the sides.

A stream named Malham Beck originates on Malham Moor and emerges from a cave at the bottom of the cove. This is a different stream from the stream that flows out of Malham Tarn north of the cove. This latter stream goes underground at &#x27;Water Sinks&#x27; about before the top of the cove and does not emerge until Aire Head, south of Malham. The two streams were once thought to be one and the same, but experiments with dyes have shown that they are two separate waterways that go underground at different places. Their routes cross, without their waters mixing, behind the limestone cliff, re-emerging a few miles apart; indicating that there is a complex cave system behind the limestone cliff. Cave divers, entering the system through the cave at the base of the cove, have so far explored about . Stalagmite deposits inside the rising, dated to at least 27 ka, imply that the cave was dry during the Devensian ice age, and so must have been formed before then. 
The cave systems usually carry away any water before it reaches the fall; however, Malham Cove temporarily became a waterfall for what is believed to be the first time since 1824 on 6 December 2015, after heavy rainfall from Storm Desmond. 

==History==
The priest and noted antiquary Thomas West described the cove in 1779: &quot;This beautiful rock is like the age-tinted wall of a prodigious castle; the stone is very white, and from the ledges hang various shrubs and vegetables, which with the tints given it by the bog water. &amp; c. gives it a variety that I never before saw so pleasing in a plain rock.&quot;

On the west side of the 80-metre (260 foot) high cliff face are about 400 irregular stone steps: these form part of the route of the Pennine Way and lead to an uneven limestone pavement at the top.

==Rock climbing==
The cove is popular with climbers offering easy to hard traditional climbs, as well as sport climbing, including the UK&#x27;s first grade sport climb, &quot;Rainman&quot;, by Steve McClure. Due to the cliff&#x27;s south face, it is a popular for rock climbing in winter; however, in summer, the face can become very hot.

==Media appearances==
The cove, along with nearby Gordale Scar, was featured in an episode of the BBC TV series &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the natural wonders of Yorkshire.

The pavement was used as a shooting location for the 1992 film version of &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot;

The cove was also featured in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; (Part 1) as one of the places Hermione and Harry visited. The scenes were filmed in November 2009.

The limestone pavement and general location of Malham featured in an episode of &quot;The Trip&quot; starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon which aired on BBC2 on 29 November 2010.

<doc id="153606" wikidata="Q13894888" url="?curid=153606" title="Nether Poppleton">
<text>Nether Poppleton is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of the City of York in North Yorkshire, England. It is by the west bank of the River Ouse and is adjacent to Upper Poppleton west of York. It is close to the A59 road from York to Harrogate. The village is served by Poppleton railway station on the Harrogate Line.

According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 2,077. That increased to 2,141 at the 2011 census. Before 1996, it had been part of the Borough of Harrogate.

The name is derived from &quot;popel&quot; (pebble) and &quot;tun&quot; (hamlet, farm) and means &quot;pebble farm&quot; because of the gravel bed upon which the village was built. The neighbouring village of Upper Poppleton has been referred to as &quot;Land Poppleton&quot; and Nether Poppleton as &quot;Water Poppleton&quot;, indicating the villages&#x27; position relative to the river.

The village is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 and an Anglo-Saxon charter of circa 972. It became a Conservation Area in 1993. The earthworks to the north and east of the parish church are designated as a Scheduled Monument ().

==History==

In 972, the village was recorded as &quot;Popeltun&quot; in a list made for Archbishop of York Oswald of Church property lost in the wars earlier in the century, and in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Popletune&quot;. The villages and lands were given by Osbern De Arches to the Abbot of St Mary&#x27;s in York. It was, therefore, under the ecclesiastical rule of the Parish of St Mary-Bishophill Junior.

During the reign of Richard II, the village was the scene of the murder of a mayor of York.

In 1644, the 25,000-strong Scottish and Parliament armies, led by the Earl of Manchester, laid siege to the city of York. To facilitate communications, they built a &quot;bridge of boats&quot; at Poppleton. This bridge was eventually taken by Prince Rupert and his Royalist forces, but he subsequently lost the battle at Marston Moor.

The village benefited from the growth in the railways in the 19th century when the York, Knaresborough and Harrogate Railway routed its line through Poppleton and built a station.

On 22 January 1876, the village became the birthplace of Flora Sandes, the only woman to be officially enlisted during the First World War.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the Borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

===&quot;Time Team&quot; Dig 2004===
In June 2004, the British broadcaster Channel 4 made an episode of its archaeological programme &quot;Time Team&quot; in the village in association with Yorkshire Wessex Archaeology to investigate the origins of the village based near some of the earthenworks around the village, especially near the church and Manor Farm.

In total, 12 trenches were dug in addition to 32 test pits dug by the local population. The dig found evidence that there had been a monastic building in the village that was dated AD 450–850 and a formerly-unknown Tudor manor.

==Governance==

Nether Poppleton lies within the Rural West Ward of the City of York Unitary Authority. As of the 2023 elections, it is represented by councillors Anne Hook and Emilie Knight, who are both members of the Liberal Democrats. It is a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer. 

Locally, there is a parish council with seven council members.

==Economy==

Poppleton was formerly an agricultural settlement with many farms, but the modern village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to the nearby towns and cities. It has benefited from its good road and rail links. The village shares local retail facilities, including a post office, and some small enterprises with Upper Poppleton.

==Demography==

In the 19th century, the population varied between 254 and 346. The 2001 census recorded the population as 1,961.

==Education==

As of 2010, Poppleton Ousebank Primary School provides primary education for both Poppletons.

For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb. The nearest secondary school is Manor Church of England Academy on Millfield Lane, which has its own admissions policy separate from the local city council&#x27;s policy. It
was originally built in 1813 at Kings Manor and has moved several times before being sited in Millfield Lane.

==Transport==

Harrogate Coach Travel buses run past the village as part of the York to Ripon route. Transdev York and First York run service through the village from Upper Poppleton.

Poppleton railway station is located on the Harrogate line, which runs from York to Leeds via Harrogate. Northern Rail operates services from Poppleton in each direction.

==Religion==

St Everilda&#x27;s Church is at the end of Church Lane and is thought to have origins as early as the seventh century. The stained glass in the eastern window and in one of the windows in the south aisle are of late 13th century and early 14th century. St Everilda&#x27;s Church is named after a seventh century Saxon saint. It is one of only two churches in the United Kingdom dedicated to this saint. The other is at Everingham some to the south-east in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

==Sports==

The local football team, Poppleton United, and a lawn tennis club are in nearby Upper Poppleton. A Junior Football club, Poppleton Tigers, is based on Millfield Lane. The team play at the Poppleton Community Sports Pavilion, which was opened by John Sentamu, Archbishop of York on 10 October 2011.

<text>The East Riding of Yorkshire, often abbreviated to the East Riding or East Yorkshire, is a ceremonial county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. It borders North Yorkshire to the north and west, South Yorkshire to the south-west, and Lincolnshire to the south across the Humber Estuary. The city of Kingston upon Hull is the largest settlement.

The county has an area of and a population of 600,259. Kingston upon Hull is by far the largest settlement, with population of 267,014, and is a major port and the county&#x27;s economic and transport centre. The rest of the county is largely rural, and the next largest towns are the seaside resort of Bridlington (35,369) and the historic town of Beverley (30,351), which is also the county town. The county is governed by two unitary authorities, East Riding of Yorkshire Council and Hull City Council. It takes its name from the East Riding, a historic subdivision of Yorkshire.

In the east of the county the low-lying plain of Holderness is enclosed by a crescent of low chalk hills, the Yorkshire Wolds. The Wolds meet the sea at Flamborough Head, a chalk headland, while the Holderness coast to the south is characterised by clay cliffs. The west of the county is part of the Vale of York, the wide plain of the River Ure/Ouse; the south-west is part of the Humberhead Levels.

==History==
=== Prehistoric ===
When the last glacial period ended, the hunter gatherers of the Palaeolithic period followed the animal herds across the land between continental Europe and Britain. Then, as conditions continued to improve and vegetation could support a greater diversity of animals, the annual range of seasonal movement by Mesolithic communities decreased, and people became more fixed to particular localities. Until about 6000 BC, Mesolithic people appear to have exploited their environment as they found it. As communities came to rely on a smaller territorial range and as population levels increased, they started to try to modify or control the natural world. In the Great Wold Valley, pollen samples of Mesolithic date indicate that the forest cover in the area was being disturbed and altered by man, and that open grasslands were being created. The Yorkshire Wolds became a major focus for human settlement during the Neolithic period as they had a wide range of natural resources. The oldest monuments found on the Wolds are the Neolithic long barrows and round barrows. Two earthen long barrows in the region are found at Fordon, on Willerby Wold, and at Kilham, near Driffield, both of which have radiocarbon dates of around 3700 BC.

From around 2000 to 800 BC, the people of the Bronze Age built the 1,400 Bronze Age round barrows that are known to exist on the Yorkshire Wolds. These are found both in isolation and grouped together to form cemeteries. Many of these sites can still be seen as prominent features in the present-day landscape. By the later Bronze Age, an open, cleared, landscape predominated on the Wolds. It was used for grazing and also for arable cultivation. The wetlands on either side of the Wolds in the River Hull valley, Holderness and the Vale of York were also being used for animal rearing at this time. In the Iron Age there were further cultural changes in the area. There emerged a distinctive local tradition known as the Arras Culture, named after a site at Arras, near Market Weighton. There are similarities between the chariot burials of the Arras Culture and groups of La Tène burials in northern Europe, where the burial of carts was also practiced.

===Brythonic, Latin and Germanic===
The area became the kingdom of the tribe known as the Parisi. After invading Britain in AD 43, the Romans crossed the Humber Estuary in AD 71 to invade the Parisi tribe&#x27;s territory. From their bridgehead at Petuaria they travelled northwards and built roads along the Wolds to Derventio, present-day Malton, and then westwards to the River Ouse where they built the fort of Eboracum. There is evidence of extensive use of the light soils of the Wolds for grain farming in the Roman era. Several Roman villas which were the centres of large agricultural estates have been identified around Langton and Rudston. In the low-lying lands on either side of the Wolds there was an increase in the number of settlements between 500 BC and AD 500, as the land became drier and more accessible due to a fall in sea level. The lower-lying land was used for stock breeding. During the last years of Roman Britain, Anglo-Saxon raiders were troubling the area. After the Romans, the Brythonic-speaking area became known as Deira.

By the second half of the 5th century, the continued settlement by the Angles caused a shift to Old English. Deira merged into Northumbria and village names containing the Anglian elements -ing, -ingham or -ham started to be found in settlement names. As Christianity was established in the area from the 7th century onwards, several cemeteries like the one at Garton on the Wolds show evidence of the abandonment of pagan burial practices. In AD 867, the Great Danish Army captured the Anglian town of York. The remnants of the army settled from AD 876 as their leader Halfdan shared out the land. The Danish consolidated the area into the Kingdom of Jorvik, Danelaw then the Norse North Sea Empire. Scandinavian settlement names started to be found, such as -by and -thorpe. Scandinavian rule in the area came to an end in AD 954 with the death of Eric Bloodaxe.

===Medieval===
After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in AD 1066, land across England was granted to followers of the new Norman king and ecclesiastical institutions. When some of the northern earls rebelled, William retaliated with the Harrying of the North which laid waste to many northern villages. The land was then distributed among powerful barons, such as the Count of Aumale in Holderness and the Percy family in the Wolds and the Vale of York. These lay lords and ecclesiastical institutions, including the monasteries, continued to improve and drain their holdings throughout the Middle Ages to maximise the rents they could charge for them. The governance structure in the Domesday survey of 1086 was Yorkshire, its ridings and Wapentakes—the latter two remnants of the Norse structure.

In the mid-16th century Henry VIII of England dissolved the monasteries, resulting in the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated. The Crown subsequently sold these large tracts of land into private ownership. Along with the land already belonging to lay owners, they formed some of the vast estate holdings which continued to exist in the Riding until the 20th century.

==Geography==

===Location===
The traditional cultural and historic geographic county, the East Riding of Yorkshire borders the North Sea to the east of the county. To the north across the River Derwent is the North Riding of Yorkshire, and to the west across the River Ouse is the West Riding of Yorkshire.

In terms of neighbouring local government administration, the East Riding of Yorkshire unitary authority adjoins North Yorkshire to the north, north-west and to the west, South Yorkshire metropolitan area to the south-west and Lincolnshire across the Humber Estuary to the south. The City of Kingston upon Hull is a separate unitary authority immediately to the south and forms part of the ceremonial county area. Other councils areas adjacent to the unitary authority include North East Lincolnshire, beyond the Humber Estuary; North Lincolnshire, beyond the Humber and on land; Hull, Doncaster, North Yorkshire and York.

===Geology===
Geologically the East Riding district is split into three parts. The western part is the eastern section of the Vale of York with the southern extension into the Humberhead Levels. In this area there is a belt of sandstones overlain by glacial and lake deposits formed at the close of the last ice age. The middle part is the Yorkshire Wolds, a chalk formation which extends from the Humber at North Ferriby to the coast at Flamborough Head, a chalk headland. The south-east of the district is the low-lying coastal plain of Holderness, which faces east to the North Sea, and to the south drains into the Humber Estuary. South of Flamborough Head is Bridlington, which features several beaches, and at the far south-east of the district is the Spurn peninsula.

Before the last ice age the eastern coastline of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines to the west of the Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well-drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.

===Landscape===

The Wolds area takes the form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by numerous deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.

The Holderness landscape is dominated by deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form a more or less continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well-drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area, and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.
The Holderness coastline suffers the highest rate of coastal erosion in Europe: 2 metres a year on average or 2 million tonnes of material a year. Some of this is transported by longshore drift with about 3% of material being deposited at Spurn Head spit, to the south. The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing concern in the area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been carrying out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951. The Holderness area drains mostly into the Humber and the eponymous River Hull drains the area north of Hull.

The western part of the district in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.

===Climate===
The East Riding generally has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought, particularly on the Wolds. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night, and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the area are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea.
== Governance ==

The East Riding of Yorkshire is divided into two council areas: Kingston upon Hull is managed by Hull City Council, and the rest of the county is managed by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council.

A non-mayoral devolution deal was previously proposed for the county, a mayoral deal received approval from the Secretary of State as of September 2024. This led to the establishment of an Hull and East Yorkshire Combined Authority with powers over housing, job creation and public transport, including bus franchising.

=== Administrative history ===
The administrative division of the East Riding of Yorkshire originated in antiquity. Unlike most counties in Great Britain, which were divided anciently into hundreds, Yorkshire was divided first into three ridings and then into numerous wapentakes within each riding.
The separate Lieutenancy for the riding was established after the Restoration, and the ridings each had separate Quarter Sessions. For statistical purposes in the 19th century an East Riding of Yorkshire registration county was designated, consisting of the entirety of the Poor Law Unions of Beverley, Bridlington, Driffield, Howden, Hull, Patrington, Pocklington, Sculcoates, Skirlaugh and York.

In 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, administrative counties were formed on the existing historic county boundaries in England, but in Yorkshire, given the vast size of the county area, three administrative county councils were created, based on the historic boundaries of the three Ridings. A county council for the East Riding of Yorkshire (the East Riding County Council) was set up in 1889, covering an administrative county local government area centred on Beverley and which had the same boundaries as the historic riding. It also acted as the ceremonial county (Lieutenancy) area established for the area. At the same date a separate county borough of Kingston upon Hull, was created. The East Riding County Council and the county borough of Kingston upon Hull remained in place for eighty-six years until being removed for new administrative tiers of local government.

In 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, the historic established Lieutenancy and the local government administrative county were disbanded, being replaced by the newly created Humberside County Council which included most of the East Riding and additional parts of the West Riding and parts of Lincolnshire. The creation of this cross-Humber authority was unpopular on both banks of the Humber. Due to this local unpopularity with the new county council name, two of the nine districts formed in the 1972 Act included East Yorkshire in their titles, though they only covered a fraction of the geographical East Yorkshire area (East Yorkshire district, East Yorkshire Borough of Beverley). Continued disquiet culminated in a number of local government reviews in the 1980s and 1990s. Twenty-two years after being set up, Humberside County Council was abolished on 1 April 1996. The area north of the Humber Estuary (i.e. the city of Hull, whose boundaries would remain unchanged, the former districts of East Yorkshire, Beverley, and Holderness, and the northern part of the former Boothferry district, including the Goole area) formed two unitary authorities. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council unitary authority and the Kingston upon Hull City Council unitary authority were formed on 1 April 1996. The ceremonial county, the area in which the Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire represents the Crown, was re-established the same day, covering the City of Kingston upon Hull as well as the East Riding of Yorkshire Council area as did predecessor authorities.

The East Riding of Yorkshire is entirely parished; the City of Hull has no parishes. From 1996 Beverley had Charter Trustees to maintain the charter of the borough of Beverley: these were replaced by a Beverley Town Council in 1999, and Bridlington was parished in 1999. The unparished area consisting of the urban district of Haltemprice was divided into various parishes in 1999 and 2000.

===Current administration===

The East Riding of Yorkshire Council is based at County Hall in Beverley, in the former headquarters of Humberside County Council, and the former headquarters of East Riding County Council before that. There are 26 wards electing a total of 67 councillors in the district. The council elects on a four-yearly cycle with all seats up for election at the same time. It first had elections in 1995—a year before it came into its powers—as a shadow authority. Between 1995 and 2007 the council had No overall control. In the 2007 local elections the Conservative Party gained a majority of seats, including those of the Liberal Democrat and Labour Party leaders. The council has a leader-and-executive system, led by Steven Parnaby of the Conservative Party since its creation until his retirement at the 2019 election, when Richard Burton was elected as his replacement. On 13 May 2021, Jonathan Owen was elected as the new leader of the council. Following the 2023 election the Conservative Party elected former deputy, Anne Handley, to be leader of the group. At the annual general meeting of the council on 18 May 2023 Handley was elected as leader of the council, with the Conservative Party running a minority administration with support of the independents.

In the Audit Commission report covering 2007 the council was given a four-star rating, which places the authority as one of the best in the country.

===Result of the 2023 election===






===Westminster parliamentary===

For representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom the bulk of the East Riding district is divided into three county constituencies: Beverley and Holderness, Bridlington and the Wolds and Goole and Pocklington. The Kingston upon Hull area is divided into three constituencies; Kingston upon Hull North and Cottingham, Kingston upon Hull East, and Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice.

== Demographics ==

Until 1 April 2009, the East Riding was the largest district and the largest unitary authority in England by area and the second-largest non-metropolitan district in England by population. Following the 2009 structural changes to local government in England it fell to fifth place by area and sixth place by population.
The East Riding of Yorkshire covers and has a population of 335,049 (2008 Office for National Statistics mid-year estimates), a density of 1.4 people per hectare. The most populous parishes in the main 2001 census were Bridlington (34,000), Goole (17,000), Beverley (17,000), Cottingham (17,000, by Hull), Hessle (15,000, by Hull), Driffield (11,000), Anlaby with Anlaby Common (10,000, by Hull), Hornsea (8,000) and Willerby (8,000), Pocklington (8,000) and Elloughton-cum-Brough (7,000). Half the district&#x27;s population reside in these 11 parishes, with the other half living in the other 160 parishes. In comparison, Hull&#x27;s population according to the same census was 243,589. The population density of the district was around 135 people per square km, which made it the least densely populated unitary authority after the Isles of Scilly, Rutland and Herefordshire.

The East Riding has a larger than average number of residents aged 40 and above. There is a particularly strong deficit in the number of young adults. There is a higher-than-average level of car ownership. 36.4% of all households do not have a car. Less than 5% of the population travel to work by public transport compared with 15% nationally. The district is one of the lowest non-white populations, with the census reporting 98.8% of the inhabitants being white. Hull itself is also quite monoethnic for a city of its size, with the census reporting 97.7% white.

Areas of the East Riding show significant signs of affluence, including the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden which consists of middle-class areas such as: the suburb of Willerby, suburb of Kirk Ella, village of North Ferriby, and village of Swanland. Much of the area is affluent and has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the country.

Other parts of the county are more diverse, including the suburbs of Hessle, Cottingham and Anlaby with Anlaby Common. These areas consist of a mix of housing tenures in a real range of properties, from small ex-authority estates, to grand period homes. Hessle and Cottingham in particular have seen a considerable amount of home building, supporting the regeneration and development of the city of Hull. Beverley, a market town, is generally associated with affluence but, like any other town of its size, it also has areas that face disadvantage.

Other areas of the East Riding of Yorkshire face significant deprivation. The seaside towns of Withernsea and Bridlington face similar challenges with unemployment, low educational attainment, and socioeconomic inequality. South East Holderness, consisting of small rural communities, deals with limited access to services, inadequate public transportation, and the decline of traditional industries. Goole, an inland port town, has experienced a decline in its socioeconomic characteristic. Akin to much of the West Riding, this has coincided with the decline of industry over the latter half of the 20th century.

The crime rate in the East Riding is lower than the national average in robbery, sexual offences, theft of a vehicle, theft from a vehicle, violence against a person and burglary.

Christianity is the religion with the largest following in the area, with 53.3% residents so identifying in the 2021 UK census. These census figures show no other single religion returned affiliation, as a percentage of population, above the national average for England. At the time of the 2021 census the population of the East Riding was 342,215 and its ethnic composition was 97.4% white, compared with the English average of 81.0%. The area has a slightly higher elderly population, of 26.4% in 2021, than the national average.

==Settlements==
By population, the largest settlements in the ceremonial county are:


Kingston upon Hull is administered separately from the East Riding of Yorkshire. Anlaby and Willerby are suburban villages, almost contiguous with the Hull urban area. Bridlington is the most populous of the coastal settlements; others include Flamborough, Hornsea, Withernsea and Aldbrough. Settlements on the flat agricultural area of Holderness are Hedon and Roos and in the Great Wold Valley is Rudston. Beverley, Bishop Burton, Driffield, Cottingham and Lockington lie is the Yorkshire Wolds eastern foot. Low-lying lands close to the Humber Estuary are Goole, Brough, North Ferriby, Hessle and Kirk Ella. Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Market Weighton, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Howden and South Cave all lie to the north and west of the area, between the River Derwent and the scarp slope of the Wolds.

==Places of interest==


There are a wide range of interesting places to visit in the East Riding. These include historic buildings such as Burnby Hall, Burton Agnes Manor House, Burton Agnes Hall, Sewerby Hall, Skipsea Castle and the gun battery of Fort Paull. The religious edifices of the Rudston Monolith, Beverley Minster, Beverley Friary and Howden Minster can be visited at all seasons.

The sails of Skidby Windmill can be seen providing the power to grind flour on certain days, and natural sites provide interest at Spurn, Bempton Cliffs, Hornsea Mere, Humber Estuary, River Hull, Watton Beck, River Derwent, River Ouse, River Aire, River Trent and River Don, some of which are owned or run by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.

The Driffield Navigation, Leven Canal, Market Weighton Canal and Pocklington Canal offer glimpses of tranquillity. Stamford Bridge is the site of the famous battle, and the Yorkshire Wolds Way is a long-distance footpath that takes a winding route through the Yorkshire Wolds to Filey.

===Religious sites===
Most of the East Riding is in the East Riding Archdeaconry of the Church of England Diocese of York. The archdeaconry includes the Yorkshire Wolds and the City of Hull, with a coastline extending from Scarborough and Bridlington in the north to Spurn Point. The Middlesbrough Roman Catholic diocese covers Yorkshire&#x27;s historic east and north ridings as well as the historic City of York.

Notable religious sites include Beverley Minster, Howden Minster, Hull Minster and Bridlington Priory along with the historic parish church of St Augustine, Hedon, known as the &#x27;King of Holderness&#x27;, which is a Grade I listed building. The Sykes Churches Trail is a tour of East Yorkshire churches which were built, rebuilt or restored by the Sykes family of Sledmere House in the 19th century.

==Transport==

The East Riding has only a small segment of motorway. Part of the M62 serves to link the Hull area to West Yorkshire and the national motorway network, while the M18 incidentally passes the district border near Goole. Primary roads in the district include the A63, A164, A165, A1034, A166, A1033 and the A1079.

Hull Paragon Interchange is a large railway station, served by the Selby Line to the west and the Yorkshire Coast Line to the north. See Railway stations in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

Train operators active in the area are Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway, Northern and TransPennine Express. Bus services are provided by several operators including First York, which provides services from the East Riding into York, Goole Town Service and also services from Goole to Doncaster. Stagecoach in Hull provides services from the East Riding to Hull and into Lincolnshire, and East Yorkshire Motor Services, historically the dominant area operator, provides a wide variety of bus services throughout the East Riding. Yorkshire Coastliner provides services from Bridlington to Malton, York and Leeds. Holderness Area Rural Transport, a charity, provides a community transport service for North Holderness, taking people to medical appointments in Hull and to the shops.

The Humber Bridge, a road-only bridge, part of the A15, links Hessle, west of Hull, with Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire. West of this, the next crossing of the river (the Ouse at this point) are three bridges near Goole: a railway bridge, the M62 bridge and the A614.

The area is served by Humberside Airport located in Lincolnshire.

==Economy==
The district is generally rural, with no towns approaching the size of Hull. There are a few market towns such as Beverley, Driffield, Goole, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and the coastal towns of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. In the south the district contains areas such as Hessle which are part of the Hull urban area but outside the city boundaries. Rural areas tend to have a greater business stock than urban areas, reflecting the number of agricultural businesses and small businesses in rural areas. 20% of all VAT registered businesses in the East Riding are in agriculture and related sectors, although the number of such businesses fell by 40% between 1997 and 2003.
Easington, on the coast, is the site of a natural gas terminal, Easington Gas Terminal, used for the Langeled pipeline, as well as three other gas terminals operated by BP and Centrica.

The East Riding is characterised by a high employment rate and a relatively low unemployment level. The overall unemployment rate is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are unemployment hotspots in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea. Unemployment levels tend to fluctuate over the course of the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at DST Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.

The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has joined Hull City Council, North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire Councils in the Hull and Humber Ports City Region Partnership.

===Renewable energy===

The UK government has set a target to generate 10% of the UK&#x27;s electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government&#x27;s aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, which requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required to contribute to the delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region due its large wind energy potential. The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41 MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148 MW for installed grid-connected renewable energy. There are operational wind farms at Lissett in Holderness and Out Newton to the north of the Humber Estuary.

There are single turbines at the Waste Water Treatment Works at Saltend and at Loftsome Bridge Water Treatment Works near Barmby on the Marsh. In addition, several other wind developments have either been given or are applying for permission. By late February 2009 there was existing developed capacity or planning approval for 140 MW of renewable energy from wind farm developments. The overall renewable energy target for 2010 and 2021 has therefore already been exceeded by wind energy proposals alone, assuming some of these schemes will be operational by 2010. The East Riding has also exceeded 148 MW, when other renewable energy types such as biomass are included in the calculation. The Humber Estuary is to be used for trials of a tidal stream generator. If successful, it will be used to develop larger models which could be deployed in a 100-unit &quot;renewable power station&quot; capable of powering 70,000 homes.

===Industry===

The 18th century saw a canal network form, the River Derwent was canalised as far upstream as Malton and was linked to Pocklington by the cutting of the Pocklington Canal. Other canals were cut to join the towns of Beverley and Driffield to the River Hull, which was also improved to aid navigation. The Market Weighton Canal connected the town directly to the Humber Estuary. The canals and canalisation of the county&#x27;s rivers helped aid drainage to low-lying and ill-drained areas.

The 19th century saw a rail network created. An early rail link was constructed between Filey and Bridlington in 1847 and the Malton to Driffield railway was the first to cross the Wolds in 1853. Holidaymakers on the rail network expanded the coastal resorts of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. These routes also served the agricultural community in helping to get products to the expanding industrial markets to the port of Hull for export and the West Riding of Yorkshire for further production. The landscape in the East Riding has changed little since the enclosure of the open fields in the 18th and 19th centuries, except for some hedgerows removed to allow for the use of large agricultural machinery in the 20th century.

==Education==

The East Riding local education authority supports 150 schools: 131 primary schools and 19 secondary schools. The total net spending per head of population on education rose from £578.08 in 2006–07 to £632.88 in 2007–08.
In 2009 primary school test results showed a slide down the national performance table for the East Riding authority, dropping eight places in the national league table to 28th after other education authorities improved more in the tests.

At secondary level the authority slipped seven places to 39th out of 149 authorities, despite producing the best set of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) results since the inception of the East Riding of Yorkshire Council in 1996. The percentage of students achieving five or more good GCSEs, at grades A*–C including maths and English, rose to 52.5 per cent, from 50.8 per cent in 2007. This is above the national average of 47.6 per cent.
Bishop Burton is the location of Bishop Burton College, a further education and higher education college specialising in agriculture and equine studies.
Beverley Grammar School, which was founded around 700 AD, is widely renowned for being the oldest continuously operating state school in England.

Furthermore, Hull is home to several schools, including the private Hymers College, and a university. The University of Hull was founded as a university college in 1927 and received full university status in 1954; it is home to the Hull York Medical School, and has seen large scale expansion in recent years to cater for the ever-growing number of students.

== Public services ==
Both the East Riding and Hull are still covered by the Humberside Police area and the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. Piped water is supplied by Yorkshire Water who also maintain the sewerage system. About 1% of the population use water from private supplies. They are usually in the more remote parts of the East Riding. The majority are bore holes but they can be wells or natural springs.
NHS East Riding of Yorkshire provides health services such as district nursing, health visiting, school nursing, intermediate care and therapy services. It works with local GP practices, pharmacists, dentists, optometrists and ambulance services to provide a primary healthcare service.
Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust provides hospitals at Castle Hill Hospital, Hull Royal Infirmary and Beverley&#x27;s Westwood Hospital. Scarborough and North East Yorkshire Healthcare NHS Trust runs Bridlington Hospital and also provides health care from the Alfred Bean Hospital at Driffield and the Malton Community Hospital which are run by the local primary care trusts (NHS East Riding and NHS North Yorkshire and York). Small cottage and community hospitals provide a range of services at Hornsea Cottage Hospital and Withernsea Community Hospital.

There are ten household waste recycling sites across the East Riding. In the 2004–05 financial year of municipal waste was collected by East Riding and by Hull. Between 2003–04 and 2004–05 the amount of waste collected in Hull increased by 1.77% () and in the East Riding by 4.80% (). Target 45+ is a joint sustainable waste-management strategy developed in partnership by Hull City Council and the East Riding of Yorkshire Council. The overall aim is to achieve 45% recycling or composting by 2010 and then go beyond this. At the outset it was anticipated that recycling rates in the East Riding by the end of 2005–06 would be 22.4% and in Hull the rate would be 17.4%.
The Waste Recycling Group is a company working in partnership with the Hull City and East Riding of Yorkshire councils to deal with waste. The company has plans to build an energy from waste plant at Saltend to deal with of rubbish and put waste to a productive use by providing power for the equivalent of 20,000 houses.

The East Riding of Yorkshire is notably high for recycling rates. The county was marked the first Unitary Authority in England for household waste recycling, composting and re-use rate in 2021. Figures highlight that 60.8% of household waste in the county was recycled or composted, ahead of second-place North Somerset who were marked at 60.4%.

==Sport and leisure==
Hull is the main centre for national-level sport in the region. Hull City A.F.C., play in the Championship, the second tier of the English football league system, after promotion, as champions, from League One, at the first time of asking, in the 2020–21 season. Bridlington Town A.F.C. play in the Northern Premier League East Division.
North Ferriby play in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division and Hall Road Rangers played in Division One until resigning before the 2022–23 season. Beverley Town also play in NCEL division one as of the 2022–23 season, after being promoted the season before from the East Ridings highest amateur football league, Humber Premier League.

There are two professional rugby league teams based in Hull: Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers who play in the Super League. Bridlington Rugby Union Football Club plays at Dukes Park in Bridlington. The Hull Pirates ice hockey team were founded in 2015 and played in the National Ice Hockey League&#x27;s National League, but were replaced by Hull Seahawks for the 2022–23 season.

Horse racing is catered for at Beverley Racecourse on the Westwood to the west of Beverley. What the organisers claim is the world&#x27;s oldest horse race, the Kiplingcotes Derby, has been held annually in the East Riding since 1519.
There are more than a dozen golf clubs in the Riding including the cliff-top course at Flamborough. The Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club is based at Bridlington, and flying and gliding take place from Pocklington airfield and Eddsfield airfield.

==Media==
The region is covered by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire based in Hull and ITV Yorkshire, broadcast from Leeds. BBC Local Radio for the county is served by BBC Radio Humberside and BBC Radio York (covering Pocklington). County-wide commercial radio stations are Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Greatest Hits Radio East Yorkshire and Nation Radio East Yorkshire. The county also has four Community radio stations Great Driffield Radio, which covers Great Driffield and the surrounding villages, Seaside FM, which serves the Holderness area on 105.3 FM MHz, Vixen 101 which serves Market Weighton and Pocklington and 107.8 Beverley FM which serves Beverley and the surrounding areas.

Newspapers include the &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot;, owned by Reach plc. An &quot;East Riding Mail&quot; was launched in March 2006 as a sister paper to this. Other newspapers in the area include the &quot;Bridlington Free Press&quot;, the &quot;Goole Times&quot;, the &quot;Holderness Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Driffield &amp; Wolds Weekly&quot;. The &quot;Beverley Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Driffield Times &amp; Post&quot; used to serve the area but closed in 2016.

<doc id="153614" wikidata="Q192373" url="?curid=153614" title="World AIDS Day">
<text>World AIDS Day, designated on 1 December every year since 1988, is an international day dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection and mourning those who have died of the disease. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The HIV virus attacks the immune system of the patient and reduces its resistance to other diseases. Government and health officials, non-governmental organizations, and individuals around the world observe the day, often with education on AIDS prevention and control.

World AIDS Day is one of the eleven official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with World Health Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Immunization Week, World Tuberculosis Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Malaria Day, World Hepatitis Day, World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, World Patient Safety Day and World Chagas Disease Day.

, AIDS has killed between 27.2 million and 47.8 million people worldwide, and an estimated 37.7 million people are living with HIV, making it one of the most important global public health issues in recorded history. Thanks to recent improved access to antiretroviral treatment in many regions of the world, the death rate from AIDS epidemic has decreased by 64% since its peak in 2004 (1.9 million in 2004, compared to 680 000 in 2020).

==History==

World AIDS Day was first conceived in August 1987 by James W. Bunn and Thomas Netter, two public information officers for the Global Programme on AIDS at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. Bunn and Netter took their idea to Dr. Jonathan Mann, Director of the Global Programme on AIDS (now known as UNAIDS). Mann liked the concept, approved it, and agreed with the recommendation that the first observance of World AIDS Day should be on 1 December 1988. Bunn, a former television broadcast journalist from San Francisco, had recommended the date of 1 December that believing it would maximize coverage of World AIDS Day by western news media, sufficiently long following the US elections but before the Christmas holidays.

In its first two years, the theme of World AIDS Day focused on children and young people. While the choice of this theme was criticized at the time by some for ignoring the fact that people of all ages may become infected with HIV, the theme helped alleviate some of the stigma surrounding the disease and boost recognition of the problem as a family disease.

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) became operational in 1996, and it took over the planning and promotion of World AIDS Day. Rather than focus on a single day, UNAIDS created the World AIDS Campaign in 1997 to focus on year-round communications, prevention and education. In 2004, the World AIDS Campaign became an independent organization.

Each year since 1988, Popes have released a greeting message for patients and doctors on World AIDS Day. In 2016, a collection of HIV, rabies, COVID and other respiratory virus NGOs (including Panagea Global AIDS and the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa) started a campaign to rename World AIDS Day to World HIV Day. They claim the change will emphasize social justice issues, and the advancement of treatments like pre-exposure prophylaxis.

In the US, the White House began marking World AIDS Day with the iconic display of a AIDS Ribbon on the building&#x27;s North Portico in 2007. White House aide Steven M. Levine, then serving in President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration, proposed the display to symbolize the United States&#x27; commitment to combat the world AIDS epidemic through its landmark PEPFAR program. The White House display, now an annual tradition across four presidential administrations, quickly garnered attention, as it was the first banner, sign or symbol to prominently hang from the White House since the Abraham Lincoln administration.

Since 1993, the President of the United States has made an official proclamation for World AIDS Day (see section #US Presidential Proclamations for World AIDS Day for copies of those proclamations). On 30 November 2017, President Donald Trump along with local community college students proclaimed World AIDS Day for 1 December.

==Themes==
All the World AIDS Day campaigns focus on a specific theme, chosen following consultations with UNAIDS, WHO, and a large number of grassroots, national and international agencies involved in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. each year&#x27;s theme is chosen by the Global Steering Committee of the World AIDS Campaign (WAC).

For each World AIDS Day from 2005 through 2010, the theme was &quot;Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise&quot;, designed to encourage political leaders to keep their commitment to achieving universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support by the year 2010.

 the multi-year theme for World AIDS Day is &quot;Getting to Zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero deaths from AIDS-related illness. Zero discrimination.&quot; The US Federal theme for the year 2014 was &quot;Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-Free Generation&quot;.

The themes are not limited to a single day but are used year-round in international efforts to highlight HIV/AIDS awareness within the context of other major global events including the G8 Summit, as well as local campaigns like the Student Stop AIDS Campaign in the UK.

<doc id="153615" wikidata="Q356388" url="?curid=153615" title="Jules Léotard">
<text>Jules Léotard (; 1 August 183816 August 1870) was a French acrobatic performer and aerialist who developed the art of trapeze. He also created and popularized the one-piece gym wear that now bears his name and inspired the 1867 song &quot;The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot;, sung by George Leybourne.

==Biography==
Léotard was born in Toulouse, France, the son of a gymnastics instructor who ran a swimming pool in Toulouse. Léotard would practice his routines over the pool. He went on to study law.

After he passed his law exams, he seemed destined to join the legal profession, but at age 18 he began to experiment with trapeze bars, ropes, and rings suspended over a swimming pool. He later joined the Cirque Napoléon.

On 12 November 1859, the first flying trapeze routine was performed by Jules Léotard on three trapeze bars at the Cirque Napoleon.

The costume he invented was a one-piece knitted garment streamlined to suit the safety and agility concerns of trapeze performance. It also showed off his physique, impressed spectators, and took on his name.

At age twenty-four in July 1862, Léotard married a Tuscan actress named Silvia Bernini, whom he had met earlier in January. They bought an estate in France and met each other&#x27;s families. Yet by June 1864, Léotard, who was on a trip in Paris, informed Bernini via telegraph that he was seeking a divorce. Bernini traveled to Paris to speak with her husband, but they only argued more. Bernini then went to a hotel, disguised herself as a servant, and &quot;cut off her hair, sent it to her husband in a parcel, and attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself into the Seine.&quot; She survived. The two ultimately divorced.

In 1861, he performed in London at the Alhambra music hall. His approach did not stress the risk he took, but emphasized the &quot;ease and grace&quot; of his trapeze work, inspiring not fear but wonder.

Léotard inspired the 1867 song &quot;The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot;, made popular by George Leybourne.

He was also one of the cycling pioneers in France right before his death at age 32.

According to notes from the Victoria and Albert Museum, Jules Léotard died in 1870 from an infectious disease (possibly smallpox).

<text>Everingham is a village in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is west of Market Weighton town centre and south of Pocklington town centre.

The village lies in a civil parish also officially called &quot;Everingham&quot; by the Office for National Statistics, although the county council and parish council refer to it as Everingham and Harswell since the parish also includes the nearby village of Harswell. According to the 2011 UK census, it had a population of 304, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 320, and covers an area of .

==History==

There are two competing theories as to the origins of the village&#x27;s name. Firstly, the theory that the village is named after St. Everilda, the daughter of the 7th-century King Cyneglis of the West Saxons, who fled her home to practise Christianity in seclusion. Upon reaching York she was allowed to set up a convent at a place that came to be known as &#x27;Everildsham&#x27; (Everild&#x27;s home), which some believe to have evolved into the current name; Everingham. No trace of the convent survives and the former location is unknown. The second theory is that the name is derived from &#x27;Eofor&#x27;s Ham&#x27;, meaning the &#x27;ham&#x27; (home) of Eofor&#x27;s people, who may have been a Saxon tribe in the area. is a Saxon word meaning &#x27;Wild Boar&#x27; and was commonly used in that era as a name, for example as the name of a warrior in the Saxon epic Beowulf.

The next historical mention of the village comes in &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, when its population was recorded as 22. Though a small village for the time it paid a large amount of tax relative to other comparable villages. The value of the village had decreased considerably by 1086, however, probably as a result of the widespread destruction caused by William the Conqueror during his campaign to suppress rebellion in the north. After that time the village grew in prosperity, largely thanks to the presence of Everingham Hall, which gradually became the seat of the estate land and property in the area and contributed to the development of nearby villages such as Seaton Ross. The current hall is a Grade I Listed structure built between 1757 and 1764 by John Carr.

In 1823 Everingham was in the Wapentake of Harthill. The then &quot;neat modern church&quot; was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. There was also a Roman Catholic chapel. Population at the time was 271, with occupations including thirteen farmers, one of whom was a farrier, a carpenter, a shopkeeper, and a shoemaker. A tailor was the landlord of The Ship public house, and a blacksmith was the parish clerk. There was a schoolmaster, a rector of the church who was also church patron, a steward for William Constable-Maxwell, later the 10th Lord Herries of Terregles, described as a minor, and Mrs Constable-Maxwell of the &#x27;Hall&#x27;.

The village has two churches, both dedicated to St Everilda; St Everilda&#x27;s (Church of England) and Ss Mary &amp; Everilda, Everingham, (Roman Catholic). The latter church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England, whilst the former was designated as Grade II*. There is only one other church in Britain dedicated to this saint, St Everilda&#x27;s Church, Nether Poppleton, in the City of York. In a shrine to the saint in Half-Acre Lane harebells bloom and are referred to as &#x27;the holy harebells of St Everilda&#x27;. An elaborately carved gravestone set into the floor of the nearby ancient church of St Peter in Harswell might mark the grave of St Everilda.

The Ham class minesweeper was named after the village.

The Everingham railway station was also named after the village.

<doc id="153618" wikidata="Q7898869" url="?curid=153618" title="Upper Poppleton">
<text>Upper Poppleton is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of the City of York in North Yorkshire, England. It is situated by the west bank of the River Ouse adjacent to Nether Poppleton, and west of York close to the A59 from York to Harrogate. The village is served by Poppleton railway station on the Harrogate Line. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,961, increasing to 1,997 at the 2011 Census. Before 1996, it was part of the Borough of Harrogate.

The name is derived from &quot;popel&quot; (pebble) and &quot;tun&quot; (hamlet, farm) and means &quot;Pebble Farm&quot; because of the gravel bed upon which the village was built. Upper Poppleton has been referred to as &quot;Land Poppleton&quot; and the neighbouring village of Nether Poppleton as &quot;Water Poppleton&quot; indicating their position relative to the river.

The village is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. It became a Conservation Area in 1993.

==History==
In 972, the village was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles as &quot;Popeltun&quot; and in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Popeltune&quot;. The villages and lands were given by Osbert De Arches to the Abbot of St Mary&#x27;s in York. It was, therefore, under the ecclesiastical rule of the Parish of St Mary-Bishophill Junior.

During the reign of Richard II the village was the scene of the murder of a Mayor of York.

In 1644 the 25,000 strong Scottish and Parliament Armies, led by the Earl of Manchester, laid siege to the city of York. To facilitate communications, they built a &quot;Bridge of Boats&quot; at Poppleton. This bridge was eventually taken by Prince Rupert and his Royalist Forces, but he subsequently lost the battle at Marston Moor.

The village benefitted from the growth in the railways in the 19th century, when the York, Knaresborough and Harrogate Railway routed their line through Poppleton and erected a station.

The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the Borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==Governance==
Upper Poppleton lies within the Rural West York ward of the City of York unitary authority. It is a part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer.

Locally there is a Parish Council with eight council members.

==Economy==
The Poppletons were formerly agricultural settlements with many farms, but the modern village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to the nearby towns and cities. It has benefited from its good road and rail links. The village has local retail facilities, including a post office, and some small enterprises.

==Demography==
In the 19th century the population has varied between 284 and 346. The census of 2001 recorded the population as 1,961.

==Community==
There are two allotment sites in the village of Upper Poppleton. One is located at the end of Beech Grove and the other is in Main Street next to the Library. There are eight allotments on the Beech Grove Allotments, each approximately 300 square metres. The land is owned by the Parish Council. Main Street Allotments have seven plots.

There is a Youth Club and Scout Troop in the village.

==Education==
In 1797, local ironmonger John Dodsworth founded a Church of England School. This was converted into accommodation for the School Master when a new building was built in 1850. As of 2010 Poppleton Ousebank Primary provides primary education for both Poppletons.

For secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of York High School on Cornlands Road in nearby Acomb, though the nearest secondary school is Manor CE on Millfield Lane. Manor is a Church of England School and has its own admissions policy separate from the local City Council. It was originally built in 1813 at Kings Manor and has moved several times before being sited in Millfield Lane.

==Transport==

East Yorkshire (bus company) buses run past the village as part of the York to Ripon route.

First York buses operate in the village as part of the Nether Poppleton route to York/Stamford Bridge.

A Park and Ride (Poppleton Bar) was constructed by the A59 in 2015, with Park and Ride buses (route 59) running from Poppleton to York centre, generally every fifteen minutes. In 2020 the site was used as a drive-through COVID-19 testing centre. This has now been reopened as a park and ride.

Northern Rail operates a stopping service on the line between York and Leeds via Harrogate. Poppleton station is the first station after York. Trains from Leeds via Harrogate are billed with Poppleton as the final destination on the boards at Leeds but the train will continue to York.

==Religion==

The old Norman &#x27;Chapel of All Hallows&#x27; in Upper Poppleton was demolished in 1890 to make way for the Victorian All Saints&#x27; Church. The &#x27;new&#x27; church was designed by Hodgson Fowler of Durham.

In 1866, the two Poppleton Parishes were united to form the Parish of Nether Poppleton with Upper Poppleton. All Saints&#x27; Church is situated on The Green in Upper Poppleton.

The present Methodist Chapel on the Green replaced two previous buildings on the site built in 1817 and 1819 respectively.

==Sports==
Poppleton United 1st XI play in York Football League Premier Division, as of 2010, and play next to the Community Centre on Main Street. The 2nd XI play in Reserve Division C. Poppleton Tigers Junior Football Club is located in Nether Poppleton, but serves both villages.

There is a Lawn Tennis Club with artificial and all weather courts in Main Street. As of 2010 the Men&#x27;s 1st and second team play in Division One of the Tyke Petroleum Tennis League and the 3rd team play in Division Six. The Ladies 1st team also compete in the Ladies section of the same League, with the 1st team playing in Division One, the 2nd team in Division Three and the 3rd team in Division Three as of 2010. They also enter five teams in the Mixed Section in Divisions One, Two, Six Eight and Eleven.

<doc id="153620" wikidata="Q2322403" url="?curid=153620" title="New Earswick">
<text>New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire, England, near the River Foss, north of York and south of Haxby. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812, reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census.

The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==History==
The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, &quot;I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities&quot;. The first 28 houses were designed between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

The village had contemporaries such as Bournville, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and others. It presented a sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the 19th century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree&#x27;s report of 1901, entitled &quot;Poverty: a study of town life&quot;. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and insanitary housing.

As a result of the report, Joseph Rowntree&#x27;s conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new &#x27;garden&#x27; village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City.

The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low, but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested. Houses were open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The village was to be a demonstration of good practice.

The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust, which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick, safeguarded generous open green space. All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named. The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick. From 1950 the brickyard, which closed down in the 1930s, was developed into a nature reserve.

Due to their religious beliefs, The Rowntree family decreed there would not be a public house in the village. There never has been, although the Sports Club obtained a drinks licence in the 1980s.

==Governance==

New Earswick is part of the Huntington &amp; New Earswick Ward of the City of York Council. As of 2010 it is represented by Keith Hyman, Keith Orrel and Carol Runciman who are all members of the local Liberal Democrat Party.

A Parish Council was created in 1934 consisting of ten elected councillors and a clerk.

==Community==

There is a local community centre, the Folk Hall, which hosts activities such as keep-fit, yoga, snooker, and a junior youth club. New Earswick has recreational facilities, including a swimming pool currently run by a charitable organisation, the Friends of New Earswick Swimming Pool, tennis courts and football, rugby and cricket pitches at the New Earswick Sports and Social Club. There were two open access play areas close to the Folk Hall, including a hard surface play area which have recently been bulldozed for a development of houses. There is a library based in the Integrated Children&#x27;s Centre at the local primary school, a doctor&#x27;s surgery and a range of shops, including two general stores, a pet shop and Post Office. As of 2017 the Post Office is situated within the Folk Hall.

The village has 36 allotments in two areas, Willow Bank and Sleeper Path.

In the 1960s, the Folk Hall was a live music venue featuring the likes of Procol Harum and Pink Floyd.

==Geography==

The River Foss runs along the eastern boundary of New Earswick with the York to Scarborough Line running to the west. The Nestle factory and grounds mark the southern border with the northern border being the A1237 York Outer Ring Road. The village was built using bricks from the brickworks on the outskirts of the village. From 1950 the brickyard was developed into a nature reserve. The reserve is the home of New Earswick Angling Club, which was formed in 1948.

==Economy==

Unlike the villages of Port Sunlight, Saltaire and Bournville the village was not designed specifically for the workforce of the nearby Joseph Rowntree Cocoa Works although some do earn their living at the factory which was taken over by Swiss firm, Nestle in 1988.

==Transport==

Transdev York operate a bus service that stops in the village as part of the Askham Bar to Clifton Moor route. First Group operate two bus services that stop in the village as part of the Wigginton to Acomb and Haxby to York City Centre routes.

New Earswick was served by Earswick railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1847 and 1965, the station being on the site of The Flag And Whistle pub.

==Education==

There are both primary and secondary schools in New Earswick. New Earswick Primary School was built in 1912. The primary school is one of eight Integrated Children&#x27;s Centres in York. Joseph Rowntree School is a secondary school and was built in 1941. In 2006, the Joseph Rowntree School secured £27million for a complete rebuild that was completed in late 2009. The catchment area for the secondary school is from the village itself, Huntington, The Groves and the villages of Haxby and Wigginton.

==Religious sites==

In 1914 the Anglican church of St Andrew&#x27;s was built on the edge of the parish. The church was extended in 1939 to cater for the new housing in South Huntington just across the River Foss. A Methodist chapel and meeting house for the Society of Friends were added later. St Andrew&#x27;s Church is now part of the ecclesiastical parish of Huntington and New Earswick.

==Sport==

New Earswick Cricket Club play at the recreation ground on White Rose Avenue. As of 2014 their two teams will play in Division 3 (South) and Division 4 (Central) of the York and District Senior Cricket League.

The recreation ground is shared with New Earswick All Blacks, an open age rugby league club that was founded in the 1980s and currently play in The Yorkshire Men&#x27;s League Amateur Rugby League competition, in 2019–20, playing in the Premier Division (the top tier).

Steve Webster, 10 times world champion in the FIM Sidecar World Championship, was born and raised in the village.

It has been in existence since at least the 11th century, and was declared a conservation area in 1978. It is the burial place of the nun Mary Ward.

==History==

It is mentioned three times in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Osboldewic&quot;. It is named after Osbald, an earl in the kingdom of Northumbria. At that time the manor was assessed with the city of York and the lands held by the Church of St Peter, York. It was the first Norman Archbishop of York that created the office of &quot;Prebend of Osbaldwick&quot;. The earliest mention of an incumbent of this office was of &quot;Richard le Brun&quot; in 1270. The office was de facto lord of the manor of the village. In 1852, the Church was allowed to sell off land and Osbaldwick Manor was sold to a Thomas Samuel Watkinson, later the Lord Mayor of York.

The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==Governance==

The village is within the York Outer UK Parliament constituency. It is also part of the Osbaldwick and Derwent Ward within York Unitary Authority.

==Geography==

Osbaldwick is now effectively a suburb of York, about east of the city. The village proper lies mostly along one street called Osbaldwick Village. Newer housing surrounds this and Osbaldwick is now effectively bounded on three sides by the A1079 to the south, the A64 that forms part of York&#x27;s Ring Road) to the east and by green-belt land to the north. To the west, newer housing merges into the Tang Hall district.

Light industrial/trading estates exist to the east of the village heading towards Murton) and along Osbaldwick Link Road which links it to the A1079. A new (2006) housing development built in 2006, known as Murton Gardens, was built by Wimpey Homes on the link road on the site of a farm building and surrounding fields. A development known as Derwenthorpe was granted planning permission on 10 May 2007 for the green-belt land north of the village. Some farmland also exists between Osbaldwick and Murton.

Osbaldwick Beck runs through the village and is part of the tributary system of the River Foss.

===Demography===

The 1881 UK census recorded the population as 340. According to the 2001 UK census the parish had a population of 2,726, of whom 2,299 were over the age of sixteen years and 1,115 of those were in employment. There were 1,200 dwellings of which 364 were detached.
==Transport==

Between 1913 and 1926 Osbaldwick was served by a station on the Derwent Valley Light Railway. This line remained open to freight until 1981, and in 1992, Sustrans converted the trackbed into National Cycle Route 66 from the village into York.
Osbaldwick is also served by two bus routes operated by First York on their service 6 between Clifton Moor and University Campus East and Transdev York on their service 20 between Rawcliffe and Osbaldwick (Limited service frequency).

==Landmarks==

The village is home to Osbaldwick Hall, a Grade II Listed Building, and to the 12th century St Thomas&#x27; Church.

Eliza Raine (1793–1860) is buried in St. Thomas cemetery. Raine was the first partner to the celebrated English landowner and diarist Anne Lister.

==Facilities==

Education in the village is provided by Osbaldwick Primary School, and most pupils transfer after Year 6 to Archbishop Holgate&#x27;s School.

The village post office closed in July 2003.

===Derwent Arms===

The Derwent Arms, in the old part of the village, was built in 1823 when it was known as The Black Bull. It consisted of the main pub house and a stable for two horses with a granary over it. To the right were two cow houses with a small orchard and pig pen behind. In front of this was another outbuilding. In the early years the pub had a wash house. Later, a long cattle shed for eight to nine cows was added onto the west side of the stable. It was later renamed The Derwent Arms after the Derwent Valley Light Railway which used to run through the village. It currently consists of a rendered brick building with the public rooms on the ground floor and accommodation for the owners above. The pub has a large field which is used to host community events such as the village fair and a bonfire night.

The Magnet pub, near the newer houses on Osbaldwick Lane, closed in 2018.

==Religion==
The Church of England parish church dedicated to St Thomas originally dates from the 12th century. Windows in the north wall date from the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries. The church has been reordered and extended on a number of occasions, notably in 1877 by John Oldrid Scott and by later architects in both 1967 and 2005.

The Rev. William Ball Wright, noted genealogist and one of the first SPG Anglican missionaries to Japan, served as vicar of the parish from 1903 to 1912.

A window in the church is a memorial to former Sheriff and Lord Mayor of York, James Barber. It is the burial place of the Roman Catholic nun Mary Ward, who founded the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as the Sisters of Loreto. The Church registers show that a Dorothy Paston Bedingfield, a superior of the order, was also buried here.

<doc id="153623" wikidata="Q2378275" url="?curid=153623" title="Strensall">
<text>Strensall is a village in the Strensall with Towthorpe civil parish in the unitary authority of the City of York in North Yorkshire, England, on the River Foss north of York and north-east of Haxby. In 2001 the parish had a population of 3,815. It covers an area of 2,908 acres.

The village was historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the district of Ryedale in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority. On 1 April 2009 the parish was abolished and merged with Towthorpe to form &quot;Strensall with Towthorpe&quot;.

The nearby Strensall Common is a Special Area of Conservation, an example of lowland heathland habitat covering over 5 km2. The southern part is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Strensall also has an army firing range and training area both of which belong to the Ministry of Defence.

==History==

Strensall is referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Streonaeshalch&quot;, after &quot;Streona&quot;, a personal name, and &quot;halch&quot;, a corner of land. The name has altered through the centuries from Strenshale in the 11th century, to Stranessale in the 14th century and to Strencile or Strencham alias Trencham in the 17th century.

It has belonged to the Archbishops of York since before 1214, apart from a short period in 1547 when it was briefly held by the Duke of Somerset and Lord Wharton. During the reign of Edward the Confessor the manor and land belonged to a couple of Saxon lords known as Sasford and Turchil.

Strensall is also the possible site of many historical events supposed to have occurred in Whitby, most significantly the Synod of Whitby of 664. This is due to a complication in 9th-century documents, which describe Streonaeshalch as being Whitby (the name &quot;Whitby&quot; is Viking as are all place names ending with the suffix &quot;by&quot;, e.g. &quot;Selby&quot;, &quot;Grimsby&quot;, &quot;Wetherby&quot; etc. – &quot;by&quot; means &quot;town&quot; in Scandinavian languages, from the verb &quot;bo&quot;, meaning &quot;to reside&quot;).

The Hall with its moat and large grounds were to the north of the church. On the same site probably stood the manor-house of 1649 and 1757 which also had a moat.

To the south of the village lies Strensall Camp, formed by the War Office in 1884 for training troops and now known as Queen Elizabeth Barracks.

==Demography==

The 1881 census records the population as being 446. According to the 2011 census the parish had a population of 6,047.

==Governance==

Strensall was in the Ryedale parliamentary constituency until the 2010 general election when it was transferred to the newly created constituency of York Outer.

Strensall forms its own ward in the City of York Council, together with the villages of Stockton-on-the-Forest and Earswick. As of May 2023, it is represented by Tony Fisher and Paul Healey of the Liberal Democrats.

The village is part of the Strensall with Towthorpe Parish Council. There are 14 councillors in total.

==Geography==

The soil is sand and foxmole laid over a subsoil of white and grey sandstone. The land lies for the most part about 50 ft above sea level. The River Foss flows from the north-east of the village in a south and south-westerly direction towards Towthorpe. It is crossed by three bridges. About a quarter of a mile east of the village is the disused Strensall station on the York and Scarborough branch of the North Eastern railway.

===Strensall Common===
Strensall Common lies to the east of the village and forms part of the surrounding lowland heath. There are a number of different habitats, such as wet heath, dry heath and birch/oak woodland with areas of standing water. There are over 150 plant species including, marsh cinquefoil, marsh gentian, round-leaved sundew and petty whin.

There are over 60 species of bird including curlew, stonechat, whinchat, and both green and great spotted woodpecker. Amongst the numerous insects to be found are green and purple hairstreaks, the dark-bordered beauty, bog bush cricket and glowworm. Other wildlife seen here include red fox, European hare and harvest mouse. Hebridean sheep and Highland cattle graze during summer to keep down vegetation.

The site is maintained by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.

==Economy==
In the 19th century employment was found in a tannery in the village. There were also the Strensall Pottery and Britannia Pottery near the village. Though there is some employment at the local Barracks, the village is mostly a dormitory for commuters to nearby York.

==Transport==

First York operate a service through the village as part of the York City Centre to Strensall route (Number 5 and 5a).

There are three level crossings within Strensall as it lies on the York to Scarborough line but there is no station any more. Strensall railway station was a minor railway station serving the village. It was opened on 5 July 1845 by the York &amp; North Midland Railway and closed on 22 September 1930.

==Community==

Strensall has three local grocery shops plus a post office, three pubs, a bakery, a hairdressers, a fish &amp; chip shop and Chinese takeaway. It also has a library and a medical centre. Its sports facilities include 2 playing fields, one with changing rooms; three floodlit tennis courts; two football pitches and one astro pitch and five small parks. There are 20 half plot allotments on New Lane run by the council and were established in 2008. There are also 14 plots run by the Parish Council on Northfield Lane.
==Religious sites==

A Wesleyan chapel existing in Strensall from 1823 was succeeded by a new building in 1895. Between 1879 and 1889 a Primitive Methodist chapel was built in the village.

The Parish Church of Strensall is St Mary the Virgin. The current building was consecrated by the Archbishop of York in 1866 after the old building, originally dedicated to St James, was destroyed about 1798 or 1800. There are also the Methodist Chapel and St Wilfred&#x27;s Garrison Church.

==Education==

Strensall falls within the secondary education catchment areas for Huntington School in the northern outskirts of York. Robert Wilkinson is the local primary school and was founded in 1718 from money left by a local farmer of that name. It moved to its present location on West End in 1972.

==Sports==

Strensall is the home of the York Golf Club. Strensall Football Club 1XI play in Division Two of the York and District Football League.

<text>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, also known as the IUCN Red List or Red Data Book, founded in 1964, is an inventory of the global conservation status and extinction risk of biological species. A series of Regional Red Lists, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit, are also produced by countries and organizations.

The goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.

Major species assessors include BirdLife International, the Institute of Zoology (the research division of the Zoological Society of London), the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, and many Specialist Groups within the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.

The IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated at least every ten years, and every five years if possible. This is done in a peer reviewed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups (SSC), which are Red List Authorities (RLA) responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of BirdLife International, an entire class (Aves). The red list unit works with staff from the IUCN Global Species Programme as well as current program partners to recommend new partners or networks to join as new Red List Authorities.

The number of species which have been assessed for the Red List has been increasing over time. of 150,388 species surveyed, 42,108 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular overfishing, hunting, and land development.

==History==
The idea for a Red Data Book was suggested by Peter Scott in 1963.

=== 1966–1977 Red Data Lists ===
Initially the Red Data Lists were designed for specialists and were issued in a loose-leaf format that could be easily changed.

The first two volumes of Red Lists were published in 1966 by conservationist Noel Simon, one for mammals and one for birds.

The third volume that appeared covered reptiles and amphibians. It was created by René E. Honegger in 1968.

In 1970, the IUCN published its fifth volume in this series. This was the first Red Data List which focused on plants (angiosperms only), compiled by Ronald Melville.

The final volume of Red Data List created in the older, loose leaf style was volume 4 on freshwater fishes. This was published in 1979 by Robert Rush Miller.

=== 1969 Red Data Book ===
The first attempt to create a Red Data Book for a nonspecialist public came in 1969 with &quot;The Red Book: Wildlife in Danger&quot;. This book covered varies groups but was predominantly about mammals and birds, with smaller sections on reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and plants.

===2006 release===
The 2006 Red List, released on 4 May 2006 evaluated 40,168 species as a whole, plus an additional 2,160 subspecies, varieties, aquatic stocks, and subpopulations.

===2007 release===
On 12 September 2007, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) released the 2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In this release, they have raised their classification of both the western lowland gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla gorilla&quot;) and the Cross River gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla diehli&quot;) from endangered to critically endangered, which is the last category before extinct in the wild, due to Ebola virus and poaching, along with other factors. Russ Mittermeier, chief of Swiss-based IUCN&#x27;s Primate Specialist Group, stated that 16,306 species are endangered with extinction, 188 more than in 2006 (total of 41,415 species on the Red List). The Red List includes the Sumatran orangutan (&quot;Pongo abelii&quot;) in the Critically Endangered category and the Bornean orangutan (&quot;Pongo pygmaeus&quot;) in the Endangered category.

===2008 release===
The 2008 Red List was released on 6 October 2008 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Barcelona and &quot;confirmed an extinction crisis, with almost one in four [mammals] at risk of disappearing forever&quot;. The study shows at least 1,141 of the 5,487 mammals on Earth are known to be threatened with extinction, and 836 are listed as Data Deficient.

===2012 release===
The Red List of 2012 was released 19 July 2012 at Rio+20 Earth Summit; nearly 2,000 species were added, with 4 species to the extinct list, 2 to the rediscovered list. The IUCN assessed a total of 63,837 species which revealed 19,817 are threatened with extinction. 3,947 were described as &quot;critically endangered&quot; and 5,766 as &quot;endangered&quot;, while more than 10,000 species are listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot;. At threat are 41% of amphibian species, 33% of reef-building corals, 30% of conifers, 25% of mammals, and 13% of birds. The IUCN Red List has listed 132 species of plants and animals from India as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;.

==Categories==

Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups, specified through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation. There is an emphasis on the acceptability of applying any criteria in the absence of high quality data including suspicion and potential future threats, &quot;so long as these can reasonably be supported&quot;.
*Extinct (EX) – beyond reasonable doubt that the species is no longer extant.
*Extinct in the wild (EW) – survives only in captivity, cultivation and/or outside native range, as presumed after exhaustive surveys.
*Critically endangered (CR) – in a particularly and extremely critical state.
*Endangered (EN) – very high risk of extinction in the wild, meets any of criteria A to E for Endangered.
*Vulnerable (VU) – meets one of the 5 Red List criteria and thus considered to be at high risk of unnatural (human-caused) extinction without further human intervention.
*Near Threatened (NT) – close to being endangered in the near future.
*Lower Risk (LR) – unlikely to become endangered or extinct in the near future.
*Data Deficient (DD) 
*Not Evaluated (NE)

In the IUCN Red List, &quot;threatened&quot; embraces the categories of Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable.

===1994 categories and 2001 framework===
The older 1994 list has only a single &quot;Lower Risk&quot; category which contained three subcategories:

*Conservation Dependent (LR/cd)
*Near Threatened (LR/nt)
*Least Concern (LR/lc)

In the 2001 framework, &quot;Near Threatened&quot; and &quot;Least Concern&quot; became their own categories, while &quot;Conservation Dependent&quot; was removed and its contents merged into &quot;Near Threatened&quot;.

===Possibly extinct===
The tag of &quot;possibly extinct&quot; (PE) is used by Birdlife International, the Red List Authority for birds for the IUCN Red List. BirdLife International has recommended PE become an official tag for Critically Endangered species, and this has now been adopted, along with a &quot;Possibly Extinct in the Wild&quot; tag for species with populations surviving in captivity but likely to be extinct in the wild.

==Versions==

There have been a number of versions, dating from 1991, including:

* Version 1.0 (1991)
* Version 2.0 (1992)
* Version 2.1 (1993)
* Version 2.2 (1994) 
* Version 2.3 (1994)
* Version 3.0 (1999)
* Version 3.1 (2001)

All new IUCN assessments since 2001 have used version 3.1 of the categories and criteria.

==Criticism==
In 1997, the IUCN Red List received criticism on the grounds of secrecy (or at least poor documentation) surrounding the sources of its data. These allegations have led to efforts by the IUCN to improve its documentation and data quality, and to include peer reviews of taxa on the Red List. The list is also open to petitions against its classifications, on the basis of documentation or criteria.

In the November 2002 issue of &quot;Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution&quot;, an article suggested that the IUCN Red List and similar works are prone to misuse by governments and other groups that draw possibly inappropriate conclusions on the state of the environment or to affect exploitation of natural resources.

In the November 2016 issue of &quot;Science Advances&quot;, a research article claims there are serious inconsistencies in the way species are classified by the IUCN. The researchers contend that the IUCN&#x27;s process of categorization is &quot;out-dated, and leaves room for improvement&quot;, and further emphasize the importance of readily available and easy-to-include geospatial data, such as satellite and aerial imaging. Their conclusion questioned not only the IUCN&#x27;s method but also the validity of where certain species fall on the List. They believe that combining geographical data can significantly increase the number of species that need to be reclassified to a higher risk category.

<doc id="153626" wikidata="Q399653" url="?curid=153626" title="RCA connector">
<text>The RCA connector is a type of electrical connector commonly used to carry audio and video signals. The name &quot;RCA&quot; derives from the company Radio Corporation of America, which introduced the design in the 1930s. The connector’s male plug and female jack are called RCA plug and RCA jack.

It is also called RCA phono connector or phono connector. The word &quot;phono&quot; in &quot;phono connector&quot; is an abbreviation of the word &quot;phonograph&quot;, because this connector was originally created to allow the connection of a phonograph turntable to a radio receiver. RCA jacks are often used in phono inputs, a set of input jacks usually located on the rear panel of a preamp, mixer or amplifier, especially on early radio sets, to which a phonograph or turntable is attached. 

In some European countries such as France and Germany, the name &quot;cinch&quot; is still used as an antonomasia of the Chicago-based manufacturer Cinch, for such a connector and socket.

==History==

The exact release date of this connector is still a little vague. The following dates were derived from historical RCA documentation.

By no later than 1937, RCA introduced this connector. In 1937, it was used inside a RCA model U-109 radio-phonograph and model R-97 phonograph. In the U-109, the internal amplifier chassis had female connectors which accepted male cables from the internal radio chassis and built-in phonograph player. Originally, the concept was intended as an easy method to unhook sources while troubleshooting the console during servicing.

By no later than 1938, RCA migrated the female connector to the rear panel of many of their desktop AM radio models to allow customers an easy method to attach an external phonograph or television at a later date. The connector was labeled on the back of radio with one of the following terms: &quot;Victrola&quot;, &quot;Phono&quot;, &quot;Pick-up&quot;, &quot;Television&quot;. RCA later marketed a special turntable for 45 RPM records, the model 9JY.

In 1939, RCA introduced two radio-television floor consoles (TRK-9, TRK-12) which used the same internal connection concept but the audio output of the television chassis was connected to the radio/amplifier chassis via a male to male cable. Three lower-cost 1939 television models had an audio output connector on their rear panel instead of an integrated amplifier and speaker: RCA TT-5, Westinghouse WRT-700, GE HM-171.

In the 1950s, RCA connectors began to replace the older phone connectors for many other applications in the consumer audio world when component high-fidelity systems started becoming popular during the transistor revolution. Refinement of the RCA connectors came with later designs, although they remained compatible.

In the 1980s, some computer monitors and TVs had a RCA jack for composite video input. Later, some televisions had RCA jacks for audio and video out or component video inputs.

==Other uses==

In the most normal use, cables have a standard plug on each end, consisting of a central male connector, surrounded by a ring. The ring is often segmented to provide spring gripping pressure when mated. Devices mount the socket (female jack), consisting of a central hole with a ring of metal around it. The ring on the jack is slightly smaller in diameter and longer than the ring on the plug, allowing the plug&#x27;s ring to fit tightly over it. The jack has a small area between the outer and inner rings which is filled with an insulator, typically plastic (very early versions, or those made for use as RF connectors, used ceramic).

The RCA connector was initially used for audio signals. As with many other connectors, it has been adopted for uses other than originally intended, including as a DC power connector, an RF connector, and as a connector for loudspeaker cables. Its use as a connector for composite video signals is extremely common but provides poor impedance matching: there is neither a standard for plug impedance, nor is it feasible to provide a true match to 75 Ω due to plug dimensions. RCA connectors and cable are also commonly used to carry S/PDIF-formatted digital audio, with plugs colored orange to differentiate them from other typical connections.

Connections are made by pushing the cable&#x27;s plug into the female jack on the device. The signal-carrying pin protrudes from the plug, and often comes into contact with the socket before the grounded rings meet, resulting in loud hum or buzz if the audio components do not share a common ground and are powered while making connections. Continuous noise can occur if the plug partially falls out of the jack, breaking the ground connection but not the signal. Some variants of the plug, especially cheaper versions, also give very poor grip and contact between the ground sheaths due to their lack of spring action.

They are often color-coded, yellow for composite video, red for the right audio channel, and white or black for the left channel of stereo audio. This trio (or pair) of jacks can often be found on the back of audio and video equipment. One or more sets are often found on TV sets to facilitate connection of camcorders, other portable video sources and video game consoles. Although nearly all connectors, including analog and S/PDIF audio as well as composite and component video, can use identical 75 Ω cables, sales of special-purpose cables for each use have proliferated. Varying cable quality means that a cheap line-level audio cable might not successfully transfer component video. For digital audio, as long as a connection is successfully made using the cables the sound will remain faithful to the original signal because a digital signal can only be fully received or not received at all. Cables should meet the S/PDIF specification as defined by the international standard IEC 60958-3 for assured performance.

The male plug has a center pin that is in diameter, and is surrounded by an outer shell that is in diameter.

==Disadvantages==
When connecting the male into the female, the inner, &quot;hot&quot; (signal) connection is made before the ground connection has been guaranteed; this often produces a loud buzz if the equipment is active when the connection is made.

The hot signal wire and signal ground provided by an RCA connection implement an unbalanced connection. A true balanced connection is generally preferred in certain applications, particularly professional settings because it allows for the use of long cables while reducing susceptibility to external noise.

Using RCA connectors, each signal requires its own plug. Even the simple case of attaching a cassette deck may need four of themtwo for stereo input and two for stereo output. In any common setup this quickly leads to a disarray of cables and confusion in how to connect them. This situation is made worse if one considers more complex signals like component video (a total of three for video and two for analog audio – or one for digital coaxial audio).

There have been attempts to introduce combined audio/video connectors for direct signals, but in the analog realm none of these has ever become common, with the exception of Europe where the SCART connector was very successful. For a time the 5-pin DIN connector was popular for bi-directional stereo connection between A/V equipment, but it has been entirely displaced on modern consumer devices. Though RF modulators inherently transmit combined A/V signals in video applications, they depend on broadcast television systems and RF connectors which are not universal worldwide; RF signals are also generally inferior to direct signals due to protocol conversion and the RF limitations of the three major analog TV systems (NTSC, PAL and SECAM).

Before HD television became a standard, nearly all TV sets, VCRs, and DVD players sold in Europe had SCART connectors, although these were sometimes supplemented by RCA and/or RF connectors. SCART–RCA adapters also exist, which usually allow input of composite video and stereo audio. Outside Europe, separate RCA connectors are usually used, supplemented by RF connectors for backward compatibility and simplicity. Although mini-DIN connectors are used for S-Video connections, composite video, component video, and analog audio (mono or stereo) all use RCA connectors unless the signals are sent via SCART. In the digital realm, however, combined A/V connectors are gaining ground: HDMI is commonly used today for consumer electronics; and DisplayPort, a potential competitor to HDMI, is often found on home computers and peripherals.

==Color coding in consumer equipment==

Plugs and sockets on consumer equipment are conventionally color-coded to aid correct connections. The standard colors for the various signals are shown in the table below; however, beyond 7.1 audio, the standard has degraded to a more general white/yellow, red/blue, and green/yellow color scheme for each cable respectively.

Stereo audio applications use either black and red, grey and red, or white and red RCA connectors; in all three cases, red denotes right. White or purple may also be replaced by black. Some older tape recorders, and equipment like receivers designed to connect to them, use a 5-pin DIN connector to connect left and right for record and playback with a single cable. Adapters between this connector and RCA connectors have used white and red for left and right channel recording, and blue (or sometimes black) and yellow for playback, but this is not universal. Most modern equipment with RCA connectors for recording devices simply uses white and red for all stereo pairs, whether record or playback.

While these are the standard colors found on commercially made products, cables with different-colored connectors may be used, as long as the cable itself is compatible with the application (for example, cables with 75 ohms impedance for video and S/PDIF).

<text>Zamość (; ; ) is a historical city in southeastern Poland. It is situated in the southern part of Lublin Voivodeship, about from Lublin, from Warsaw. In 2021, the population of Zamość was 62,021.

Zamość was founded in 1580 by Jan Zamoyski, Grand Chancellor of Poland, who envisioned an ideal city. The historical centre of Zamość was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992, following a decision of the sixteenth ordinary session of the World Heritage Committee, held between 7 and 14 December 1992 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States; it was recognized for being &quot;a unique example of a Renaissance town in Central Europe&quot;.

Zamość is about from the Roztocze National Park.

==History==
Zamość was founded in 1580 by the Chancellor and Hetman (head of the army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), Jan Zamoyski, on the trade route linking western and northern Europe with the Black Sea. Modelled on Italian trading cities, and built during the late-renaissance period by the Paduan architect Bernardo Morando, Zamość remains a perfect example of a Renaissance town of the late 16th century. It retains its original street layout, fortifications (Zamość Fortress), and a large number of original buildings blending Venetian and central European architectural traditions.

In the 16th century, the city thrived during its most extensive and fastest period of development. It attracted not only Poles but also other nationalities. In 1594, Jan Zamoyski founded the Zamoyski Academy in Zamość. The city, however, faced numerous invasions, including a Cossack siege led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the leader of the uprising against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648–1654), and another siege during the Swedish Deluge in 1656. The Swedish army, like the Cossacks, failed to capture the city. Only during the Great Northern War was Zamość occupied, by Swedish and Saxon troops.

In the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the city was annexed by the Habsburg monarchy, forming part of the newly established Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria; the kingdom became a crown land of the Austrian Empire upon its formation in 1804. Following the Austro-Polish War of 1809 the city was incorporated into the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. The 17th Polish Infantry Regiment was formed in Zamość in 1809. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna dissolved the duchy and made Zamość part of the Kingdom of Poland, also called Congress Poland, which was controlled by the Russian Empire. The city played a considerable role during the November Uprising in 1830–1831 and surrendered as the last Polish resistance point. The fortress was demolished in 1866, allowing the rapid growth of the city beyond its original limits. During the final stages of World War I, in 1918, local Poles liberated the city from foreign occupation, shortly before Poland officially regained independence.

===World War II===
In September 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, German Luftwaffe planes bombed Zamość several times. Over 250 people were killed, mainly civilians. In early September 1939, the Polish government evacuated a portion of the Polish gold reserve from Warsaw to Zamość, and then further southeast to Śniatyn at the Poland-Romania border, from where it was transported via Romania and Turkey to territory controlled by Polish-allied France. The city was overrun by the Germans during the invasion of Poland and the local garrison, staffed by the Polish infantry regiment of &quot;podpułkownik&quot; Stanisław Gumowski, was defeated. On September 27, 1939, Nazi Germany signed a border treaty with the Soviet Union which had invaded Poland from the east, and, consequently, on September 28, 1939, Zamość was handed over to the Red Army – for about a week. The Soviets withdrew on October 5, 1939, along with some 5,000 Jews after a further demarcation line adjustment. The Germans returned to the city on October 8, 1939 and shortly afterwards mass arrests of prominent citizens began. This was as part of the secret A-B Action, the deliberate extermination of Polish intellectuals. The German Nazis created an execution site in the Zamość Rotunda, Gestapo camp, (in German: &quot;Gefangenen-Durchgangslager Sicherheitspol&quot;, in English: &quot;The transit camp for Security Police prisoners&quot;). More than 8,000 people were massacred there, including displaced residents of the region. In Zamość, Nazi Germans also created a &quot;Transit Camp&quot; on Okrzei Street, for arrested and displaced inhabitants of the Zamość region (including thousands of children) and camps of Soviet prisoners of war captured during Operation Barbarossa.
In 1942, Zamość County, due to its fertile black soil, was chosen for further German colonization in the General Government as part of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, with the new name of &quot;Himmlerstadt&quot;, after Heinrich Himmler. The name was later changed to Pflugstadt (Plow City), a reference to the German &quot;plow&quot; that was to &quot;plow the East&quot;. Neither name endured.

Local people resisted the German occupiers with great determination; they escaped into the forests, organised self-defence, gave help to those who were expelled, and rescued kidnapped Polish children from German hands by bribery (see Zamość Uprising). The Nazis found it difficult to find many families suitable for settlement in the area, and those who did settle often fled in fear, because the former Polish residents would burn down houses or kill their inhabitants.

In 1942–1943, tens of thousands of inhabitants of the region were ethnically cleansed by the Nazi occupiers, to make space for German settlers in order to ensure Germanisation of the area. Most former inhabitants were deported to forced labor camps in Germany, Nazi concentration camps or extermination camps such as Auschwitz, Majdanek and Bełżec.

===Post-war period===

After World War II, Zamość began a period of development. In the 1970s and 1980s the population grew rapidly (from 39,100 in 1975 to 68,800 in 2003), as the city started to gain significant profits from the old trade routes linking Germany with Ukraine and the ports on the Black Sea. During the years 1975–1998 Zamość was the capital of Zamość Voivodeship.

===Jewish Community===

The Qahal of Zamość was founded in 1588 when Jan Zamoyski agreed to Jewish settlement in the city. The first Jewish settlers were mainly Sephardi Jews coming from Italy, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. In the 17th century, Ashkenazi Jews also settled in the city and soon became the majority of the Jewish population. The settlement rights given by Jan Zamoyski were re-confirmed in 1684 by Marcin Zamoyski, the fourth Ordynat of the Zamość estate.
At the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Jewish inhabitants were influenced by the Jewish Enlightenment, or Haskalah. Rabbis forbade the entry of Hasids into Zamosc, until the late nineteenth century. In Zamość there was a Jewish synagogue, two houses of worship, a ritual bathhouse, a hospital and a slaughterhouse. The best preserved remnant of the Jewish community is the now restored Zamość Synagogue. Zamość was home to many prominent Jews, including poet Solomon Ettinger (1799–1855) and writer Isaac Leib Peretz. In 1827, 2,874 Jews lived in the city and this had risen by 1900 to 7,034. The increase continued, so that by 1921 the Jewish population stood at 9,383 (49.3% of the total population), including significant landowners within the city.

On the eve of World War II, more than 12,500 Jews lived in Zamość; 43 percent of the population of 28,100. Soon after the handing over to the Germans by the Soviet Union on October 8, 1939, the Nazis instituted the Judenrat, through which to control the Jews, and in December 1939 created an open ghetto in the Nowa Osada neighbourhood.

Jews deported from the newly formed &quot;Warthegau&quot; province in German-annexed western Poland were transported to Zamość and in April 1941 the ghetto was moved to the New Town and 7,000 Jews were ordered to relocate there. The ghetto was not enclosed and many Jews escaped to the Soviet Union. It was liquidated before the end of November 1942; deportations had begun in April, with some 3,000 Jews sent to the Bełżec extermination camp in a Holocaust train consisting of 30 cattle cars. In October, the Nazis shot 500 Jews in the streets and deported 4,000 Jewish prisoners via the Izbica Ghetto transfer point to Bełżec for gassing. They were transported without any food or water. Although the distance was relatively short, the transports would take several days, and many died en route. The secret Polish Council to Aid Jews &quot;Żegota&quot;, established by the Polish resistance movement operated in the city.

==Architecture==
Most historic buildings are located in the Old Town, whose main distinguishing features have been retained. It includes the regular Great Market Square (&quot;Rynek Wielki&quot;) of 100 x 100 metres with the splendid Town Hall (&quot;Ratusz&quot;) and the so-called &quot;Armenian houses&quot;, as well as fragments of the original fortress and fortifications, including those of the Russian occupation in the 19th century. (The destroyed sections of fortifications have been largely rebuilt to restore the city&#x27;s appearance.)
It is often called &quot;the new Padua&quot;.

Jan Zamoyski commissioned the Venetian (from Padua) architect Bernardo Morando to design the city, based upon the anthropomorphic concept. Its &quot;head&quot; was to be the Zamoyski Palace, &quot;backbone&quot; Grodzka Street, crossing the Great Market Square from east to west, in the direction of the palace, and with the &quot;arms&quot; embodied by 10 streets intersecting the main streets: Solna Street (north of the Great Market Square) and Bernardo Morando Street (south of the Great Market Square). In these streets, the other squares were placed: Salt Square (&quot;Rynek Solny&quot;) and Water Square (&quot;Rynek Wodny&quot;), functioning as the &quot;internal organs&quot; of the city whereas the bastions are the &quot;hands and legs&quot; for self-defence.

The most prominent building is the Town Hall, built at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, following Bernardo Morando&#x27;s design. In 1639–1651, Jan Jaroszewicz and Jan Wolff redesigned the structure. They enlarged the edifice and added three storeys with a high parapet. The façades were built in accordance with Mannerist proportions, regular divisions and excessive architectural décor. The 18th century witnessed the construction of a guardroom and a fan-shaped double stairway, built in front of the building. In 1770 a slender dome with a lantern was added to the top of the tower.

The Town Hall stands on the north side of the Great Market Square, regarded as one of the most beautiful 16th-century squares in Europe. It is surrounded by a complex of arcaded houses built by the richest Zamość merchants. It is a square, measuring exactly 100 metres in both width and length, crossed by the two main axes of the old town. The 600-metre longitudinal axis goes east–west: from Bastion No. 7 to the Zamoyski Palace. The 400-metre crosswise axis goes north–south, linking the Great Market Square with the two smaller market squares: Solny and Wodny.

The red &quot;Under the Angel&quot; House at 26 Ormiańska street (Armenian street) was built in the early 1630s by a rich Armenian merchant, Gabriel Bartoszewicz. It is embellished with a carved figure of the founder&#x27;s saint patron, the Archangel Gabriel holding a lily. The walls of the second floor are decorated with lions and a dragon, illustrating that the lions should protect the house against the evil embodied by the dragon. The house is the seat of the Zamość Museum.

The brightly coloured houses are vital to the square&#x27;s character. The yellow &quot;Under The Madonna&quot; House at 22 Ormiańska street (Armenian Street) features the Madonna with the baby Jesus; showing the Madonna standing on a dragon. Built by a Lwów merchant, Sołtan Sachwelowicz, in the 17th century, the house has been refurbished recently to expose its façade. A high parapet has been reconstructed on the basis of old photographs. At present the house is the venue of the Bernardo Morando Fine Arts State Secondary School.

The &quot;Under St. Casimir&quot; House was erected in the 17th century and was owned alternately by Polish chemists and Armenian merchants. The façade of the house is embellished with a figure of St. Casimir, the saint patron of the new owner – Kazimierz Lubecki.

Built at the beginning of the 17th century, the green Wilczek House at 30 Ormiańska Street (Armenian Street) displays a Baroque decor, including a relief featuring St. John the Baptist and St. Thomas the Apostle with three spears. The house was remodelled in 1665–1674 by Jan Wilczek, a town councillor.

The blue &quot;Under The Married Couple&quot; House, also known as the &quot;Sapphire&quot; House, at 24 Ormiańska street (Armenian Street) was built in the second quarter of the 17th century by an Armenian merchant, Torosz. The façade includes a geometrical and plant frieze whereas the parapet is decorated with grotesque figures of a married couple.

The Link House at 5 Rynek Wielki street (Great Market Street) was erected at the end of the 17th century with all the features of the Baroque style. A Polish architect Jan Michał Link decorated the façade of the house with fluted Ionic columns. The tops of the windows were embellished with the carved busts of two mythological warriors: Minerva wearing a basinet and Hercules dressed in lion skins. Under the windows there is a frieze featuring laurel and palm branches – symbols of glory and victory. The pilasters include wall-trophies – weapons and armours.

Called also the &quot;Chemist&#x27;s House&quot;, the Piechowicz House maintains a 350-year-old tradition. Namely the building, which was built by Szymon Piechowicz from Turobin, a chemist and a professor of medicine at the Zamoyski Academy, still houses a pharmacy. The shop is fitted with a set of 19th-century dark, oak cabinets.

Constructed by Bernardo Morando for an Italian merchant in the 1590s, also called the Telanowski house, the Zamoyski house belonged to Jan Zamoyski (1599–1657). The house has four arcades, a frieze placed under the windows and a parapet. It was supposed to be a model for other houses located on the square.

The construction of the Second Morando Tenement House started around 1590. It was designed by Bernardo Morando who placed Italian-style regular four-window façade with arcades. The windows are ornamented by a frieze with rosettes. Another frieze is situated on the side wall, showing a combination of rectangles and ovals.

The Abrek House was built for a professor of the Zamoyski Academy, Stanisław Rosiński. In 1636 the house was bought by another professor of the Zamoyski Academy, Andrzej Abrek who turned it into a splendid edifice with an arcaded portal, triangular top and three stone doors in the hallway.

Built at the end of the 16th century, the Szczebrzeszyn House belonged to the town of Szczebrzeszyn. Its function was to keep Szczebrzeszyn&#x27;s treasures and assets safely within the protection of Zamość fortress. The house has four windows, arcades and a richly ornamented finial in the form of a cartouche, which reputedly enclosed Szczebrzeszyn&#x27;s coat of arms.

Built, the Turobin House was built in the 1600s in line with Bernardo Morando&#x27;s design for the town of Turobin which used to be part of Zamość Entail. It is embellished with many Renaissance decorations based on Italian models taken from Sebastiano Serlio&#x27;s books. Its façade has a frieze featuring a system of geometrical figures.

The cathedral (a former collegiate church until 1992) was founded by Jan Zamoyski and dedicated to the Lord&#x27;s Resurrection and St. Thomas the Apostle. It was built in 1587–1598 by Bernardo Morando. It is 45 metres long and 30 metres wide; the Cathedral constitutes one of the most impressive sacral buildings in Poland. Full of numerous side chapels, thin pillars and a fine vaulted presbytery, it prides itself in original interior decor and rich Renaissance decorations, an 18th-century Rococo tabernacle and many paintings of Italian and Polish painters. In the church&#x27;s vault, there are crypts with the ashes of 16 Zamość entailers and those of their families.

Built in the Baroque style in the second half of the 18th century, the Cathedral Bell Tower is a separate and prominent structure. It was erected to Jerzy de Kawe&#x27;s design. The passageway is decorated with plaques commemorating the martyrdom of the inhabitants of Zamość Region during World War II. In the bell tower there are three historic bells: &quot;Jan&quot; – the biggest and the oldest one, named after its benefactor Jan &quot;Sobiepan&quot; Zamoyski, &quot;Tomasz&quot; founded by Tomasz Józef Zamoyski in 1721 and &quot;Wawrzyniec&quot; founded by Wawrzyniec Sikorski in 1715.

The Redemptorists&#x27; Church of St. Nicholas is the former Orthodox church built in 1618–1631. The project was drafted by Jan Jaroszewicz whereas the decorations were designed by Jan Wolff. The domed temple had a defensive purpose. In the 1690s a tower with a Baroque dome was added. The building has features typical of Moldavian Orthodox churches and Latin architecture.

Built in the 1680s in the Baroque style in line with J. M. Link&#x27;s design, St. Catherine&#x27;s Church was first dedicated to Saint Peter of Alcantara but in the 1920s it became an academic church dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During World War II, the &quot;Prussian Homage&quot; (; 1879−1882), the famous historical painting of Prussian Tribute, by Jan Matejko, was transferred secretly from Kraków and hidden in the vault of St. Catherine&#x27;s to protect it from the German occupiers.

Tomasz Zamoyski, the second entailer, and his wife Katarzyna built the Franciscan Church Dedicated to The Annunciation in the Baroque style. The biggest temple in Zamość (56 metres long and 29 metres wide), it was regarded as one of the most prominent 17th-century churches in Poland. It was embellished with a very rich décor by Jan Michał Link. In 1784 the Austrians closed down the Franciscan Order and as a result the church lost its sacral function for many years, housing a cinema and secondary school. In 1993 the building was restored as a church again.

==Education==

Zamość prides itself in the long history of educational services. The Zamoyski Academy (1594–1784) was an academy founded in 1594 by Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski. It was the third institution of higher education to be founded in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The academy was an institution midway between a secondary school and an institution of higher learning that bestowed doctorates of philosophy and law. It was known for the high quality of education that it provided, which however did not extend beyond the ideals of &quot;nobles&quot;&#x27; liberty.

After Zamoyski&#x27;s death, it slowly lost its importance, and in 1784 it was downgraded to a lyceum. The present-day I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Jana Zamoyskiego is one of several secondary schools in Zamość.

In modern Zamość there are 9 secondary schools: 7 public (numbered from 1 to 7), one Catholic and one Social school. In addition, there are 10 primary schools: 8 public (numbered from 2 – 4 and from 6–10) as well as a Catholic and a Social primary school.

==Economy==
The city is located on the broad gauge railway line linking the former Soviet Union with Upper Silesian coal and sulphur mines as well as less than 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border crossings to Ukraine. Zamość is also located on a standard gauge rail line, although it is not electrified. The economy of the city is based on services which is why it is dominated by numerous small and medium-sized enterprises. However, there are some large production plants, mainly food factories and companies, that reflect the regional dominance of agriculture. These include the Zamojskie Wheat Company (Zamojskie Zakłady Zbożowe), the Animex fodder company, the Mors frozen food producer, and a daughter company of the Dairy in Krasnystaw.

The city is also a centre of expertise for agriculture and a market for various agricultural products. In addition, the other companies include a daughter company of the Black Red White furniture company (former Zamojskie Furniture Company), the Spomasz Zamość SA industrial and metal hardware producer, the SIPMOT agricultural machinery producer (a branch of the SIPMA Group from Lublin and a branch of Stalprodukt (former Metalplast) – producer of metal hardware and equipment from Bochnia, listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

The Old Town and the remnants of the old Zamość Fortress constitute an urban complex inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Zamość hosts the following cultural events: concerts of music performed by the Karol Namysłowski Symphonic Orchestra in Zamość and by Polish artists representing different kinds of music, Zamość Days of Music (Zamojskie Dni Muzyki) and International Meetings of Jazz Singers (Międzynarodowe Spotkania Wokalistów Jazzowych), which is a tribute to Mieczysław Kosz, a great blind jazz player and composer who used to combine his jazz music with the Polish folk.

&quot;Jazz na Kresach&quot; is a very popular annual music festival that dates back to 1982 and has been held since. The festival is organised in Zamość Old Town by the Zamość Jazz Club to commemorate Mieczysław Kosz.

The Zamość Festival of Mark Grechuta aims at commemorating his works. He was a composer, singer and poet. The festival has already taken place 3 times: 7–8 September 2007, 6–7 September 2008, 4–6 September 2009. The laureates of the competition and various well-known musicians sang at this festival. The festival is held in Zamość Great Market.

<text>Edmund Grindal ( 15196 July 1583) was Bishop of London, Archbishop of York, and Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of Elizabeth I. Though born far from the centres of political and religious power, he had risen rapidly in the church during the reign of Edward VI, culminating in his nomination as Bishop of London. However, the death of the King prevented his taking up the post, and along with other Marian exiles, he was a supporter of Calvinist Puritanism. Grindal sought refuge in continental Europe during the reign of Mary I. Upon Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, Grindal returned and resumed his rise in the church, culminating in his appointment to the highest office. 

The late 16th century was a time of great change in the English church, following the Elizabethan settlement. Although Grindal historically was not regarded as a particularly notable church leader, his reputation has been revived by modern critical scholarship, which maintains he had the support of his fellow bishops and set the course for the development of the English Church in the early 17th century.

== Early life to the death of Edward VI ==

Tradition, as retailed by Grindal&#x27;s biographer John Strype, had long held that Grindal was born in Hensingham, now a suburb of Whitehaven. However modern scholarship has shown that his birthplace was in fact Cross Hill House, St Bees, Cumberland. Grindal himself described his birthplace in a letter to Sir William Cecil, Elizabeth I&#x27;s Secretary of State: &quot;the house wherein I was born, and the lands pertaining thereto, being a small matter, under twenty shillings rent, but well builded at the charges of my father and brother&quot;: which corresponds to Cross Hill House. This has been proven by the discovery of the long-mislaid St. Bees long leases, which have provided the missing link in the chain of ownership back to William Grindal, Edmund&#x27;s father, a farmer in the village. Grindal&#x27;s exact date of birth is uncertain, but is c. 1519.

His education may have started with the monks at the nearby St Bees Priory, though this is not recorded. It is believed by Collinson that both Grindal and Edwin Sandys (later Archbishop of York) shared a childhood, quite probably in St Bees. Sandys himself recalled that he and Grindal had lived &quot;familiarly&quot; and &quot;as brothers&quot; and were only separated between Sandys&#x27;s 13th and 18th years. It is thought likely that Sandys grew up at nearby Rottington. Edwin Sandys kept one step behind Grindal in their subsequent careers, succeeding him as Bishop of London, and then as Archbishop of York. Whatever the place of early education, it is known that the Marian martyr John Bland was the schoolmaster of Sandys, so it is likely he would also have taught Grindal.

Grindal was educated at Magdalene and Christ&#x27;s colleges and then at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated BA and was elected a fellow in 1538. Having obtained his MA in 1541, he was ordained deacon in 1544, appointed proctor in 1550 and was Lady Margaret preacher 1548–1549. Probably through the influence of Nicholas Ridley, who had been master of Pembroke Hall, Grindal was selected as one of the Protestant disputants during the visitation of 1549. He had a talent for this work and was often given similar tasks.

When Ridley became Bishop of London, he made Grindal one of his chaplains and gave him the precentorship of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Grindal was soon promoted to be one of King Edward VI&#x27;s chaplains and prebendary of Westminster, and in October 1552 was one of six to whom the Forty-Two Articles were submitted for examination before being sanctioned by the Privy Council. According to John Knox, Grindal distinguished himself from most of the court preachers in 1553 by denouncing the worldliness of courtiers and foretelling the evils that would follow the king&#x27;s death.

Grindal benefited greatly from the patronage of Ridley and Sir William Cecil during this period, to the extent that on 11 June 1553 he was nominated to be Bishop of London. However, only a month later Edward VI was dead, and very soon Catholicism would return with a vengeance under Mary I, earning her the epithet &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;.

==Exile==
Although Grindal was not politically compromised by the events surrounding the accession of Mary I in October 1553, he had resigned his Westminster prebend by 10 May 1554, and made his way to Strasbourg as one of the Marian exiles. In 1554 he was in Frankfurt, where he tried to settle the disputes between the &quot;Coxians&quot;, who regarded the 1552 Prayer Book as the perfection of reform, and the &quot;Knoxians&quot;, who wanted further simplification.

==Bishop of London==

He returned to England in January 1559 in the company of his friend Edwin Sandys, on the day that Elizabeth I was crowned. He was soon gathered in to the body of men who would be at the centre of establishing the reformed church. He was appointed to the committee to revise the liturgy, and was one of the Protestant representatives at the Westminster conference. In July 1559 he was elected Master of Pembroke Hall in succession to the recusant Thomas Young (1514?–1580) and finally created Bishop of London in succession to Edmund Bonner, six years after his first nomination in Edward&#x27;s reign. About this time he ordained his friend the martyrologist John Foxe.

Grindal had qualms about vestments and other traces of &quot;popery&quot; as well as about the Erastianism of Elizabeth&#x27;s ecclesiastical government. Firmly Protestant, he did not mind recommending that a Roman Catholic priest &quot;might be put to some torment&quot;, and in October 1562 he wrote to William Cecil, begging to know &quot;if that second Julian, the king of Navarre, is killed; as he intended to preach at St Paul&#x27;s Cross, and might take occasion to mention God&#x27;s judgements on him&quot;. Nevertheless, he was reluctant to execute judgements on English Puritans, and failed to give Matthew Parker much assistance in rebuilding the shattered fabric of the English Church. Indeed he had appointed a number of Marian exiles who went on to play a major role in the resistance to Parker:Thomas Huyck, Thomas Cole, John Pullain, James Calfhill, Alexander Nowell.

Grindal lacked that firm faith in the supreme importance of uniformity and autocracy which enabled John Whitgift to persecute nonconformists whose theology was identical to his own. London, which was always a difficult see, involved Bishop Sandys in similar troubles when Grindal had gone to York. As it was, although Parker said that Grindal &quot;was not resolute and severe enough for the government of London&quot;, his attempts to enforce the use of the surplice evoked angry protests, especially in 1565, when many nonconformists were suspended. This developed into a breakaway movement that formed the London Underground Church. Grindal repeatedly raided their services and imprisoned worshippers, but generally for short spells, agreeing with the Privy Council &#x27;to move [them] to be conformable by gentleness&#x27;. Grindal of his own accord denounced Thomas Cartwright to the council in 1570. Other anxieties were brought upon him by the burning of his cathedral in 1561, for although Grindal himself is said to have contributed £1,200 towards its rebuilding, the laity and even the clergy of his diocese were not generous.

==Archbishop of York==
In 1570 Grindal became Archbishop of York, where Puritans were few and coercion would be required mainly for Roman Catholics. His first letter from his residence at Cawood Castle to Cecil told that he had not been well received, that the gentry were not &quot;well-affected to godly religion and among the common people many superstitious practices remained.&quot; It is admitted by his Anglican critics that he did the work of enforcing uniformity against the Roman Catholics with good-will and considerable tact.

He must have given general satisfaction, for even before Parker&#x27;s death two persons so different as Cecil (now Lord Burghley), and Dean Nowell independently recommended Grindal&#x27;s appointment as his successor, and Edmund Spenser spoke warmly of him in &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot; as the &quot;gentle shepherd Algrind&quot;.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
Grindal was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury on 26 July 1575, though there is no actual proof that the new archbishop ever visited the seat of his see, Canterbury, not even for his enthronement.

Burghley wished to conciliate the moderate Puritans and advised Grindal to mitigate the severity which had characterised Parker&#x27;s treatment of the nonconformists. Grindal indeed attempted a reform of the ecclesiastical courts, but his activity was cut short by a disagreement with the Queen. Elizabeth wanted Grindal to suppress the &quot;prophesyings&quot; or meetings for sermon training and discussion which had come into vogue among the Puritan clergy, and she even wanted him to discourage preaching. Instead of carrying out his instructions, Grindal responded with a 6,000-word letter defending prophesyings, saying: &#x27;I choose rather to offend your earthly Majesty than to offend the heavenly majesty of God.&#x27; In June 1577 he was suspended from his jurisdictional - though not his spiritual - functions for disobedience. He stood firm, and in January 1578 Secretary Wilson informed Burghley that the Queen wished to have the Archbishop deprived. She was dissuaded from this extreme course, but Grindal&#x27;s sequestration was continued in spite of a petition from Convocation in 1581 for his reinstatement. Elizabeth then suggested that he should resign; he declined to do so, and after apologising to the Queen he was reinstated towards the end of 1582. However, his infirmities were increasing, and while making preparations for his resignation, he died and was buried in Croydon Minster.

==Legacy==

By the 17th century, Grindal came to be admired by the Puritans who were experiencing persecution at the hands of Archbishop Laud.

John Milton, who rejected episcopal church government, thought the Elizabethan bishops had been Laodiceans, neither hot nor cold, but thought Grindal had been &quot;the best of them&quot; in his tract &quot;Of Reformation&quot; of 1641.

William Prynne had no time for Parker (&quot;over pontifical and princely&quot;) and Whitgift (&quot;stately pontifical bishop&quot;), but praised Grindal in 1641 as &quot;a grave and pious man&quot;. Richard Baxter in 1656 claimed of Grindal: &quot;Such bishops would have prevented our contentions and wars.&quot; Daniel Neal a century later, in his &quot;History of the Puritans&quot;, called him &quot;the good old archbishop&quot;, &quot;of a mild and moderate temper, easy of access and affable even in his highest exaltation&quot;, &quot;upon the whole ... one of the best of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s bishops&quot;.

Conversely, Grindal came to be attacked by High Church Tories. Henry Sacheverell, in his famous sermon of 5 November 1709, &quot;The Perils of False Brethren, Both in Church and State&quot;, attacked him as &quot;that false son of the Church, Bishop Grindall ... a perfidious prelate&quot; who deluded Elizabeth into tolerating the &quot;Genevan Discipline&quot; and thereby facilitating &quot;the first plantation of dissenters&quot;. This attack on Grindal&#x27;s memory led to John Strype publishing his biography of Grindal, helped by a subscription list that included many leading Whig politicians and churchmen.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was Sacheverell&#x27;s portrayal of a weak and ineffective prelate that had come to be the predominant view. Sidney Lee claimed Grindal &quot;feebly temporised with dissent&quot;; Mandell Creighton called him &quot;infirm of purpose&quot;; Walter Frere said Grindal possessed a &quot;natural incapacity for government&quot;; and W. P. M. Kennedy said he had &quot;a constitutional incapacity for administration&quot; which was Grindal&#x27;s &quot;outstanding weakness&quot;. However, in 1979 was published the first critical biography of Grindal, by Patrick Collinson, who said that Grindal was neither weak nor ineffectual but had the support of his fellow bishops and led the way for how the English Church would develop in the early 17th century.

Grindal left considerable benefactions to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge; he also endowed a free school at St Bees, and left money for the poor of St Bees, Canterbury, Lambeth and Croydon.

The most enduring monument to Grindal has proved to be the St Bees School (a &quot;free grammar school&quot;), which he founded in his native village of St Bees, where he had not been for perhaps forty-five years. Only three days before his death Grindal had published statutes for the school; a series of minute and specific regulations which are a noted treasury of information for historians of Tudor education. Although the school was to be sometimes at risk in its early years, a school building had been erected by 1588 at a cost of £366.3s.4d. and endowed with annual revenues of £50. Nicholas Copland was nominated by Grindal as the first Headmaster and a tradition of learning had begun which continued without a break for over four centuries. In 2015 it was announced that the school was to close, but it re-opened in 2018.

Grindal also played a part in the establishment of Highgate School in North London, for which he gave land, and he is credited with having introduced the tamarisk tree to the British Isles.

<text>Thomas Cartwright (c. 1535 – 27 December 1603) was an English Puritan preacher and theologian.

==Background and education==
Cartwright was probably born in Royston, Hertfordshire, and studied divinity at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. On the accession of Queen Mary I of England in 1553, he was forced to leave the university, and found occupation as clerk to a counsellor-at-law. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, five years later, he resumed his theological studies, and was soon afterwards elected a fellow of St John&#x27;s and later of Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Theological stance==
In 1564, Cartwright opposed Thomas Preston in a theological disputation held on the occasion of Elizabeth&#x27;s state visit, and in the following year brought attention to the Puritan attitude on church ceremonial and organization. He was popular in Ireland as chaplain to Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Armagh (1565–1567). In 1569, Cartwright was appointed Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity at Cambridge. In 1570 he delivered the &quot;first public call for Presbyterianism&quot; in the Church of England. In response John Whitgift, on becoming vice-chancellor, deprived him of the post in December 1570, and—as master of Trinity—of his fellowship in September 1571.

This was a result of the use which Cartwright had made of his position; in the sermons in which he made a public call for Presbyterianism he criticised the hierarchy and constitution of the Church of England, which he compared unfavourably with the primitive Christian organization. So keen was the struggle between him and Whitgift that the chancellor, William Cecil, had to intervene. After his deprivation by Whitgift, Cartwright visited Theodore Beza at Geneva. He returned to England in 1572, and might have become professor of Hebrew at Cambridge but for his expressed sympathy with the notorious &quot;Admonition to the Parliament&quot; by John Field and Thomas Wilcox. To escape arrest he again went abroad, and officiated as clergyman to the English residents at Antwerp and then at Middelburg.

==Later years==
In 1576 Cartwright visited and organized the Huguenot churches of the Channel Islands, and after revising the Rhenish version of the New Testament, again settled as pastor at Antwerp, declining the offer of a chair at the University of St Andrews. 
In 1585, he returned without permission to London, was imprisoned for a short time, and became master of the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s hospital at Warwick, known as the Lord Leycester Hospital in the same year. 
In 1590, he was summoned before the court of high commission and imprisoned, and in 1591 he was once more committed to the Fleet prison. 
He was not treated harshly, and powerful influence soon secured his release. He visited Guernsey (1595–1598), and spent his closing years in honour and prosperity at Warwick, where he died 27 December 1603.

==Qualities and character==
Cartwright was a man of much culture and originality, but said to be exceedingly impulsive. His views were distinctly Presbyterian, and he stoutly opposed the Brownists or Independents. He never conceived of a separation between church and state, and may have refused to tolerate any non-conformity with the reformed national Presbyterian church. However, it is believed that the Puritanism of the day owed its systematization and much of its force to him.
