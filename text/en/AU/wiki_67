<text>Bunbury is a village in Cheshire, England, south of Tarporley and north west of Nantwich on the Shropshire Union Canal. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 1,195.

==History==
Bunbury was reputedly derived from Buna-burh, meaning the &quot;redoubt of Buna&quot;. Just prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066 it was held by a certain Dedol of Tiverton. Its name was written as Boleberie in the Domesday Survey of 1086 and the lord of the fief was Robert FitzHugh. Listed as lying in the hundred of Rushton and the county of Cheshire, it had a recorded population of 3 households in 1086, meaning that it was one of smallest 20% of settlements at that time.

A Norman family later acquired the surname of De Boneberi, and were linked to Rake Hall during and after the reign of King Stephen. They were allegedly a cadet line of the Norman family of De St Pierre, associated with Hugh &quot;Lupus&quot; Earl of Chester, one of the famous &quot;marcher lords&quot; of the Welsh Marches.
Then the fief was governed by the family of Hugh Claveley that held the manor of Calveley in Bunbury, Cheshire, living in Calveley Hall that came into the possession of the Davenport family through marriage in 1369. 

Much later, in the era of the English Civil War and on the date of 23 December 1642 some of the prominent gentlemen of Cheshire met in Bunbury and drew up the Bunbury Agreement. The terms of the agreement were intended to keep Cheshire neutral during the English Civil War. It proved to be a forlorn hope because the national strategic importance of Cheshire and the city port of Chester meant that national interests overruled local ones.

Bunbury was a victim of the Blitz during World War II. German aircraft returning from a night raid on Liverpool in 1940 jettisoned surplus bombs over the village, obliterating Church Row (the houses have since been rebuilt). The blast caused minor damage to the exterior of St Boniface&#x27;s Church and the immediate area. The original village centre surrounding the church was hit, damaging shops beyond repair. This has largely caused the current centre to evolve in the geographical heart of the village.

Four old villages have combined to form the modern-day Bunbury. These are:
* Higher Bunbury (centred on the church and the Dysart Arms),
* Lower Bunbury (the main part of the village today),
* Bunbury Heath (essentially School Lane) and
* Bunbury Common (from Higher Bunbury towards Bunbury Locks).

The last three have coalesced to form a single village. The River Gowy is a natural division between Higher and Lower Bunbury.

Bunbury was used in the autumn of 2014 as the setting for the fictional village of &#x27;Great Paxford&#x27; in the ITV drama &quot;Home Fires&quot;.

==Landmarks==
Bunbury Locks is a working wharf with some &quot;high-rise&quot; staircase locks and canal horse stables.

Bunbury Mill is a watermill dating from 1844, although there has been a mill on this site since 1290. Following damage caused by a flood in 1960, the mill closed in 1966. It was restored to working order and reopened to the public as a museum by North West Water Authority (later part of United Utilities). It was closed again in 2010, and passed into the ownership of the Bunbury Watermill Trust, who have reopened it to visitors.

The Chantry House is a grade-II*-listed timber-framed building dating from around 1527, which originally housed the two chantry priests of the Ridley chantry of St Boniface&#x27;s Church, and later formed part of the free grammar school founded by Thomas Aldersey.

==Community==

The main lane in Bunbury is Bunbury Lane which contains three shops (butcher, general convenience store/Post Office and fish and chip shop), two hairdressers, and three pubs - the Nags Head, the Dysart Arms (Cheshire Dining Pub of the Year 2009) and the Yew Tree (formerly the Crewe Arms) which re-opened in 2010.

Bunbury Aldersey C of E Primary school is in School Lane.

The parish church is dedicated to Saint Boniface and is built on the highest point of the village. It is over 1,000 years old and is built on an older pagan site. This was a collegiate church built in the 14th century; the nave arcades and aisle windows are about 100 years later than this. There is an alabaster effigy of the founder of the college, Sir Hugh Calveley, other effigies, and a 17th-century tomb. It was restored after bomb damage during the Second World War.

Bunbury has amenities such as a cricket pavilion, sports pitches, tennis courts, a scout hut (with a new one under construction in 2011) and a village hall. It also has some clubs and societies.

Sadlers Wells Woods is located near the A49 road. The wooded area was also mentioned in the Domesday Book written in the time of William the Conqueror.

<doc id="153717" wikidata="Q272993" url="?curid=153717" title="Susanoo-no-Mikoto">
<text>Susanoo (; historical orthography: , ), often referred to by the honorific title Susanoo-no-Mikoto, is a in Japanese mythology. The younger brother of Amaterasu, goddess of the sun and mythical ancestress of the Japanese imperial line, he is a multifaceted deity with contradictory characteristics (both good and bad), being portrayed in various stories either as a wild, impetuous god associated with the sea and storms, as a heroic figure who killed a monstrous serpent, or as a local deity linked with the harvest and agriculture. Syncretic beliefs of the Gion cult that arose after the introduction of Buddhism to Japan also saw Susanoo becoming conflated with deities of pestilence and disease.

Susanoo, alongside Amaterasu and the earthly Ōkuninushi (also Ōnamuchi) – depicted as either Susanoo&#x27;s son or scion depending on the source – is one of the central deities of the imperial Japanese mythological cycle recorded in the ( CE) and the (720 CE). One of the gazetteer reports () commissioned by the imperial court during the same period these texts were written, that of Izumo Province (modern Shimane Prefecture) in western Japan, also contains a number of short legends concerning Susanoo or his children, suggesting a connection between the god and this region.

In addition, a few other myths also hint at a connection between Susanoo and the Korean Peninsula.

== Name ==
Susanoo&#x27;s name is variously given in the as , , or simply as . &quot;-no-Mikoto&quot; is a common honorific appended to the names of Japanese gods; it may be understood as similar to the English honorific &#x27;the Great&#x27;. He is meanwhile named in the as , , , and . The of Izumo Province renders his name both as and . In these texts the following honorific prefixes are attached to his name: , , and .

The in Susanoo&#x27;s name has been variously explained as being derived from either of the following words:

*The verb or meaning &#x27;to be impetuous,&#x27; &#x27;to be violent,&#x27; or &#x27;to go wild&#x27;
*The verb , &#x27;to advance&#x27;
*The township of in Iishi District, Izumo Province (modern Shimane Prefecture)
*A word related to the Middle Korean , meaning &#x27;master&#x27; or &#x27;shaman&#x27;

== Mythology ==
=== Parentage ===
The ( CE) and the (720 CE) both agree in their description of Susanoo as the son of the god Izanagi and the younger brother of Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, and of Tsukuyomi, the god of the moon. The circumstances surrounding the birth of these three deities, collectively known as the , however, vary between sources.

*In the , Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo came into existence when Izanagi bathed in a river to purify himself after visiting Yomi, the underworld, in a failed attempt to rescue his deceased wife, Izanami. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born when he washed his right eye, and Susanoo was born when he washed his nose. Izanagi then appoints Amaterasu to rule , Tsukuyomi the night, and Susanoo the seas. Susanoo, who missed his mother, kept crying and howling incessantly until his beard grew long, causing the mountains to wither and the rivers to dry up. An angry Izanagi then &quot;expelled him with a divine expulsion.&quot;
*The main narrative of the has Izanagi and Izanami procreating after creating the Japanese archipelago; to them were born (in the following order) Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, the &#x27;leech-child&#x27; Hiruko, and Susanoo. Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi were sent up to heaven to govern it, while Hiruko – who even at the age of three could not stand upright – was placed on the and set adrift. Susanoo, whose wailing laid waste to the land, was expelled and sent to the netherworld (Ne-no-Kuni). (In the , Hiruko is the couple&#x27;s very first offspring, born before the islands of Japan and the other deities were created; there he is set afloat on a boat of reeds.)
*A variant legend recorded in the has Izanagi begetting Amaterasu by holding a bronze mirror in his left hand, Tsukuyomi by holding another mirror in his right hand, and Susanoo by turning his head and looking sideways. Susanoo is here also said to be banished by Izanagi due to his destructive nature.
*A third variant in the has Izanagi and Izanami begetting Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Hiruko, and Susanoo, as in the main narrative. This version specifies the Rock-Camphor Boat on which Hiruko was placed in to be the couple&#x27;s fourth offspring. The fifth child, the fire god Kagutsuchi, caused the death of Izanami (as in the ). As in other versions, Susanoo – who &quot;was of a wicked nature, and was always fond of wailing and wrath&quot; – is here expelled by his parents.

=== Susanoo and Amaterasu ===

Before Susanoo leaves, he ascends to Takamagahara, wishing to say farewell to his sister Amaterasu. As he did so, the mountains and rivers shook and the land quaked. Amaterasu, suspicious of his motives, went out to meet him dressed in male clothing and clad in armor, but when Susanoo proposed a trial by pledge () to prove his sincerity, she accepted. In the ritual, the two gods each chewed and spat out an object carried by the other (in some variants, an item they each possessed).

*Both the and the &#x27;s main account relate that Amaterasu broke Susanoo&#x27;s into three, chewed them and then spat them out. Three goddesses – Takiribime (Tagorihime), Ichikishimahime, and Tagitsuhime – were thus born. Susanoo then took the strings of beads Amaterasu entwined in her hair and round her wrists, likewise chewed the beads and spat them out. Five male deities – Ame-no-Oshihomimi, Ame-no-Hohi, Amatsuhikone, Ikutsuhikone, and Kumano-no-Kusubi – then came into existence.
*A variant account in the has Amaterasu chew three different swords she bore with her – a ten-span sword, a , and an – while Susanoo chewed the necklace that hung on his neck.
*Another variant account in the has Susanoo meet a named on his way to heaven. This deity presented him with the beads used in the ritual. In this version, Amaterasu begets the three goddesses after chewing the beads Susanoo obtained earlier, while Susanoo begets the five gods after biting off the edge of Amaterasu&#x27;s sword.
*A third variant has Amaterasu chewing three different swords to beget the three goddesses as in the first variant. Susanoo, in turn, begat six male deities after chewing the &quot;magatama&quot; beads on his hair bunches and necklace and spitting them on his hands, forearms, and legs.


Amaterasu declares that the male deities were hers because they were born of her necklace, and that the three goddesses were Susanoo&#x27;s. Susanoo, announcing that he had won the trial, thus signifying the purity of his intentions, &quot;raged with victory&quot; and proceeded to wreak havoc by destroying his sister&#x27;s rice fields, defecating in her palace and flaying the &#x27;heavenly piebald horse&#x27; (天斑駒, &quot;ame-no-fuchikoma&quot;), which he then hurled at Amaterasu&#x27;s loom, killing one of her weaving maidens. A furious Amaterasu in response hid inside the Ama-no-Iwato (&quot;Heavenly Rock Cave&quot;), plunging heaven and earth into total darkness. The gods, led by Omoikane-no-Kami (思金神), eventually persuade her to come out of the cave, restoring light to the world. As punishment for his misdeeds, Susanoo is thrown out of Takamagahara:


*A fourth variant of the story in the &quot;Shoki&quot; reverses the order of the two events. This version relates that Susanoo and Amaterasu each owned three rice fields; Amaterasu&#x27;s fields were fertile, while Susanoo&#x27;s were dry and barren. Driven by jealousy, Susanoo ruins his sister&#x27;s rice fields, causing her to hide in the Ama-no-Iwato and him to be expelled from heaven (as above). During his banishment, Susanoo, wearing a hat and a raincoat made of straw, sought shelter from the heavy rains, but the other gods refused to give him lodging. He then ascends to heaven once more to say farewell to Amaterasu.

The two then perform the &quot;ukehi&quot; ritual; Susanoo produces six male deities from the &quot;magatama&quot; beads on his hair knots. Declaring that his intentions were indeed pure, Susanoo gives the six gods to Amaterasu&#x27;s care and departs.

=== Susanoo and Ōgetsuhime ===
The &quot;Kojiki&quot; relates that during his banishment, Susanoo asked the goddess of food, Ōgetsuhime-no-Kami (大気都比売神), to give him something to eat. Upon finding out that the goddess produced foodstuffs from her mouth, nose, and rectum, a disgusted Susanoo killed her, at which various crops, plants and seeds spring from her dead body. This account is not found in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, where a similar story is told of Tsukuyomi and the goddess Ukemochi.

=== Slaying the Yamata no Orochi ===

After his banishment, Susanoo came down from heaven to Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni (葦原中国, the &#x27;Central Land of Reed Plains&#x27;, i.e. the earthly land of Japan), to the land of Izumo, where he met an elderly couple named Ashinazuchi (足名椎 / 脚摩乳) and Tenazuchi (手名椎 / 手摩乳), who told him that seven of their eight daughters had been devoured by a monstrous serpent known as the Yamata no Orochi (八俣遠呂智 / 八岐大蛇, &quot;eight-forked serpent&quot;) and it was nearing time for their eighth, Kushinadahime (櫛名田比売; also called Kushiinadahime, Inadahime, or Makami-Furu-Kushiinadahime in the &quot;Shoki&quot;).

Sympathizing with their plight, Susanoo hid Kushinadahime by transforming her into a comb (&quot;kushi&quot;), which he placed in his hair. He then made the serpent drunk on strong sake and then killed it as it lay in a drunken stupor. From within the serpent&#x27;s tail Susanoo discovered the sword Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi (天叢雲剣, &quot;Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven&quot;), also known as Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (草薙剣, &quot;Grass-Cutting Sword&quot;), which he then presented to Amaterasu as a reconciliatory gift.


Amaterasu later bequeathed the sword to Ninigi, her grandson by Ame-no-Oshihomimi, along with the mirror Yata no Kagami and the jewel Yasakani no Magatama. This sacred sword, mirror, and jewel collectively became the three Imperial Regalia of Japan.

While most accounts place Susanoo&#x27;s descent in the headwaters of the river Hi in Izumo (肥河 / 簸之川, &quot;Hi-no-Kawa&quot;, identified with the Hii River in modern Shimane Prefecture), with the &quot;Kojiki&quot; specifying the area to be a place called Torikami (鳥髮, identified with Mount Sentsū in eastern Shimane), one variant in the &quot;Shoki&quot; instead has Susanoo descend to the upper reaches of the river E (可愛之川, &quot;E-no-kawa&quot;) in the province of Aki (identified with the Gōnokawa River in modern Hiroshima Prefecture). Kushinadahime&#x27;s parents are here given the names Ashinazu-Tenazu (脚摩手摩) and Inada-no-Miyanushi-Susa-no-Yatsumimi (稲田宮主簀狭之八箇耳); here, Kushinadahime is not yet born when Susanoo slew the Yamata no Orochi.

The ten-span sword Susanoo used to slay the Yamata no Orochi, unnamed in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Shoki&quot;&#x27;s main text, is variously named in the &quot;Shoki&quot;&#x27;s variants as Orochi-no-Aramasa (蛇之麁正, &#x27;Rough [and] True [Blade] of the Serpent&#x27;), Orochi-no-Karasabi-no-Tsurugi (蛇韓鋤之剣, &#x27;Korean (&quot;Kara&quot;) Sword of the Serpent&#x27; or &#x27;Flashing Sword of the Serpent&#x27;), and Ame-no-Haekiri-no-Tsurugi (天蝿斫剣, &#x27;Heavenly Fly Cutter&#x27;, also Ame-no-Hahakiri &#x27;Heavenly Serpent (&quot;haha&quot;) Cutter&#x27;). In the &quot;Kogo Shūi&quot; it is dubbed Ame-no-Habakiri (天羽々斬, also Ame-no-Hahakiri). This sword is said to have been originally enshrined in Isonokami Futsumitama Shrine in Bizen Province (modern Okayama Prefecture) before it was transferred to Isonokami Shrine in Yamato Province (modern Nara Prefecture).

=== Susanoo in Soshimori ===

A variant account in the &quot;Shoki&quot; relates that after Susanoo was banished due to his bad behavior, he descended from heaven, accompanied by a son named Isotakeru-no-Mikoto (五十猛命), to a place called &#x27;Soshimori&#x27; (曽尸茂梨) in the land of Shiragi (the Korean kingdom of Silla) before going to Izumo. Disliking the place, they crossed the sea in a boat made of clay until they arrived at Torikami Peak (鳥上之峯, &quot;Torikami no mine&quot;) by the upper waters of the river Hi in Izumo.

=== The palace of Suga ===
After slaying the Yamata no Orochi, Susanoo looked for a suitable place in Izumo to live in. Upon arriving at a place called Suga (須賀 / 清), he declared, &quot;Coming to this place, my heart is refreshed (&quot;sugasugashi&quot;).&quot; He then erected a palace there and made a song:

Donald L. Philippi (1968) translates the song into English thus:

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; adds that Susanoo appointed Kushinadahime&#x27;s father Ashinazuchi to be the headman of his new dwelling, bestowing upon him the name Inada-no-Miyanushi-Suga-no-Yatsumimi-no-Kami (稲田宮主須賀之八耳神, &#x27;Master of the Palace of Inada, the Eight-Eared Deity of Suga&#x27;). With his new wife Kushinadahime, Susanoo had a child named Yashimajinumi-no-Kami (八島士奴美神). He then took another wife named Kamu-Ōichihime (神大市比売), the daughter of Ōyamatsumi, the god of mountains, and had two children by her: Ōtoshi-no-Kami (大年神), the god of the harvest, and Ukanomitama-no-Kami (宇迦之御魂神), the god of agriculture.

The &quot;Shoki&quot;&#x27;s main narrative is roughly similar: Susanoo appoints Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi to be the keepers of his palace and gives them the title Inada-no-Miyanushi. The child born to Susanoo and Kushiinadahime in this version is identified as Ōnamuchi-no-Kami (大己貴神, the &quot;Kojiki&quot;&#x27;s Ōkuninushi).

After having thus lived for a time in Izumo, Susanoo at length finally found his way to Ne-no-Kuni.

=== Planting trees ===
One variant in the &quot;Shoki&quot; has Susanoo pulling out hairs from different parts of his body and turning them into different kinds of trees. Determining the use of each, he then gives them to his three children – Isotakeru-no-Mikoto, Ōyatsuhime-no-Mikoto (大屋津姫命), and Tsumatsuhime-no-Mikoto (枛津姫命) – to spread in Japan. Susanoo then settled down in a place called Kumanari-no-Take (熊成峯) before going to Ne-no-Kuni.

The myth of Susanoo&#x27;s descent in Soshimori has Isotakeru bringing seeds with him from Takamagahara which he did not choose to plant in Korea but rather spread throughout Japan, beginning with Tsukushi Province. The narrative adds that it is, for this reason, why Isotakeru is styled Isaoshi-no-Kami (有功之神, &#x27;Meritorious Deity&#x27;).

=== Susanoo and Ōnamuji ===

In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, a sixth-generation descendant of Susanoo, Ōnamuji-no-Kami (大穴牟遅神), ends up in Ne-no-Kuni to escape his wicked elder brothers who make repeated attempts on his life. There he meets and falls in love with Susanoo&#x27;s daughter Suseribime (須勢理毘売). Upon learning of their affair, Susanoo imposes four trials on Ōnamuji:

*Susanoo, upon inviting Ōnamuji to his dwelling, had him sleep in a chamber filled with snakes. Suseribime aided Ōnamuji by giving him a scarf that repelled the snakes.
*The following night, Susanoo had Ōnamuji sleep in another room full of centipedes and bees. Once again, Suseribime gave Ōnamuji a scarf that kept the insects at bay.
*Susanoo shot an arrow into a large plain and had Ōnamuji fetch it. As Ōnamuji was busy looking for the arrow, Susanoo set the field on fire. A field mouse showed Ōnamuji how to hide from the flames and gave him the arrow he was searching for.
*Susanoo, upon discovering that Ōnamuji had survived, summoned him back to his palace and had him pick the lice and centipedes from his hair. Using a mixture of red clay and nuts given to him by Suseribime, Ōnamuji pretended to chew and spit out the insects he was picking.

After Susanoo was lulled to sleep, Ōnamuji tied Susanoo&#x27;s hair to the hall&#x27;s rafters and blocked the door with an enormous boulder. Taking his new wife Suseribime as well as Susanoo&#x27;s sword, &quot;koto&quot;, and bow and arrows with him, Ōnamuji thus fled the palace. The &quot;koto&quot; brushed against a tree as the two were fleeing; the sound awakens Susanoo, who, rising with a start, knocks his palace down around him. Susanoo then pursued them as far as the slopes of Yomotsu Hirasaka (黄泉比良坂, the &#x27;Flat Slope of Yomi&#x27;). As the two departed, Susanoo grudgingly gave his blessing to Ōnamuji, advising him to change his name to Ōkuninushi-no-Kami (大国主神, &quot;Master of the Great Land&quot;). Using the weapons he obtained from Susanoo, Ōkuninushi defeats his brothers and becomes the undisputed ruler of Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni.

=== Susanoo in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot; ===

The &quot;Fudoki&quot; of Izumo Province (completed 733 CE) records the following etiological legends which feature Susanoo and his children:

*The township of Yasuki (安来郷) in Ou District (意宇郡) is named such after Susanoo visited the area and said, &quot;My mind has been comforted (&quot;yasuku nari tamau&quot;).&quot;
*The township of Ōkusa (大草郷) in Ou is said to have been named after a son of Susanoo named Aohata-Sakusahiko-no-Mikoto (青幡佐久佐比古命).
*The township of Yamaguchi (山口郷) in Shimane District (島根郡) is named as such after another son of Susanoo, Tsurugihiko-no-Mikoto (都留支日子命), declared these entrance to the hills (&quot;yamaguchi&quot;) to be his territory.
*The township of Katae (方結郷) in Shimane received its name after Kunioshiwake-no-Mikoto (国忍別命), a son of Susanoo, said, &quot;The land I govern is in good condition geographically (&quot;kunigatae&quot;).&quot;
*The township of Etomo (恵曇郡) in Akika District (秋鹿郡) is named such after Susanoo&#x27;s son Iwasakahiko-no-Mikoto (磐坂日子命) noted the area&#x27;s resemblance to a painted arm guard (画鞆, &quot;etomo&quot;).
*The township of Tada (多太郷) in Akika District received its name after Susanoo&#x27;s son Tsukihoko-Tooruhiko-no-Mikoto (衝杵等乎留比古命, also Tsukiki-Tooruhiko) came there and said, &quot;My heart has become bright and truthful (&quot;tadashi&quot;).&quot;
*The township of Yano (八野郷) in Kando District (神門郡) is named after Susanoo&#x27;s daughter Yanowakahime-no-Mikoto (八野若日女命), who lived in the area. Ōnamochi (大穴持命, i.e. Ōkuninushi), also known as Ame-no-Shita-Tsukurashishi-Ōkami (所造天下大神, &#x27;Great Deity, Maker of All Under Heaven&#x27;), who wished to marry her, had a house built at this place.
*The township of Namesa (滑狭郷) in Kando District (神門郡) is named after a smooth stone (滑磐石, &quot;nameshi iwa&quot;) Ame-no-Shita-Tsukurashishi-Ōkami (Ōnamochi) spotted while visiting Susanoo&#x27;s daughter Wakasuserihime-no-Mikoto (和加須世理比売命, the &quot;Kojiki&quot;&#x27;s Suseribime), who is said to have lived there.
*The township of Susa (須佐郷) in Iishi District (飯石郡) is said to be named after Susanoo, who enshrined his spirit in this place:

*The township of Sase (佐世郷) in Ōhara District (大原郡) is said to have gained its name when Susanoo danced there wearing leaves of a plant called &quot;sase&quot; on his head.
*Mount Mimuro (御室山, &quot;Mimuro-yama&quot;) in the township of Hi (斐伊郷) in Ōhara District is said to have been the place where Susanoo built a temporary dwelling (御室, &quot;mimuro&quot;, lit. &#x27;noble chamber&#x27;) in which he stayed the night.

=== Susanoo, Mutō Tenjin and Gozu Tennō ===

The syncretic deity Gozu Tennō (牛頭天王, &quot;Ox-Headed Heavenly King&quot;), originally worshiped at Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto and at other shrines such as Tsushima Shrine in Aichi Prefecture, was historically conflated with Susanoo. Originally a deity of foreign import (India and Korea have all been suggested as possible origins), Gozu Tennō was widely revered since the Heian period as a god of pestilence, who both caused disease and cured them.

Gozu Tennō became associated with another deity called Mutō-no-Kami (武塔神) or Mutō Tenjin (武塔天神), who appears in the legend of Somin Shōrai (蘇民将来). This legend relates that Mutō, a god from the northern sea, embarked on a long journey to court the daughter of the god of the southern seas. On his way he sought lodging from a wealthy man, but was turned down. He then went to the home of a poor man (sometimes identified as the rich man&#x27;s brother) named Somin Shōrai, who gave him food and shelter. Years later, Mutō returned and slew the rich man and his family but spared Somin Shōrai&#x27;s house. Some versions of the story have Mutō repaying Somin Shōrai for his hospitality by giving the poor man&#x27;s daughter a wreath of &quot;susuki&quot; (&quot;Miscanthus sinensis&quot;) reeds that she is to wear while declaring, &quot;[I am] the descendant of Somin Shōrai&quot; (蘇民将来之子孫也, &quot;Somin Shōrai no shison nari&quot;). By doing so, she and her descendants would be spared from pestilence. The deity in this story, Mutō, is often conflated with Gozu Tennō (who, as his name implies, was born with the head of an ox) in later retellings, though one version identifies Gozu Tennō as Mutō Tenjin&#x27;s son.

The earliest known version of this legend, found in the &quot;Fudoki&quot; of Bingo Province (modern eastern Hiroshima Prefecture) compiled during the Nara period (preserved in an extract quoted by scholar and Shinto priest Urabe Kanekata in the &quot;Shaku Nihongi&quot;), has Mutō explicitly identify himself as Susanoo. This suggests that Susanoo and Mutō Tenjin were already conflated in the Nara period, if not earlier. Sources that equate Gozu Tennō with Susanoo only first appear during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), although one theory supposes that these three gods and various other disease-related deities were already loosely coalesced around the 9th century, probably around the year 877 when a major epidemic swept through Japan.

== Analysis ==

The image of Susanoo that can be gleaned from various texts is rather complex and contradictory. In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Shoki&quot; he is portrayed first as a petulant young man, then as an unpredictable, violent boor who causes chaos and destruction before turning into a monster-slaying culture hero after descending into the world of men, while in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot;, he is simply a local god apparently connected with rice fields, with almost none of the traits associated with him in the imperial mythologies being mentioned. Due to his multifaceted nature, various authors have had differing opinions regarding Susanoo&#x27;s origins and original character.

The Edo period &quot;kokugaku&quot; scholar Motoori Norinaga, in his &quot;Kojiki-den&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Kojiki&quot;), characterized Susanoo as an evil god in contrast to his elder siblings Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, as the unclean air of the land of the dead still adhered to Izanagi&#x27;s nose from which he was born and was not purified completely during Izanagi&#x27;s ritual ablutions. The early 20th century historian Tsuda Sōkichi, who put forward the then-controversial theory that the &quot;Kojiki&quot;&#x27;s accounts were not based on history (as Edo period &quot;kokugaku&quot; and State Shinto ideology believed them to be) but rather propagandistic myths concocted to explain and legitimize the rule of the imperial dynasty, also saw Susanoo as a negative figure, arguing that he was created to serve as the rebellious opposite of the imperial ancestress Amaterasu. Ethnologist Ōbayashi Taryō, speaking from the standpoint of comparative mythology, opined that the stories concerning the three deities were ultimately derived from a continental (Southeast Asian) myth in which the Sun, the Moon and the Dark Star are siblings and the Dark Star plays an antagonistic role (cf. Rahu and Ketu from Hindu religion); Ōbayashi thus also interprets Susanoo as a bad hero.

Other scholars, however, take the position that Susanoo was not originally conceived of as a negative deity. Mythologist Matsumura Takeo for instance believed the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot; to more accurately reflect Susanoo&#x27;s original character: a peaceful, simple &quot;kami&quot; of the rice fields. In Matsumura&#x27;s view, Susanoo&#x27;s character was deliberately reversed when he was grafted into the imperial mythology by the compilers of the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. Matsumoto Nobuhiro, in a similar vein, interpreted Susanoo as a harvest deity. While the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot; claims that the township of Susa in Izumo is named after its deity Susanoo, it has been proposed that the opposite might have actually been the case and Susanoo was named after the place, with his name being understood in this case as meaning &quot;Man (&quot;o&quot;) of Susa.&quot;

While both Matsumura and Matsumoto preferred to connect Susanoo with rice fields and the harvest, Matsumae Takeshi put forward the theory that Susanoo was originally worshiped as a patron deity of sailors. Unlike other scholars who connect Susanoo with Izumo, Matsumae instead saw Kii Province (the modern prefectures of Wakayama and Mie) as the birthplace of Susanoo worship, pointing out that there was also a settlement in Kii named Susa (須佐). (In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, Ōnamuji enters Susanoo&#x27;s realm, Ne-no-Kuni, through the fork of a tree in Kii.) Matsumae proposed that the worship of Susanoo was brought to other places in Japan by seafaring peoples from Kii, a land rich in timber (the province&#x27;s name is itself derived from the word &quot;ki&quot; meaning &#x27;tree&#x27;).
A few myths, such as that of Susanoo&#x27;s descent in Soshimori in Silla, seem to suggest a connection between the god and the Korean Peninsula. Indeed, some scholars have hypothesized that the deities who were eventually conflated with Susanoo, Mutō Tenjin, and Gozu Tennō, may have had Korean origins as well, with the name &#x27;Mutō&#x27; (武塔, historical orthography: &quot;mutau&quot;) being linked with the Korean word &quot;mudang&quot; &quot;shamaness,&quot; and &#x27;Gozu&#x27; being explained as a calque of &#x27;Soshimori&#x27;, here interpreted as being derived from a Korean toponym meaning &#x27;Bull&#x27;s (&quot;&quot;) Head (&quot;&quot;)&#x27;. The name &#x27;Susanoo&#x27; itself has been interpreted as being related to the Middle Korean title &quot;&quot; (transliterated as 次次雄 or 慈充), meaning &#x27;master&#x27; or &#x27;shaman&#x27;, notably applied to Namhae, the second king of Silla, in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;. Susanoo is thus supposed in this view to have originally been a foreign god (蕃神, &quot;banshin&quot;), perhaps a deified shaman, whose origins may be traced back to Korea.

Emilia Gadeleva (2000) sees Susanoo&#x27;s original character as being that of a rain god – more precisely, a god associated with rainmaking – with his association with the harvest and a number of other elements from his myths ultimately springing from his connection with rainwater. He thus serves as a contrast and a parallel to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. Gadeleva also acknowledges the foreign elements in the god&#x27;s character by supposing that rainmaking rituals and concepts were brought to Japan in ancient times from the continent, with the figure of the Korean shaman (&quot;susung&quot;) who magically controlled the abundance of rain eventually morphing into the Japanese Susanoo, but at the same time stresses that Susanoo is not completely a foreign import but must have had Japanese roots at his core. In Gadeleva&#x27;s view, while the god certainly underwent drastic changes upon his introduction in the imperial myth cycle, Susanoo&#x27;s character already bore positive and negative features since the beginning, with both elements stemming from his association with rain. As the right quantity of rainwater was vital for ensuring a rich harvest, calamities caused by too much or too little rainfall (i.e. floods, drought, or epidemics) would have been blamed on the rain god for not doing his job properly. This, according to Gadeleva, underlies the occasional portrayal of Susanoo in a negative light.

=== Susanoo and Ne-no-Kuni ===
In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Susanoo is repeatedly associated with Ne-no-Kuni (Japanese: 根の国; the &quot;Land of Roots&quot;). While sometimes seemingly considered to be more or less identical to Yomi, the Land of the Dead (the &quot;Kojiki&quot; speaks of Ne-no-Kuni as the land of Susanoo&#x27;s deceased mother Izanami, who is stated earlier in the narrative to have become the ruler of Yomi, and calls the slope serving at its exit the Yomotsu Hirasaka, the &#x27;Flat Slope of Yomi&#x27;), it would seem that the two were originally considered to be different locations.

While Matsumura Takeo suggested that Ne-no-Kuni originally referred to the dimly remembered original homeland of the Japanese people, Emilia Gadeleva instead proposes that the two locales, while similar in that both were subterranean realms associated with darkness, differed from each other in that Yomi was associated with death, while Ne-no-Kuni, as implied by the myth about Ōnamuji, was seemingly associated with rebirth. Ne-no-Kuni being a land of revival, as per Gadeleva&#x27;s theory, is why Susanoo was connected to it: Susanoo, as the god that brought rain and with it, the harvest, was needed in Ne-no-Kuni to secure the rebirth of crops. In time, however, the two locations were confused with each other, so that by the time the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Shoki&quot; were written Ne-no-Kuni came to be seen like Yomi as an unclean realm of the dead. Gadeleva argues that this new image of Ne-no-Kuni as a place of evil and impurity contributed to Susanoo becoming more and more associated with calamity and violence.

=== Susanoo&#x27;s rampage ===
Susanoo&#x27;s acts of violence after proving his sincerity in the &quot;ukehi&quot; ritual has been a source of puzzlement to many scholars. While Edo period authors such as Motoori Norinaga and Hirata Atsutane believed that the order of the events had become confused and suggested altering the narrative sequence so that Susanoo&#x27;s ravages would come before, and not after, his victory in the &quot;ukehi&quot;, Donald Philippi criticized such solutions as &quot;untenable from a textual standpoint.&quot; (Note that as mentioned above, one of the variants in the &quot;Shoki&quot; does place Susanoo&#x27;s ravages and banishment before the performance of the &quot;ukehi&quot; ritual.)

Tsuda Sōkichi saw a political significance in this story: he interpreted Amaterasu as an emperor-symbol, while Susanoo in his view symbolized the various rebels who (unsuccessfully) rose up against the imperial court.

Emilia Gadeleva observes that Susanoo, at this point in the narrative, is portrayed similarly to the hero Yamato Takeru (Ousu-no-Mikoto), in that both were rough young men possessed with &quot;valor and ferocity&quot; (&quot;takeku-araki kokoro&quot;); their lack of control over their fierce temperament leads them to commit violent acts. It was therefore imperative to direct their energies elsewhere: Ousu-no-Mikoto was sent by his father, the Emperor Keikō, to lead conquering expeditions, while Susanoo was expelled by the heavenly gods. This ultimately resulted in the two becoming famed as heroic figures.

A prayer or &quot;norito&quot; originally recited by the priestly Nakatomi clan in the presence of the court during the Great Exorcism (大祓, &quot;Ōharae&quot;) ritual of the last day of the sixth month, more commonly known today as the &quot;Ōharae no Kotoba&quot; (大祓詞, &#x27;Words of the Great Exorcism&#x27;), lists eight &quot;heavenly sins&quot; (Japanese: 天つ罪, &quot;amatsu-tsumi&quot;), most of which are agricultural in nature:

# Breaking down the ridges
# Covering up the ditches
# Releasing the irrigation sluices
# Double planting
# Setting up stakes
# Skinning alive
# Skinning backward
# Defecation

1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 are committed by Susanoo in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, while 3, 4, 5 are attributed to him in the &quot;Shoki&quot;. In ancient Japanese society, offenses related to agriculture were regarded as abhorrent as those that caused ritual impurity.

One of the offensive acts Susanoo committed during his rampage was &#x27;skinning backward&#x27; (逆剥, &quot;sakahagi&quot;) the &quot;Ame-no-Fuchikoma&quot; (Japanese: 天の斑駒, &quot;Heavenly-Piebald Horse&quot;). Regarding this, William George Aston observed, &quot;Indian myth has a piebald or spotted deer or cow among celestial objects. The idea is probably suggested by the appearance of the stars.&quot; Nelly Naumann (1982) meanwhile interpreted the spotted horse as a lunar symbol, with Susanoo&#x27;s action being equivalent to the devouring or killing of the moon. To Naumann, the act of flaying itself, because it is performed in reverse, is intended to be a magical act that caused death. Indeed, in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; when Susanoo throws the flayed horse (or its hide) to Amaterasu&#x27;s weaving hall, one of the weaving maidens injures herself and dies. (In the &quot;Shoki&quot;, it is Amaterasu herself who is alarmed and injured.) Emilia Gadeleva meanwhile connects Susanoo&#x27;s act of skinning and flinging the horse with ancient Korean rainmaking rituals, which involved animal sacrifice.

The gods punish Susanoo for his rampages by cutting off his beard, fingernails, and toenails. One textual tradition in which the relevant passage is read as &quot;cutting off his beard and causing the nails of his hands and feet &quot;to be extracted&quot;&quot; (亦切鬚及手足爪令拔而) suggests that this was something along the lines of corporal punishment. Another tradition which reads the passage as &quot;cutting off his beard and the nails of his hands and feet, &quot;had him exorcised&quot;&quot; (亦切鬚及手足爪令祓而) meanwhile suggests that this was an act of purification, in which the sins and pollution that adhered to Susanoo are removed, thus turning him from a destroyer of life into a giver of life.

== Family ==










=== Consorts ===

Susanoo&#x27;s consorts are:

*Kushinadahime (櫛名田比売), daughter of Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi, children of Ōyamatsumi, a son of Izanagi and elder brother of Susanoo (&quot;Kojiki&quot;, &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;)
:Also known under the following names:
:*Kushiinadahime (奇稲田姫, &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;)
:*Inadahime (稲田媛, &quot;Shoki&quot;)
:*Makami-Furu-Kushiinadahime (真髪触奇稲田媛, &quot;Shoki&quot;)
:*Kushiinada-Mitoyomanurahime-no-Mikoto (久志伊奈太美等与麻奴良比売命, Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot;)
*Kamuōichihime (神大市比売), another daughter of Ōyamatsumi (&quot;Kojiki&quot;)
*Samirahime-no-Mikoto (佐美良比売命), a goddess worshiped in Yasaka Shrine reckoned as a consort of Susanoo

=== Offspring ===
Susanoo&#x27;s child by Kushinadahime is variously identified as Yashimajinumi-no-Kami (八島士奴美神) in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and as Ōnamuchi-no-Kami (大己貴神) in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;&#x27;s main narrative. (In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and in variant accounts contained in the &quot;Shoki&quot;, Ōnamuchi / Ōnamuji (Ōkuninushi) is instead Susanoo&#x27;s descendant.)

Susanoo&#x27;s children by Kamuōichihime meanwhile are:

* Ōtoshi-no-Kami (大年神)
* Ukanomitama-no-Kami (宇迦之御魂神)

Susanoo&#x27;s children who are either born without a female partner or whose mother is unidentified are:

* The Munakata goddesses of Munakata Taisha in Munakata, Fukuoka Prefecture
:* Takiribime-no-Mikoto (多紀理毘売命)
:Also known as Tagorihime (田心姫)
:* Ichikishimahime-no-Mikoto (市寸島比売命)
:Also known as Okitsushimahime (瀛津島姫)
:* Tagitsuhime-no-Mikoto (多岐都比売命)
* Suseribime-no-Mikoto (須勢理毘売命)
:Also known as Wakasuserihime-no-Mikoto (和加須世理比売命) in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot;
* Isotakeru / Itakeru-no-Mikoto (五十猛命)
* Ōyatsuhime-no-Mikoto (大屋津姫命)
* Tsumatsuhime-no-Mikoto (枛津姫命)

Deities identified as Susanoo&#x27;s children found only in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot; are:

* Kunioshiwake-no-Mikoto (国忍別命)
* Aohata-Sakusahiko-no-Mikoto (青幡佐草日古命)
* Iwasakahiko-no-Mikoto (磐坂日子命)
* Tsukihoko-Tooruhiko-no-Mikoto (衝桙等番留比古命)
* Tsurugihiko-no-Mikoto (都留支日子命)
* Yanowakahime-no-Mikoto (八野若日女命)

An Edo period text, the &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot; (和漢三才図会, lit. &quot;Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia&quot;), identifies a monstrous goddess known as Ama-no-Zako (天逆毎) as an offspring of Susanoo.

== Worship ==

In addition to his connections with the sea and tempests, due to his mythical role as the slayer of the Yamata no Orochi and his historical association with pestilence deities such as Gozu Tennō, Susanoo is also venerated as a god who wards off misfortune and calamity, being invoked especially against illness and disease. As his heroic act helped him win the hand of Kushinadahime, he is also considered to be a patron of love and marriage, such as in Hikawa Shrine in Saitama Prefecture (see below).

=== Shrines ===

Susanoo is worshiped in a number of shrines throughout Japan, especially in Shimane Prefecture (the eastern part of which is the historical Izumo Province). A few notable examples are:

* Susa Shrine (須佐神社) in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture
:Listed in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot; as one of five shrines in Iishi District that were registered with the Department of Divinities, this shrine is identified as the place in what was formerly the township of Susa where Susanoo chose to enshrine his spirit. The shrine was also known as Jūsansho Daimyōjin (十三所大明神) and Susa no Ōmiya (須佐大宮 &#x27;Great Shrine of Susa&#x27;) during the medieval and early modern periods. The shrine&#x27;s priestly lineage, the Susa (or Inada) clan (須佐氏 / 稲田氏), were considered to be the descendants of Susanoo via his son Yashimashino-no-Mikoto (八島篠命, the &quot;Kojiki&quot;&#x27;s Yashimajinumi-no-Kami) or Ōkuninushi. Besides Susanoo, his consort Kushinadahime and her parents Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi are also enshrined here as auxiliary deities.
* Suga Shrine (須我神社) in Unnan, Shimane Prefecture
:This shrine, claimed to stand on the site of the palace Susanoo built after defeating the Yamata no Orochi, enshrines Susanoo, Kushinadahime, and their son Suga-no-Yuyamanushi-Minasarohiko-Yashima-no-Mikoto (清之湯山主三名狭漏彦八島野命, i.e. Yashimajinumi-no-Kami). Listed in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot; as one of sixteen shrines in Ōhara District not registered with the Department of Divinities.
* Yaegaki Shrine (八重垣神社), in Matsue, Shimane Prefecture
:Dedicated to Susanoo, Kushinadahime, Ōnamuchi (Ōkuninushi) and Aohata-Sakusahiko, the shrine takes its name from the &#x27;eightfold fence&#x27; (&quot;yaegaki&quot;) mentioned in Susanoo&#x27;s song. The shrine&#x27;s legend claims that Susanoo hid Kushinadahime in the forest within the shrine&#x27;s precincts, enclosing her in a fence, when he slew the Yamata no Orochi. Identified with the Sakusa Shrine (佐久佐社) mentioned in the Izumo &quot;Fudoki&quot;.
* Kumano Taisha (熊野大社) in Matsue, Shimane Prefecture
:Reckoned as Izumo Province&#x27;s &quot;ichinomiya&quot; alongside Izumo Grand Shrine. Not to be confused with the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex in Wakayama Prefecture. Its deity, known under the name &#x27;Izanagi-no-Himanago Kaburogi Kumano-no-Ōkami Kushimikenu-no-Mikoto&#x27; (伊邪那伎日真名子加夫呂伎熊野大神櫛御気野命, &quot;Beloved Child of Izanagi, Divine Ancestor [and] Great Deity of Kumano, Kushimikenu-no-Mikoto&#x27;), is identified with Susanoo. The shrine is also considered in myth to be where the use of fire originated; two ancient fire-making tools, a hand drill (燧杵 &quot;hikiri-kine&quot;) and a hearthboard (燧臼 &quot;hikiri-usu&quot;) are kept in the shrine and used in the shrine&#x27;s Fire Lighting Ceremony (鑚火祭 &quot;Kiribi-matsuri&quot; or &quot;Sanka-sai&quot;) held every October.
* (須佐神社) in Arida, Wakayama Prefecture

=== Gion shrines ===

The following shrines were originally associated with Gozu Tennō:

* Yasaka Shrine (八坂神社) in Gion, Higashiyama, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture – Head shrine of the Yasaka shrine network
* Tsushima Shrine (津島神社) in Tsushima, Aichi Prefecture – Head shrine of the Tsushima shrine network
* Hiromine Shrine (広峰神社) in Himeji, Hyōgo Prefecture

=== Hikawa Shrine network ===
The Hikawa Shrine network concentrated in Saitama and Tokyo (historical Musashi Province) also has Susanoo as its focus of worship, often alongside Kushinadahime.

*Hikawa Shrine (氷川神社) in Ōmiya, Saitama, Saitama Prefecture
*Hikawa Shrine in Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture
*Hikawa Shrine in Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo

*Susanoo Shrine in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture

== In Japanese performing arts ==
*The iwami kagura – Orochi
*The jōruri – &quot;Nihon Furisode Hajime&quot; () by Chikamatsu Monzaemon

== Influence outside of Japan ==

In the 20th century, Susanoo was depicted as the common ancestor of the modern Koreans while the Japanese were considered to be descendants of Amaterasu during the Japanese occupation of Korea by historians such as Shiratori Kurakichi, founder of the discipline of Oriental History (Tōyōshi 東洋史) in Tokyo Imperial University.

The theory linked the Koreans to Susanoo and in turn the Japanese which ultimately legitimized the colonization of the Korean peninsula by the Japanese.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Yamata Amasung Keibu Keioiba&quot; () is a Meitei language play that interweaves the stories of the two legendary creatures, Yamata-no-Orochi slain by Susanoo of Japanese folklore and Keibu Keioiba of Meitei folklore (Manipuri folklore). In the play, the role of Susanoo was played by &quot;Romario Thoudam Paona&quot;.

Along with Yamato Takeru, he was portrayed by Toshiro Mifune in &quot;The Birth of Japan&quot;. The film suggests Susanoo&#x27;s grief over Izanami and resentment towards Izanagi caused his violent rampage.

<text>Chester is a cathedral city in Cheshire, England, on the River Dee, close to the England–Wales border. With a built-up area population of 92,760 in 2021, it is the most populous settlement in the borough of Cheshire West and Chester. It is also the historic county town of Cheshire and the second-largest settlement in Cheshire after Warrington.

Chester was founded in 79 AD as a &quot;castrum&quot; or Roman fort with the name Deva Victrix during the reign of Emperor Vespasian. One of the main army camps in Roman Britain, Deva later became a major civilian settlement. In 689, King Æthelred of Mercia founded the Minster Church of West Mercia, which later became Chester&#x27;s first cathedral, and the Angles extended and strengthened the walls to protect the city against the Danes. Chester was one of the last cities in England to fall to the Normans, and William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a castle to dominate the town and the nearby Welsh border. Chester was granted city status in 1541.

The city walls of Chester are some of the best-preserved in the country and have Grade I listed status. Apart from a section, the walls are almost complete. It has several medieval buildings. However, many of the black-and-white buildings within the city centre are Victorian restorations, originating from the Black-and-white Revival movement. The Industrial Revolution brought railways, canals, and new roads to the city, which saw substantial expansion and development; Chester Town Hall and the Grosvenor Museum are examples of Victorian architecture from this period. Tourism, the retail industry, public administration, and financial services are important to the modern economy. Chester signs itself as &quot;Chester International Heritage City&quot; on road signs on the main roads entering the city.

==History==

Charles Leigh concluded in 1701 that there was probably a British city called Genuina (or Gunia) before the arrival of the Romans.

===Roman===
The Roman Legio II Adiutrix during the reign of the Emperor Vespasian founded Chester in AD 79 as a &quot;castrum&quot; or Roman fort with the name &quot;Deva Victrix&quot;. It was established in the land of the Celtic Cornovii, according to ancient cartographer Ptolemy, as a fortress during the Roman expansion northward, and was named Deva either after the goddess of the Dee, or directly from the British name for the river. The &#x27;victrix&#x27; part of the name was taken from the title of the Legio XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot; which was based at Deva. Central Chester&#x27;s four main roads, Eastgate, Northgate, Watergate and Bridge Street, follow routes laid out at this time.

A civilian settlement grew around the military base, which probably originated from trade with the fortress. The fortress was 20% larger than other fortresses in the Roman province of Britannia built around the same time at York (Eboracum) and Caerleon (Isca Augusta); this has led to the suggestion that the fortress, rather than London (Londinium), was intended to become the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Superior. The civilian amphitheatre, which was built in the 1st century, could seat between 8,000 and 10,000 people. It is the largest known military amphitheatre in Britain, and is also a Scheduled Monument. The Minerva Shrine in the Roman quarry is the only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain.

The fortress was garrisoned by the legion until at least the late 4th century. Although the army had abandoned the fortress by 410 when the Romans retreated from Britannia, the Romano-British civilian settlement continued (probably with some Roman veterans staying behind with their wives and children) and its occupants probably continued to use the fortress and its defences as protection from raiders from the Irish Sea.

===Medieval===
After the Roman troops withdrew, the Romano-British established several petty kingdoms. Chester is thought to have become part of Powys. &quot;Deverdoeu&quot; was a Welsh name for Chester as late as the 12th century (cf &quot;Dyfrdwy&quot;, Welsh for the river Dee). Another, attested in the 9th-century &quot;History of the Britons&quot; traditionally attributed to Nennius, is &#x27; (&quot;Fort&quot; or &quot;City of the Legion&quot;); this later developed into &#x27; and then the modern Welsh &quot;&quot;. (The town&#x27;s importance is noted by its taking the simpler form in each case, while Isca Augusta in Monmouthshire, another important legionary base, was known first as Caerleon on the Usk, and now as Caerleon). King Arthur is said to have fought his ninth battle at the &quot;city of the legions&quot; (&quot;Caerlleon&quot;) and later St Augustine came to the city to try to unite the church, and held his synod with the Welsh Bishops.

In 616, Æthelfrith of Northumbria defeated a Welsh army at the brutal and decisive Battle of Chester and probably established the Anglo-Saxon position in the area from then on. The Northumbrian Anglo-Saxons used an Old English equivalent of the British name, &quot;&quot;, which was current until the 11th century, when, in a further parallel with Welsh usage, the first element fell out of use and the simple name Chester emerged. In 689, King Æthelred of Mercia founded the Minster Church of West Mercia on what is considered to be an early Christian site: it is known as the Minster of St John the Baptist, Chester (now St John&#x27;s Church) which later became the first cathedral. Much later, the body of Æthelred&#x27;s niece, St Werburgh, was removed from Hanbury in Staffordshire in the 9th century and, to save it from desecration by Danish marauders was reburied in the Church of SS Peter &amp; Paul – later to become the Abbey Church (the present cathedral). Her name is still remembered in St Werburgh&#x27;s Street, which passes alongside the cathedral, and near the city walls, and in St Werburgh&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in Grosvenor Park Road.

The Anglo-Saxons extended and strengthened the walls of Chester to protect the city against the Danes, who occupied it for a short time until Alfred seized all the cattle and laid waste on the surrounding land to drive them out. It was Alfred&#x27;s daughter Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, that built the new Anglo-Saxon &quot;burh&quot;. A new Church dedicated to St Peter alone was founded in AD 907 by the Lady Æthelfleda at what was to become the Cross. In 973, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that, two years after his coronation at Bath, King Edgar of England came to Chester where he held his court in a palace in a place now known as Edgar&#x27;s Field near the old Dee bridge in Handbridge. Taking the helm of a barge, he was rowed the short distance up the River Dee from Edgar&#x27;s Field to the great Minster Church of St John the Baptist by six (the monk Henry Bradshaw records he was rowed by eight kings) tributary kings called &quot;reguli&quot;.

In 1071, King William the Conqueror made Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, who built Chester Castle, the first Earl of Chester (second creation). From the 14th to the 18th century, the city&#x27;s prominent position in North West England meant it was commonly known as Westchester. This name was used by Celia Fiennes when she visited the city in 1698. and is also used in &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;.

===Early modern period===

In the English Civil War, Chester sided with the royalist cause of King Charles I but was subdued by the Parliamentarians in 1643. The Mayor of Chester, Charles Walley, was removed from office and replaced by Alderman William Edwards. Another alderman, Francis Gamull, a royalist MP and former Mayor, was ordered to surrender Dee Mills: they were to be demolished, and new mills built on city land.

===Industrial history===

Chester played a significant part in the Industrial Revolution, which began in the North West of England in the late 18th century. The city village of Newtown, located northeast of the city and bounded by the Shropshire Union Canal, was at the very heart of this industry. The large Chester Cattle Market and the two Chester railway stations, Chester General and Chester Northgate Station, meant that Newtown with its cattle market and canal, and Hoole with its railways were responsible for providing the vast majority of workers and in turn, the vast amount of Chester&#x27;s wealth production throughout the Industrial Revolution.

The population was 23,115 by 1841.

===Modern era===
A considerable amount of land in Chester is owned by The 7th Duke of Westminster who owns an estate, Eaton Hall, near the village of Eccleston. He also has London properties in Mayfair.

Grosvenor is the Duke&#x27;s family name, which explains such features in the city as the Grosvenor Bridge, the Grosvenor Hotel, and Grosvenor Park. Much of Chester&#x27;s architecture dates from the Victorian era, many of the buildings being modelled on the Jacobean half-timbered style and designed by John Douglas, who was employed by the Duke as his principal architect. He had a trademark of twisted chimney stacks, many of which can be seen on the buildings in the city centre.

Douglas designed, amongst other buildings, the Grosvenor Hotel and the City Baths. In 1911, Douglas&#x27; protégé and city architect James Strong designed the then-active fire station on the west side of Northgate Street. Another feature of all buildings belonging to the estate of Westminster is the &#x27;Grey Diamonds&#x27; – a weaving pattern of grey bricks in the red brickwork laid out in a diamond formation.

Towards the end of World War II, a lack of affordable housing meant many problems for Chester. Large areas of farmland on the city&#x27;s outskirts were developed as residential areas in the 1950s and early 1960s, producing, for instance, the suburb of Blacon. In 1964, a bypass was built through and around the city centre to combat traffic congestion.

These new developments caused local concern as the physicality and, therefore, the feel of the city was being dramatically altered. In 1968, a report by Donald Insall, in collaboration with authorities and government, recommended that historic buildings be preserved in Chester. Consequently, the buildings were used in new and different ways instead of being demolished.

The City Conservation Area was designated in 1969. Over the next twenty years, the emphasis was placed on saving historic buildings, such as The Falcon Inn, Dutch Houses, and Kings Buildings.

On 13 January 2002, Chester was granted the first UK Fairtrade City status by the Fairtrade Foundation. In 2011 this was extended to the entire borough.

==Governance==

There is one main tier of local government covering Chester, at unitary authority level, being Cheshire West and Chester Council. Much of the Chester urban area is an unparished area, but some of the suburbs are included in civil parishes such as Great Boughton and Upton-by-Chester and there is also a small parish in the centre of the city called Chester Castle.

The built-up area straddles the two parliamentary constituencies of Chester North and Neston and Chester South and Eddisbury.

===Administrative history===
Chester was an ancient borough, with its earliest known charters dating from the twelfth century. It was given the right to appoint its own sheriffs in 1506, making it a county corporate, outside the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Cheshire. The borough gained city status in 1541 following the creation of the Diocese of Chester. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised the way many boroughs operated across the country. As part of the 1836 reforms the borough was enlarged beyond its medieval boundaries to include the Boughton area.

When elected county councils were created in 1889, Chester was considered large enough for its existing borough council to provide county-level services. It was therefore made a county borough, independent from Cheshire County Council. The borough was enlarged in 1936, when it absorbed Blacon, and again in 1954, when it absorbed Hoole. The county borough was abolished in 1974, merging with the former Chester Rural District and Tarvin Rural District which covered the surrounding rural areas to create a new Chester district, which was a district-level authority with Cheshire County Council providing county-level services. Chester&#x27;s city status was extended to cover the whole of the district created in 1974. In 1992, Chester City Council was given the right to appoint a Lord Mayor.

Chester City Council was abolished in 2009 when local government across Cheshire was reorganised; Cheshire County Council was also abolished, and the three districts of Chester, Ellesmere Port and Neston and Vale Royal merged to form a unitary authority called Cheshire West and Chester. Charter trustees were established to maintain Chester&#x27;s city status and appoint the Lord Mayor. Chester&#x27;s city status is now formally held by the area of the charter trustees, comprising the 15 wards of Cheshire West and Chester which correspond to the area of the pre-2009 Chester City Council. The official city therefore includes rural areas beyond Chester&#x27;s built-up area, and had a total population of 138,875 at the 2021 census, compared to 92,760 for the built-up area.

==Geography==

Chester lies at the southern end of a Triassic sandstone ridge that rises to a height of 42 m within a natural S-bend in the River Dee (before the course was altered in the 18th century). The bedrock, also known as the Chester Pebble Beds, is noticeable because of the many small stones trapped within its strata. Retreating glacial sheet ice also deposited quantities of sand and marl across the area where boulder clay was absent.

The eastern and northern parts of Chester consisted of heathland and forest. The western side towards the Dee Estuary was marsh and wetland habitats.

===Climate===
Chester has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), typical of the British Isles but more susceptible to cold than the extreme south. Despite its proximity to the Irish Sea, the temperature regime is similar to areas further inland, owing to the shelter provided by the Pennines to the northeast and the Welsh Mountains to the southwest. The nearest official weather station is at Hawarden Airport, about west of the city centre.

The absolute maximum temperature recorded was on 18 July 2022, the highest temperature reported in Wales. In an average year, the warmest day should reach , and 12.0 days in total should attain a temperature of or higher. Given the correctly aligned breezy conditions, a föhn effect will operate, meaning local temperatures are somewhat higher than the surrounding area.

The absolute minimum temperature recorded was during January 1982. Annually, an average of 42.2 air frosts should be recorded.

Annual rainfall is barely over 700mm due to a rain shadow effect caused by the Welsh Mountains. Over 1mm of rain is reported on 135.5 days.

==Divisions and suburbs==

The Chester Urban Area is an urban area surrounding the city of Chester. The urban area includes the town of Saltney in Flintshire, North Wales and the outlying suburbs of Bache, Blacon, Boughton, Curzon Park, Great Boughton, Handbridge, Huntington, Hoole, Kingsway, Lache, Moston, Newton, Newtown, Queens Park, Upton, Vicars Cross and Westminster Park.

Areas just outside the city include: Christleton, Eccleston, Guilden Sutton, Littleton, Mickle Trafford, Mollington, Saughall and Waverton.

==Landmarks and tourist attractions==
The more unusual landmarks in the city are the city walls, the Rows and the black-and-white architecture. The walls encircle the bounds of the medieval city and constitute the most complete city walls in Britain, the full circuit measuring nearly . The only break in the circuit is in the south-west section in front of County Hall. A footpath runs along the top of the walls, crossing roads by bridges over Eastgate, Northgate, St Martin&#x27;s Gate, Watergate, Bridgegate, Newgate, and the Wolf Gate, and passing a series of structures, namely Phoenix Tower (or King Charles&#x27; Tower), Morgan&#x27;s Mount, the Goblin Tower (or Pemberton&#x27;s Parlour) and Bonewaldesthorne&#x27;s Tower with a spur leading to the Water Tower and Thimbleby&#x27;s Tower. On Eastgate is Eastgate Clock, which is said to be the most photographed clock face in England after those that share the tower with Big Ben.

The Rows are unique in Britain. They consist of buildings with shops or dwellings on the lowest two storeys. The shops or dwellings on the ground floor are often lower than the street and are entered by steps, which sometimes lead to a crypt-like vault. Those on the first floor are entered behind a continuous walkway, often with a sloping shelf between the walkway and the railings overlooking the street. Much of the architecture of central Chester looks medieval and some of it is, but by far the greater part of it, including most of the black-and-white buildings, is Victorian, a result of what Pevsner termed the &quot;black-and-white revival&quot; pioneered by architects John Douglas and T.M. Lockwood.

The most prominent buildings in the city centre are the town hall and the cathedral. The town hall was opened in 1869. It is in Gothic Revival style and has a tower and a short spire. The cathedral was formerly the church of St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey. Its architecture dates back to the Norman era, with additions made most centuries since. A series of major restorations took place in the 19th century, and in 1975, a separate bell tower was opened. The elaborately carved canopies of the choir stalls are considered to be among the finest in the country. Also in the cathedral is the shrine of St Werburgh. The former monastic buildings are north of the cathedral. The oldest church in the city is St John&#x27;s, which is outside the city walls and was at one time the cathedral church. The church was shortened after the dissolution of the monasteries, and ruins of the former east end remain outside the church. Much of the interior is in Norman style and this is considered to be the best example of 11th–12th-century church architecture in Cheshire. At the intersection of the former Roman roads is Chester Cross, to the north of which is the small church of St Peter&#x27;s, which is in use as an ecumenical centre. Other churches are now redundant and have other uses: St Michael&#x27;s in Bridge Street is a heritage centre, St Mary-on-the-Hill is an educational centre, and Holy Trinity now acts as the Guildhall. Other notable buildings include the preserved shot tower, the highest structure in Chester, and St Thomas of Canterbury Church.
Roman remains can still be found in the city, particularly in the basements of some of the buildings and in the lower parts of the northern section of the city walls. The most important Roman feature is the amphitheatre just outside the walls, which underwent archaeological investigation in the early 21st century. Roman artefacts are on display in the Roman Gardens which run parallel to the city walls from Newgate to the River Dee, where there&#x27;s also a reconstructed hypocaust system. An original hypocaust system discovered in the 1720s can be seen in the basement of 39 Bridge Street, which is open to the public.

Of the original medieval city, the most important surviving structure is Chester Castle, particularly the Agricola Tower. Much of the rest of the castle has been replaced by the neoclassical county court and its entrance, the Propyleum. To the south of the city runs the River Dee, with its 11th-century weir. The river is crossed by the Old Dee Bridge, dating from the 13th century, the Grosvenor Bridge of 1832, and Queen&#x27;s Park suspension bridge (for pedestrians). To the southwest of the city, the River Dee curves towards the north. The area between the river and the city walls here is known as the Roodee and contains Chester Racecourse, which holds a series of horse races and other events. The first recorded race meet in England at Roodee Fields was on 9 February 1540. The Shropshire Union Canal runs to the north of the city and a branch leads from it to the River Dee.

The major museum in Chester is the Grosvenor Museum, which includes a collection of Roman tombstones and an art gallery. Associated with the museum is 20 Castle Street, which has rooms furnished in different historical styles. The Deva Roman Experience has hands-on exhibits and a reconstructed Roman street. One of the blocks in the forecourt of the Castle houses the Cheshire Military Museum.

The major public park in Chester is Grosvenor Park. On the south side of the River Dee, in Handbridge, is Edgar&#x27;s Field, another public park, which contains Minerva&#x27;s Shrine, a Roman shrine to the goddess Minerva. A war memorial to those who died in the world wars is in the town hall and it contains the names of all Chester servicemen who died in the First World War.

There are cruises on the River Dee and the Shropshire Union Canal, as well as guided open-air bus tours. The river cruises and bus tours start from a riverside area known as the Groves, which contains seating and a bandstand. A series of festivals is organised in the city, including mystery plays, a summer music festival and a literature festival. There is a Tourist Information Centre at the town hall.

The Cheshire Police Constabulary was historically based in the city from its foundation in 1857. Originally on Seller Street, its headquarters moved to Egerton Street (both since redeveloped), and then from 1870 to 113 Foregate Street, where Parker&#x27;s Buildings now stand. In 1883, the police headquarters moved to 142 Foregate Street, Chester, now preserved as a Grade II listed building. The county police headquarters has since moved again, in 1967, to Nuns Road before leaving the city in 2003 for Clemonds Hey, Winsford.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 census, Chester had a large White British proportion of around 110,000 or 90.9% of the population. 1.0% described themselves as Irish. 3.6% as Other White. 2.2% described themselves as Asian. 1.3% described themselves as Mixed Race. 0.6% described themselves as Black or Black British and 0.3% are classed as other. Cheshire West and Chester also has a large number of Christians at 76.4%. 14% have no religion, and 8.2% are not stated. 0.7% are Muslim. 0.1% are Sikhs. 0.1% are Jewish. 0.2% are Buddhists.

The population was forecast to grow by 5% from 2005 to 2021. The resident population for Chester District in the 2001 Census was 118,200. This represents 17.5% of the Cheshire County total (1.8% of the North West population).

==Education==
The city is home to the University of Chester. Formerly a teacher training college, it gained full university status in 2005 and is the county&#x27;s main provider of tertiary education.

Cheshire College – South &amp; West is a vocational college with campuses in Handbridge as well as Ellesmere Port and Crewe.

The King&#x27;s School, a private school, was established by King Henry VIII in 1541. The girls-only Queen&#x27;s School, another independent school, was founded in 1878.

Other secondary schools include:
* Bishops&#x27; Blue Coat C of E
* Catholic High School
* Queens Park High School
* Upton-by-Chester High School
* Blacon High School
* Christleton High School

==Culture==

The major museum in Chester is the Grosvenor Museum, which includes a collection of Roman tombstones and an art gallery. Associated with the museum is a building on 20 Castle Street that has rooms furnished in different historical styles. The Dewa Roman Experience has hands-on exhibits and a reconstructed Roman street. One of the blocks in the forecourt of Chester Castle houses the Cheshire Military Museum.

The £37m Storyhouse arts centre opened in the city centre in 2017. It includes a theatre, cinema, restaurant and the city&#x27;s main library. It is housed in the city&#x27;s remodelled 1936 Odeon Cinema and replaces the Gateway Theatre and the former library on Northgate Street.

Chester Little Theatre is based in Newtown and run by Chester Theatre Club. It generally stages 5 or 6 plays each year. Chester Music Theatre is based in a converted church in Boughton. There was a multiplex cinema and a ten-pin bowling alley at Greyhound Retail Park on the city&#x27;s edge, but these have closed. The cinema has moved to Broughton, just over the border in North Wales. A new Picturehouse multi-screen cinema is being built in the city centre as part of the Northgate Project, due for completion in 2022. Chester has its own film society, several amateur dramatic societies and theatre schools.

The Grove area of Chester is home to a Grade II-listed bandstand built in 1913. A programme of afternoon performances runs every weekend and Bank Holiday from May to August each year, usually including brass bands, choirs, jazz, blues, and acoustic performers. The current Bandstand Coordinator is Luke Moore, who was appointed in 2018 and has expanded the programme to include a mixture of visual art, theatre, poetry, and community events alongside a variety of musical performances.

Grosvenor Park Open Air Theatre, founded in 2010, is the only site-specific professional open-air theatre company outside London. It has an eight-week annual summer repertory season.

To the east side of the city is Chester Zoo, the UK&#x27;s largest zoo with over 11,000 animals in 110 acres of award-winning gardens.

Numerous pubs, nightclubs, and bars, some of which are located in medieval buildings, populate the city. One such example is Quaintways.

===Music===
Chester has had a professional classical music festival – the Chester Summer Music Festival, beginning in 1967 and regularly since 1978. The festival went into liquidation in 2012. A major new music festival was launched in March 2013 (previously known as Chester Performs), running annually every summer. The Chester Music Festival features the professional music group &quot;Ensemble Deva&quot; led by Giovanni Guzzo and Music Director Clark Rundell. Ensemble Deva regularly features soloists and section leaders from the country&#x27;s leading symphony orchestras, including Liverpool Philharmonic, the Hallé and Manchester Camerata.

The composer Howard Skempton was born in Chester in 1947.

Chester has a brass band that was formed in 1853. It was known as the Blue Coat Band and today as The City of Chester Band. It is a third section brass band with a training band. Its members wear a blue-jacketed uniform with an image of the Eastgate clock on the breast pocket of the blazer.

Chester Music Society was founded in 1948 as a small choral society. It now encompasses four sections: The Choir has 170 members drawn from Chester and the surrounding district; The Youth Choirs support three choirs: Youth Choir, Preludes, and the Alumni Choir; Celebrity Concerts promote a season of six high-quality concerts each year; The club is a long established section which aims to encourage young musicians and in many cases offers the first opportunity to perform in public.

The Chester Philharmonic Orchestra (CPO) was founded in 1884 and is one of the premier non-professional orchestras in North West England. Formerly the Chester Orchestral Society, it performs music from a vast repertoire. The Orchestra is a registered charity and usually performs four or five concerts each year (including an annual carol concert) in the magnificent setting of Chester&#x27;s ancient Cathedral under the direction of well-known professional conductors.

Telford&#x27;s Warehouse, Alexander&#x27;s Jazz Bar and The Live Rooms are the city&#x27;s leading live music venues.

An annual popular music festival started in 2011 called Chester Rocks. It is held on the grounds of the Chester Racecourse.

The founder members of the band River City People (guitarist Tim Speed and his drummer brother Paul Speed) are from Chester. They had a number of hits in the early 1990s. Later into the same decade, Mansun formed in the city after singer Paul Draper met guitarist Dominic Chad whilst working in the local former Fat Cat Bar. More recently, Shy and the Fight, featuring Chester-based musicians, has achieved national attention via airplay on Radio 1 and Radio 2, also appearing at Wychwood and Swn festivals. Other bands that have gone on to achieve a degree of success outside of the city include The Suns, The Wayriders, Motion Empire, Casino and Face Of Christ and The Lovelies.

===Media===
Chester&#x27;s newspapers include the weekly paid-for &quot;Chester Chronicle&quot; and freesheet &quot;Chester Standard&quot;. The &quot;Chester Evening Leader&quot; and &quot;Midweek Chronicle&quot; are no longer in publication.

Chester&#x27;s Dee Radio is the city&#x27;s radio station, with Heart North West, Capital North West and Wales and BBC Radio Merseyside also broadcasting locally. Lache FM is currently Chester&#x27;s only Community radio station.

Television in Chester is served by &quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot; and &quot;ITV Granada Reports &quot;, and with its close proximity to North Wales, viewers can also receive &quot;BBC Wales Today&quot; and &quot;ITV News Wales at Six &quot;. Chester is where Channel 4&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; is set (although most filming takes place around Liverpool).

===In literature===
Lydia Sigourney gives her impressions of the city in her poem &quot;Chester&quot; published in &quot;Pleasant Memories of Pleasant Lands&quot;, 1842. These relate to her visit to this country from America in 1840.

==Economy==

Chester&#x27;s primary industries are now the service industries, which are tourism, retail, public administration, and financial services. Many domestic and international tourists visit to view the city&#x27;s landmarks and heritage, with a complementary benefit to hotels and restaurants.

The city&#x27;s central shopping area includes its unique Rows or galleries (two levels of shops), which date from medieval times and are believed to include the oldest shop front in England. The city has many chain stores. Also, it features an indoor market and two main indoor shopping centres: The Grosvenor Shopping Centre and the Forum (a reference to the city&#x27;s Roman past). There are retail parks to the west and south. Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet and Broughton Retail Park are near the city.

Chester has a relatively large financial sector including Bank of America, NFU Mutual, Lloyds Bank, Virgin Money, Quilter, and M&amp;S Bank. The price comparison website moneysupermarket.com is based over the Welsh border in Ewloe. Chester has its own university, the University of Chester, and a major hospital, the Countess of Chester Hospital, named after Diana, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester.

Just over the Welsh border to the west, Broughton is home to a large Airbus UK factory (formerly British Aerospace), employing around 6,000 staff, where the wings of the Airbus aeroplanes are manufactured. There are food processing plants to the north and west. The Iceland frozen food company is based in nearby Deeside.

===Developments===

In 2007, Chester City Council announced a 10-year plan to see Chester become a &quot;must-see European destination&quot;. At a cost of £1.3 billion it was branded Chester Renaissance.

The Northgate Development project began in 2007 with the demolition of St. Martin&#x27;s House on the city&#x27;s ring road. At a cost of £460 million, Chester City Council and developers ING hoped to create a new quarter for Chester. The development was intended see the demolition of the market hall, bus station, theatre and NCP car park. They were to be replaced with a multi-storey car park, bus exchange, performing arts centre, library, homes, retail space and a department store which will be anchored by House of Fraser. There project was put on hold in 2008 due to the economic downturn. However a number of Chester&#x27;s other Renaissance projects continued, including a new health centre, offices and apartments in the Delamere Street development, and a hotel and new headquarters for Cheshire West and Chester Council in the £60million HQ development. Work on a new bus station started in October 2015 and it opened in June 2017. The Northgate Project is now being led by the council and is due to include a new market hall, cinema, multi-storey car park and restaurant units on the site of the former bus exchange. Building work has begun and is due to be completed in 2022.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The city is a hub for major roads, including the M53 motorway towards the Wirral Peninsula and Liverpool and the M56 motorway towards Manchester. The A55 road runs along the North Wales coast to Holyhead and the A483 links the city to nearby Wrexham and Swansea in Wales.

===Buses===
Bus transport in the city is provided by Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire and Arriva Buses Wales; the council-owned and operated ChesterBus (formerly Chester City Transport) was sold to First Chester &amp; The Wirral in mid-2007. Services connect the city with Liverpool, Rhyl, Flint, Holywell, Ellesmere Port, Northwich and Whitchurch. A National Express route between London and Liverpool stops in Chester.

A new bus exchange was built in the city at Gorse Stacks and opened to its first services on 30 May 2017.

Chester has four dedicated park and ride sites, three of them (Upton, Boughton Heath and Wrexham Road) along major roads surrounding the city.

===Railways===
Chester railway station is served by four train operating companies:
* Avanti West Coast provides inter-city services between London Euston, and 
* Merseyrail operates electric services on the Wirral Line, on a circular route via 
* Northern Trains provides a regular service to , via and , on the Mid-Cheshire line
* Transport for Wales operates services on four routes:
** to Holyhead, via 
** Manchester Piccadilly to , via the North Wales Main Line; some services continue to Holyhead
** , via 
** Crewe, via Beeston Castle.

====History====
The city formerly had two railway stations: Chester General remains in use (now named simply &quot;Chester&quot;), but Chester Northgate closed in 1969 as a result of the Beeching cuts. Chester Northgate, which was north-east of the city centre, opened in 1875 as a terminus for the Cheshire Lines Committee. Trains travelled via Northwich to ; later, services also went to Seacombe (Wallasey) and Wrexham Central via . It was demolished in the 1970s and the site is now part of the Northgate Arena leisure centre.

Chester General opened in 1848 and was designed with an Italianate frontage. It now has seven designated platforms but once had fourteen. The station lost its original roof in the 1972 Chester General rail crash. In September 2007, extensive renovations took place to improve pedestrian access and parking. Chester General also had a sizeable marshalling yard and a motive power depot, most of which has now been replaced with housing.
In late 1847, the Dee bridge disaster occurred when a bridge span collapsed as a train passed over the River Dee by the Roodee. Five people were killed in the accident. The bridge had been designed and built by famed railway engineer Robert Stephenson for the Chester and Holyhead Railway. A Royal Commission inquiry found that the trusses were made of cast iron beams that had inadequate strength for their purpose. A national scandal ensued and many new bridges of similar design were either taken down or heavily altered.

===Cycling===
There are a series of colour-coded signposted cycling routes around the city.

On 19 June 2008, then Secretary of State for Transport Ruth Kelly named Chester as a cycling demonstration town. This initiative allowed for substantial financial support to improve cycling facilities and a number of schemes were planned.

Potential schemes included a new pedestrian and cycling bridge across the River Dee, linking the Meadows with Huntington and Great Boughton; an access route between Curzon Park and the Roodee; an extension to the existing greenway route from Hoole to Guilden Sutton and Mickle Trafford; and an access route between the Millennium cycle route and Deva Link. However, following a reorganisation of the local authorities effective 1 April 2009, the Conservative-led administration of the newly established Cheshire West and Chester council was not supportive, so comparatively little was actually achieved.

Many of the ideas generated at the time were captured in a &quot;Cycle Chester Masterplan&quot; document.

===Canals===

The Chester Canal was constructed with locks leading down to the River Dee. Canal boats could enter the river at high tide to load goods directly onto seagoing vessels. The port facilities at Crane Wharf, by Chester racecourse, made an important contribution to the commercial development of the North West region. 
The original Chester Canal was constructed to run from the River Dee near Sealand Road to Nantwich in south Cheshire and opened in 1774. In 1805, the Wirral section of the Ellesmere Canal was opened, which ran from Netherpool (now known as Ellesmere Port) to meet the Chester Canal at Chester canal basin. Later, those two canal branches became part of the Shropshire Union Canal network. This canal, which runs beneath the northern section of the city walls of Chester, is navigable and remains in use today.

From about 1794 to the late 1950s, when the canal-side flour mills were closed, narrowboats carried cargo such as coal, slate, gypsum or lead ore as well as finished lead (for roofing, water pipes and sewerage) from the leadworks in Egerton Street (Newtown). The grain from Cheshire was stored in granaries on the banks of the canal at Newtown and Boughton, and salt for preserving food arrived from Northwich.

====Proposed canal====
The original plan to complete the Ellesmere Canal was to connect Chester directly to the Wrexham coalfields by building a broad-gauge waterway with a branch to the River Dee at Holt. If the waterway had been built, canal traffic would have crossed the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct heading north to Chester and the River Dee.

As the route was never completed, the short length of the canal north of Trevor, near Wrexham, was infilled. The Llangollen Canal, although designed to be primarily a water source from the River Dee, became a cruising waterway despite its inherent narrow nature.

However, although Wrexham itself was bypassed, the plan to join the rivers Severn, Mersey, and Dee was completed, first by cutting the Wirral Arm from Chester to Ellesmere Port (Whitby wharf) and then by extending the Llangollen Arm via Ellesmere, Whitchurch and Bettisfield Moss through to the Chester Canal at Hurleston. The network became the Shropshire Union Canal.

===Trams===
Chester had a tram service during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It ran from Saltney, on the Welsh border in the west, to Chester General station and then to Tarvin Road and Great Boughton. It featured the narrowest gauge trams (3&#x27; 6&quot;) in mainland Britain, due to an act of Parliament that deemed they must have the least obstructive route possible.

The tramway was established in 1871 by Chester Tramways Company. It was horse-drawn until it was taken over by the council in 1903. Renamed as Chester Corporation Tramways, it was reconstructed to the 3&#x27;6&quot; gauge and electrified with overhead cables. The tramway was closed in February 1930, a fate experienced by most other systems in the UK. All that remains are small areas of uncovered track inside the former bus depot, and a few tram-wire supports attached to buildings on Eastgate/Foregate Street. However, substantial sections of the track remain buried beneath the current road surface.

Chester electric tram number 4, built by G.F. Milnes &amp; Co. in 1903, has been preserved by Hooton Park Trust and is currently undergoing restoration.

==Sport==
===Football===
Chester was home to Chester City F.C., who were founded in 1885 and elected to the Football League in 1931 and played at their Sealand Road stadium until 1990, spending two years playing in Macclesfield before returning to the city to the new Deva Stadium – which straddles the border of England and Wales – in 1992. The club first lost its Football League status in 2000, only to reclaim it four years later as Conference champions. However, they were relegated again in 2009 and went out of business in March 2010 after 125 years in existence.

Notable former players of the club include Ian Rush (who later managed the club), Cyrille Regis, Arthur Albiston, Earl Barrett, Lee Dixon, Steve Harkness, Roberto Martínez and Stan Pearson.

Following their demise, a new team – Chester FC – was founded. They play at Chester City&#x27;s Deva Stadium, also known as the Chester Swansway Stadium for sponsorship reasons, and were elected to the Northern Premier League Division One North for the 2010–11 season, ending their first season as that division&#x27;s champions, securing a place in the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2011–12 season. The club achieved promotion for the next two consecutive seasons and currently play in the National League Premier Division.

===Basketball===
The city also has a professional basketball team in the country&#x27;s top competition, the British Basketball League. Cheshire Phoenix – formerly known as Cheshire Jets – play at the Cheshire Oaks Arena at nearby Ellesmere Port; and a wheelchair basketball team, Celtic Warriors, formerly known as the Chester Wheelchair Jets.

===Rugby Union===
Chester Rugby Club (union) plays in the English National League 2 North, having been promoted in 2012. It won the EDF Energy Intermediate Cup in the 2007–08 season and the Cheshire Cup several times.

===Watersports on the River Dee===
The River Dee is home to Grosvenor Rowing Club, Royal Chester Rowing Club and the University of Chester Rowing Club, and two school clubs, The King&#x27;s School Chester Rowing Club and Queen&#x27;s Park High Rowing Club. According to the rowing historian Tim Koch, the city&#x27;s annual rowing regatta dates back to at least 1814, making it older than The Boat Race (1829) and Henley Royal Regatta (1839), although the regatta claims to date back even further to 1733. Other annual rowing events include the Chester Long Distance Sculls and the Dee Autumn Head in autumn, and the North of England Head in March. The weir is used by a number of local canoe and kayak clubs. Each July, the Chester Raft Race is held on the River Dee in aid of charity.

===Horseracing===
Chester Racecourse hosts several flat race meetings from the spring to the autumn. The races take place within view of the City walls and attract tens of thousands of visitors. The May meeting includes several nationally significant races, such as the Chester Vase, which is recognised as a trial for The Derby.

===Other sports===
A successful hockey club, Chester H.C., plays at the County Officers&#x27; Club on Plas Newton Lane, and a handball team, Deva Handball Club, boasts of being the largest handball team in the country. Deva&#x27;s handball club plays in National League 1 of handball. There is also an American football team, the Chester Romans, part of the British American Football League.

Chester Golf Club is near the banks of the Dee, and there are numerous private golf courses near the city, as well as a 9-hole municipal course at Westminster Park.

The Northgate Arena is the city&#x27;s main leisure centre; smaller sports centres are in Christleton and Upton. The Victorian City Baths are in the city centre.

December 2011 saw the first Chester Santa Dash. A running event whose route winds around the streets of Chester in aid of local charities; the Santa Dash is a festive event open to everyone of all ages and abilities.

The city has hosted the RAC Rally eight times.

<text>Audlem ( ) is a village and civil parish located in Cheshire, North West England. In 2021, it had a population of 1,832.

The largest village in southern Cheshire, Audlem is approximately south of Nantwich, just north of the border with the neighbouring county of Shropshire, the village is east of Whitchurch and north of Market Drayton. It is also approximately from the border with Wales.

==History==
Audlem was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Aldelime&quot;. By the late 13th century, St James&#x27; Church had been founded and Edward I granted it a market charter in 1295.

The arrival of the Shropshire Union Canal in 1835 was a significant development for Audlem. The canal boosted the local economy by facilitating the transport of goods and materials, particularly agricultural produce and coal. During this period, many of the village&#x27;s distinctive Georgian and Victorian buildings were constructed. Audlem’s flight of 15 locks, designed by Thomas Telford, are a notable engineering feature. Though commercial activity on the canal virtually ceased in the 1950s, it is now an important source of tourism for the village. The canal continues to draw visitors and leisure boaters alike along the waterway itself and to walk the picturesque path.

In 2008 village residents launched an online referendum on moving the village to Wales from England – in a protest over prescription charges in England.

<text>Gustave &quot;Gussie&quot; Mueller (April 17, 1890 – December 16, 1965) was an early jazz clarinetist.

The New Orleans, Louisiana-born Mueller was a top clarinetist with Papa Jack Laine&#x27;s bands in New Orleans before going to Chicago, Illinois with Tom Brown&#x27;s band in early 1915. After serving in the Army in World War I he moved to California and joined the early Paul Whiteman Orchestra, with which he moved to New York City. He helped give the Whiteman band a touch of the Dixieland jazz style. One of the Whiteman Orchestra&#x27;s early hit records, as well as one of the unfortunately few recordings where Mueller can be heard prominently, is Wang Wang Blues which Mueller dominates in a style similar to Larry Shields. Mueller also shares composer credit on &quot;Wang Wang&quot;.

According to Whiteman, Mueller was reluctant to learning how to read music, for fear that it would impair his abilities as a &quot;hot player&quot;. He left the Whiteman band in November 1920, saying &quot;I jes&#x27; can&#x27;t play that &#x27;pretty music&#x27; that you all play. And you fellers can&#x27;t never play blues worth a damn&quot;. Mueller returned to California to join his old friend Ray Lopez in the Abe Lyman Orchestra. Mueller stayed in the Los Angeles area and remained active as a musician well in to the 1940s, mainly performing with &quot;Hillbilly&quot; bands. He rejoins Whiteman in Capitol Record&#x27;s Hollywood studios in 1945, for a recreation of the famous Wang-Wang Blues. On the record Mueller replicates in detail his phrases from the 1920 recording.

<text>Beeston is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester, which itself is in the ceremonial county of Cheshire in the north of England. It is located approximately 10 km south-east of Chester, and approximately 3.5 km south-west of Tarporley, close to the Shropshire Union Canal. According to the 2011 census, Beeston had a population of 188.

==History==
Beeston is listed in the Domesday Book in 1086 as a parish within the ancient hundred of Rushton in Cheshire. The hundreds of Cheshire were consolidated in the 13th century, with Beeston becoming a township within Bunbury parish. 

Beeston Castle was occupied from the 13th to mid-17th centuries; its site west of the center of the village is in the care of English Heritage:
:Beeston Castle here crowns an isolated sandstone rock, 366 feet high; and commands a charming view of the vale of Cheshire, and over the Mersey to Liverpool. The castle was built, as a fortress, in 1228, by Ranulf de Blundeville; became a royal garrison between Henry III. and his barons; was dismantled, in 1645, by order of parliament; and is now an extensive and picturesque ruin.

The Victorian-era Peckforton Castle is less than a mile southwest of Beeston.

==Population==
According to the 1881 Census data, the population of Beeston was 328. Of these, 56 were engaged in agriculture, suggesting a strong farming community in the area. 30 persons were employed in domestic service in the parish at the time as well, possibly indicating the presence of a country estate. There was also a schoolmaster, an innkeeper and a shopkeeper, which suggests that there was a school, an inn and a village shop present in 1881.

The overall trend for in Beeston has been that the population has declined since the 1881 census, with approximately 188 people living in the village in 2011. This is despite the overall number of households in the parish increasing.

==Transport==
Beeston is located off the A49, which bypasses the village to the east.

The village was once served by Beeston Castle and Tarporley railway station on the Chester to Crewe main line. The station closed to goods traffic in January 1965, and to passengers 15 months later, in April 1966. The line remains open, and sections of the platforms are still in situ.

<text>Bollington is a town and civil parish in Cheshire, England, to the east of Prestbury. In the Middle Ages, it was part of the Earl of Chester&#x27;s manor of Macclesfield and the ancient parish of Prestbury. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 7,944 and the built up area had a population of 7,235.

Bollington is on the River Dean and the Macclesfield Canal, on the south-western edge of the Peak District. Rising above the town on Kerridge Hill is White Nancy, a monument built to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo.

== History ==

From the late 18th through to the mid-20th centuries, Bollington was a major centre for cotton-spinning. Waterhouse Mill, now demolished, off Wellington Road, once spun the finest cotton in the world, and was sought after by lace makers in Nottingham and in Brussels, Belgium.

Clarence Mill still stands. The lower floors remain commercial but the upper floors have been converted into apartments. One of the oldest surviving mills in Bollington is the very small Defiance Mill, built in Queen Street about 1800 and now restored for residential occupation.

There is a large paper coating mill on the site of Lower Mills. The original mill was built by George Antrobus in 1792 but very little of those buildings remain. A stone-built traditional mill still survives amongst the 20thC brick and 21stC steel developments. In the 1830s and 1840s this mill was rented to Thomas Oliver and Martin Swindells for the production of fine cotton thread for the lace-making industry. Lowerhouse Mill (Antrobus, 1819, later occupied by Samuel Greg Jnr) also remains as an industrial mill, also producing coated papers.

The other remaining mill is Adelphi Mill (Swindells, 1856), which is today entirely commercial.

In 1801, the population was 1,231. In 1851, the population was 4,655. In 1901, it had grown to 5,245. Population growth slowed during the mid-20th century such that by 1951 the population was 5,644. By 2001 the population had reached 7,095, and in 2011 it was 8,310.

== Governance ==
There are two tiers of local government covering Bollington, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Bollington Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at the Town Hall on Wellington Road.

The town falls within the Westminster constituency of Macclesfield, which has represented by the Labour Party MP Tim Roca since 2024.

=== Administrative history ===
Bollington was historically a township in the ancient parish of Prestbury, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the Poor Laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Prestbury, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Bollington became a civil parish.

Bollington was made a local government district in 1862, governed by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Bollington Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A successor parish called Bollington was established covering the same area as the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name Bollington Town Council. District-level functions passed to Macclesfield Borough Council. In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service have a retained fire station in Bollington. The town has a medical practice on Wellington Road, and a dental surgery on Bollington Road. The town does not have its own police station; policing is provided by the Cheshire Constabulary. The town has a small yet thriving local retail community, with two bakers, two butchers, a delicatessen, a newsagent, a florist, and two convenience stores: Co-op and Tesco. The town has several notable take-aways, restaurants, wine bars, and coffee shops, along with around ten traditional public houses.

The Holly Bush pub was built in about 1935 and is a rare example of an almost intact &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Tudor&quot; style pub from this period, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.

== Education ==
Bollington is served by four primary schools. The Roman Catholic school of St Gregory is on Albert Road, along with the secular Dean Valley Community Primary School. The Church of England has two schools in the town, St John the Baptist Church of England on Grimshaw Lane, and at Bollington Cross, St Oswald&#x27;s Primary School. Secondary-aged students travel to Tytherington School, The Fallibroome Academy, The Kings School, All Hallows Catholic College, all in Macclesfield, and Poynton High School.

== Sport ==
The recreation ground, across the road from the Civic Hall and library, provides a football pitch, bowling green, tennis court and cricket pitch, all of which are in regular use by Bollington Town F.C., Bollington Cricket Club, Bollington Athletics Club, and the Bollington Bowling Club. A further cricket pitch located along Clarke Lane, by The Lord Clyde pub, is home to Kerridge Cricket Club. Bollington has a hockey club, which plays on the King&#x27;s School AstroTurf pitches. There are a number of other sporting activity groups including cycling, walking, and swimming.

Other activities are based at the Bollington Health and Leisure Centre at Heath Road, Bollington Cross and The Capelli Sports Ground, the home of Bollington United Football Club and Bollington Health and Leisure Football Club.

The football club&#x27;s crest features White Nancy, a significant landmark within the Bollington area.

Perhaps because of its proximity to the home of British Cycling and its location between the flat Cheshire plains and the hillier Peak District, Bollington is home to a number of professional road and track cyclists, notably Adam Blythe and Ethan Vernon.

== Landmarks ==
Bollington is notable for White Nancy, a stone folly located on top of Kerridge Hill. At c.6m high and painted white, this 1817 monument to victory at the Battle of Waterloo is visible from as far away as Shropshire and the western hills of Cheshire. It originally had an entrance to the interior where the visitor would find a single room with stone benches and a round table. However, vandalism reportedly prompted the closure of the entrance sometime in the 20th century.

The big mills, Clarence, Adelphi and Lowerhouse, are notable examples of 19th-century mill buildings in the northwest of England.

== Culture ==

The town has several churches. The parish Church of St John the Baptist closed in 2006, leaving St Oswald&#x27;s Church in Bollington Cross as the only Anglican church. St Gregory&#x27;s Church on Wellington Road is the Roman Catholic place of worship in the town. The Grade-II listed Methodist church on Wellington Road has been closed to worship and has been sold.

In 2005 Canalside Community Radio was launched to provide community news and entertainment for the duration of the festival. Cousins John and Terry Waite opened the 2005 Bollington Festival. together with the Discovery Centre. In December 2008 Canalside Radio began broadcasting to northeast Cheshire on 102.8 FM having obtained a full-time licence after five years of trying.

Hiking, cycling and riding through the hills around Bollington and along the Macclesfield Canal towpath as well as the Middlewood Way (a disused railway) are popular activities. Boats and bikes can be hired for day-trips and holidays at Grimshaw Lane canal wharf. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the town., as does the Gritstone Trail.

The town has many traditional public houses, most of which have not been modernised.

=== Events ===

Every five or six years since 1964, the town hosts the Bollington Festival, which runs for two and a half weeks and involves a wide variety of community activities, from concerts, theatrical, opera, art exhibitions, to local history events, science events and competitions. The last Festival was in 2019 and the next is scheduled for 2026 (delayed by COVID-19 and the financial environment).

In September each year a ten-day Walking Festival promotes exercise and fresh air while taking in the beauty of the surrounding countryside, the western hills of the Peak District.

Bollington hosts an annual &#x27;Carols around the Christmas Tree&#x27; on Christmas Eve each year.

At mid-day on Christmas Day each year a brass band play at White Nancy.

=== Societies and organisations ===
Bollington has a branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute, which meets regularly while retired gentlemen may meet at the weekly Probus, and likewise the ladies at their monthly Probus.

The Guide and Scout movements are all represented. Bollington United Junior Football Club (JFC) has three clubs for children ranging from under-10s to under-17s. 
Bollington is home to 236 Squadron of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Air Training Corps, which has its headquarters on Shrigley Road. The Squadron had close links with 42(R) (formerly 236 OCU) of the Royal Air Force before the latter was disbanded in the government defence review in 2010. The Sea Cadets is for 10‑ to 18‑year‑olds. The Bollington and Macclesfield Sea Cadets also have a unit website.

There are numerous artistic, musical and theatrical groups all providing popular exhibitions and performances. Many of these are held at the Bollington Arts Centre.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Bollington is from the A523 road that runs from Hazel Grove, through Macclesfield to Leek in Staffordshire. The nearest motorway junctions are J17 and 19 (Congleton and Knutsford) on the M6, and J1 (Stockport) on the M60.

=== Bus ===
Regular bus services connect Bollington with Macclesfield, Hazel Grove and Stockport, operated by D&amp;G Bus. However, all public transport ends before 7pm.

=== Railway ===
Bollington no longer has its own railway station; the nearest being in Macclesfield, for inter-city trains to London and Manchester, and Prestbury for local stopping trains.

Bollington used to be served by the Macclesfield, Bollington &amp; Marple Railway, which operated between Rose Hill Marple and Macclesfield. The railway was built in 1869 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) and the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR), as a part of a quest to provide an alternative link between Manchester and the south that was independent of the London and North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR). Cotton mill owner Thomas Oliver had suggested this route hoping to revive the cotton mills of Bollington, the Kerridge stone quarries and the coal fields at Poynton. The line was closed in January 1970 as part of the Beeching closures. The trackbed is today used for walking, cycling and horseriding; it is known as the Middlewood Way.

=== Water ===
The Macclesfield Canal passes through the centre of the town and is a picturesque and rural part of the Cheshire Ring. The stretch from Marple Junction on the Peak Forest Canal to Bosley is without locks and is carried on an embankment through Bollington. Kerridge was the scene of a spectacular breach on 29 February 1912, where the water from Bosley to Bugsworth basin emptied through the town. Today, the canal is used for leisure purposes.

== Media ==
&quot;Bollington Live!&quot; is a publication produced three times a year by a team of volunteer writers, editor and distributors. It is funded by local businesses who sponsor and advertise. It covers a wide range of issues of local interest, from historical articles, to matters of current concern. The magazine is delivered free to every household and business in Bollington, plus others in Pott Shrigley and Whiteley Green by almost fifty volunteers. The magazine was started in 1994 by a group of residents who felt that whilst Bollington was served by the neighbouring Macclesfield newspapers, it was in need of a Bollington-centred publication. All copies are available online on the town&#x27;s extensive Happy Valley web site.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West, Silk Radio and Canalside Radio, a community-based station.

<text>Emile Joseph Christian (April 20, 1895 – December 3, 1973), sometimes spelled Emil Christian, was an American early jazz trombonist; he also played cornet and string bass. He also wrote a number of tunes, including &quot;Meet Me at the Green Goose&quot;, &quot;Satanic Blues&quot;, and &quot;Mardi Gras Parade&quot;.

== Biography ==
Christian was born into a musical family in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans, most prominently his older brother Frank Christian was a noted cornetist and bandleader. Emile Christian played both cornet and trombone with the Papa Jack Laine bands. He went to Chicago, Illinois in late 1917 to play trombone with the Bert Kelly Jass Band. In 1918 he went to New York City to replace Eddie Edwards in the Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB); he toured England with the ODJB, contributed his tune &quot;Satanic Blues&quot; to their repertory, and made his first recordings with this band. After a brief time in the Original Memphis Five, he returned to Europe. There, from 1924 into the 1930s, he played bass and trombone with various jazz bands including those of Eric Borchard and Lud Gluskin, in European cities including Berlin (where he made more recordings), Paris, Stockholm (where he recorded with Leon Abbey&#x27;s band). In Paris (also in Nice and Aix-les-Bains) he played with Tom Waltham&#x27;s Ad-Libs. In 1935 he played with Benny Peyton&#x27;s Jazz Kings in Switzerland.

Christian played in both Black and White bands in Europe and India before returning to the United States after the outbreak of World War II. In the 1950s he moved back to New Orleans, where he played with the bands of Leon Prima, Santo Pecora, and Sharkey Bonano and his own band. In 1957 he toured with the Louis Prima Band. He continued playing in New Orleans into 1969, in his later years mostly playing string bass.

He died in 1973 in New Orleans, aged 78.

<doc id="153734" wikidata="Q8108" url="?curid=153734" title="Georgian language">
<text>Georgian (, , ) is the most widely spoken Kartvelian language. It is the official language of Georgia and the native or primary language of 88% of its population. It also serves as the literary language or lingua franca for speakers of related languages. Its speakers today amount to approximately 3.8 million. Georgian is written with its own unique Georgian scripts, alphabetical systems of unclear origin.

Georgian is most closely related to the Zan languages (Megrelian and Laz) and more distantly to Svan. Georgian has various dialects, with standard Georgian based on the Kartlian dialect, and all dialects are mutually intelligible. The history of Georgian spans from Early Old Georgian in the 5th century, to Modern Georgian today. Its development as a written language began with the Christianization of Georgia in the 4th century.

Georgian phonology features a rich consonant system, including aspirated, voiced, and ejective stops, affricates, and fricatives. Its vowel system consists of five vowels with varying realizations. Georgian prosody involves weak stress, with disagreements among linguists on its placement. The language&#x27;s phonotactics include complex consonant clusters and harmonic clusters. The Mkhedruli script, dominant in modern usage, corresponds closely to Georgian phonemes and has no case distinction, though it employs a capital-like effect called Mtavruli for titles and inscriptions. Georgian is an agglutinative language with a complex verb structure that can include up to eight morphemes, exhibiting polypersonalism. The language has seven noun cases and employs a left-branching structure with adjectives preceding nouns and postpositions instead of prepositions. Georgian lacks grammatical gender and articles, with definite meanings established through context. Georgian&#x27;s rich derivation system allows for extensive noun and verb formation from roots, with many words featuring initial consonant clusters.

The Georgian writing system has evolved from ancient scripts to the current Mkhedruli, used for most purposes. The language has a robust grammatical framework with unique features such as syncope in morphophonology and a left-branching syntax. Georgian&#x27;s vocabulary is highly derivational, allowing for diverse word formations, while its numeric system is vigesimal.

==Classification==
No claimed genetic links between the Kartvelian languages and any other language family in the world are accepted in mainstream linguistics. Among the Kartvelian languages, Georgian is most closely related to the so-called Zan languages (Megrelian and Laz); glottochronological studies indicate that it split from the latter approximately 2700 years ago. Svan is a more distant relative that split off much earlier, perhaps 4000 years ago.

==Dialects==

Standard Georgian is largely based on the Kartlian dialect. Over the centuries, it has exerted a strong influence on the other dialects. As a result, they are all, generally, mutually intelligible with standard Georgian, and with one another.

==History==

The history of the Georgian language is conventionally divided into the following phases:
* Early Old Georgian: 5th–8th centuries
* Classical Old Georgian: 9th–11th centuries
* Middle Georgian: 11th/12th–17th/18th centuries
* Modern Georgian: 17th/18th century–present

The earliest extant references to Georgian are found in the writings of Marcus Cornelius Fronto, a Roman grammarian from the 2nd century AD. The first direct attestations of the language are inscriptions and palimpsests dating to the 5th century, and the oldest surviving literary work is the 5th century &quot;Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik&quot; by Iakob Tsurtaveli.

The emergence of Georgian as a written language appears to have been the result of the Christianization of Georgia in the mid-4th century, which led to the replacement of Aramaic as the literary language.

By the 11th century, Old Georgian had developed into Middle Georgian. The most famous work of this period is the epic poem &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin,&quot; written by Shota Rustaveli in the 12th century.

In 1629, a certain Nikoloz Cholokashvili authored the first printed books written (partially) in Georgian, the &quot;Alphabetum Ibericum sive Georgianum cum Oratione&quot; and the &quot;Dittionario giorgiano e italiano&quot;. These were meant to help western Catholic missionaries learn Georgian for evangelical purposes.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
On the left are symbols, and on the right are the corresponding letters of the modern Georgian alphabet, which is essentially phonemic.
# Opinions differ on the aspiration of , as it is non-contrastive.
# Opinions differ on how to classify and ; classifies them as post-velar, argues that they range from velar to uvular according to context.
# The uvular ejective stop is commonly realized as a uvular ejective fricative but it can also be , , or , they are in free variation.
# is realized as an alveolar tap though occurs in free variation.
# is pronounced as a velarized before back vowels; it is pronounced as in the environment of front vowels.
# is realized in most contexts as a bilabial fricative or , but has the following allophones.
## before voiceless consonants, it is realized as or .
## after voiceless consonants it is also voiceless and has been interpreted either as labialization of the preceding consonant or simply as .
## whether it is realized as labialization after voiced consonants is debated.
## word-initially before the vowel /u/ and sometimes before other consonants it may be deleted entirely.
#In initial positions, are pronounced as a weakly voiced .
#In word-final positions, may be devoiced and aspirated to . 
#/r/ may be dropped in CrC contexts in colloquial speech. 
#Word-final /b, d, ɡ/ may be realized as unreleased stops [b̚, d̚, ɡ̚] before another obstruent at word boundaries.

Former () has merged with (), leaving only the latter.

The glottalization of the ejectives is rather light, and in fact Georgian transliterates the tenuis stops in foreign words and names with the ejectives.

The coronal occlusives (, not necessarily affricates) are variously described as apical dental, laminal alveolar, and &quot;dental&quot;.

===Vowels===
Per Canepari, the main realizations of the vowels are [], [], [], [], [].

Aronson describes their realizations as [], [], [] (but &quot;slightly fronted&quot;), [], [].

Shosted transcribed one speaker&#x27;s pronunciation more-or-less consistently with [], [], [], [], [].

Allophonically, [] may be inserted to break up consonant clusters, as in . 

In casual speech, /iV, Vi/ sequences can be realized phonetically as [jV~i̯V, Vj~Vi̯]. 

Phrase-final unstressed vowels may sometimes be partially reduced.

===Prosody===
Prosody in Georgian involves stress, intonation, and rhythm. Stress is very weak, and linguists disagree as to where stress occurs in words. Jun, Vicenik, and Lofstedt have proposed that Georgian stress and intonation are the result of pitch accents on the first syllable of a word and near the end of a phrase.

According to Borise, Georgian has fixed initial word-level stress cued primarily by greater syllable duration and intensity of the initial syllable of a word. Georgian vowels in non-initial syllables are pronounced with a shorter duration compared to vowels in initial syllables. long polysyllabic words may have a secondary stress on their third or fourth syllable. 

According to Gamq&#x27;relidze et al, quadrisyllabic words may be exceptionally stressed on their second syllable. Stressed vowels in Georgian have slightly longer duration, more intensity, and higher pitch compared to unstressed vowels. 

Some Georgian dialects have distinctive stress.

===Phonotactics===
Georgian contains many &quot;harmonic clusters&quot; involving two consonants of a similar type (voiced, aspirated, or ejective) that are pronounced with only a single release; e.g. &quot;bgera&quot; &#x27;sound&#x27;, &quot;tskhovreba&quot; &#x27;life&#x27;, and &quot;ts’q’ali&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;. There are also frequent consonant clusters, sometimes involving more than six consonants in a row, as may be seen in words like &quot;gvprtskvni&quot; &#x27;you peel us&#x27; and &quot;mts’vrtneli&quot; &#x27;trainer&#x27;.

Vicenik has observed that Georgian vowels following ejective stops have creaky voice and suggests this may be one cue distinguishing ejectives from their aspirated and voiced counterparts.

== Writing system ==

Georgian has been written in a variety of scripts over its history. Currently the &quot;Mkhedruli&quot; script is almost completely dominant; the others are used mostly in religious documents and architecture.

&quot;Mkhedruli&quot; has 33 letters in common use; a half dozen more are obsolete in Georgian, though still used in other alphabets, like Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan. The letters of &quot;Mkhedruli&quot; correspond closely to the phonemes of the Georgian language.

According to the traditional account written down by Leonti Mroveli in the 11th century, the first Georgian script was created by the first ruler of the Kingdom of Iberia, Pharnavaz, in the 3rd century BC. The first examples of a Georgian script date from the 5th century AD. There are now three Georgian scripts, called &quot;Asomtavruli&quot; &#x27;capitals&#x27;, &quot;Nuskhuri&quot; &#x27;small letters&#x27;, and &quot;Mkhedruli&quot;. The first two are used together as upper and lower case in the writings of the Georgian Orthodox Church and together are called &quot;Khutsuri&quot; &#x27;priest alphabet&#x27;.

In &quot;Mkhedruli&quot;, there is no case. Sometimes, however, a capital-like effect, called &quot;Mtavruli&quot; (&#x27;title&#x27; or &#x27;heading&#x27;), is achieved by modifying the letters so that their vertical sizes are identical and they rest on the baseline with no descenders. These capital-like letters are often used in page headings, chapter titles, monumental inscriptions, and the like.

Georgian is an agglutinative language. Certain prefixes and suffixes can be joined in order to build a verb. In some cases, one verb can have up to eight different morphemes in it at the same time. An example is &quot;ageshenebinat&quot; (&#x27;you [all] should&#x27;ve built [it]&#x27;). The verb can be broken down to parts: &quot;a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t&quot;. Each morpheme here contributes to the meaning of the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.

====Morphophonology====
In Georgian morphophonology, syncope is a common phenomenon. When a suffix (especially the plural suffix -&quot;eb&quot;-) is attached to a word that has either of the vowels &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot; in the last syllable, this vowel is, in most words, lost. For example, &quot;megobari&quot; means &#x27;friend&#x27;; &quot;megobrebi&quot; (&quot;megobØrebi&quot;) means &#x27;friends&#x27;, with the loss of &quot;a&quot; in the last syllable of the word stem.

====Inflection====
Georgian has seven noun cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive, instrumental, adverbial and vocative. An interesting feature of Georgian is that, while the subject of a sentence is generally in the nominative case and the object is in the accusative case (or dative), one can find this reversed in many situations (this depends mainly on the character of the verb). This is called the dative construction. In the past tense of the transitive verbs, and in the present tense of the verb &quot;to know&quot;, the subject is in the ergative case.

===Syntax===
* Georgian is a left-branching language, in which adjectives precede nouns, possessors precede possessions, objects normally precede verbs, and postpositions are used instead of prepositions.
* Each postposition (whether a suffix or a separate word) requires the modified noun to be in a specific case. This is similar to the way prepositions govern specific cases in many Indo-European languages such as German, Latin, or Russian.
* Georgian is a pro-drop language; both subject and object pronouns are frequently omitted except for emphasis or to resolve ambiguity.
* A study by Skopeteas &quot;et al.&quot; concluded that Georgian word order tends to place the focus of a sentence immediately before the verb, and the topic before the focus. A subject–object–verb (SOV) word order is common in idiomatic expressions and when the focus of a sentence is on the object. A subject–verb–object (SVO) word order is common when the focus is on the subject, or in longer sentences. Object-initial word orders (OSV or OVS) are also possible, but less common. Verb-initial word orders including both subject and object (VSO or VOS) are extremely rare.
* Georgian has no grammatical gender; even the pronouns are ungendered.
* Georgian has no articles. Therefore, for example, &quot;guest&quot;, &quot;a guest&quot; and &quot;the guest&quot; are said in the same way. In relative clauses, however, it is possible to establish the meaning of the definite article through use of some particles.

==Vocabulary==

Georgian has a rich word-derivation system. By using a root, and adding some definite prefixes and suffixes, one can derive many nouns and adjectives from the root. For example, from the root -&quot;kart&quot;-, the following words can be derived: &quot;Kartveli (&#x27;a Georgian person&#x27;), &quot;Kartuli (&#x27;the Georgian language&#x27;) and Sakartvelo (&#x27;the country of Georgia&#x27;).

Most Georgian surnames end in -&quot;dze&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; (Western Georgia), -&quot;shvili&quot; &#x27;child&#x27; (Eastern Georgia), -&quot;ia&quot; (Western Georgia, Samegrelo), -&quot;ani&quot; (Western Georgia, Svaneti), -&quot;uri&quot; (Eastern Georgia), etc. The ending -&quot;eli&quot; is a particle of nobility, comparable to French &quot;de&quot;, Dutch &quot;van&quot;, German &quot;von&quot; or Polish -&quot;ski&quot;.

Georgian has a vigesimal numeric system like Basque and (partially) French. Numbers greater than 20 and less than 100 are described as the sum of the greatest possible multiple of 20 plus the remainder. For example, &quot;93&quot; literally translates as &#x27;four times twenty plus thirteen&#x27; (, &quot;otkhmotsdatsamet’i&quot;).

One of the most important Georgian dictionaries is the &quot;Explanatory dictionary of the Georgian language&quot; (). It consists of eight volumes and about 115,000 words. It was produced between 1950 and 1964, by a team of linguists under the direction of Arnold Chikobava.

==Examples==

===Word formations===
Georgian has a word derivation system, which allows the derivation of nouns from verb roots both with prefixes and suffixes, for example:

* From the root -- &#x27;write&#x27;, the words &#x27;letter&#x27; and &quot;mts’erali&quot; &#x27;writer&#x27; are derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;give&#x27;, the word &#x27;broadcast&#x27; is derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;try&#x27;, the word &#x27;exam&#x27; is derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;resemble&#x27;, the words &#x27;similar&#x27; and &quot;msgavseba&quot; &#x27;similarity&#x27; are derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;build&#x27;, the word &#x27;building&#x27; is derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;bake&#x27;, the word &#x27;cake&#x27; is derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;cold&#x27;, the word &#x27;refrigerator&#x27; is derived.
* From the root -- &#x27;fly&#x27;, the words &#x27;airplane&#x27; and &#x27;takeoff&#x27; are derived.

It is also possible to derive verbs from nouns:

* From the noun -- &#x27;war&#x27;, the verb &#x27;you wage/are waging war&#x27; is derived.
* From the noun -- &#x27;lunch&#x27;, the verb &#x27;you eat/are eating lunch&#x27; is derived.
* From the noun - &#x27;breakfast&#x27;, the verb &#x27;eating a little breakfast&#x27; is derived; the preverb &quot;ts’a&quot;- in Georgian adds the meaning &#x27;a little&#x27;.
* From the noun -- &#x27;home&#x27;, the verb &#x27;relocating, moving&#x27; is derived.

Likewise, verbs can be derived from adjectives, for example:

* From the adjective -- &#x27;red&#x27;, the verb &#x27;blushing, making one blush&#x27; is derived. This kind of derivation can be done with many adjectives in Georgian.
* From the adjective - &#x27;blind&#x27;, the verbs &#x27;becoming blind, blinding someone&#x27; are derived.
* From the adjective -- &#x27;beautiful&#x27;, the verb &#x27;becoming beautiful&#x27; is derived.

===Words that begin with multiple consonants===
In Georgian many nouns and adjectives begin with two or more contiguous consonants. This is because syllables in the language often begin with two consonants. Recordings are available on the relevant Wiktionary entries, linked to below.
*Some examples of words that begin with two consonants are:
** (), &#x27;water&#x27;
** (), &#x27;correct&#x27;
** (), &#x27;milk&#x27;
** (), &#x27;hair&#x27;
** (), &#x27;mountain&#x27;
** (), &#x27;horse&#x27;
* Many words begin with three contiguous consonants:
** (), &#x27;you &#x27;
** (), &#x27;green&#x27;
** (), &#x27;nose&#x27;
** (), &#x27;sweet&#x27;
** (), &#x27;painful&#x27;
** (), &#x27;north&#x27;
* A few words in Georgian that begin with four contiguous consonants. Examples are:
** (), &#x27;murderer&#x27;
** (), &#x27;dead&#x27;
** (), &#x27;drunk&#x27;
** (), &#x27;row, screeve&#x27;
* Some extreme cases also exist in Georgian. For example, the following word begins with six contiguous consonants:
** (), &#x27;trainer&#x27;
*While the following word begins with seven:
** (), &#x27;you train us&#x27;
* And the following words begin with eight:
** (), &#x27;you peel us&#x27;
** (), &#x27;you tear us&#x27;

<text>The Upper Derwent Valley is an area of the Peak District National Park in England. It largely lies in Derbyshire, but its north eastern area lies in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Its most significant features are the Derwent Dams, Ladybower, Derwent and Howden, which form Ladybower Reservoir, Derwent Reservoir and Howden Reservoir respectively.

==History==
In 1899, the Derwent Valley Water Board was set up to supply water to Derby, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, and the two Gothic-style dams were built across the River Derwent to create Howden Reservoir (1912) and Derwent Reservoir (1916).

West of the Derwent a large village known as Birchinlee, locally known as &#x27;Tin Town&#x27;, was created for the &#x27;navvies&#x27;—the workers who built the dams—and their families, many of whom came from the Elan Valley Reservoirs in Wales. One of the buildings was salvaged and rebuilt at Hope where in 2014 it was reported to be housing a beauty parlour.

The villages in the Upper Derwent Valley:
*Bamford
*Yorkshire Bridge
*Hathersage
*Grindleford
*Calver

A standard-gauge railway, for transporting materials, connected the Water Board offices in Bamford with the work site. A section of the track of the railway is now a footpath; other sections are visible when water levels in the reservoirs are low. The railway engine house no longer exists at the old offices. The offices are now occupied by a Quaker group.


Over the decades, demand for water increased. Piped intakes were constructed from the rivers Ashop and Alport to the west to feed directly into the Derwent reservoir, but soon demand increased further to the point where another reservoir was required. The larger Ladybower Reservoir, built largely during World War II, necessitated the flooding of the villages of Derwent and Ashopton, with the occupants being relocated to the Yorkshire Bridge estate, just downstream of Ladybower dam. A packhorse bridge with a preservation order on it also had to be moved, and was rebuilt at Slippery Stones, north of Howden Reservoir. The bodies in the churchyard were exhumed and reburied at Bamford. The reservoir was completed in 1945.

The topographical similarity between the Upper Derwent Valley and the Ruhr Valley of Germany led to the dams being used as a practice environment for the Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron (Dam Busters) in 1943 before their attack on the Ruhr dams. &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; film was subsequently filmed at the Derwent Dams, and the area sees occasional commemorative flypasts by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

The reservoirs cover 198.50 square kilometres, and can hold 463,692 million litres. The main beneficiary of the reservoirs&#x27; water is Sheffield, less than away, but the reservoirs are also connected to the Severn Trent&#x27;s water grid that extends to mid-Wales and Gloucestershire. The reservoirs were originally intended to supply water to the cities of Sheffield, Derby, Leicester and Nottingham. Sheffield was supplied with &quot;raw&quot; water for treatment in its own treatment plants. The other cities were supplied with treated water. Water was treated at the Yorkshire Bridge works (now converted to apartments), and at the much bigger Bamford Filter works, much expanded in the 1960s.

The area is good for rare birds, including black grouse and goshawk. Much of the surrounding land is administered by the National Trust and is popular as a recreational area for walking and cycling.

== Incidents ==
On 9 May 2016, a large moor fire was accidentally caused by a disposable barbecue on the moors above Ladybower Reservoir. The fire required the attendance of twelve fire engines from eight stations, Edale Mountain Rescue, and Peak Park and National Trust officials. Due to an incident involving a vehicle and a member of the emergency services, a Coastguard SAR helicopter and Yorkshire Air Ambulance were also required on the scene. The injured person was airlifted to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield. During the incident all access roads to the reservoir were closed, though the A57 Snake Pass was unaffected.

<doc id="153742" wikidata="Q6745232" url="?curid=153742" title="Mam Tor">
<text>Mam Tor is a hill near Castleton in the High Peak of Derbyshire, England. Its name means &quot;mother hill&quot;, so called because frequent landslips on its eastern face have resulted in a multitude of &quot;mini-hills&quot; beneath it. These landslips, which are caused by unstable lower layers of shale, also give the hill its alternative name of Shivering Mountain.

In 1979, the continual battle to maintain the A625 road (Sheffield to Chapel en le Frith) on the crumbling eastern side of the hill was lost when the road officially closed as a through-route, with the Fox House to Castleton section of the road being re-designated as the A6187.

The hill is crowned by a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age univallate hill fort, and two Bronze Age bowl barrows. At the base of the Tor and nearby are four show caves: Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern, Peak Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern where lead, Blue John, fluorspar and other minerals were once mined. Mam Tor was declared to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by Thomas Hobbes in his 1636 book &quot;De Mirabilibus Pecci&quot;.

==Geography==
Mam Tor is on the southern edge of the Dark Peak (sandstones) and overlooks the White Peak (limestones), including the dry gorge of Winnats Pass. It is a dominating link between the eastern end of Rushup Edge and the western end of the Great Ridge, which together separate the Hope Valley to the south from Edale to the north, and is a popular ridgewalk.

Mam Tor is made of rocks of Carboniferous age, approximately 320 million years old. The base of Mam Tor is composed of black shales of the Bowland Shale Formation of Serpukhovian age overlain by turbiditic sandstone of the Mam Tor Sandstone Formation of Bashkirian age.

==Landslides==
A feature of Mam Tor is the active landslide which invades its southeast side almost to the summit, and interrupts the ramparts of the hillfort, unless its builders used it as part of the defences. This rotational landslide began roughly 4,000 years ago. The toe is a debris flow. The landslide is due to weak shales underlying sandstones, a common phenomenon all around the Dark Peak, notably at Alport Castles, Longdendale, Glossop and Canyards Hills, Sheffield. Indeed, three larger landslides occur on the north side of Mam Tor, one of them cutting the main ridge at Mam Nick which allows a minor road over into Edale; another creates the striking crag of Back Tor well seen from Mam Tor.

Evidence for the continued movement of the slide mass is demonstrated graphically by the severe damage to the old Mam Tor road that traversed this flow. The road was built at the beginning of the 1800s and was subsequently relaid until local authorities closed it in 1979. Layers of tarmac and gravel are up to thick in places, demonstrating the numerous efforts to keep the road open. A short tunnel could readily have been made avoiding the landslip zone, but the opportunity to exclude heavy business and lorry traffic from the middle of the National Park was preferred. A local diversion for light vehicles follows the limestone gorge of Winnats Pass. This is one of the most extreme cases of geological problems affecting main transport systems in Britain, comparable with the railway at Dawlish.

Current mean annual movement is &quot;up to 0.25 m; this increases greatly when winter rainfalls exceed thresholds of both 210 mm/month and 750 mm in the preceding six months&quot;. The debris flow poses no threat to any inhabited buildings; however, small farm buildings lying in the flow&#x27;s path may soon be overwhelmed assuming a flow rate similar to that of the present. The 2000 study suggests that deep drainage may be the most effective means of stabilising the flow, though this may not completely stop movement.

==Prehistory==
The summit of Mam Tor is encircled by a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age univallate hill fort. Radiocarbon analysis suggests occupation from around 1200 BC. The earliest remaining features are two Bronze Age burial mounds, one just below the summit and the other on the summit itself, though now buried under the paving. At a later stage over a hundred small platforms were levelled into the hill near the summit, allowing inhabited timber huts to be constructed. The hill fort and burial mounds are a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

<doc id="153743" wikidata="Q492247" url="?curid=153743" title="Jimmie Noone">
<text>Jimmie Noone (April 23, 1895 – April 19, 1944) was an American jazz clarinetist and bandleader. After beginning his career in New Orleans, he led Jimmie Noone&#x27;s Apex Club Orchestra, a Chicago band that recorded for Vocalion and Decca. Classical composer Maurice Ravel acknowledged basing his &quot;Boléro&quot; on an improvisation by Noone. At the time of his death Noone was leading a quartet in Los Angeles and was part of an all-star band that was reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz in the 1940s.

== Early life ==
Jimmie Noone was born on April 23, 1895, near the Stanton Plantation in New Orleans, Louisiana to Lucene Daggs and James Noone. All of his grandparents were slaves. His father James either left the family or died before Noone was 5 years old. In 1910, Noone&#x27;s family moved to Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana. Noone switched to the clarinet and studied with Lorenzo Tio, and the young Sidney Bechet.

== Later life and career ==
=== 1913–1942 ===
In 1913, Noone was playing professionally with Freddie Keppard, in Storyville, replacing Bechet. In 1916, when Keppard went on tour, Noone and Buddie Petit formed the Young Olympia Band, and Noone led a small ensemble (clarinet, piano, drums) unusual for its time.

In 1917, Noone played with Kid Ory and Oscar Celestin until the Storyville district was permanently closed. He rejoined Keppard and the Original Creole Orchestra on the vaudeville circuit until the group broke up the following year.

In 1918, Noone moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he studied with symphony clarinetist Franz Schoepp. He played for two years (1918–1920) at Chicago&#x27;s Royal Garden Cafe with Paul Barbarin (drums), King Oliver, Bill Johnson (bass), Lottie Taylor (piano) and Eddie Vinson (trombone). In 1920, Noone joined Keppard in Doc Cook&#x27;s dance orchestra, in which he played saxophone and clarinet for six years. Noone was a brother-in-law of both Barbarin and Keppard.

In 1926, Noone began to lead the band at the Apex Club, at 330 E. 35th Street, one of a wealth of Jazz Age clubs on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Jimmie Noone&#x27;s Apex Club Orchestra had an unusual instrumentation—a front line consisting of clarinet and alto saxophone (, who worked with Noone in Doc Cook&#x27;s band), with piano (Earl Hines), drums (Ollie Powers, succeeded by Johnny Wells in 1928) and guitar (Bud Scott).

Noone signed with Brunswick Records in May 1928 and was assigned to their Vocalion label. The first session yielded &quot;Four or Five Times&quot; backed with &quot;Every Evening (I Miss You)&quot; (Vocalion 1185), which was a best seller.

&quot;The quintet which Noone brought to Vocalion was unique in that it preserved New Orleans&#x27; musical concepts without using brass instruments,&quot; wrote jazz historian Richard Hadlock in his notes to Decca&#x27;s 1994 remastered reissue of the 1928–1929 Apex Club Orchestra recordings. &quot;Joe Poston and Noone took turns playing a loose, melodic lead and the powerful right hand of Hines was often blended into the front line to plump up the harmony...Noone seemed to keep one foot in traditional New Orleans bandsmanship and the other in the new movement toward virtuoso swing solo playing.&quot;

Noone inspired Maurice Ravel&#x27;s 1928 composition, &quot;Boléro&quot;. Benny Goodman was among the teenage musicians often seen at the Apex Club. &quot;He absorbed in his own playing the beautiful tone and sparkling flow of Jimmie Noone&quot;, wrote John S. Wilson, music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Not yet ten years old, Nat King Cole listened to Noone&#x27;s band on the radio, and he would sneak out his window to sit in the alley outside the nightclub and listen to Noone and Hines. Some ten years later, when a customer badgered Cole to sing along with his instrumental trio, the first song he sang was &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot;, Noone&#x27;s theme song.

Noone remained in Chicago, working at the Apex Club until it was raided and shut down in 1929, and then worked at other Chicago clubs throughout the next decade. He recorded with Doc Cook&#x27;s band as well as his own. In 1931, Noone left Chicago for a month at the Savoy Ballroom, and in 1935 he briefly moved to New York City, to start a band and a (short-lived) club with Wellman Braud. He made long tours around the country, including performances in New Orleans.

Noone remained with Brunswick through 1935 (mostly on Vocalion, but also had a number of records issued on Brunswick) and then signed with Decca in early 1936 and one session each for Decca in 1936, 1937 and 1940. He did one session for Bluebird also in 1940.

With swing music dominating jazz, Noone tried leading a big band—singer Joe Williams made his professional debut in 1937 with the group—but he went back to his small-ensemble format.

=== 1943–1944 ===
In 1943, Noone moved to Los Angeles, California, where a traditional New Orleans-style jazz revival was under way. He began to enjoy renewed popularity that year when the Brunswick Collectors Series reissued his 1928 Vocalion recordings in a Decca album set (B-1006) titled &quot;Jimmie Noone, Dean of Modern Hot Clarinetists – Apex Club, Chicago 1928, Volume 1&quot;.

Arriving in Los Angeles, Noone was confronted with a massive housing shortage due to the population boom associated with the war industry. On September 14, 1943, Ted LeBerthon of &quot;The Los Angeles Daily News&quot; wrote a column pleading for someone to rent or sell a home to Noone:
I noted that Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw or Woody Herman, three outstanding white jazz clarinetists and band leaders, would have found a home because, being white, they did not have to confine their search to a limited restricted area. Also, I pointed out, they made far bigger money because of being white, and could afford to pay a far higher rental. The situation, I observed, was cruelly ironic. For Hugues Panassié, the distinguished French music critic, in his book &quot;The Real Jazz&quot;, had acclaimed Jimmie Noone as the greatest clarinetist of all time, the possessor of a more beautiful, more poignant tone and a player able to summon more sensitive nuances than any other. The late Maurice Ravel, who acknowledged basing his &quot;Boléro&quot; on a Jimmie Noone improvisation, had publicly dared any symphonic clarinetist to perform Jimmie&#x27;s technical feats. But in Los Angeles there was no place for Jimmie and his lovely wife, Rita.

The column brought about LeBerthon&#x27;s dismissal after seven years with the &quot;Daily News&quot;.

Noone&#x27;s wife (born Rita Mary Mathieu, 1912–1980) and their three children had to move back to Chicago while Noone continued to look for a place for them to live. In addition to it being a burdensome expense for the musician, LeBurthon later reported that the stress on Noone aggravated a cardiac ailment that had emerged during the Depression years. By February 1944, however, Noone was able to find a home in Los Angeles for his family and after some delays they were reunited.

On March 15, 1944, Noone made his first appearance with an all-star band featured on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;—a band that was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz. A passionate and knowledgeable fan of traditional jazz, Orson Welles asked Marili Morden of Hollywood&#x27;s Jazz Man Record Shop to put together an authentic jazz band for his radio show. Within minutes she assembled Mutt Carey (trumpet), Ed Garland (bass), Kid Ory (trombone), Bud Scott (guitar), Zutty Singleton (drums), Buster Wilson (piano), and Jimmie Noone (clarinet). Other than Singleton, Noone was the only band member who was working regularly, performing with his own quartet at the Streets of Paris in Hollywood. Their performances on the Welles show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and launched Ory&#x27;s comeback.

Noone performed on four broadcasts of &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;. On the morning of the fifth broadcast, April 19, 1944, Noone suddenly died at home of a heart attack, aged 48. Welles telephoned Kid Ory and told him of Noone&#x27;s death, and asked him to write a blues that could be performed for that evening&#x27;s radio program. &quot;See if you can work one up,&quot; Welles said. &quot;We&#x27;ll call it &#x27;Blues for Jimmie&#x27;.&quot;

In 1952, Ory reflected on writing the tune, which by then was regarded a classic. &quot;I got up right away and began blowing some blues on my horn. I was real sad; Jimmie was my best friend,&quot; Ory said. &quot;I found a man to fill in for Jimmie on clarinet. Then I got the band together that afternoon and we rehearsed the tune. On the show that night Mr. Welles explained the situation over the air. I don&#x27;t mind saying that when we played &#x27;Blues for Jimmie&#x27; all the musicians in the band were crying. So was Mr. Welles, and the audience, too.&quot;

On the program that evening, Welles spoke extemporaneously for three minutes about Noone while Buster Wilson and Bud Scott, a member of Jimmie Noone&#x27;s Apex Club Orchestra, played &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; in the background. &quot;That was his theme, remember?&quot; Welles said. As he did every time the All Star Jazz Group appeared, Welles introduced each musician by name, and that night he introduced New Orleans-born clarinetist Wade Whaley, sitting in for Noone.

&quot;Blues for Jimmie&quot; became a regular feature for Kid Ory&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, and they recorded it for Crescent Records in August 1944.

Until a few nights before his death Noone continued to perform with own quartet. He signed with Capitol Records in March 1944 and his last recordings were made for Capitol&#x27;s &quot;New American Jazz&quot; album (Capitol A-3, August 1944), produced by Dave Dexter, Jr. Dexter called Noone &quot;a gracious, personable and musicianly artist—one whose devotion to the early New Orleans style of playing was ever apparent—and with his passing the profession lost another of its pioneers.&quot;

In August 1944, the Musicians Congress sponsored a memorial concert at the Trocadero in Noone&#x27;s honor, and for the benefit of his family. Featured artists included the All Star Jazz Group, Calvin Jackson, Wingy Manone, Johnny Mercer, the Nicholas Brothers, Earl Robinson, Rex Stewart, Joe Sullivan and Dooley Wilson. Albert Dekker was master of ceremonies.

==Discography==
Jimmie Noone&#x27;s Apex Club Orchestra was recorded in Chicago. Personnel include Jimmie Noone (clarinet), Joe Poston (alto saxophone), Earl Hines (piano), Bud Scott (banjo and guitar) and Johnny Wells (drums). The August 1928 sessions also include Lawson Buford (tuba).

* &quot;New Orleans Jazz&quot; (Olympic, 1975)
* &quot;Chicago Dixieland in the Forties&quot; (Smithsonian Folkways, 1981)
* &quot;Oh! Sister, Ain&#x27;t That Hot&quot; (Jazz Heritage Series, 1983)
* &quot;Apex Blues&quot; (Decca, 1994)

== Legacy ==
Noone is generally regarded as one of the greatest of the second generation of jazz clarinetists, along with Johnny Dodds and Sidney Bechet. Noone&#x27;s playing is not as blues-tinged as Dodds nor as flamboyant as Bechet, but is perhaps more lyrical and sophisticated, and certainly makes more use of &quot;sweet&quot; flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw, Irving Fazola and Benny Goodman.

Jimmie Noone and His Orchestra make a brief appearance in the East Side Kids feature film, &quot;Block Busters&quot; (1944), released three months after Noone&#x27;s death. The quartet performs excerpts of &quot;Apex Blues&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;.

Noone&#x27;s discography concluded with recordings of his performances on &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot; in March and April 1944. Several albums collect all of the live performances (also available on the Internet Archive), and a few collect most of Welles&#x27;s introductions of the band, including his eulogy for Jimmie Noone.

Nesuhi Ertegun founded Crescent Records—the first record label he created—with the express purpose of recording the All Star Jazz Band featured on &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;. Jimmie Noone died before any recording had begun. With the exception of Zutty Singleton, who had other commitments, the rest of the group stayed together and was renamed Kid Ory&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band by Ertegun. The second disc released by Crescent Records features &quot;Blues for Jimmie&quot;, recorded in August 1944.

Jimmie Noone, Jr. (1938–1991), the oldest of Noone&#x27;s three children, was a jazz clarinetist who made his professional debut in 1964. He made an album with John R. T. Davies in 1985 and began working with Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham&#x27;s Sweet Baby Blues Band in 1984. Noone made five albums with The Cheathams and taught jazz in the San Diego public school system from 1967 to 1984. He died of a heart seizure in 1991, aged 52.

&quot;Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me&quot; (1928) is featured on the soundtrack of Woody Allen&#x27;s 2013 film, &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;. His tune, &quot;Way Down Yonder In New Orleans&quot; (1936), is featured in the 2014 French film &quot;Une heure de tranquillité&quot; but attributed to a fictional clarinetist named Niel Youart on his 1958 album &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;.

<doc id="153749" wikidata="Q743506" url="?curid=153749" title="Edmund Bonner">
<text>Edmund Bonner (also Boner; c. 15005 September 1569) was Bishop of London from 1539 to 1549 and again from 1553 to 1559. Initially an instrumental figure in the schism of Henry VIII from Rome, he was antagonised by the Protestant reforms introduced by the Duke of Somerset and reconciled himself to Catholicism. He became notorious as &quot;Bloody Bonner&quot; for his role in the persecution of heretics under the Catholic government of Mary I of England, and ended his life as a prisoner under Queen Elizabeth I.

==Early life==
Bonner was the son of Elizabeth Frodsham, who was married to Edmund Bonner, a sawyer of Hanley, Worcestershire. John Strype printed an account, with many circumstantial details, stating that Bonner was the natural son of George Savage (and therefore grandson of Sir John Savage and great-nephew of Thomas Savage who had also served as Bishop of London, before he became Archbishop of York), rector of Davenham, Cheshire, and that his mother married Bonner only after the future bishop&#x27;s birth. This account was disputed by Strype&#x27;s contemporary, Sir Edmund Lechmere, who asserted that Bonner was of legitimate birth.

He was educated at Broadgates Hall, now Pembroke College, Oxford, graduating bachelor of civil and canon law in June 1519. He was ordained about the same time and admitted doctor of civil law (DCL) in 1525.

==An agent of royal supremacy==
In 1529 he was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s chaplain, which brought him to the notice of the king and Thomas Cromwell. After the fall of Wolsey he remained faithful to him and was with him at the time of his arrest at Cawood and death at Leicester in 1530. Subsequently, he was transferred, perhaps through Cromwell&#x27;s influence, to the service of the king, and in January 1532 he was sent to Rome as the king&#x27;s agent when the question of the king&#x27;s divorce was raised. There he sought to obstruct the judicial proceedings against Henry in the papal curia.

In October 1533 he was entrusted with the task of suggesting to Clement VII (while he was the guest of Francis I at Marseille) Henry&#x27;s appeal from the pope to a general council; but there seems to be no good authority for Gilbert Burnet&#x27;s story that Clement threatened to have him burnt alive. For these and other services Bonner had been rewarded by successive grants of the livings of Cherry Burton (Yorkshire), Ripple (Worcestershire), Blaydon (County Durham), and East Dereham (Norfolk). He was rector of Uppingham (Rutland), 1528–1541 and, in 1535, he was made Archdeacon of Leicester.

During the following years he was much employed on important embassies in the king&#x27;s interests, first to the pope to appeal against the excommunication pronounced in July 1533, afterwards to the Emperor to dissuade him from attending the general council which the pope wished to summon at Vicenza. Towards the end of 1535 he was sent to further what he called &quot;the cause of the Gospel&quot; (&quot;Letters and Papers&quot;, 1536, No. 469) in North Germany; and in 1536 he wrote a preface to Stephen Gardiner&#x27;s &quot;De vera Obedientia&quot;, which asserted the royal and denied the papal supremacy, and was received with delight by the Lutherans. After a brief embassy to the Emperor in the spring of 1538, Bonner succeeded Gardiner as ambassador to the French Court in Paris. In this capacity he proved capable and successful, though irritation was frequently caused by his overbearing and dictatorial manner. He began his mission by sending Cromwell a long list of accusations against his predecessor. He was almost as bitter against Wyatt and Mason, whom he denounced as a &quot;papist&quot;, and the violence of his conduct led Francis I to threaten him with a hundred strokes of the halberd. He seems, however, to have pleased his patron, Cromwell, and perhaps Henry, by his energy in seeing the king&#x27;s Great Bible in English through the press in Paris. He was already king&#x27;s chaplain; his appointment at Paris had been accompanied by promotion to the See of Hereford (27 November 1538) but owing to his absence he could neither be consecrated nor take possession of his see, and he was still abroad when he was translated to the Bishopric of London (October 1539). Bonner returned to England and was consecrated 4 April 1540.

Hitherto Bonner had possessed a reputation as a somewhat coarse and unscrupulous tool of Cromwell – a sort of ecclesiastical Thomas Wriothesley, he is not known to have protested against any of the changes effected by his masters; he professed to be no theologian, and was in the habit, when asked technical questions, to refer his interrogators to the theologians. He had graduated in law, and not in theology. There was nothing in the Reformation to appeal to him, except the repudiation of papal control; and he was one of those numerous Englishmen whose views were faithfully reflected in Henry&#x27;s Act of the Six Articles. Indeed, almost his first duty as Bishop of London was to try heretics under these articles; accusations of excessive cruelty and bias against the accused were spread broadcast by his enemies, and from the first he seems to have been unpopular in London. He became a staunch conservative. During the years 1542-43 he was again abroad in Spain and Germany as ambassador to the emperor, at the end of which time he returned to London.

The death of the king on 28 January 1547, proved the turning point in Bonner&#x27;s career. Hitherto he had shown himself entirely subservient to the sovereign, supporting him in the matter of the divorce, approving of the suppression of the religious houses and taking the oath of Supremacy which John Fisher and Thomas More refused at the cost of their lives. However, while accepting the schism from Rome, he had always resisted the Reformers&#x27; innovations and held to the doctrines of the old religion.

Therefore, from the first he put himself in opposition to the religious changes introduced by Protector Somerset and Archbishop Cranmer. Bonner began to doubt that supremacy when he saw to what uses it could be put by a Protestant council, and either he or Gardiner evolved the theory that the royal supremacy was in abeyance (undetermined) during a royal minority. The ground was skillfully chosen, but it was not legally nor constitutionally tenable. Both he and Gardiner had in fact sought fresh licences to exercise their ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the young king Edward VI; and, if he was supreme enough to confer jurisdiction, he was supreme enough to issue the injunctions and order the visitation to which Bonner objected. It was on this question that he came into conflict with Edward&#x27;s government.

==Realignment with Catholicism==
===Under Edward VI===
Bonner resisted the visitation of August 1547, and was committed to the Fleet Prison; but he withdrew his opposition, and was released in time to take an active part against the government in the parliament of November 1547. In the next session, November 1548-March 1549, he was a leading opponent of the first Act of Uniformity and Book of Common Prayer. When these became law, he neglected to enforce them, and on 1 September 1549 he was required by the council to maintain at St Paul&#x27;s Cross that the royal authority was as great as if the king were forty years of age.

He did so, but with such significant omissions in the matter which had been prescribed touching the king&#x27;s authority, that after a seven days&#x27; trial he was deprived of his bishopric by an ecclesiastical court over which Cranmer presided, and sent as a prisoner to the Marshalsea. The fall of Somerset in the following month raised Bonner&#x27;s hopes, and he appealed from Cranmer to the council. After a struggle the Protestant faction gained the upper hand, and on 7 February 1550 Bonner&#x27;s deprivation was confirmed by the council sitting in the Star Chamber, and he was further condemned to perpetual imprisonment, where he remained until the accession of Mary in 1553.

===Under Mary I===
Bonner was at once restored to his see, his deprivation being regarded as invalid and Ridley as an intruder. He vigorously restored Catholicism in his diocese, made no difficulty about submitting to the papal jurisdiction which he had foresworn. During 1554 Bonner carried out a visitation of his diocese, restoring the Mass and the manifold practices and emblems of Catholic life, but the work was carried out slowly and with difficulty. To help in the work, Bonner published a list of thirty-seven &quot;Articles to be enquired of&quot;, but these led to such disturbances that they were temporarily withdrawn.

Mary&#x27;s administration thought that religious dissidents would best be dealt with by ecclesiastical tribunals rather than by the civil power. As Bonner was Bishop of London, the chief burden of stamping out religious dissent fell to him. Therefore, in 1555, he began the persecution to which he owes his notoriety among his detractors as &quot;Bloody Bonner.&quot; He was appointed to degrade Cranmer at Oxford in February 1556. The part he took in these affairs gave rise to intense hatred on the part of the rebels. John Foxe in his &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot; summed up this view in two lines:

:&quot;This cannibal in three years space three hundred martyrs slew
:They were his food, he loved so blood, he sparèd none he knew.&quot;

His apologists, including defenders of Catholicism in England, claim his actions were merely &quot;official&quot;, and that &quot;he had no control&quot; over the fate of the accused &quot;once they were declared to be irreclaimable heretics and handed over to the secular power; but he always strove by gentle suasion first to reconcile them to the Church&quot;; the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; asserts the number of persons executed as heretics in his jurisdiction as about 120, rather than 300. Many of his victims were forced upon him by the king and queen in Council, which at one point addressed a letter to Bonner on the express ground that he was not proceeding with sufficient severity. So completely had the state dominated the church that religious persecutions had become state persecutions, and Bonner was acting as an ecclesiastical sheriff in the most refractory district of the realm. Even John Foxe records instances in which Bonner failed to persecute those authorised for persecution.

Bonner&#x27;s detractors, beginning with his Protestant contemporaries John Foxe and John Bale and continuing through most English historiography of the period, paint a different picture. Bonner, they point out, was one of those who brought it to pass that the condemnation of heretics to the fire should be part of his ordinary official duties, and he was represented as hounding men and women to death with merciless vindictiveness. Bale, formerly a friar and ex-Bishop of Ossory, published from his place of exile at Basel in 1554 an attack on the bishop, in which he speaks of him as among other things, &quot;the bloody sheep-bite of London&quot; and &quot;bloody Bonner&quot;.

Bonner&#x27;s most important writings date from this time. They include &quot;Responsum et Exhortatio in laudem Sacerdotii&quot; (1553); &quot;Articles to be enquired of in the General Visitation of Edmund Bishop of London&quot; (1554); and &quot;&quot; (1555), as well as a catechism, probably written by his chaplains, Nicholas Harpsfield and Henry Pendleton, entitled &quot;A profitable and necessary doctrine&quot; (1554, 2d ed. 1555).

==Under Elizabeth==
After the death of Mary, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne. The Council ordered him to resign the bishopric, which he refused to do, adding that he preferred death. He was sent again to the Marshalsea prison on 20 April 1560. During the next two years representatives of the Protestant party frequently clamoured for the execution of Bonner and the other imprisoned bishops. When the Parliament of 1563 met, a new act of Parliament, the Supremacy of the Crown Act 1562 (5 Eliz. 1. c. 1), was passed by which the first refusal of the oath of royal supremacy was &quot;praemunire&quot;, the second, high treason. The bishops had refused the oath once, so that by this act, which became law on 10 April 1563, their next refusal of the oath might be followed by their death. Thanks to the intervention of the Spanish ambassador, action against the bishops was delayed; but a year later, on 29 April 1564, Bonner was indicted on a charge of &quot;praemunire&quot; on refusing the oath when tendered him by his diocesan, Bishop Horne of Winchester. He challenged the legality of Horne&#x27;s consecration, and a special act of Parliament, the Bishops Act 1566 (8 Eliz. 1. c. 1), was passed to meet the point, while the charge against Bonner was withdrawn. Four times a year for three years he was forced to appear in the courts at Westminster only to be further remanded. The last of these appearances took place in the Michaelmas term of 1568, so the last year of the bishop&#x27;s life was spent in prison. His demeanour during his long imprisonment was remarkable for his cheerfulness, and even John Jewel, the Bishop of Salisbury, describes him in a letter as &quot;a most courteous man and gentlemanly both in his manners and appearance&quot; (&quot;Zurich Letters&quot;, I, 34).

Bonner never tired of trying to convert others to Catholicism, and never expressed regret over his actions under Queen Mary. Bishop Jewel, in a letter to Peter Martyr Vermigli, related that &quot;.&quot; Bonner died in the Marshalsea on 5 September 1569, and was buried in St George&#x27;s, Southwark, secretly at midnight to avoid the risk of a hostile demonstration.

==Bonner in historical memory==

Contemporary Catholic writers attributed to Bonner and the other bishops who died in prison the honour of martyrdom: &quot;in vinculis obierunt martyres&quot;. On the walls of the English College, Rome, an inscription recording the deaths of eleven bishops, but without naming them, found a place among the paintings of the martyrs. Bonner was attacked during life with a rare hatred which has followed him into the grave, so that in English history few names have been so execrated and vilified as his.

A more charitable assessment of Bonner&#x27;s character was made by an Anglican historian, S. R. Maitland, who considers him... .
This verdict was generally followed by later historians. Lord Acton in the &quot;Cambridge Modern History&quot; (1904) argued: &quot;The number of those put to death in his diocese of London was undoubtedly disproportionately large, but this would seem to have been more the result of the strength of the reforming element in the capital and in Essex than of the employment of exceptional rigour; while the evidence also shows that he himself patiently dealt with many of the Protestants, and did his best to induce them to renounce what he conscientiously believed to be their errors.&quot;
Twelve of Bonner&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1555; nine of these were by John Harpsfield) were translated into the Cornish language by John Tregear in around 1560, and the &quot;Tregear Homilies&quot; are now the largest single work of traditional Cornish prose.

<doc id="153750" wikidata="Q744710" url="?curid=153750" title="Patois">
<text>Patois ( ) is speech or language that is considered nonstandard, although the term is not formally defined in linguistics. As such, &quot;patois&quot; can refer to pidgins, creoles, dialects or vernaculars, but not commonly to jargon or slang, which are vocabulary-based forms of cant.

In colloquial usage of the term, especially in France, class distinctions are implied by the very meaning of the term, since in French, &quot;patois&quot; refers to any sociolect associated with uneducated rural classes, in contrast with the dominant prestige language (Standard French) spoken by the middle and high classes of cities or as used in literature and formal settings (the &quot;acrolect&quot;). Sociolinguistics is the discipline that studies the relationship between these language varieties, how they relate to the dominant culture and, in the case of France, to national language policy.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;patois&quot; comes from Old French , &#x27;local or regional dialect&#x27; (originally meaning &#x27;rough, clumsy or uncultivated speech&#x27;), possibly from the verb , &#x27;to treat roughly&#x27;, from , &#x27;paw&#x27;, from Old Low Franconian , &#x27;paw, sole of the foot&#x27;, plus the suffix .

==Examples==
In France and other Francophone countries, &quot;patois&quot; has been used to describe non-standard French and regional languages such as Picard, Occitan and Franco-Provençal since 1643, and Catalan after 1700 when the king Louis XIV banned its use. The word assumes the view of such languages being backward, countrified and unlettered; thus the term &quot;patois&quot; is potentially considered offensive when used by outsiders. As Jean Jaurès once said, &quot;One names &quot;patois&quot; the language of a defeated nation.&quot; In France and Switzerland, however, the term &quot;patois&quot; no longer holds any offensive connotation, and has become a celebrated and distinguished variant of the numerous local tongues.

The vernacular form of English spoken in Jamaica is also referred to as &quot;patois&quot; or &quot;patwa&quot;. It is noted especially in reference to Jamaican Patois from 1934. Jamaican Patois language consists of words from the native languages spoken by many Caribbean ethnic and cultural groups including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian, English and several African languages. Additionally, some islands have Creole dialects influenced by French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese and others. Jamaican Patois is also spoken in Costa Rica and French Creole is spoken in Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana in South America.

Often, these patois are popularly considered &quot;broken English&quot; or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified more correctly as a Creole language. Notably, in the Francophone Caribbean, the analogous term for local basilectal languages is &quot;créole&quot; (see also Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole). Antillean Creole, in addition to French, is spoken in Lesser Antilles and includes vocabulary and grammar of African and Carib origin. Its dialects often contain folk-etymological derivatives of French words. For example, &#x27; (&quot;river, stream&quot;), a syncopated variant of the standard French phrase (&quot;the river&quot;), has been associated by folk etymology with (&quot;to wash&quot;). Therefore, &#x27; is interpreted to mean &quot;a place to wash&quot; since such streams are often used for washing laundry.

Other examples of &quot;patois&quot; include Trasianka, Sheng and Tsotsitaal. 

In Uruguay, &quot;patois&quot; has been spoken by citizens in the south of Uruguay, many who hail from France and Piedmont region of Italy.

==Synonyms==

Dominican, Grenadian, St. Lucian, Trinidadian and Venezuelan speakers of Antillean Creole call the language &quot;patois&quot;. It is also named in the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela and spoken since the eighteenth century by self-colonization of French people (from Corsica) and Caribbean people (from Martinique, Trinidad, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) who moved for cacao production.

Macanese Patois is also known as &quot;Patuá&quot; and was originally spoken by the Macanese community of the former Portuguese colony of Macau.

<text>Jamaican English, including Jamaican Standard English, is the variety of English native to Jamaica and is the official language of the country. A distinction exists between Jamaican English and Jamaican Patois (a creole language), though not entirely a sharp distinction so much as a gradual continuum between two extremes. Jamaican English tends to follow British English spelling conventions.

==Sociolinguistics==
There are several language varieties that have significantly impacted the Jamaican dialect of English. English was introduced into Jamaica in 1655, because of British colonisation. British English was spread through post-primary education, and through British teachers that immigrated to Jamaica. Standard English in Jamaica conflated with the British standard. Individuals who speak the standard variety are often considered to be of a higher social class; the people who speak more standard English than patois are known as “uptown” Also, American English has contributed to the Jamaican English dialect. These impacts can be traced to the development of stronger social and economic ties with the United States, the popularity of U.S. cultural offerings, including film, music, and televised dramas and comedies and tourism. Jamaican Patois is another source of influence on Jamaican English. Many rural homes are monolingually Patois.

==Grammar==
There are great similarities between standard British English and the standard variety of Jamaican English, including in grammar, idiom, and vocabulary.

==Phonology==

Features of standard Jamaican English include the characteristic pronunciation of the diphthong in words like , which is often more closed and rounded than in British Received Pronunciation (RP) or General American (GA); the pronunciation of the vowel to (again, more closed and rounded than the RP or GA varieties); and the very distinctive feature of &quot;variable semi-rhoticity&quot;. Non-rhoticity (the pronunciation of &quot;r&quot; nowhere except before vowels) is highly variable in Jamaican English and can depend upon the phonemic and even social context. Jamaican English accents are: non-rhotic regarding words of the lexical set (at the ends of unstressed syllables); rhotic (i.e., fully preserving the &quot;r&quot; sound) regarding words of the and sets; high to middling in degrees of rhoticity regarding the , , and sets; and low regarding rhoticity with most other word sets. When &quot;r&quot; is followed by a consonant, non-rhoticity is more likely than when &quot;r&quot; is not followed by a consonant. However, overall more rhoticity is positively correlated with higher levels of education. This has been attributed to the Jamaican education system normalising and promoting a rhotic variety of English. Thus, the overall degree of rhoticity in educated Jamaican English remains very low, with rhoticity occurring 21.7% of the time.

Merger of the diphthongs in &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;fear&quot; takes place both in Jamaican Standard English and Jamaican Patois, resulting in those two words (and many others, like &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;beer&quot;) often becoming homophones: the sound being , though often (something like &quot;ee-air&quot;; thus &quot;bear/beer&quot; as &quot;bee-air&quot;).

The short &quot;a&quot; sound (, man, hat, etc.) is very open , similar to its Irish variants, while , , and all use this same sound too, but lengthened, and perhaps slightly backed; this distinction can maintain a London-like split. Both and use a rounded , though a cot-caught merger is theoretically avoided by the latter set of words being more lengthened; however, in reality, a full merger (of ) is reportedly increasing in informal contexts. For Jamaican Patois speakers, the merged vowel is much lower. and vowels in the standard educated dialect are long monophthongs: respectively and . The unstressed schwa phoneme () appears to be normally produced in the area of .

Before the low central vowel , the velars and can be realized with palatalisation, so that &quot;cat&quot; can be pronounced [khat ~ kjat] and &quot;card&quot; as [kha:d ~ kja:d]); while [ɡ] and [ɡj] coexist, as in &quot;gap&quot; [ɡap ~ ɡjap] or guard [ɡa:(ɹ)d ~ ɡja:(ɹ)d]. These variations are distinct phonemes in Jamaican Patois before [a]: [ɡja:dn̩] is &quot;garden&quot; while [ɡa:dn̩] is &quot;Gordon&quot;; [kja:f] is &quot;calf&quot; while [ka:f] is &quot;cough&quot;. They are not distinct phonemes in Jamaica English because these word pairs are distinguished by the vowel ([a] vs [ɔ]) instead. However, this fact hasn&#x27;t stopped educated speakers from incorporating [kj] in their English at least before unlengthened &quot;a&quot;. However, vowel length can be a relevant factor, since it is possible to hear forms like for &quot;cat&quot;, for &quot;carry&quot;, for &quot;character&quot;, and for &quot;Caribbean&quot;, but affluent or aspiring middle-class speakers tend to avoid for &quot;car&quot; due to its longer vowel.

Presumably less-educated Jamaican Patois speakers may speak English with several other notable features, including a merger (e.g. with &quot;rat&quot; and &quot;rot&quot; homophones) to and a merger (e.g. with &quot;line&quot; and &quot;loin&quot; homophones) to . Th-stopping is also common.

One of the most salient sounds of Caribbean English to speakers of outside English dialects is its unique rhythm and intonation. Linguists debate whether this system centres mostly on stress, tone, or a mixture in which the two interact. Sometimes, Jamaican English is perceived as maintaining less of a contrast between stressed and unstressed syllables, in other words, making all syllables sound relatively-equally stressed: thus &quot;kitchen&quot; not so much as (perhaps even perceived by a non-Caribbean as having second-syllable stress: ). In Jamaican English, normally reduced English vowels are sometimes not reduced, and other times are hyper-reduced, so that &quot;token&quot; is not but , yet &quot;cement&quot; can be as reduced as ; the exact nuances of the rules at play here are also highly debated.

==Language use: Jamaican Standard English versus Patois==

Jamaican Standard English and Jamaican Patois exist together in a post-creole speech continuum. Jamaican (Creole/Patois) is used by most people for everyday, informal situations; it is the language most Jamaicans use at home and are most familiar with, as well as the language of most local popular music. Jamaican Patois has begun to be used on the radio as well as the news. Standard English, on the other hand, is the language of education, high culture, government, the media and official/formal communications. It is also the native language of a small minority of Jamaicans (typically upper-class and upper/traditional middle-class). Most Creole-dominant speakers have a fair command of English and Standard English, through schooling and exposure to official culture and mass media; their receptive skills (understanding of Standard English) are typically much better than their productive skills (their own intended Standard English statements often show signs of Jamaican Creole influence).

Most writing in Jamaica is done in English (including private notes and correspondence). Jamaican Patois has a standardised orthography as well, but has only recently been taught in some schools, so the majority of Jamaicans can read and write standard English only, and have trouble deciphering written Patois (in which the writer tries to reflect characteristic structures and pronunciations to differing degrees, without compromising readability). Written Patois appears mostly in literature, especially in folkloristic &quot;dialect poems&quot;; in humoristic newspaper columns; and most recently, on internet chat sites frequented by younger Jamaicans, who seem to have a more positive attitude toward their own language use than their parents.

While, for the sake of simplicity, it is customary to describe Jamaican speech in terms of standard English versus Jamaican Creole, a clear-cut dichotomy does not describe the actual language use of most Jamaicans. Between the two extremes—&quot;broad Patois&quot; on one end of the spectrum, and &quot;perfect&quot; Standard English on the other—there are various in-between varieties. This situation typically results when a Creole language is in constant contact with Standardised English (superstrate or lexifier language) and is called a creole speech continuum. The least prestigious (most Creole) variety is called the basilect; Standard English (or high prestige) variety, the acrolect; and in-between versions are known as mesolects.

Consider, for example, the following forms:

*&quot;im/(h)ihn de/da/a wok úoba désò&quot; (basilect)
*&quot;im workin ova deso&quot; (low mesolect)
*&quot;(H)e (h)is workin&#x27; over dere&quot; (high mesolect)
*&quot;He is working over there.&quot; (acrolect)

(As noted above, the &quot;r&quot; in &quot;over&quot; is not pronounced in any variety, but the one in &quot;dere&quot; or &quot;there&quot; is.)

Jamaicans choose from the varieties available to them according to the situation. A Creole-dominant speaker may choose a higher variety for formal occasions like official business or a wedding speech, and a lower one for relating to friends; a standard English-dominant speaker is likely to employ a lower variety when shopping at the market than at their workplace. Code-switching can also be metacommunicative (as when a Standard-dominant speaker switches to a more heavily basilect-influenced variety in an attempt at humor or to express solidarity).

<text>Nathaniel Dourif Friedman (born 6 August 1977) is an American technology executive and investor. He was the chief executive officer (CEO) of GitHub and former chairman of the GNOME Foundation. Friedman is currently a board member at the Arc Institute and an advisor of Midjourney.

==Early life and education==
Friedman attended and graduated from St. Anne&#x27;s-Belfield School in 1996.

In 1996, while a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Friedman befriended Miguel de Icaza on LinuxNet, the IRC network that Friedman had created to discuss Linux. As an intern at Microsoft, Friedman worked on the IIS web server. At MIT, he studied Computer Science and Mathematics and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1999.

==Career==
In 1999, Friedman co-founded Ximian (originally called International Gnome Support, then Helix Code) with de Icaza to develop applications and infrastructure for GNOME, the project de Icaza had started with the aim of producing a free software desktop environment. The company was later bought by Novell in 2003.

At Novell, Friedman was the Chief Technology and Strategy Officer for Open Source until January 2010. There he launched the Hula Project which began with the release of components of Novell NetMail as open source. During his tenure, Novell began an effort to migrate 6,000 employees away from Microsoft Windows to SUSE Linux and from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice.org. Friedman&#x27;s final project before his departure was work on SUSE Studio.

During his sabbatical, Friedman created and hosted a podcast called &quot;Hacker Medley&quot; with friend and former Ximian employee Alex Graveley.

In May 2011, Friedman and de Icaza founded Xamarin, with Friedman as CEO. The company was created to offer commercial support for Mono, a project that de Icaza had initiated at Ximian to provide a free software implementation of Microsoft&#x27;s .NET software stack. At Xamarin they focused on continuing to develop Mono and MonoDevelop and marketing the cross-platform Xamarin SDK to developers targeting mobile computing devices and video game consoles. In 2016, Xamarin was acquired by Microsoft.

With the June 2018 announcement of Microsoft&#x27;s $7.5 billion (~$ in ) acquisition of GitHub, the companies simultaneously announced that Friedman, then a Microsoft corporate vice president, would become GitHub&#x27;s new CEO. GitHub&#x27;s co-founder and then-current CEO Chris Wanstrath had been leading a search for his replacement since August 2017. Friedman assumed the role of CEO on October 29, 2018. During his tenure as CEO, Friedman introduced a number of new products rapidly, including GitHub Copilot, GitHub Codespaces, a native GitHub mobile app for iOS and Android, the GitHub Advanced Security product, GitHub Sponsors to support open source developers financially, and a new GitHub CLI. Friedman also acquired six companies including NPM, Semmle, Dependabot, and PullPanda. He helped grow GitHub to an estimated value of $16.5 billion (~$ in ), more than double what Microsoft paid for GitHub in 2018. In November 2021, Friedman announced that he was stepping down as CEO.

Friedman co-founded California YIMBY in 2017 to address California&#x27;s housing shortage.

In 2023, Friedman created nat.dev, a web interface for popular large language models.

Alongside Daniel Gross, Friedman also has made significant investments in the AI space through a fund called C2 Investments, as well as running an AI grant program that gives funding and Microsoft Azure credits. During the depositor run on Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March 2023, Friedman provided capital to multiple startups.

==Personal life==
He has been married to Stephanie Friedman (née Schatz) since 2009. They have a daughter, and live in Menlo Park since 2022, having moved there from San Francisco after a home-invasion.

<text>The Humber Bridge is a single-span road suspension bridge near Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. When it opened to traffic on 24 June 1981, it was the longest of its type in the world; the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge surpassed it in 1998, and it became the thirteenth-longest by 2024.

The bridge spans the Humber (an estuary formed by the rivers Trent and Ouse), between Barton-upon-Humber on the south bank and Hessle on the north bank, connecting the East Riding of Yorkshire with North Lincolnshire. Both sides of the bridge were in the non-metropolitan county of Humberside until its dissolution in 1996. The bridge can be seen for miles around, from as far as Patrington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and from out to sea miles off the coast. It is a Grade I listed building.

By 2006, the bridge carried an average of 120,000 vehicles per week. The toll was £3.00 each way for cars (higher for commercial vehicles), which made it the most expensive toll crossing in the United Kingdom. In April 2012, the toll was halved to £1.50 each way after the UK government deferred £150 million from the bridge&#x27;s outstanding debt.

==History==

Before the bridge, commuters crossed the Humber on the Humber Ferry from Corporation Pier at Hull and New Holland Pier at New Holland, Lincolnshire, or by road via the M62 (from 1976), M18 (from 1979) and M180 motorways, crossing, by way of the Ouse Bridge, the River Ouse near Goole (connected to the Humber). Until the mid-1970s the route south was via the single-carriageway A63 and the A614 (via grid-locked Thorne) where it met the busy A18 and crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal at Keadby Bridge, a swing bridge, which formed a bottleneck on the route, and on through Finningley and Bawtry, meeting the east–west A631.

The journey was along straight single-carriageway roads across foggy moors interrupted by bottlenecks for most of the journey to Blyth, Nottinghamshire, where it met the A1, and the accident rate was high. Debates in Parliament were held on the low standard of the route across the windswept plains around Goole. It was not unexpected that under these conditions, a Humber Bridge, with connecting dual-carriageway approach roads and grade-separated junctions, would seem worthwhile. By the time the bridge opened, much of this inferior route had been transformed by dualling of the A63 and its bypasses, extending the M62 and the connecting of the M18 from Thorne to Wadworth. The obvious need for a Humber Bridge had been reduced by the late 1970s with the improvements of the motorway infrastructure in the region. Although welcome, these improvements detracted from the need for vehicles to cross a bridge from Hessle to Barton. The Humber Bridge was a victim of the success of the M62 before it opened. A hovercraft service, &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot;, linked Hull Pier and Grimsby Docks from February to October 1969 but suffered relatively frequent breakdowns.

===Act of Parliament===

Plans for a bridge were drawn up in the 1930s when a team of engineers compiled a report on whether to bridge or tunnel the estuary. It was decided that a bridge would cost £1,750,000 over a tunnel which was costed at £7,200,000. Revised plans were unveiled in 1955, but work did not begin until 27 July 1972. The (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2. c. xlvi), was promoted by Kingston Upon Hull Corporation and established the Humber Bridge Board to manage and raise funds to build the bridge and buy the land required for the approach roads.

===1966 Kingston upon Hull North by-election===
The allocation of funds proved impossible until the 1966 Kingston upon Hull North by-election. Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson prevailed upon his Minister of Transport Barbara Castle to sanction the building of the bridge. Dismay at the long wait for a crossing led to Christopher Rowe writing a protest song, &quot;The Humber Bridge&quot;.

===Design===

The consulting engineers for the project were Freeman Fox &amp; Partners (now Arcadis NV). Sir Ralph Freeman had produced the first ideas in 1927 and in the early 1930s the cost of the project was estimated at £1.725 million and that the bridge would be unlikely to recoup the construction or maintenance costs. In 1935 he had an idea for a suspension bridge for the Humber Tunnel Executive Committee. Sir Gilbert Roberts produced more ideas in 1955 for a bridge with a central span, costing £15 million, to be paid for by East Riding County Council and Lindsey County Council. When it became likely that a bridge would be constructed, Imperial College-educated Bernard Wex OBE (1922–1990) produced the design in 1964 that was actually built. The bridge was built to last 120 years. In 1985 Wex was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers. In the 1950s he had helped to design High Marnham Power Station. He was a former UK chairman of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Engineers and helped to found the Steel Construction Institute in 1976.

The architect was R. E. Slater ARIBA. The administration building (for the tolls) was designed by Parker &amp; Rosner. The landscaping was designed by Prof Arnold Weddle. Wind tunnel testing took place at the National Maritime Institute (now part of BMT Limited) at Teddington, and the road deck was designed for wind speeds up to , but storms featuring considerably lower wind speeds have been cited as grounds for emergency repairs in recent years.

===Construction===
The main contractor for the steel superstructure was British Bridge Builders (the same grouping as for the Forth and Severn Road Bridges comprising Sir William Arrol &amp; Co., then a unit of NEI Cranes Ltd, Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company, and Redpath Dorman Long Ltd). The contractor for the concrete towers, anchorages and sub-structure was John Howard &amp; Co Ltd of Chatham, Kent, which was later bought by Amec. Concrete was chosen for the towers, instead of steel, partly due to cost, but also to suit the landscape.

Work began on the southern approach road in July 1972 by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe. The approach road to the A1077 junction, by Costain Civil Engineering, began in September 1976. It included a span from the southern anchorage of seven pre-stressed concrete box sections and the A1077 junction, costing £4.25 million. Work on the bridge substructure (foundations) began in March 1973. To reduce heat of hydration in the concrete, which produces calcium silicate hydrate from belite, as much as 60 per cent of the Portland cement was replaced with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). It took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a diaphragm wall design due to there not being enough shallow bedrock. The main southern approach roads from Barton to the M180 motorway junction at Barnetby were built in the late 1970s by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe, opening in 1978.

The towers were constructed by slipforming and the north tower was completed by May 1974. The southern foundations were completed in September 1975, with the pier completed in March 1976, and the southern tower was completed by September 1976; the bridge had been planned to open in 1976. The northern tower and anchorage was built on solid chalk but the southern tower and anchorage were built on fissured Kimmeridge Clay, from the southern shore and built with a difficult caisson design. The subcontractor for the concrete was Tileman &amp; Co. of Shipston-on-Stour, south Warwickshire.

Cable spinning took place between September 1977 and July 1979. Each cable weighs , with 37 strands of 404 lengths of cable. The cable on the northern span has four extra strands. Each cable can take a load of . The deck is of box girder form, the box sections around each. The first box sections were assembled in June 1975 and put into the main span on 9 November 1979. The toll buildings and north approach road were built by A. F. Budge of Retford, Nottinghamshire, costing £2.9 million. Work began on the administration building in November 1976. The toll system was manufactured by Plessey Controls of Poole, Dorset. Corrosion resistance on the steelwork was provided by Camrex Corrosion of Bellshill, North Lanarkshire. The road was laid by Tarmac Roadstone of Wolverhampton with mastic asphalt. In 2017, the bridge was designated a Grade I listed building.

===A-frames===
At road level the deck was fastened to the towers through four rocking A-frames, to allow for movement caused by the catenary supporting the deck from above deflecting with the weight of passing traffic, from thermal expansion, and from changes in wind loading. The devices catered for a maximum deflection of 2 metres. By 2011 it was noticed that the pivot-pin bearings carrying the frames had worn, allowing them to drop towards the support structure. Each frame was replaced by two new components: a vertical linkage to cater for longitudinal movement and a sliding bearing for lateral displacement.

===Opening===
The bridge opened to traffic on 24 June 1981 at a final cost of £91 million (). It was opened officially by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 July 1981, in a ceremony that included a prayer of dedication by the Archbishop of York and a fly-past by the Red Arrows.

===World record===
With a centre span of and a total length of , the Humber Bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world for 17 years, until the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge opened in Japan on 5 April 1998.

===Local benefits===
The road-distance between Hull and Grimsby fell by nearly ; the town of Scunthorpe and environs were relieved of the passing traffic between Hull and Grimsby.

==Bridge statistics==
The bridge&#x27;s surface takes the form of a dual carriageway with a lower-level foot and cycle path on both sides. There is a permanent speed limit on the full length of the bridge.

Each tower consists of a pair of hollow vertical concrete columns, each tall and tapering from square at the base to at the top. The bridge is designed to tolerate constant motion and bends more than in winds of . The towers, although vertical, are farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the curvature of the Earth.
The total length of the suspension cable is . The north tower is on the bank and has foundations down to . The south tower is in the water, and descends to as a consequence of the shifting sandbanks that make up the estuary.

The bridge held the record for the world&#x27;s longest single-span suspension bridge for 17 years, from its opening in July 1981 until the opening of the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge in April 1998. In June 2024, it became the thirteenth-longest, single-span suspension bridge. The central span, at , is the longest in Britain and in the Western Hemisphere. It remains the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world that can be crossed on foot or by bicycle.
The bridge is crossed twice during the annual Humber Bridge Half Marathon in June, and Hull Marathon in September.

==Toll update project==
In July 2013, work began on introducing a new electronic tolling system. The existing Humber Bridge toll system was largely the same as it was when the bridge opened in 1981. The computer system was over 15 years old, absorbed an increasing amount of maintenance, and needed to be replaced. The project would decrease waiting times and was welcomed by business and transport leaders.

In the first phase, the toll booths and the toll plaza canopy were replaced, and in the second phase, writing, testing and setting up the new toll system was completed. From 2015 bridge users could set up an account with the bridge and pay into it. Account holders receive a device called the HumberTAG, a small electronic tag that enables the system to recognise the bridge user; the toll is automatically deducted from the user&#x27;s account. Two central lanes through the plaza are free-flowing; they do not have booths and account holders are able to cross the bridge without stopping.

==Incidents and suicides==
During construction of the bridge, the road deck sections were floated up on barges then hoisted into place by cables. During one of these lifting operations some of the cables on two of the road deck sections failed, leaving the sections hanging at an angle. The sections were subsequently installed.

On more than 200 occasions, people have jumped or fallen from the bridge since it was opened in 1981; only five people have survived. Between 1990 and February 2001 the Humber Rescue Team launched its boat 64 times to deal with people falling or jumping off the bridge. Notable incidents include the cases of a West Yorkshire woman and her two-year-old daughter who fell off the bridge in 2005 and that of a man jumping from the bridge to his death on the A63 road below in September 2006.

Plans were announced on 26 December 2009 to construct a suicide barrier along the walkways of the bridge; design constraints were cited as the reason for not installing barriers during the construction of the bridge.

In May 2017, a YouTuber with the username &#x27;Night Scape&#x27;, along with a small group, illegally scaled the bridge without safety equipment. The group of young men climbed up the structure to the top of the bridge using the suspension wires as handholds. Humberside Police and the Humber Bridge Board have reviewed the security measures.

On 3 April 2021, the Humber Bridge was closed to pedestrians and cyclists following an unspecified &#x27;recent incident&#x27;. The decision came after multiple deaths at the bridge in the month of March. Following the death of one individual that month, a petition calling for increased safety measures to &#x27;secure&#x27; the bridge had gained thousands of signatures. Concerns were raised over how the change will affect those who commute on foot or by bike. On 6 May 2021, the bridge was reopened to pedestrians and cyclists between the hours of 0500 and 2100; only users registered in advance could use the bridge outside of those hours. More CCTV and notices were erected and more staff assigned to patrol the crossing.

==Finances==
The bridge had a toll charge of £1.50 for cars from 1 April 2012, until for six months it was £3.00 and the only trunk road British toll bridge to charge motorcycles (£1.20). In 2004 many motorcyclists held a slow-pay protest, taking off gloves and helmets and paying the toll in large denomination bank notes. Police reported that the protest caused a queue long.

In 1996, Parliament passed the Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996 to reorganise the board&#x27;s liabilities to ensure the bridge could be safely maintained. Much of the interest on the debt was suspended and deferred in a refinancing which saw no write off – the balance was to be paid using tolls.

In 2006, Shona McIsaac, Labour MP for Cleethorpes, tabled a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, the Humber Bridge Bill. The bill would have made amendments to the Humber Bridge Act 1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2. c. xlvi) &quot;requiring the Secretary of State to give directions to members of the Humber Bridge Board regarding healthcare and to review the possibility of facilitating journeys across the Humber Bridge in relation to healthcare&quot;. The aim was to allow patients travelling between the banks for medical treatment to cross without paying the toll and to allow the Secretary of State for Transport to appoint two members of the board to represent the interests of the NHS. Even though the Bill received cross-party support (it was co-sponsored by Shadow Home Secretary David Davis and supported by all other MPs representing North Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire) it ran out of time later that year.

A protest at the bridge on 1 September 2007 was supported by the local Cancer Patients Involvement Group, the Road Haulage Association, Diana Wallis (MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber) and local business and council representatives. The government responded to the petition on 14 January 2008, stating that &quot;Concessions or exemptions from tolls on the Humber Bridge are a matter for the Humber Bridge Board&quot;.

In October 2008, a joint campaign was launched by the &quot;Scunthorpe Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Grimsby Telegraph&quot; to abolish the toll. The papers&#x27; campaign, A Toll Too Far, was launched after a mooted increase in the toll, receiving much support from councillors and MPs serving Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. The campaign was to stave off a potential increase, secure a reduction to £1.00 and ultimately to be abolished. Thousands of readers backed the campaign with a paper and an online petition.

A public inquiry into the tolls was held in March 2009 by independent inspector Neil Taylor. In July 2009, the Department for Transport announced that it had decided not to allow the proposed increase. Transport Minister Sadiq Khan said he did not believe it was right for the tolls to be raised in the current economic climate. In October 2009, the government approved a £6 million grant for maintenance costs, which meant that there would be no toll increase before 2011 at the earliest, by which time tolls would have been frozen for five years.

The board applied again to the Department of Transport in September 2010, to raise the tolls from April 2011 but the government ordered a public inquiry into the application. A three-day public inquiry was held in Hull in early March 2011. Following the recommendation by the planning inspector, the government gave approval, on 14 June 2011, for the increase. The toll was raised on 1 October 2011, at which point it became the most expensive in the United Kingdom. The Severn Bridge/Second Severn Crossing charged £5.70 for Wales-bound traffic.

In the 2011 Autumn Statement on 29 November, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced that the government had agreed to reduce the debt on the bridge by £150 million, which would allow the toll for cars to be halved to £1.50. Following the government accepting the agreement, between the four local councils, to meet a portion of the debt if revenues proved insufficient, the Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, confirmed the reduction on 29 February 2012, with effect from April.

<text>Bal-Sagoth () are a symphonic black metal band from Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, formed in 1993.

Originally formed as an epic symphonic black metal band with strong death metal elements, vocalist/lyricist Byron Roberts took the name &#x27;Bal-Sagoth&#x27; from the Robert E. Howard short story &quot;The Gods of Bal-Sagoth&quot;. Their first demo was recorded in 1993, and Bal-Sagoth have since released three albums on Cacophonous Records, and three with Nuclear Blast.

==History==

===Early days (1989–1993)===
Bal-Sagoth was conceived in 1989 by Byron Roberts, in an attempt to form what he called &quot;a sublimely symphonic black/death metal band swathed in a concept of dark fantasy and science fiction, inspired by the celebrated style of the grand pulp horror and fantasy literature of the 1930s&quot;. Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Edgar Rice Burroughs, J.R.R Tolkien and Jack Kirby, Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe, with tales told through epic lyrics and music. After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project, Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993, who were also looking to form a serious band. This formed what would become the writing core of the outfit. After several months of rehearsing, and following a line up reshuffle which saw the departure of lead guitarist Alistair MacLatchy, the band recorded their first demo in late 1993. The band roster at this point consisted of Byron Roberts on vocals, Chris Maudling on guitar, Jonny Maudling on drums, Jason Porter on bass and Vincent Crabtree on keyboards. The demo attracted the attention of Cacophonous Records, who signed the band to a three-album deal.

===First Trilogy (1994–1999)===

The band entered Academy Music Studio in June 1994 and recorded their debut album, &quot;A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria&quot;, in just two weeks. Due to label problems, the album was shelved for nearly a year, finally seeing the light of day in 1995. The album showcased more traditional black metal/death metal ideas versus the more epic and sprawling arrangements the group would utilize in later works. The vocal style of Byron Roberts is also different from later efforts, using more traditional death metal and black metal grunts, as well as the spoken narrative passages which would become more prevalent on subsequent albums.

In 1996, Bal-Sagoth released &quot;Starfire Burning Upon the Ice-Veiled Throne of Ultima Thule&quot;, again recorded at Academy Music Studio in England. The album marked a key shift in the band&#x27;s sound, now focusing more on the composition and arrangement skills of drummer (and studio keyboard player) Jonny Maudling, as well as the &quot;storytelling&quot; aspect of Byron Roberts&#x27;s spoken-word vocals. Through keyboards, the band incorporated a virtual symphony orchestra as an equal fifth instrument, along with guitar, bass, drums and vocals. This new sound would be expanded and explored on all four of the band&#x27;s later efforts.

Joined by touring keyboardist Leon Forrest and bassist Alistair MacLatchy, who had in fact been an original member of the band in its very earliest incarnation, Bal-Sagoth teamed up with Dark Funeral and Ancient in March 1997 for the &quot;Starfire Engulfs Europe Tour&quot; (AKA the &quot;Satanic War Tour II&quot;), a 23-date trek through Europe, followed by the second leg in October 1997 with the black metal band Emperor and thrash metal outfit Nocturnal Breed.

Bal-Sagoth spent much of 1997 writing and recording what would become the album &quot;Battle Magic&quot;. Again recorded at Academy Music Studio in England, this time the band were afforded nearly a full month to record the album. Released in March 1998, &quot;Battle Magic&quot; caught the attention of Nuclear Blast records, who subsequently signed Bal-Sagoth to a three-album deal with worldwide distribution (a first for the band).

Rather than tour in support of &quot;Battle Magic&quot;, the band opted to immediately focus on the writing and recording of their Nuclear Blast debut. Frustrated with fill-in tour keyboard players, Jonny Maudling decided to focus full-time on composition and live keyboards in 1999, handing drum duties over to Dave Mackintosh (later of DragonForce).

===Second Trilogy (1999–2006)===

In 1999, Bal-Sagoth released their first album with Nuclear Blast, &quot;The Power Cosmic&quot;. Focusing on an intergalactic tale of war, cosmic empires, and celestial gods, the album pushed the band to new heights both artistically, and in popularity. After the release of &quot;The Power Cosmic&quot;, the band again disappeared, playing no shows until the release of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis Ascendant&quot;.

The band resurfaced as a live act in 2001, embarking on &quot;The Fifth Cataclysm Devours Europe: Phase 1&quot; tour (AKA: No Mercy festival tour) with Mortician, Sinister, Vader, Amon Amarth, Marduk, God Dethroned, ...and Oceans, and Mystic Circle. Shortly after this, they embarked upon another European tour with Marduk. Later in 2002, the band played the Bloodstock Open Air indoor festival, which was followed by a short tour with Return to the Sabbat in the United Kingdom. In 2004, Dave Mackintosh left the band and joined DragonForce. He was replaced by Dan Mullins (who left the band in 2006 and later became drummer of My Dying Bride), who made his debut with Bal-Sagoth at Wacken Open Air 2004.

In March 2006, Bal-Sagoth released their long-awaited sixth album, &quot;The Chthonic Chronicles&quot; on Nuclear Blast records. The music was recorded entirely at Jonny Maudling&#x27;s Waylands Forge Studio, while the vocals of Byron Roberts were recorded once again at the famed Academy Music Studio. Shortly after its release the band recruited a new drummer, Paul Jackson. The album was the band&#x27;s first in five years, and is rumoured to be their last, although the band have stated that they have no concrete intentions of either recording another album or splitting up, and that various members of the band may soon be announcing side projects.

===Recent activity (2006–present)===
In the summer of 2006, Bal-Sagoth played at the Bloodstock Open Air festival, and in January 2007 they made their first trip to the US to headline the &quot;Heathen Crusade II&quot; festival in St. Paul, Minnesota. In January 2008, they journeyed to Finland to headline shows in Helsinki and Turku, supported by Finnish band Battlelore, and in November 2008 they played the Screamfest festival in Oslo, Norway. In May 2009, the band played two shows in Lisbon and Porto, Portugal. In January 2010, Mark Greenwell left the band to be replaced by previous bassist Alistair MacLatchy, and in March 2010, Bal-Sagoth returned to Finland to play a show in Helsinki with fellow English band Skyclad. On 14 August 2010, Bal-Sagoth performed at the Brutal Assault festival in the Czech Republic. On 5 March 2011, the band played a headlining show in Bern, Switzerland.

<text>I = (PAT) is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the impact of human activity on the environment.

:I=P×A×T

The expression equates human impact on the environment to a function of three factors: population (P), affluence (A) and technology (T). It is similar in form to the Kaya identity, which applies specifically to emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.

The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions.

==History==
The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between Barry Commoner, Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren. Commoner argued that environmental impacts in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following World War II and focused on present-day deteriorating environmental conditions in the United States. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth, focusing on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time.

The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment, but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by Paul Ehrlich, George Wald, Denis Hayes, Lester Brown, René Dubos, and Sidney Ripley that did not come to pass. Neal Koblitz classified equations of this type as &quot;mathematical propaganda&quot; and criticized Ehrlich&#x27;s use of them in the media (e.g. on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;) to sway the general public.

==The dependent variable: Impact==
The variable &quot;I&quot; in the &quot;I=PAT&quot; equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can endure a certain level of impact. The maximum endurable impact is called the carrying capacity. As long as &quot;I&quot; is less than the carrying capacity the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up &quot;I&quot; can be perpetually endured. If &quot;I&quot; exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in overshoot, which may only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to endure impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity.

Impact may be measured using ecological footprint analysis in units of global hectares (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of Earth&#x27;s biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita.

Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers; therefore affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency factor.

==The three factors==
===Population===


In the I=PAT equation, the variable P represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused Thomas Malthus, Paul Ehrlich and many others to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see Malthusian growth model).

The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.7 billion today (2019) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100.
These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of demographic transition all over the world. Although the UN projects that human population may stabilize at around 11.2 billion in 2100, the I=PAT equation will continue to be relevant for the increasing human impact on the environment in the short to mid-term future.

====Environmental impacts of population====
Increased population increases humans&#x27; environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:

* Increased land use - Results in habitat loss for other species
* Increased resource use - Results in changes in land cover
* Increased pollution - Can cause sickness and damages ecosystems
*Increased climate change
*Increased biodiversity loss

===Affluence===


The variable A in the I=PAT equation stands for affluence. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through GDP per capita or GNI per capita. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases. GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the I=PAT equation.

====Environmental impacts of affluence====
Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts:

* 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires;
* 682 lbs. of pollution at a mine for the lead battery;
* 2178 lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22 lbs. of copper contained in the car.

The more cars per capita, the greater the impact.
Ecological impacts of each product are far-reaching; increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources.

===Technology===
The T variable in the I=PAT equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used. Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier. Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for T is often tailored for the situation to which I=PAT is being applied. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for T might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.

====Environmental impacts of technology====
Increases in efficiency from technologies can reduce specific environmental impacts, but due to increasing prosperity these technologies yield for the people and businesses that adopt them, technologies actually end up generating greater overall growth into the resources that sustain us.

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the I=PAT formula:
* Too simplistic for complex problem
* Interdependencies between variables
* General sweeping assumptions of variables&#x27; effect toward environmental impact
* Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact
* Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one&#x27;s view of the situation.

===Interdependencies===
The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least seven interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T). For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the rebound effect or Jevons paradox. As was shown by Alcott, despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. 

Each factor in the I=PAT equation can either increase or decrease the level of environmental impact, and their interactions are non-linear and dynamic. Although environmental impacts are driven by human activities in specific regions, these impacts often manifest elsewhere due to the globalized nature of environmental systems and human. For instance, economic activity in one area can lead to resource extraction in another or cause pollution that spreads to different locations.

===Neglect of beneficial human impacts===
There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any conservation or restoration efforts that societies have made.

===Neglect of political and social contexts===
Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision-making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact. Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor. I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low-impact practices. However, it has been argued that the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (i.e., resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small-scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this. In fact, the generally low impact of small-scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low-level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their &quot;inability&quot; to significantly affect their environment. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren&#x27;s 1972 dialogue with Commoner in &quot;The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren&#x27;s 1993 paper, &quot;A Brief History of &quot;IPAT&quot;&quot;.

===Policy implications===
As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., population control and material sufficiency and degrowth movements have been controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or Pigouvian taxation of resource use or pollution.

== World3 model and IPAT Equation ==
The IPAT equation serves as the cornerstone for analyzing the causes of environmental sustainability. It underpins the entire World3 simulation model, which is the most influential sustainability model ever created, and is essentially an extended application of the IPAT equation.

<text>Conisbrough Castle is a medieval fortification in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, England. The castle was initially built in the 11th century by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Hamelin Plantagenet, the illegitimate, &quot;parvenu&quot; brother of Henry II, acquired the property by marriage in the late 12th century. Hamelin and his son William rebuilt the castle in stone, including its prominent -high keep. The castle remained in the family line into the 14th century, despite being seized several times by the Crown. The fortification was then given to Edmund of Langley, passing back into royal ownership in 1461.

Conisbrough Castle fell into ruin, its outer wall badly affected by subsidence, and was given to the Carey family in the 16th century. Its derelict state prevented it from involvement in the English Civil War of the 17th century and the remains were bought by the Duke of Leeds in 1737. Sir Walter Scott used the location for his 1819 novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and by the end of the 19th century the ruins had become a tourist attraction. 

The state took over the management of the property in 1950, but by the 1980s the visitor facilities were felt to be unsuitable, leading to a three-way partnership being created between the local council, the state agency English Heritage and a local charitable trust to develop the castle. The keep was re-roofed and re-floored in the 1990s with the help of European Union funding. English Heritage took over control of the castle in 2008 and continues to operate the property as a tourist attraction.

The castle is made up of an inner and an outer bailey, the former surrounded by a stone curtain wall defended by six mural or fortified towers and the castle keep. The inner bailey would have included a hall, solar, chapel and other service buildings of which only the foundations survive. The design of Conisbrough&#x27;s keep is unique in England, and the historians Oliver Creighton and Stephen Johnson consider it an &quot;architectural gem&quot; and &quot;one of the finest examples of late Norman defensive architecture&quot;. The keep comprises a circular central tower with six massive buttresses; its four floors would have included a main chamber and a private chamber for the lord above it. Although militarily weak, the design would have been a powerful symbol of Hamelin Plantagenet&#x27;s new social status as a major lord.

==History==

===11th – 12th centuries===

Conisbrough Castle was founded by William de Warenne, the first Earl of Surrey, who had taken part in the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and was rewarded by his father-in-law, William the Conqueror, with extensive estates in Yorkshire, Norfolk and Sussex. As part of these, Lord de Warenne was given the manor of Conisbrough, which had previously been owned by the late Saxon king Harold II. The manor took its name from the Old English name for the settlement, &quot;Cyningesburh&quot;, meaning &quot;the king&#x27;s fortress&quot;, and formed a large estate comprising 28 townships, centred on a fortified burh at Conisbrough itself.

William built his castle on a rocky Magnesian Limestone spur surrounded by steep banks, and the fortification included a motte, an inner bailey protected by an earth bank and palisades, an outer bailey, and possibly a timber keep. The castle was located around above the river and would have dominated this part of the Don Valley. It was positioned directly opposite the village, which probably contained the old Anglo-Saxon burh.

The castle was held by William&#x27;s son, also called William, from 1088 to 1138, and then by his son, another William, until his death in 1147. Conisbrough and the earldom then passed through Isabel, William&#x27;s daughter, to her first husband, William de Blois, and then on to her second husband, Hamelin Plantagenet, whom she married in 1163. Hamelin was the illegitimate half-brother of King Henry II, who had arranged the marriage, and the union brought him great wealth. Hamelin extensively rebuilt the castle around 1180 to 1190, including constructing the stone keep; given his &quot;parvenu&quot; status, he probably hoped to reinforce perceptions of his new elevated rank. King John visited the castle in 1201.

===13th – 15th centuries===

The castle continued in the ownership of Hamelin Plantagenet&#x27;s family, passing to his son William de Warenne in 1202. William was probably responsible for the construction of new stone curtain walls around the inner bailey, destroying the former earthwork defences in the process. The inner bailey was levelled and William built a hall and service buildings inside the castle, again in stone. Conisbrough was inherited by William&#x27;s young son John de Warenne in 1239, but he was still a minor and the castle was initially managed by his mother, Maud.

Under John, Conisbrough&#x27;s constables carried out a range of what the historian Stephen Johnson terms &quot;colourful if rather unlawful dealings&quot;; one was ultimately charged with having conducted &quot;devilish and innumerable oppressions&quot;. Further work was carried out in the castle during John&#x27;s ownership, including modernising the castle hall and solar.

The castle passed to John&#x27;s grandson, also called John, who, in 1304, married Joan de Barr. The marriage broke down but John&#x27;s attempts to gain a divorce in 1316 failed in the law courts. John blamed Thomas, the Earl of Lancaster, for this and in response he kidnapped Thomas&#x27; wife; Thomas then retaliated by seizing Conisbrough Castle. Edward II intervened in the dispute and confirmed Thomas as the new owner of the castle. In 1322, however, Thomas rebelled against the King and was executed, resulting in Edward taking control of Conisbrough himself. The King visited the castle in 1322, and spent 40 marks on repairing both Conisbrough and the neighbouring castle of Pontefract. Edward was overthrown by his wife Isabella in 1326 and the castle was returned to John. John had hoped to pass the property to his mistress and two illegitimate sons, but he outlived them and on his death in 1347 it reverted to the control of the Crown.

Edward III gave the castle to his own son, Edmund of Langley, the Duke of York, who controlled it until 1402. Edmund&#x27;s eldest son, Edward, owned it until 1415, when it passed to Maud Clifford, the widow of Edmund&#x27;s younger son Richard, who lived there until 1446. Richard of York then inherited the castle, and on his death in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses it passed to his son Edward, who seized the throne in 1461, bringing Conisbrough back into Crown ownership once again.

===16th – 19th centuries===

By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle was in a poor state of repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge and parts of the walls had collapsed in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.

Henry VIII gave the ruins to the Carey family, who retained it until it passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle was not involved in the events of the English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, probably because the collapse of the outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.

In 1811 the novelist Sir Walter Scott passed by the castle and later used it as the location for his novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, published in 1819. Scott only had a partial view of the property from the road and the events portrayed in the novel, set at the end of the 12th century, are fictitious; Scott believed the castle to have been Saxon in origin, a view shared by many 19th-century commentators. Although the writer John Wainwright was still able to praise the &quot;picturesque view&quot; around the castle in 1826, the antiquarian Ecroyd Smith commented with concern in 1887 on the changing character of the location, in particular the factories that were growing up around the new railway line and the &quot;murky atmosphere&quot; the industrial works created.

In 1859 Francis D&#x27;Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep remained in good condition, but by 1884 it was apparent that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark&#x27;s colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely climbed to the top of the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.

===20th – 21st centuries===

Conisbrough Castle was bought by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the guardianship of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the freehold ownership of the land. Two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969, exposing the foundations of the buildings in the inner bailey, and then from 1973 to 1977, examining options for future visitor facilities. By 1984, when the government agency English Heritage took over the management of the property, the condition of the visitor services was unsatisfactory and the industrial character of the surrounding area was discouraging tourists.

In response, English Heritage and Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council formed a three-way agreement in 1988 with the Ivanhoe Trust, a local charity designed to generate new employment in the region. Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage would maintain the historic fabric of the castle, while the council would construct a new visitors&#x27; centre. A new, controversial visitor&#x27;s centre was built in the style of a collection of jousting tents, while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, in an attempt to limit the erosion of the castle stonework.

Visitor numbers following the investments fell far short of expectations, however, and by 2006 had settled at around 30,000 each year, only slightly above the level in the early 1980s. The external facilities did not age well and funding shortages led to the new audio-visual effects in the keep being turned off to save money. Discussions between the three partners about the future of the castle took place, but relations broke down and English Heritage resumed the direct management of the castle in 2008.

The castle was closed for a £1.1 million programme of renovations in 2013, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, as part of which a new visitors&#x27; centre and visitor facilities were constructed. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==Architecture==

===Inner and outer baileys===

Conisbrough Castle has an outer and an inner bailey, approximately and across respectively. The castle was entered through the outer bailey, a rectangular enclosure protected by earthworks, which would have contained the castle&#x27;s barns, stables, and other service facilities. A drawbridge on the northern side of the outer bailey, now replaced by an earth causeway, linked it with the inner bailey.

The oval inner bailey was formed by scarping and counter-scarping the natural contours of the hill, producing a bank, now largely destroyed, and a protective ditch. The early 13th-century curtain wall is mostly of roughly dressed, coursed stone, up to thick and high, with two sections repaired with ashlar facings. The wall was defended by six mural towers along its southern and western sides, of which three still survive reasonably intact, and strengthened with pilaster buttresses along the northern edge. The bases of the walls and the towers were splayed, spreading their weight out more broadly, but their footings are only deep in places. A barbican protected the link from the drawbridge to the gatehouse of the inner bailey, complete with an additional corner turret. The remains of the collapse of the curtain wall are still visible in the ditch.

Various buildings were constructed along the inside of the inner bailey wall of similar rough stonework to the curtain wall, but only their foundations remain today. In the south-west corner was the solar block, containing the solar and various chambers. Along the north side was the hall, pushed into an awkward corner of the curtain wall, in size and originally probably built two storeys high. Initially constructed with a central hearth, a fireplace was added into the outer wall in the later 13th century. Alongside the hall were a kitchen and pantry, the former with a cellar. On the south-east side of the inner bailey was the castle chapel, across.

===Keep===
Conisbrough&#x27;s keep was positioned on the north-east side of the inner bailey. It is an important medieval survival: the historian, Sidney Toy, considered it to be &quot;one of the finest keeps in England&quot;, the archaeologist Oliver Creighton describes it as an &quot;architectural gem&quot; and Stephen Johnson as &quot;one of the finest examples of late Norman defensive architecture&quot;.
The keep comprises a central circular tower, in diameter, with six, large solid buttresses projecting outwards to form an hexagonal design, unique in England. It was made from magnesian limestone and tall with walls up to thick in places. It has four floors: a ground floor that serves as a basement and a vaulted stone support for the chamber above; the first floor, through which the keep was accessed; two upper floors and a roof walk, which was probably covered by a pentice and defended by battlements.

The current concrete stairs to the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors. The basement contained a well, which could also be drawn from the 1st floor through a hole in the stone floor.

The keep was designed as a private tower for Hamelin Plantagenet, rather than a grander residence. As a result, it was not designed to accommodate several different households and its layout was simpler than that seen at the contemporary keep of Orford Castle, for example. The 2nd and the 3rd floor would have served as the main chamber and the lord&#x27;s private chamber, forming a vertical sequence of rooms, with a vaulted, hexagonal chapel leading off the private chamber, cut into one of the buttresses.

Most of the castle would have been very dark due to the lack of natural light. The main chamber, however, had a large window, by , with deep recesses to allow for the thickness of the walls; two carved seats sat alongside the window. A similar window was placed above it in the private chamber. The keep had relatively advanced fireplaces and flues for this period, the fireplace in the main chamber being exceptionally large and decorated with stone columns and carved capitals.

Conisbrough Castle was probably similar to two other castles owned by the Warren earls. Hamelin Plantagenet was also responsible for the development of Mortemer Castle in France, where a similar keep was built on top of a motte, and Conisbrough might also have had resemblances to Sandal Castle in the north of England, also owned by the earls. The design of the keep was poor from a military perspective. The central circular tower provided defensive advantages but the buttresses introduced 12 vulnerable corners into the stonework, and the keep itself had no arrow slots to permit the defenders to fire on any attackers. Rather than being designed primarily for military defence, it was constructed to symbolise and reinforce Hamelin&#x27;s lordship and new social status.

<text>Blowing a raspberry, razzing or making a [[Bronx]] cheer, is to make a noise similar to flatulence that may signify derision, real or feigned. It is made by placing the tongue between the lips and blowing.

A raspberry (when used with the tongue) is not used in any human language as a building block of words, apart from jocular exceptions such as the name of the comic-book character Joe Btfsplk. However, the vaguely similar bilabial trill (essentially blowing a raspberry with one&#x27;s lips) is a regular consonant sound in a few dozen languages scattered around the world. 

Spike Jones and His City Slickers used a &quot;birdaphone&quot; to create this sound on their recording of &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;, repeatedly lambasting Adolf Hitler with: &quot;We&#x27;ll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil! (Bronx cheer) Right in Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face!&quot;

In the terminology of phonetics, the raspberry has been described as a voiceless linguolabial trill, transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet, and as a buccal interdental trill, transcribed in the Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet.

==Name==
The nomenclature varies by country. In most anglophone countries, it is known as a &quot;raspberry&quot;, which is attested from at least 1890, and which in the United States had been shortened to &quot;&quot; by 1919. The term originates in rhyming slang, where &quot;raspberry tart&quot; means &quot;&quot;. In the United States it has also been called a &quot;Bronx cheer&quot; since at least the early 1920s.

<text>The principality of Liechtenstein is divided into eleven municipalities (&#x27;, [[grammatical number|singular]]&#x27;), most consisting of only a single town. Five of the &quot; fall within the electoral district of (lower country), while the other six are within the (upper country).

==Municipalities==
==Exclaves and enclaves==

The municipalities of Liechtenstein, the &quot;, exhibit complex shapes, despite their small size.

Seven of the &quot;&quot; have one or more exclaves, in addition to the main territory:

* Gamprin: 1 exclave
* Eschen: 1 exclave
* Planken: 4 exclaves, of which 1 is a true enclave
* Schaan: 4 exclaves, of which 1 is a true enclave
* Vaduz: 6 exclaves, of which 2 are true enclaves
* Triesenberg: 1 exclave
* Balzers: 2 exclaves

==Data codes==
In ISO 3166-2, the codes of the municipalities start with LI-, followed by two digits (01–11, assigned in alphabetical order).

In FIPS 10-4 (standard withdrawn in 2008), the codes of the municipalities started with LS-, followed by the same two digits as the ISO codes.

As a member of the EFTA, Liechtenstein is included in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). The three NUTS levels all correspond to the country itself (NUTS-1: LI0; NUTS-2: LI00; NUTS-3: LI000). Below the NUTS levels, there are two LAU levels (LAU-1: electoral districts; LAU-2: municipalities).

<doc id="153773" wikidata="Q1068162" url="?curid=153773" title="Stradivarius">
<text>A Stradivarius is one of the string instruments, such as violins, violas, cellos, and guitars, crafted by members of the Stradivari family, particularly Antonio Stradivari (Latin: Antonius Stradivarius), in Cremona, Italy, during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. These instruments are known for their craftsmanship, tonal quality, and lasting legacy, and are considered some of the finest ever made. Stradivari&#x27;s violins, in particular, are coveted by musicians and collectors, with many selling for millions of dollars.

Antonio Stradivari made over 1,100 instruments, with approximately 650 surviving today. The exact methods Stradivari used to produce the instruments&#x27; famed sound remain unknown, with theories ranging from the unique quality of the wood used during the Little Ice Age to the varnishes and chemical treatments applied. Despite extensive scientific research, including modern acoustic analysis and CT scans, no one has been able to conclusively replicate or fully explain the tonal qualities of Stradivarius instruments.

The reputation of Stradivarius instruments for having unmatched sound quality has been debated. Blind experiments conducted from the 19th century to the present have often found no significant difference between Stradivari violins and high-quality modern violins. These findings have led some to question the objectivity of the instruments&#x27; legendary status.

Stradivarius instruments are still played by leading musicians and housed in museums worldwide, such as the &quot;Museo del Violino&quot; in Cremona, which preserves several Stradivarius instruments. Initiatives like the &quot;Stradivarius Sound Bank&quot; have aimed to digitally capture and preserve the sounds of these instruments for future generations. Stradivarius instruments have become known in popular culture, appearing in fiction and representing elite musical artistry.

==Construction==
Stradivari made his instruments using an inner form, unlike the French copyists, such as Vuillaume, who employed an outer form. It is clear from the number of forms throughout his career that he experimented with some of the dimensions of his instruments. The woods used included spruce for the top, willow for the internal blocks and linings, and maple for the back, ribs, and neck. Stradivari&#x27;s sound is described as &quot;direct and precise&quot;, responding to the slightest touch with refined direction and elegance.

There has been conjecture that the wood used may have been treated with several types of minerals, both before and after construction of a violin. Scientists at National Taiwan University have detected trace amounts of aluminum, copper, and calcium in wood from Stradivari violins. The traces may have come from chemical preservatives applied by loggers to the wood they sold. As well, the violin makers applied varnishes to their instruments. Potassium borate (borax) may have been used to protect against woodworm. Sodium and potassium silicate may have been used to prevent mildew, rotting and insect damage. Simone Fernando Sacconi suggested that Vernice bianca, an egg tempera varnish composed of gum arabic, honey, and egg white, may have been used.

French chemist Jean-Philippe Echard and his co-workers have studied varnishes on Stradivarius violins. He reported in 2010 that even when varnish is no longer visible to the human eye on the surface of older violins, it can be detected within the top layers of cells. A lower layer of varnish is found within the topmost wood cells while an upper rests upon the wood. Echard&#x27;s findings suggest that Stradivari used a mixture of common Cremonese resin, oil, and pigment as a varnish, rather than making his own. Echard did not find traces of specialized ingredients such as protein materials, gums, or fossil amber.

A comparative study published in PLOS One in 2008 found no significant differences in median densities between modern and classical violins, or between classical violins from different origins; instead the survey of several modern and classical examples of violins highlighted a notable distinction when comparing density differentials. These results suggest that differences in density differentials in the material may have played a significant role in the sound production of classical violins. A later survey, focused on comparing median densities in both classical and modern violin examples, questioned the role available materials may have played in sound production differences, though it made no comment on variations in density differentials. The content of copper and aluminium is higher than current instruments.

==Market value==

A Stradivarius made in the 1680s, or during Stradivari&#x27;s &quot;Long Pattern&quot; period from 1690 to 1700, could be worth hundreds of thousands to several million U.S. dollars at today&#x27;s prices. The 1697 &quot;Molitor&quot; Stradivarius, once rumored to have belonged to Napoleon (it actually belonged to a general in his army, Marshal Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor, 1er Comte Molitor), sold in 2010 at Tarisio Auctions to violinist Anne Akiko Meyers for $3,600,000, at the time a world record.

Depending on condition, instruments made during Stradivari&#x27;s &quot;golden period&quot; from 1700 to about 1725 can be worth millions of dollars. In 2011, his &quot;Lady Blunt&quot; violin from 1721, which is in pristine condition, was sold in London for $15.9 million (it is named after Lord Byron&#x27;s granddaughter Lady Anne Blunt, who owned it for 30 years). It was sold by the Nippon Music Foundation in aid of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami appeal. In Spring 2014 the &quot;Macdonald&quot; viola was put up for auction through the musical instrument auction house Ingles &amp; Hayday in conjunction with Sotheby&#x27;s via silent auction with a minimum bid of $45 million. The auction failed to reach its minimum bid by 25 June 2014, and the viola was not sold.

&quot;Vice&quot; magazine reported in May 2013 that &quot;in recent years, Stradivarius investment funds have started to appear, pushing already astronomical prices even higher&quot;.

Stradivarius instruments are at risk of theft. Stolen instruments are often recovered, even after being missing for many years. They are difficult to sell illicitly, as dealers will typically call the police if approached by a seller with a Stradivarius known to have been stolen. The &quot;General Kyd Stradivarius&quot; was stolen in 2004. It was returned three weeks later by a woman who found it and handed it over to the police. The &quot;Sinsheimer/Iselin&quot; was stolen in Hanover, Germany in 2008 and recovered in 2009. The &quot;Lipinski Stradivarius&quot; was stolen in an armed robbery on 27 January 2014 and subsequently recovered. The &quot;Ames Stradivarius&quot; was stolen in 1981 and recovered in 2015.

A number of stolen instruments remain missing, such as the &quot;Karpilowsky&quot;, stolen in 1953; the &quot;Davidoff-Morini&quot;, stolen in 1995; and the &quot;Le Maurien&quot;, stolen in 2002.

==Comparisons in sound quality==
The Stradivarius instruments are famous for the quality of sound they produce. However, the many blind experiments from 1817 to as recent as 2014 have never found any difference in sound between Stradivari&#x27;s violins and high-quality violins in comparable style of other makers and periods, nor has acoustic analysis. In a particularly famous test on a BBC Radio 3 programme in 1977, the violinists Isaac Stern and Pinchas Zukerman and the violin expert and dealer Charles Beare tried to distinguish between the &quot;Chaconne&quot; Stradivarius, a 1739 Guarneri del Gesú, an 1846 Vuillaume, and a 1976 British violin played behind a screen by a professional soloist. The two violinists were allowed to play all the instruments first. None of the listeners identified more than two of the four instruments. Two of the listeners identified the 20th-century violin as the Stradivarius. Violinists and others have criticized these tests on various grounds such as that they are not double-blind (in most cases), the judges are often not experts, and the sounds of violins are hard to evaluate objectively and reproducibly.

In a test in 2009, the British violinist Matthew Trusler played his 1711 Stradivarius, said to be worth two million U.S. dollars, and four modern violins made by the Swiss violin-maker . One of Rhonheimer&#x27;s violins, made with wood that the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology researcher Francis Schwarze had treated with fungi, received 90 of the 180 votes for the best tone, while the Stradivarius came second with 39 votes. The majority (113) of the listeners misidentified the winning violin as the Stradivarius. Analysis of the treated wood revealed a reduction in density, accompanied by relatively little change in the speed of sound. According to this analysis, treatment improves the sound radiation ratio to the level of cold-climate wood considered to have superior resonance.

In a double-blind test in 2012 published in the study &quot;Player preferences among new and old violins&quot;, expert players could not distinguish old from new instruments by playing them for a short time in a small room. In an additional test, performed in a concert hall, one of the Stradivarius violins placed first, but one of the participants stated that &quot;the audience in the concert hall were essentially equivocal on which instruments were better in each of the pair-wise instrument comparisons&quot; and &quot;I could tell slight differences in the instruments... but overall they were all great. None of them sounded substantially weaker than the others.&quot; Modern violins were rated as having better sound-carrying qualities and were preferred again in a study in 2017.

While many world-class soloists play violins by Antonio Stradivari, there are notable exceptions. For example, Christian Tetzlaff formerly played &quot;a quite famous Strad&quot;, but switched to a violin made in 2002 by Stefan-Peter Greiner. He states that the listener cannot tell that his instrument is modern, and he regards it as excellent for Bach and better than a Stradivarius for &quot;the big Romantic and 20th-century concertos.&quot;

==Theories and reproduction attempts==
Some maintain that the very best Stradivari have unique superiorities. Various attempts at explaining these supposed qualities have been undertaken, most results being unsuccessful or inconclusive. Over the centuries, numerous theories have been presented – and debunked – including an assertion that the wood was salvaged from old cathedrals.

A more modern theory attributes tree growth during a time of global low temperatures during the Little Ice Age associated with unusually low solar activity of the Maunder Minimum, circa 1645 to 1750, during which cooler temperatures throughout Europe are believed to have caused stunted and slowed tree growth, resulting in unusually dense wood. Further evidence for this &quot;Little Ice Age theory&quot; comes from a simple examination of the dense growth rings in the wood used in Stradivari&#x27;s instruments. Two researchers – University of Tennessee tree-ring scientist Henri Grissino-Mayer and Lloyd Burckle, a Columbia University climatologist – published their conclusions supporting the theory on increased wood density in the journal &quot;Dendrochronologia&quot;.

In 2008, researchers from the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, announced further evidence that wood density caused the claimed high quality of these instruments. After examining the violins with X-rays, the researchers found that these violins all have extremely consistent density, with relatively low variation in the apparent growth patterns of the trees that produced this wood.

Yet another possible explanation is that the maple wood used was sourced from the forests of northern Croatia. This wood is known for its extreme density resulting from the slow growth caused by harsh Croatian winters. Croatian wood was traded by Venetian merchants of the era, and is still used today by local luthiers and craftsfolk for musical instruments.

Some research points to wood preservatives used in that day as contributing to the resonant qualities. Joseph Nagyvary reveals that he has always held the belief that there are a wide range of chemicals that will improve the violin&#x27;s sound. In a 2009 study co-authored with Renald Guillemette and Clifford Spiegelman, Nagyvary obtained shavings from a Stradivarius violin and examined them, and analysis indicated they contained &quot;borax, fluorides, chromium and iron salts.&quot; He also found that the wood had decayed a little, to the extent that the filter plates in the pores between the wood&#x27;s component tracheids had rotted away, perhaps while the wood was stored in or under water in the Venice lagoon before Stradivarius used it.

Steven Sirr, a radiologist, worked with researchers to perform a CT scan of a Stradivari known as the &quot;Betts&quot;. Data regarding the differing densities of woods used were then used to create a reproduction instrument.

==Instruments==
Stradivari made mainly violins but also violas, cellos and some plucked string instruments (five guitars, two mandolins and one harp are known). About 650 original Stradivarius instruments have survived. Thousands of violins have been made in tribute to Stradivari, copying his model and bearing labels that read &quot;Stradivarius&quot;. The presence of a Stradivarius label does not confirm that the instrument is a genuine work of Stradivari.

== Sound preservation ==
The Museo del Violino in Cremona, Italy embarked on a project to preserve the sound of Stradivarius instruments. In January 2019, four musicians recorded scales and arpeggios using two violins, a viola, and a cello, including a famous 1727 violin named &quot;Vesuvio.&quot; These recordings, known as the &quot;Stradivarius Sound Bank,&quot; preserve the sounds. The project involved closing off streets and minimizing noise to ensure a quiet environment during the recordings. The musicians recorded over one million sound files across different techniques to capture the instruments&#x27; tonal characteristics. These recordings are stored as part of a permanent collection at the Museo del Violino. Fausto Cacciatori, curator of the museum, emphasized that while the sounds of these instruments change over time due to natural aging, the project will allow future generations to experience the original sound of these Stradivarius instruments.

<text>The first point of Aries, also known as the cusp of Aries, is the location of the March equinox (the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere, and the autumnal equinox in the southern), used as a reference point in celestial coordinate systems. In diagrams using such coordinate systems, it is often indicated with the symbol ♈︎. Named for the constellation of Aries, it is one of the two points on the celestial sphere at which the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic, the other being the first point of Libra, located exactly 180° from it. Due to precession of the equinoxes since the positions were originally named in antiquity, the position of the Sun when at the March equinox is now in Pisces; when it is at the September equinox, it is in Virgo (as of J2000).

Along its yearly path through the zodiac, the Sun meets the celestial equator as it travels from south to north at the first point of Aries, and from north to south at the first point of Libra. The first point of Aries is considered to be the celestial &quot;prime meridian&quot; from which right ascension is calculated.

==History==
The choice of starting position from which to measure the Sun&#x27;s motion across the celestial sphere is arbitrary. The equinoxes are preferred as an equinox marks the point in time when the Sun has neither northern nor southern declination but is crossing the celestial equator. Of the two possible equinoxes the ancient Greeks chose the March equinox as the starting point. This coincided with the festival of Hilaria, a time of optimism and beginnings where farmers began to sow or observed the first growth and blossoming of trees and summer crops. The naming of Aries is late in the Babylonian zodiac where the equinox was in its earliest tradition marked as in the early Middle Bronze Age by actual coincidence with the Pleiades. The time also corresponds to the time of castration of male calves, mules and donkeys, &quot;Sanguia&quot; on the vernal equinox and marked the start of spring proper.

The first point of Aries is so called because, when Hipparchus defined it in 130 BCE, it was located in the western extreme of the constellation of Aries, near its border with Pisces and the star γ Arietis. Due to the Sun&#x27;s eastward movement across the sky throughout the year, this western end of Aries was the point at which the Sun entered the constellation, hence the name &quot;first point&quot; of Aries.

==Definition==
Due to Earth&#x27;s axial precession, this point gradually moves westwards at a rate of about one degree every 72 years. This means that, since the time of Hipparchus, it has shifted across the sky by about 30°, and is currently located within Pisces, near its border with Aquarius. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April until mid-May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of the northern spring.

The first point of Aries is important to the fields of astronomy, nautical navigation and astrology. Navigational ephemeris tables record the geographic position of the first point of Aries as the reference for position of navigational stars. Due to the slow precession of the equinoxes, the zenith view (above a location) of constellations at a time of year from a given location have slowly moved west (by using solar epochs the drift is known). The tropical Zodiac is similarly affected and no longer corresponds with the constellations (the Cusp of Libra today is located within Virgo). In sidereal astrology, by contrast, the first point of Aries remains aligned with the Aries constellation.

<doc id="153777" wikidata="Q977228" url="?curid=153777" title="Yakov Smirnoff">
<text>Yakov Naumovich Pokhis (; born 24 January 1951), better known as Yakov Smirnoff (; ), is a Jewish Soviet-American comedian, actor and writer. He began his career as a stand-up comedian in the Soviet Union, then immigrated to the United States in 1977 in order to pursue an American show business career, not yet knowing any English.

He reached his biggest success in the mid-to-late 1980s, appearing in several films which include &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; with Robin Williams, &quot;The Money Pit&quot; with Tom Hanks, &quot;Heartburn&quot; with Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, and &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; with Richard Pryor. He was a star of the television series &quot;What a Country!&quot; and was a recurring guest star on NBC&#x27;s hit television series &quot;Night Court&quot; playing the part of Yakov Korolenko. His comic persona was of a naive immigrant from the Soviet Union who was perpetually confused and delighted by life in the United States. His humor combined a mockery of life under Communist states and of consumerism in the United States, as well as word play caused by misunderstanding of American phrases and culture, all punctuated by the catchphrase, &quot;And I thought, &#x27;What a country!&#x27;

The Fall of Communism starting in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an end to Smirnoff&#x27;s widespread popularity, although he continued to perform. In 1993, he began performing year round at his own theater in Branson, Missouri. , he occasionally still performs limited dates at his theater in Branson while touring worldwide. Smirnoff earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and a doctorate in psychology and global leadership from Pepperdine University in 2019. He has also taught a course titled &quot;The Business of Laughter&quot; at Missouri State University and at Drury University.

==Early life==
The son of Naum Pokhis and Klara Pokhis, Smirnoff was born in Odesa, Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union (USSR). He was an art teacher in Odesa, as well as a comedian. As a comedian, he entertained occasionally on ships in the Black Sea, where he came into contact with Americans who described life in the United States to him. That was when he first considered leaving the country.

After two years of attempting to leave, he came to the United States with his parents in 1977, arriving in New York City. His family was allowed to come to America because of &quot;an agreement between the USSR and America to exchange wheat for Soviet citizens who wished to defect&quot;. At the time, neither he nor his parents spoke any English. On arrival to the United States, he was almost sent back to the USSR when his interpreter mistranslated his occupation, comedian, as &quot;party organizer&quot;, which immigration authorities thought meant that he was an organizer for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Smirnoff spent a portion of his early days in the United States working as a busboy and bartender at Grossingers Hotel in the Catskill Mountains of New York and living in the employee dormitory.

==Career==
Smirnoff began doing stand-up comedy in the US in the late 1970s. He chose the last name &quot;Smirnoff&quot; after trying to think of a name that Americans would be familiar with; he had learned about Smirnoff vodka in his bartending days.

In the early 1980s, he moved to Los Angeles to further pursue his stand-up comedy career. While there, he was roommates with two other aspiring comedians: Andrew Dice Clay and Thomas F. Wilson. Smirnoff often appeared at renowned L.A. club the Comedy Store.

After achieving some level of fame, Smirnoff got his first break with a small role in the 1984 film &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot;; on the set, he helped star Robin Williams with his Russian dialogue. He subsequently appeared in several other motion pictures, including &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; (1984), &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986). Among his numerous appearances on television, he was featured many times on the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; as &quot;Yakov Korolenko&quot;, and appeared as a comedian and guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.
He had a starring role in the 1986–87 television sitcom &quot;What a Country!&quot; In that show, he played a Russian cab driver studying for the U.S. citizenship test. In the late 1980s, Smirnoff was commissioned by ABC to provide educational bumper segments for Saturday morning cartoons Fun Facts, punctuated with a joke and Smirnoff&#x27;s signature laugh.

In 1987, Smirnoff was invited to a party hosted by &quot;Washington Times&quot; editor-in-chief Arnaud de Borchgrave which featured President Ronald Reagan as the guest of honor. Reagan and Smirnoff immediately hit it off due to Reagan&#x27;s love of jokes about life in the Soviet Union. Reagan enjoyed telling such jokes in speeches, and Smirnoff became one of his sources for new material. An example of a joke Reagan later told that originated from Smirnoff was &quot;In Russia, if you say, &#x27;Take my wife—please&#x27;, you come home and she is gone.&quot; Smirnoff was enlisted by Dana Rohrabacher, who was then a speechwriter for Reagan, to help with material for Reagan&#x27;s speeches, including a speech given in front of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when Reagan visited the Soviet Union during the Moscow Summit in 1988. Rohrabacher later stated that Smirnoff became &quot;one of the inner circle&quot; of speechwriting advisers during Reagan&#x27;s final years in office, due to the quality of Smirnoff&#x27;s suggestions.

In 1988, Smirnoff was the featured entertainer at the annual White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner and he appeared in some commercials for hotel chain Best Western.

Since 1993, he has been performing at his own 2,000 seat, state of the art theater, and over the years has entertained more than five million people in a live setting. His 31st consecutive season was commemorated in Branson, Missouri in 2024. In the late 1990s he retooled his stand-up act to focus on the differences between men and women, and on solving problems within relationships.

In 2002, Smirnoff appeared in episodes of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (&quot;The Bluegrass Is Always Greener&quot;) and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;The Old Man and the Key&quot;).

In 2003, he appeared on Broadway in a one-man show, &quot;As Long As We Both Shall Laugh,&quot; deemed by Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;warmhearted&quot;, &quot;delightful&quot; and &quot;splendidly funny&quot;. Smirnoff was also a featured writer for &quot;AARP Magazine&quot; and gave readers advice in his column, &quot;Happily Ever Laughter&quot;.

After a successful career in television, movies and Broadway, Smirnoff received a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. He has taught classes at Drury University along with Missouri State University on this topic. He also gives seminars and self-help workshops on the topic of improving relationships. Smirnoff earned his doctorate in psychology and global leadership at Pepperdine University, graduating in May 2019.

In 2016, Smirnoff produced and starred in a comedy special for PBS, &quot;Happily Ever Laughter&quot;, which was named PBS Special of the Year.

==Comedy style==

===&quot;America: What a country!&quot;===
Some of Smirnoff&#x27;s jokes involved word play based on a limited understanding of American idioms and culture:

* &quot;I saw something that told me this was the place for me. It was a large billboard and it had my name on it: &#x27;Smirnoff...America loves Smirnoff!&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;One day the [bar] owner changed my hours and told me I&#x27;d be working the graveyard shift. I thought to myself, &#x27;Wow, a bar in a cemetery. What a country! Talk about your last call!&#x27; During Happy Hour the place must be dead!&quot;
* &quot;On my first shopping trip, I saw powdered milk...you just add water, and you get milk. Then I saw powdered orange juice...you just add water, and you get orange juice. And then I saw baby powder...I thought to myself, &#x27;What a country!&#x27; I&#x27;m making my family tonight!&quot;
* &quot;I was recently in a supermarket and I saw something called New Freedom. Freedom in a box! I said to myself, &#x27;What a country!&#x27;&quot;
* At Denny&#x27;s: &quot;When I went in to be seated, the hostess asked me, &#x27;How many in your party?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Two million.&#x27; She gave me a corner booth.&quot;
* While holding a hot dog: &quot;In Russia, we don&#x27;t eat this part of the dog.&quot;
* &quot;Like all foreigners, when you start to learn the language, you will begin by speaking pigeon English. You won&#x27;t mind, because old ladies will feed you bread crumbs. (The really hard part is learning how to crap on windshields.)&quot;

Other jokes involved comparisons between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.:

* &quot;Thanksgiving is my favorite American holiday. I really like parades without missiles. (I&#x27;ll take Bullwinkle over a tank any day!)&quot;
* &quot;I only make fun of Cleveland because all Americans do. Every country has one city that everybody makes fun of. For example, in Russia we used to make fun of Cleveland.&quot;
* &quot;They don&#x27;t play baseball in the Soviet Union because there, no one is safe.&quot;
* &quot;There aren&#x27;t any such things as credit cards in the Soviet Union, not even American Express. They do, however, have Russian Express—&#x27;Don&#x27;t leave home!&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;America has many wonderful things we never had in Russia...like warning shots.&quot;

===Russian reversal===

Smirnoff is often credited with inventing or popularizing the type of joke known as the &quot;Russian reversal&quot;, in which life &quot;in Soviet Russia&quot; or &quot;in Russia&quot; is described through an unexpected flip of a sentence&#x27;s subject and object. One example occurs in a 1985 Miller Lite commercial, in which Smirnoff states, &quot;In America, there is plenty of light beer and you can always find a party. In Russia, party always finds you.&quot; Another can be found in his 1987 book &quot;America on Six Rubles a Day&quot;: &quot;Show business in America is different from what I was used to. Here you have to find an agent. In Russia, the agent always finds you.&quot; Despite Smirnoff rarely using the joke format himself, he has often been directly associated with it throughout pop culture, including episodes of both &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine observed that the earliest example of the joke can be found in Cole Porter&#x27;s 1938 musical &quot;Leave It to Me!&quot; and furthermore credited Bob Hope for first introducing the format to a wide audience while hosting the 30th Academy Awards in 1958.

==Painting==
Smirnoff is also a painter and has frequently featured the Statue of Liberty in his art since receiving his U.S. citizenship. On the night of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he started a painting inspired by his feelings about the event, based on an image of the Statue of Liberty. Just prior to the first anniversary of the attacks, he paid US$100,000 for his painting to be transformed into a large mural. Its dimensions were 200 feet by 135 feet (61 m by 41 m). The mural, titled &quot;America&#x27;s Heart,&quot; is a pointillist-style piece, with one brush-stroke for each victim of the attacks. Sixty volunteers from the Sheet Metal Workers Union erected the mural on a damaged skyscraper overlooking the ruins of the World Trade Center. The mural remained there until November 2003, when it was removed because of storm damage. Various pieces of the mural can now be seen on display at his theater in Branson, Missouri.

The only stipulation he put on the hanging of the mural was that his name not be listed as the painter. He signed it: &quot;The human spirit is not measured by the size of the act, but by the size of the heart.&quot;

==Personal life==
Smirnoff became an American citizen on 4 July 1986.

Smirnoff married Linda Dreeszen in 1989; they divorced in 2001. They have two children: a daughter, Natasha, born in 1990, and a son, Alexander, born in 1992.

He remarried in 2019 to Olivia Kosarieva.

==Filmography==
Among his film credits, Smirnoff has co-starred in movies with Robin Williams (&quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot;, 1984), Tom Hanks (&quot;The Money Pit&quot;, 1986), and Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep (&quot;Heartburn&quot;, 1986), in addition to single episodes of several TV series.

<doc id="153780" wikidata="Q2734822" url="?curid=153780" title="Conisbrough">
<text>Conisbrough () is a town within the City of Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, England. It is roughly midway between Doncaster and Rotherham, and is built alongside the River Don at . It has a ward population (Conisbrough and Denaby) of 14,333.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Conisbrough&quot; comes from the Old English (first recorded ) meaning &quot;king&#x27;s stronghold&quot; or &quot;king&#x27;s fortified place&quot;. Its derivation has a very similar route to Kingsbury.

==History==

The historian David Hey describes Conisbrough as appearing to be the most important place in Anglo-Saxon and Viking South Yorkshire. In a will of around 1003, Conisbrough was bequeathed by Wulfric Spott, founder of Burton Abbey. At this point, it appears to have been the centre of a major former royal estate, reaching Hatfield Chase. The manor became royal again under Harold II of England, and by the Norman Conquest, 28 townships in what is now South Yorkshire belonged to the Lord of Conisbrough. William the Conqueror gave the whole lordship to William de Warenne.

The name of Conisbrough relates to a king&#x27;s stronghold and this is usually presumed to have either been on the site of Conisbrough Castle, or of the parish church. At the time of the Norman Conquest, the manor of Conisbrough was held by Harold II - he was defeated at the Battle of Hastings. Conisbrough Castle is contained within an artificial oval-shaped enclosure similar to one used as wapentake meeting-places at Gringley on the Hill and East Markham, leading Malcolm Dolby to suppose the castle site may have once been the meeting-place of the Strafforth and Tickhill wapentake.

Conisbrough contains what is believed to be the oldest building in South Yorkshire: the probably 8th-century St Peter&#x27;s Church. The church was enlarged in the twelfth century, and David Hey claims that it was a Minster church, forming the centre of a large, early parish covering all or much of the eleventh century Fee of Conisbrough.

Peter Langtoft, writing in the 13th century, claimed that Egbert of Wessex had been received at &quot;Burghe Conane&quot;, which is often identified with Conisbrough.

Conisbrough Urban District was the unit of local government between 1921 and 1974, when the area was incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster.

===Kilner connection===

In 1863, the Kilner company opened a glass-making plant in Conisbrough. &quot;The bottles made at Conisbrough are chiefly mineral water, spice, confectionery, wine and spirits, pickle, medicine, and chemists. and druggists bottles of all descriptions.&quot; In 1866, Caleb Kilner was sent to manage it, along with his cousin Kilner Bateson. In 1937, the Kilner company went bankrupt. Rights to the Kilner Jar product line were sold to the United Glass Bottle Manufacturers in the same year.

===Literature===

Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote about the town, claiming that it had been fortified by Ambrosius Aurelianus, King of the Britons after his victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Hengist, that the captive Anglo-Saxon leader Hengist was hacked to pieces by Eldol outside the town walls, and was buried at &quot;Hengist&#x27;s Mound&quot; in the town.

In Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, &#x27;Coningsburgh Castle&#x27; is based on Conisbrough. Scott&#x27;s Coningsburgh is an Anglo-Saxon fortress, based (perhaps knowingly) on the mistaken conclusion that its unique style marked it as a non-Norman castle. The great tower is described specifically, so that it is clear that Scott has the Norman version of Conisbrough in mind.

===Earth Centre===
In the mid-1990s, a new tourist attraction, Earth Centre, opened on the nearby site of the former Cadeby Main Colliery. It closed in 2005 after it failed to attract the expected number of visitors. A leisure centre has been built on the site of the former Denaby Main Colliery. In the 2008 drama &quot;Survivors&quot;, the Earth centre was used as the place Abby was shot and taken in.

===Sporting links===

It has also been a host to the Olympic torch relay for the 2012 London Olympics.

Yorkshire saw the Grand Départ for the Tour de France in 2014. After this, Yorkshire hosted Le Tour de Yorkshire. In 2016 the tour came through Conisbrough, passing the famous castle on its way to Doncaster.

==Education==

Conisbrough has one secondary school, the De Warenne Academy (formerly Northcliffe School). The Emmanuel Schools Foundation&#x27;s scheme to turn Northcliffe into an academy was scrapped after protests by parents, students and staff, despite the backing of former Conisbrough councillor Aidan Rave and former Doncaster Mayor Martin Winter.

Primary education in Conisbrough is provided by Ivanhoe Academy, Castle Academy (formerly Station Road School), Morley Place Academy, Rowena Academy and Balby Street Primary.

Further education has been available at the De Warrene Academy from 2010, but some people in the village attend Dearne Valley College, Doncaster College or other colleges further afield.

==Media==

The main bus operator in the town is Stagecoach Yorkshire, providing an extensive network of services into Doncaster &amp; throughout the Dearne Valley, referred to as &quot;The Dearne Link&quot;. Buses run at least every ten minutes into Doncaster &amp; Mexborough and at least half-hourly through to Barnsley, Wath, Cortonwood &amp; Rotherham. First South Yorkshire also operates a service through Conisbrough, running at least every twenty minutes throughout the day between Sheffield and Doncaster on its X3 route

<text>Crystal optics is the branch of optics that describes the behaviour of light in &quot;anisotropic media&quot;, that is, media (such as crystals) in which light behaves differently depending on which direction the light is propagating. The index of refraction depends on both composition and crystal structure and can be calculated using the Gladstone–Dale relation. Crystals are often naturally anisotropic, and in some media (such as liquid crystals) it is possible to induce anisotropy by applying an external electric field.

==Isotropic media==

Typical transparent media such as glasses are &quot;isotropic&quot;, which means that light behaves the same way no matter which direction it is travelling in the medium. In terms of Maxwell&#x27;s equations in a dielectric, this gives a relationship between the electric displacement field D and the electric field E:

:formula_1

where ε0 is the permittivity of free space and P is the electric polarization (the vector field corresponding to electric dipole moments present in the medium). Physically, the polarization field can be regarded as the response of the medium to the electric field of the light.

===Electric susceptibility===

In an isotropic and linear medium, this polarization field P is proportional and parallel to the electric field E:

:formula_2

where χ is the &quot;electric susceptibility&quot; of the medium. The relation between D and E is thus:

:formula_3

where

:formula_4

is the dielectric constant of the medium. The value 1+χ is called the &quot;relative permittivity&quot; of the medium, and is related to the refractive index &quot;n&quot;, for non-magnetic media, by

:formula_5

==Anisotropic media==

In an anisotropic medium, such as a crystal, the polarisation field P is not necessarily aligned with the electric field of the light E. In a physical picture, this can be thought of as the dipoles induced in the medium by the electric field having certain preferred directions, related to the physical structure of the crystal. This can be written as:

:formula_6

Here χ is not a number as before but a tensor of rank 2, the &quot;electric susceptibility tensor&quot;. In terms of components in 3 dimensions:

formula_7

or using the summation convention:

:formula_8

Since χ is a tensor, P is not necessarily colinear with E.

In nonmagnetic and transparent materials, χ&quot;ij&quot; = χ&quot;ji&quot;, i.e. the χ tensor is real and symmetric. In accordance with the spectral theorem, it is thus possible to diagonalise the tensor by choosing the appropriate set of coordinate axes, zeroing all components of the tensor except χxx, χyy and χzz. This gives the set of relations:

:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11

The directions x, y and z are in this case known as the &quot;principal axes&quot; of the medium. Note that these axes will be orthogonal if all entries in the χ tensor are real, corresponding to a case in which the refractive index is real in all directions.

It follows that D and E are also related by a tensor:

:formula_12

Here ε is known as the &quot;relative permittivity tensor&quot; or &quot;dielectric tensor&quot;. Consequently, the refractive index of the medium must also be a tensor. Consider a light wave propagating along the z principal axis polarised such the electric field of the wave is parallel to the x-axis. The wave experiences a susceptibility χxx and a permittivity εxx. The refractive index is thus:

:formula_13

For a wave polarised in the y direction:

:formula_14

Thus these waves will see two different refractive indices and travel at different speeds. This phenomenon is known as &quot;birefringence&quot; and occurs in some common crystals such as calcite and quartz.

If χxx = χyy ≠ χzz, the crystal is known as uniaxial. (See Optic axis of a crystal.) If χxx ≠ χyy and χyy ≠ χzz the crystal is called biaxial. A uniaxial crystal exhibits two refractive indices, an &quot;ordinary&quot; index (&quot;n&quot;o) for light polarised in the x or y directions, and an &quot;extraordinary&quot; index (&quot;n&quot;e) for polarisation in the z direction. A uniaxial crystal is &quot;positive&quot; if ne &gt; no and &quot;negative&quot; if ne &lt; no. Light polarised at some angle to the axes will experience a different phase velocity for different polarization components, and cannot be described by a single index of refraction. This is often depicted as an index ellipsoid.

==Other effects==

Certain nonlinear optical phenomena such as the electro-optic effect cause a variation of a medium&#x27;s permittivity tensor when an external electric field is applied, proportional (to lowest order) to the strength of the field. This causes a rotation of the principal axes of the medium and alters the behaviour of light travelling through it; the effect can be used to produce light modulators.

In response to a magnetic field, some materials can have a dielectric tensor that is complex-Hermitian; this is called a gyro-magnetic or magneto-optic effect. In this case, the principal axes are complex-valued vectors, corresponding to elliptically polarized light, and time-reversal symmetry can be broken. This can be used to design optical isolators, for example.

A dielectric tensor that is not Hermitian gives rise to complex eigenvalues, which corresponds to a material with gain or absorption at a particular frequency.

<doc id="153784" wikidata="Q546116" url="?curid=153784" title="Naginata">
<text>The naginata (, ) is a polearm and one of several varieties of traditionally made Japanese blades (&quot;nihontō&quot;). &quot;Naginata&quot; were originally used by the samurai class of feudal Japan, as well as by ashigaru (foot soldiers) and sōhei (warrior monks). The naginata is the iconic weapon of the onna-musha, a type of female warrior belonging to the Japanese nobility. A common misconception is that the Naginata is a type of sword, rather than a polearm.

==Description==
A &quot;naginata&quot; consists of a wooden or metal pole with a curved single-edged blade on the end; it is similar to the Chinese guan dao or the European glaive. Similar to the katana, naginata often have a round handguard (&quot;tsuba&quot;) between the blade and shaft, when mounted in a koshirae (furniture). The 30 cm to 60 cm (11.8 inches to 23.6 inches) &quot;naginata&quot; blade is forged in the same manner as traditional Japanese swords. The blade has a long tang which is inserted in the .

The blade is removable and is secured by means of a wooden peg called (目釘) that passes through a hole () in both the tang and the shaft.
The shaft ranges from 120 cm to 240 cm (47.2 inches to 94.5 inches) in length and is oval shaped. The area of the shaft where the tang sits is the . The tachiuchi/tachiuke would be reinforced with metal rings (), and/or metal sleeves and wrapped with cord (). The end of the shaft has a heavy metal end cap (). When not in use the blade would be covered with a .

==History==


It is assumed that the &quot;naginata&quot; was developed from an earlier weapon type of the later 1st millennium AD, the &quot;hoko yari&quot;. Another assumption is that the &quot;naginata&quot; was developed by lengthening the hilt of the &quot;tachi&quot; at the end of the Heian period, and it is not certain which theory is correct.

It is generally believed that &quot;naginata&quot; first appeared in the Heian period (794–1185). The term &quot;naginata&quot; first appeared in historical documents in the Heian period. The earliest clear references to &quot;naginata&quot; date from 1146. In &quot;Honchō Seiki&quot; compiled from 1150 to 1159 in the late Heian period, it is recorded that Minamoto no Tsunemitsu mentioned that his weapon was a &quot;naginata&quot;.

In the early Heian period, battles were mainly fought using &quot;yumi&quot; (longbow) on horseback, but in the late Heian period, battles on foot began to increase and &quot;naginata&quot; also came to be used on the battlefield. The &quot;naginata&quot; was appreciated because it was a weapon that could maintain an optimum distance from the enemy in close combat. During the Genpei War (1180–1185), in which the Taira clan was pitted against the Minamoto clan, the &quot;naginata&quot; rose to a position of particularly high esteem, being regarded as an extremely effective weapon by warriors. &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, which records the Genpei War, there are descriptions such as &quot;ō naginata&quot; (lit. big &quot;naginata&quot;) and &quot;ko naginata&quot; (lit. little &quot;naginata&quot;), which show that &quot;naginata&quot; of various lengths were used. The &quot;naginata&quot; proved excellent at dismounting cavalry and disabling riders. The widespread adoption of the &quot;naginata&quot; as a battlefield weapon forced the introduction of greaves as a part of Japanese armor. Ōyamazumi Shrine houses two &quot;naginata&quot; that are said to have been dedicated by Tomoe Gozen and Benkei at the end of the Heian period and they are designated as Important Cultural Property.

However, according to Karl Friday, there were various notations for &quot;naginata&quot; in the Heian period and the earliest physical evidence for &quot;naginata&quot; was in the middle of the Kamakura period, so there is a theory that says when they first appeared is unclear. Earlier 10th through 12th century sources refer to &quot;long swords&quot; that while a common medieval term or orthography for &quot;naginata&quot;, could also simply be referring to conventional swords; one source describes a &quot;naginata&quot; being drawn with the verb , commonly associated with swords, rather than , the verb otherwise used in medieval texts for unsheathing &quot;naginata&quot;. Some 11th and 12th century mentions of &quot;hoko&quot; may actually have been referring to &quot;naginata&quot;. The commonly assumed association of the &quot;naginata&quot; and the &quot;sōhei&quot; is also unclear. Artwork from the late-13th and 14th centuries depict the &quot;sōhei&quot; with &quot;naginata&quot; but do not appear to place any special significance to it: the weapons appear as just one of a number of others carried by the monks, and are used by &quot;samurai&quot; and commoners as well. Depictions of &quot;naginata&quot;-armed &quot;sōhei&quot; in earlier periods were created centuries after the fact, and are likely using the &quot;naginata&quot; as a symbol to distinguish the &quot;sōhei&quot; from other warriors, rather than giving an accurate portrayal of the events.

After the Ōnin War (1467–1477) in the Muromachi period, large-scale group battles started in which mobilized (foot soldiers) fought on foot and in close quarters, and (spear), (longbow), and (Japanese matchlock) became the main weapons. This made and obsolete on the battlefield, and they were often replaced with the and short, lightweight .

In the Edo period (1603–1867), the hilts of were often cut off and made into or . This practice of cutting off the hilt of an , , , or and remaking it into a shorter or due to changes in tactics is called and was common in Japan at the time. In Japan there is a saying about swords: &quot;No sword made by modifying a or a is dull in cutting&quot; (薙刀（長巻）直しに鈍刀なし). The meaning of this saying is that and are equipment for actual combat, not works of art or offerings to the , and that the sharpness and durability of swords made from their modifications have been proven on the battlefield.

In the peaceful Edo period, weapons&#x27; value as battlefield weapons became diminished and their value for martial arts and self-defense rose. The &quot;naginata&quot; was accepted as a status symbol and self-defense weapon for women of nobility, resulting in the image that &quot;the Naginata is the main weapon used by women&quot;. 

In the Meiji era, it gained popularity along sword martial arts. From the Taisho era to the post-War era, the &quot;naginata&quot; became popular as a martial art for women, mainly due to the influence of government policies.

Although associated with considerably smaller numbers of practitioners, a number of &quot;koryu bujutsu&quot; systems (traditional martial arts) which include older and more combative forms of &quot;naginatajutsu&quot; remain existent, including Suio Ryu, Araki Ryu, Tendo Ryu, Jikishinkage ryu, Higo Koryu, Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu, Toda-ha Buko Ryu, and Yoshin ryu, some of which have authorized representatives outside Japan.

==Contemporary construction==
In contemporary &quot;naginatajutsu&quot;, two types of practice &quot;naginata&quot; are in common use.

The &quot;naginata&quot; used in &quot;atarashii naginata&quot; (新しいなぎなた), the &quot;shiai-yo&quot;, has an oak shaft and a bamboo &quot;blade&quot; (&quot;habu&quot;). It is used for practice, forms competitions, and sparring. It is between and in length and must weigh over . The &quot;blade&quot; is replaceable. They are often broken or damaged during sparring and can be quickly replaced, being attached to the shaft with tape.

The naginata used by &quot;koryū&quot; practitioners has an oak shaft and blade, carved from a single piece of wood, and may incorporate a disc-shaped guard (&quot;tsuba&quot;). It is called a &quot;kihon-yo&quot;.

==Contemporary usage==

&quot;Naginata&quot; can be used to batter, stab, or hook an opponent, but due to their relatively balanced center of mass, are often spun and turned to proscribe a large radius of reach. The curved blade provides a long cutting surface without increasing the overall length of the weapon.

Historically, the &quot;naginata&quot; was often used by foot soldiers to create space on the battlefield. They have several situational advantages over a sword. Their reach is longer, allowing the wielder to keep out of the reach of opponents. The weight of the weapon gave power to strikes and cuts, even though the weight of the weapon is usually thought of as a disadvantage. The weight at the end of the shaft (&quot;ishizuki&quot;), and the shaft itself (&quot;ebu&quot;) can be used offensively and defensively.

The martial art of wielding the &quot;naginata&quot; is known as &quot;naginatajutsu&quot;. Most &quot;naginata&quot; practice today is in a modernised form, a &quot;gendai budō&quot; called &quot;atarashii Naginata&quot; (&quot;new Naginata&quot;), which is organized into regional, national, and international federations, who hold competitions and award ranks. Use of the &quot;naginata&quot; is also taught within the &quot;Bujinkan&quot; and in some &quot;koryū&quot; schools such as Suio Ryu and Tendō-ryū.

&quot;Naginata&quot; practitioners wear an &quot;uwagi&quot;, &quot;obi&quot;, and &quot;hakama&quot;, similar to that worn by &quot;kendo&quot; practitioners, although the &quot;uwagi&quot; is generally white. For sparring, armor known as &quot;bōgu&quot; is worn. &quot;Bōgu&quot; for &quot;naginatajutsu&quot; adds and the have a singulated index finger, unlike the mitten-style gloves used for &quot;kendo&quot;.

<text>Kőnig&#x27;s lemma or Kőnig&#x27;s infinity lemma is a theorem in graph theory due to the Hungarian mathematician Dénes Kőnig who published it in 1927. It gives a sufficient condition for an infinite graph to have an infinitely long path. The computability aspects of this theorem have been thoroughly investigated by researchers in mathematical logic, especially in computability theory. This theorem also has important roles in constructive mathematics and proof theory.

==Statement of the lemma==
Let formula_1 be a connected, locally finite, infinite graph. This means that every two vertices can be connected by a finite path, each vertex is adjacent to only finitely many other vertices, and the graph has infinitely many vertices. Then formula_1 contains a ray: a simple path (a path with no repeated vertices) that starts at one vertex and continues from it through infinitely many vertices. Another way of stating the theorem is: &quot;If the human race never dies out, somebody now living has a line of descendants that will never die out&quot;.

A useful special case of the lemma is that every infinite tree contains either a vertex of infinite degree or an infinite simple path. If it is locally finite, it meets the conditions of the lemma and has a ray, and if it is not locally finite then it has an infinite-degree vertex.

===Construction===
The construction of a ray, in a graph formula_1 that meets the conditions of the lemma, can be performed step by step, maintaining at each step a finite path that can be extended to reach infinitely many vertices (not necessarily all along the same path as each other). To begin this process, start with any single vertex formula_4. This vertex can be thought of as a path of length zero, consisting of one vertex and no edges. By the assumptions of the lemma, each of the infinitely many vertices of formula_1 can be reached by a simple path that starts from formula_4.

Next, as long as the current path ends at some vertex formula_7, consider the infinitely many vertices that can be reached by simple paths that extend the current path, and for each of these vertices construct a simple path to it that extends the current path. There are infinitely many of these extended paths, each of which connects from formula_7 to one of its neighbors, but formula_7 has only finitely many neighbors. Therefore, it follows by a form of the pigeonhole principle that at least one of these neighbors is used as the next step on infinitely many of these extended paths. Let formula_10 be such a neighbor, and extend the current path by one edge, the edge from formula_7 to formula_10. This extension preserves the property that infinitely many vertices can be reached by simple paths that extend the current path.

Repeating this process for extending the path produces an infinite sequence of finite simple paths, each extending the previous path in the sequence by one more edge. The union of all of these paths is the ray whose existence was promised by the lemma.

==Computability aspects==
The computability aspects of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma have been thoroughly investigated. For this purpose it is convenient to state Kőnig&#x27;s lemma in the form that any infinite finitely branching subtree of formula_13 has an infinite path. Here formula_14 denotes the set of natural numbers (thought of as an ordinal number) and formula_13 the tree whose nodes are all finite sequences of natural numbers, where the parent of a node is obtained by removing the last element from a sequence. Each finite sequence can be identified with a partial function from formula_14 to itself, and each infinite path can be identified with a total function. This allows for an analysis using the techniques of computability theory.

A subtree of formula_13 in which each sequence has only finitely many immediate extensions (that is, the tree has finite degree when viewed as a graph) is called finitely branching. Not every infinite subtree of formula_13 has an infinite path, but Kőnig&#x27;s lemma shows that any finitely branching infinite subtree must have such a path.

For any subtree formula_19 of formula_13 the notation formula_21 denotes the set of nodes of formula_19 through which there is an infinite path. Even when formula_19 is computable the set formula_21 may not be computable. Whenever a subtree formula_19 of
formula_13 has an infinite path, the path is computable from formula_21, step by step, greedily choosing a successor in formula_21 at each step. The restriction to formula_21 ensures that this greedy process cannot get stuck.

There exist non-finitely branching computable subtrees of formula_13 that have no arithmetical path, and indeed no hyperarithmetical path. However, every computable subtree of formula_13 with a path must have a path computable from Kleene&#x27;s O, the canonical formula_32 complete set. This is because the set formula_21 is always formula_34 (for the meaning of this notation, see analytical hierarchy) when formula_19 is computable.

A finer analysis has been conducted for computably bounded trees. A subtree of formula_13 is called computably bounded or recursively bounded if there is a computable function formula_37 from formula_14 to formula_14 such that for every sequence in the tree and every natural number formula_40, the formula_40th element of the sequence is at most formula_42. Thus formula_37 gives a bound for how &quot;wide&quot; the tree is. The following basis theorems apply to infinite, computably bounded, computable subtrees of formula_44.
* Any such tree has a path computable from formula_45, the canonical Turing complete set that can decide the halting problem.
* Any such tree has a path that is low. This is known as the low basis theorem.
* Any such tree has a path that is &quot;hyperimmune free&quot;. This means that any function computable from the path is dominated by a computable function.
* For any noncomputable subset formula_46 of formula_14 the tree has a path that does not compute formula_46.

A weak form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma which states that every infinite binary tree has an infinite branch is used to define the subsystem WKL0 of second-order arithmetic. This subsystem has an important role in reverse mathematics. Here a binary tree is one in which every term of every sequence in the tree is 0 or 1, which is to say the tree is computably bounded via the constant function 2. The full form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma is not provable in WKL0, but is equivalent to the stronger subsystem ACA0.

==Relationship to constructive mathematics and compactness==
The proof given above is not generally considered to be constructive, because at each step it uses a proof by contradiction to establish that there exists an adjacent vertex from which infinitely many other vertices can be reached, and because of the reliance on a weak form of the axiom of choice. Facts about the computational aspects of the lemma suggest that no proof can be given that would be considered constructive by the main schools of constructive mathematics.

The fan theorem of is, from a classical point of view, the contrapositive of a form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma. A subset &quot;S&quot; of formula_49 is called a &quot;bar&quot; if any function from formula_14 to the set formula_51 has some initial segment in &quot;S&quot;. A bar is &quot;detachable&quot; if every sequence is either in the bar or not in the bar (this assumption is required because the theorem is ordinarily considered in situations where the law of the excluded middle is not assumed). A bar is &quot;uniform&quot; if there is some number formula_52 so that any function from formula_14 to formula_51 has an initial segment in the bar of length no more than formula_52. Brouwer&#x27;s fan theorem says that any detachable bar is uniform.

This can be proven in a classical setting by considering the bar as an open covering of the compact topological space formula_56. Each sequence in the bar represents a basic open set of this space, and these basic open sets cover the space by assumption. By compactness, this cover has a finite subcover. The &quot;N&quot; of the fan theorem can be taken to be the length of the longest sequence whose basic open set is in the finite subcover. This topological proof can be used in classical mathematics to show that the following form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma holds: for any natural number &quot;k&quot;, any infinite subtree of the tree formula_57 has an infinite path.

==Relationship with the axiom of choice==
Kőnig&#x27;s lemma may be considered to be a choice principle; the first proof above illustrates the relationship between the lemma and the axiom of dependent choice. At each step of the induction, a vertex with a particular property must be selected. Although it is proved that at least one appropriate vertex exists, if there is more than one suitable vertex there may be no canonical choice. In fact, the full strength of the axiom of dependent choice is not needed; as described below, the axiom of countable choice suffices.

If the graph is countable, the vertices are well-ordered and one can canonically choose the smallest suitable vertex. In this case, Kőnig&#x27;s lemma is provable in second-order arithmetic with arithmetical comprehension, and, a fortiori, in ZF set theory (without choice).

Kőnig&#x27;s lemma is essentially the restriction of the axiom of dependent choice to entire relations formula_58 such that for each formula_59 there are only finitely many formula_60 such that formula_61. Although the axiom of choice is, in general, stronger than the principle of dependent choice, this restriction of dependent choice is equivalent to a restriction of the axiom of choice.
In particular, when the branching at each node is done on a finite subset of an arbitrary set not assumed to be countable, the form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma that says &quot;Every infinite finitely branching tree has an infinite path&quot; is equivalent to the principle that every countable set of finite sets has a choice function, that is to say, the axiom of countable choice for finite sets. This form of the axiom of choice (and hence of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma) is not provable in ZF set theory.

== Generalization ==
In the category of sets, the inverse limit of any inverse system of non-empty finite sets is non-empty. This may be seen as a generalization of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma and can be proved with Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, viewing the finite sets as compact discrete spaces, and then using the finite intersection property characterization of compactness.

<text>Cecily Neville (3 May 1415 – 31 May 1495) was an English noblewoman, the wife of Richard, Duke of York (1411–1460), and the mother of two kings of England—Edward IV and Richard III. Cecily Neville was known as &quot;the Rose of Raby&quot;, because she was born at Raby Castle in Durham, and &quot;Proud Cis&quot;, because of her pride and a temper that went with it, although she was also known for her piety. She herself signed her name &quot;Cecylle&quot;.

Cecily&#x27;s husband, the Duke of York, was the leading contender for the throne of England from the House of York during the period of the Wars of the Roses until his death in 1460. Their son Edward actually assumed the throne as Edward IV in 1461, after the deposition of King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster. The Duchess of York thus narrowly missed becoming queen consort of England.

==Family==
Cecily Neville was the youngest of the 22 children of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his second wife Joan Beaufort. Her paternal grandparents were John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, and Maud Percy, daughter of Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy. Her maternal grandparents were John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and his third wife Katherine Swynford. John of Gaunt was the third surviving son of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault.

Cecily was the aunt of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, one of the leading peers and military commanders of his generation, a great-aunt of queen consort Anne Neville, who married her son Richard III, and a great-great-great-aunt of queen consort Catherine Parr, sixth wife of her great-grandson, King Henry VIII.

==Duchess of York==
In 1424, when Cecily was eight years old, she was betrothed by her father to his thirteen-year-old ward, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. Ralph Neville died in October 1425, bequeathing the wardship of Richard to his widow, Joan Beaufort. Cecily and Richard were married by October 1429. Their first child, Anne of York, was born in August 1439 in Northamptonshire. When Richard became a king&#x27;s lieutenant and governor general of France in 1441 and moved to Rouen, Cecily moved with him. Their son Henry was born in February but died soon after.

Their next son, the future King Edward IV, was born in Rouen on 28 April 1442 and immediately baptised privately in a small side chapel. He would later be accused of illegitimacy by his cousin, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and by his own brother, George, Duke of Clarence, a common method of discrediting political enemies. George and Warwick were in dispute with Edward at the time and seeking to overthrow him as king. The claims would later be dismissed. Nonetheless, some modern historians give serious consideration to the question, and use Edward&#x27;s date of birth as supporting evidence: assuming Edward was not premature (there being no evidence either way), Richard of York would have been several days&#x27; march from Cecily at the time of conception and the baby&#x27;s baptism was a simple and private affair, unlike that of his younger brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, which was public and lavish. This is countered by other historians, however, who point out that Cecily&#x27;s husband could easily, by the military conventions of the time, have returned briefly to Rouen, where Cecily was living at the time, while baptism conventions of the time meant that a low-key baptism would be more likely due to Richard of York&#x27;s relatively low political standing at the time and fears for the baby&#x27;s survival. If the difference in baptisms was to be taken as a disavowal of an otherwise acknowledged and cherished heir, it would not only be a humiliation of a wife Richard otherwise valued before and after Edward&#x27;s birth, but also a personal and political humiliation. In any case, Richard acknowledged the baby as his own, which established legal paternity.

Around 1454, when Richard began to resent the influence of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (a first cousin of his wife), Cecily spoke with queen consort Margaret of Anjou on his behalf. When Henry VI suffered a nervous breakdown later in the year, Richard of York established himself as a Protector.

After the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, Cecily remained at their home, Ludlow Castle, even after Richard fled to Ireland and Continental Europe. At the same time, she surreptitiously worked for the cause of the House of York. When a parliament began to debate the fate of the Duke of York and his supporters in November 1459, Cecily travelled to London to plead for her husband. One contemporary commentator stated that she had reputedly convinced the king to promise a pardon if the duke would appear in the parliament in eight days. This effort failed, and Richard&#x27;s lands were confiscated, but Cecily managed to gain an annual grant of £600 to support herself and her children.

After the Yorkist victory at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460, Cecily moved to London with her children and lived with the lawyer John Paston. She carried the royal arms before Richard in triumph in London in September. When the Duke of York and his heirs were officially recognised as Henry VI&#x27;s successors in the Act of Accord, Cecily became a queen-in-waiting and even received a copy of the English chronicle from the chronicler John Hardyng.

But in the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, the Lancastrians won a decisive victory. The Duke of York, his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Cecily&#x27;s brother Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, were among the casualties. Cecily sent her two youngest sons, George and Richard, to the court of Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. This forced Philip to ally with the Yorkists.

==Mother of two kings, great-aunt of a queen, and grandmother of a queen==
Cecily&#x27;s eldest son Edward successfully continued the fight against the Lancastrians. When Cecily moved to Baynard&#x27;s Castle in London, it became the Yorkist headquarters, and after Edward defeated the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and ascended the throne, she was honoured as the mother of the king.

During the beginning of Edward&#x27;s reign, Cecily appeared beside him and maintained her influence. In 1461, she revised her coat of arms to include the royal arms of England, hinting that her husband had been a rightful king. When Edward married Elizabeth Woodville, he built new queen&#x27;s quarters for her and let his mother remain in the queen&#x27;s quarters in which she had been living.

In 1469, her nephew Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, father-in-law of her sons George and Richard, rebelled against Edward IV. She visited Sandwich, possibly trying to reconcile the parties. When the rebellion failed the first time, she invited Edward and George to London to reconcile them. Peace did not last long, and in the forthcoming war, she still tried to make peace between her sons.

Edward IV was briefly overthrown by Warwick and Margaret of Anjou, and for about six months (October 1470 – April 1471), Henry VI was restored to the throne. The breach between Edward and his brother George was apparently never really healed; indeed, George was executed for treason in the Tower of London on 18 February 1478. Edward IV died suddenly on 9 April 1483, leaving two sons aged 12 and 9, the elder one known to history as King Edward V. Cecily Neville&#x27;s youngest son Richard, their uncle, was appointed their protector by Edward&#x27;s will, but he had them placed in the Tower of London, as it was custom for Kings awaiting their coronation; their fate is still a matter of dispute. A subsequent enquiry found that Edward IV&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid. The so-called Princes in the Tower were thus declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament in 1484 and their uncle Richard crowned Richard III on 6 July 1483.

Duchess Cecily was on good terms with Richard&#x27;s wife Lady Anne Neville (her grandniece in addition to being her daughter-in-law), with whom she discussed religious works such as the writings of Mechtilde of Hackeborn.

Richard&#x27;s reign was brief; he was defeated and killed on 22 August 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth by the leader of the Lancastrian party, Henry Tudor, who immediately assumed the throne as King Henry VII. Thus Cecily&#x27;s husband and four sons had all died by 1485, although two of her daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, still lived. On 18 January 1486, Cecily&#x27;s granddaughter, Elizabeth of York, eldest daughter of Edward IV, married Henry VII and became Queen of England. Her great-grandson Arthur was born that same year, whereas her great-granddaughter Margaret was born in 1489 and great-grandson Henry in 1491, all before she died. Duchess Cecily devoted herself to religious duties and her reputation for piety comes from this period.

==Death and will==
The Duchess died on 31 May 1495 and was buried in the tomb with her husband Richard and their son Edmund at the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire, with a papal indulgence. All subsequent English and later British monarchs, beginning with Henry VIII, are descendants of Elizabeth of York, and therefore of Cecily Neville.

&quot;Cecill wife unto the right noble Prince Richard late Duke of Yorke&quot; made her will on 1 April 1495. It was proved at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 27 August of the same year.

==Issue==
Her twelve children with Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, were as follows:
#Anne of York (10 August 1439 – 14 January 1476), primarily wife of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, and secondly, Sir Thomas St. Leger

==Coat of arms==
==Fictional portrayals==

Cecily Neville as the Duchess of York is a principal character in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tragedy of King Richard III&quot;. She is portrayed as having deep affection for her dead sons George and Edward, but is cold and unloving to Richard, to whom she refers as a &quot;false glass that grieves me when I see my shame in him.&quot; Because Richard is depicted as a hunchback, the Duchess seems to hate him for his deformity and for his difficult birth, which several characters in the play gossip about. After Richard has done away with the Princes in the Tower, his mother turns against him completely, cursing him with the damning words: &quot;Bloody thou art, Bloody will be thy end!&quot; She has been portrayed by many noted actresses, including Elinor Aickin, Eleanor Bron, Annette Crosbie (for BBC Shakespeare in 1983), Helen Haye (in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1955 film), Anne Jeffreys, and, in the 1995 film starring Ian McKellen, Dame Maggie Smith.

In 2013 and 2017, the Duchess is portrayed by Caroline Goodall in the television series &quot;The White Queen&quot; and &quot;The White Princess&quot;, respectively; a series based on three of the novels from the &quot;Cousins&#x27; War&quot; series by author Philippa Gregory. In episode one, Lady Cecily&#x27;s first scene is an exchange with Jacquetta of Luxembourg and her daughter, Elizabeth Woodville. In this meeting, Jacquetta, as her daughter&#x27;s mouthpiece, really oversteps the historical mark. The disapproving Duchess, who was known in real life as &quot;proud Cis&quot;, is too easily overcome by her social inferiors when they whip out her apparent &quot;secret&quot; affair with a French archer and Elizabeth commands that she bow before her. Lost for words, she is silenced within minutes, almost cowed by them. While contemporary notions of &quot;courtesy&quot; dictated extreme forms of submission to the queen, this is a Lady Cecily straight from the pages of a novel rather than the actual proud aristocrat who asserted her own right to rule.

In 2016, Neville was portrayed by Judi Dench in the BBC television mini-series &quot;The Hollow Crown: The War of the Roses&quot;, in the third episode; which is based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Richard III&quot;.

Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot; portrays Neville relatively accurately to the historical record, as the proud matriarch of the York family and a loving but stern mother to all her children. The book heavily focuses on her disdain for Elizabeth Woodville, as well as her attempts to reconcile the various feuds between her sons.

<text>Corteno Golgi (; ) is an Italian village and (municipality) in the Val Camonica area of central Alps in northern Italy, administratively in the province of Brescia, Lombardy.
Formerly known as simply Corteno, the name of the village was changed in 1956 after the memory of scientist Camillo Golgi, who was born there in 1843 and was the first Italian to be awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906. The town houses a museum dedicated to his work.

<doc id="153797" wikidata="Q8860" url="?curid=153797" title="Orion (constellation)">
<text>Orion is a prominent set of stars visible during winter in the northern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the 88 modern constellations; it was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy. It is named after a hunter in Greek mythology.

Orion is most prominent during winter evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, as are five other constellations that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Orion&#x27;s two brightest stars, Rigel (β) and Betelgeuse (α), are both among the brightest stars in the night sky; both are supergiants and slightly variable. There are a further six stars brighter than magnitude 3.0, including three making the short straight line of the Orion&#x27;s Belt asterism. Orion also hosts the radiant of the annual Orionids, the strongest meteor shower associated with Halley&#x27;s Comet, and the Orion Nebula, one of the brightest nebulae in the sky.

==Characteristics==

Orion is bordered by Taurus to the northwest, Eridanus to the southwest, Lepus to the south, Monoceros to the east, and Gemini to the northeast. Covering 594 square degrees, Orion ranks twenty-sixth of the 88 constellations in size. The constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between and . The constellation&#x27;s three-letter abbreviation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Ori&quot;.

Orion is most visible in the evening sky from January to April, winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics (less than about 8° from the equator), the constellation transits at the zenith.

In the period May–July (summer in the Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern Hemisphere), Orion is in the daytime sky and thus invisible at most latitudes. However, for much of Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus Orion, but only the brightest stars) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, just in the brightest section of the sky low in the North where the Sun is just below the horizon. At the same time of day at the South Pole itself (Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station), Rigel is only 8° above the horizon, and the Belt sweeps just along it. In the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s summer months, when Orion is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible in Antarctica because the sun does not set at that time of year south of the Antarctic Circle.

In countries close to the equator (e.g., Kenya, Indonesia, Colombia, Ecuador), Orion appears overhead in December around midnight and in the February evening sky.

==Navigational aid==
Orion is very useful as an aid to locating other stars. By extending the line of the Belt southeastward, Sirius (α CMa) can be found; northwestward, Aldebaran (α Tau). A line eastward across the two shoulders indicates the direction of Procyon (α CMi). A line from Rigel through Betelgeuse points to Castor and Pollux (α Gem and β Gem). Additionally, Rigel is part of the Winter Circle asterism. Sirius and Procyon, which may be located from Orion by following imaginary lines (see map), also are points in both the Winter Triangle and the Circle.

==Features==
Orion&#x27;s seven brightest stars form a distinctive hourglass-shaped asterism, or pattern, in the night sky. Four stars—Rigel, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, and Saiph—form a large roughly rectangular shape, at the center of which lies the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt—Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka. His head is marked by an additional 8th star called Meissa, which is fairly bright to the observer. Descending from the &quot;belt&quot; is a smaller line of three stars, Orion&#x27;s Sword (the middle of which is in fact not a star but the Orion Nebula), also known as the hunter&#x27;s sword.

Many of the stars are luminous hot blue supergiants, with the stars of the belt and sword forming the Orion OB1 association. Standing out by its red hue, Betelgeuse may nevertheless be a runaway member of the same group.

===Bright stars===
* Betelgeuse, also designated Alpha Orionis, is a massive M-type red supergiant star nearing the end of its life. It is the second brightest star in Orion, and is a semiregular variable star. It serves as the &quot;right shoulder&quot; of the hunter (assuming that he is facing the observer). It is generally the eleventh brightest star in the night sky, but this has varied between being the tenth brightest to the 23rd brightest by the end of 2019. The end of its life is expected to result in a supernova explosion that will be highly visible from Earth, possibly outshining the Earth&#x27;s moon and being visible during the day. This is most likely to occur within the next 100,000 years.
* Rigel, also known as Beta Orionis, is a B-type blue supergiant that is the seventh brightest star in the night sky. Similar to Betelgeuse, Rigel is fusing heavy elements in its core and will pass its supergiant stage soon (on an astronomical timescale), either collapsing in the case of a supernova or shedding its outer layers and turning into a white dwarf. It serves as the left foot of the hunter.
* Bellatrix is designated Gamma Orionis by Johann Bayer. It is the twenty-seventh brightest star in the night sky. Bellatrix is considered a B-type blue giant, though it is too small to explode in a supernova. Bellatrix&#x27;s luminosity is derived from its high temperature rather than a large radius. Bellatrix marks Orion&#x27;s left shoulder and it means the &quot;female warrior&quot;, and is sometimes known colloquially as the &quot;Amazon Star&quot;. It is the closest major star in Orion at only 244.6 light years from our solar system.
* Mintaka is designated Delta Orionis, despite being the faintest of the three stars in Orion&#x27;s Belt. Its name means &quot;the belt&quot;. It is a multiple star system, composed of a large B-type blue giant and a more massive O-type main-sequence star. The Mintaka system constitutes an eclipsing binary variable star, where the eclipse of one star over the other creates a dip in brightness. Mintaka is the westernmost of the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt, as well as the northernmost.
* Alnilam is designated Epsilon Orionis and is named for the Arabic phrase meaning &quot;string of pearls&quot;. It is the middle and brightest of the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt. Alnilam is a B-type blue supergiant; despite being nearly twice as far from the Sun as the other two belt stars, its luminosity makes it nearly equal in magnitude. Alnilam is losing mass quickly, a consequence of its size. It is the farthest major star in Orion at 1,344 light years.
* Alnitak, meaning &quot;the girdle&quot;, is designated Zeta Orionis, and is the easternmost star in Orion&#x27;s Belt. It is a triple star system, with the primary star being a hot blue supergiant and the brightest class O star in the night sky.
* Saiph is designated Kappa Orionis by Bayer, and serves as Orion&#x27;s right foot. It is of a similar distance and size to Rigel, but appears much fainter. It means the &quot;sword of the giant&quot;
* Meissa is designated Lambda Orionis, forms Orion&#x27;s head, and is a multiple star with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.33. Its name means the &quot;shining one&quot;.

=== Belt ===

Orion&#x27;s Belt or The Belt of Orion is an asterism within the constellation. It consists of the three bright stars Zeta (Alnitak), Epsilon (Alnilam), and Delta (Mintaka). Alnitak is around 800 light years away from earth and is 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun and shines with magnitude 1.8; much of its radiation is in the ultraviolet range, which the human eye cannot see. Alnilam is approximately 2,000 light years away from Earth, shines with magnitude 1.70, and with ultraviolet light is 375,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Mintaka is 915 light years away and shines with magnitude 2.21. It is 90,000 times more luminous than the Sun and is a double star: the two orbit each other every 5.73 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, Orion&#x27;s Belt is best visible in the night sky during the month of January around 9:00 pm, when it is approximately around the local meridian.

Just southwest of Alnitak lies Sigma Orionis, a multiple star system composed of five stars that have a combined apparent magnitude of 3.7 and lying 1150 light years distant. Southwest of Mintaka lies the quadruple star Eta Orionis.

===Sword===
Orion&#x27;s Sword contains the Orion Nebula, the Messier 43 nebula, the Running Man Nebula, and the stars Theta Orionis, Iota Orionis, and 42 Orionis.

===Head===
Three stars comprise a small triangle that marks the head. The apex is marked by Meissa (Lambda Orionis), a hot blue giant of spectral type O8 III and apparent magnitude 3.54, which lies some 1100 light years distant. Phi-1 and Phi-2 Orionis make up the base. Also nearby is the very young star FU Orionis.

===Club===
Stretching north from Betelgeuse are the stars that make up Orion&#x27;s club. Mu Orionis marks the elbow, Nu and Xi mark the handle of the club, and Chi1 and Chi2 mark the end of the club. Just east of Chi1 is the Mira-type variable red giant U Orionis.

===Shield===
West from Bellatrix lie six stars all designated Pi Orionis (π1 Ori, π2 Ori, π3 Ori, π4 Ori, π5 Ori and π6 Ori) which make up Orion&#x27;s shield.

===Meteor showers===
Around 20 October each year the Orionid meteor shower (Orionids) reaches its peak. Coming from the border with the constellation Gemini as many as 20 meteors per hour can be seen. The shower&#x27;s parent body is Halley&#x27;s Comet.

===Deep-sky objects===

Hanging from Orion&#x27;s belt is his sword, consisting of the multiple stars θ1 and θ2 Orionis, called the Trapezium and the Orion Nebula (M42). This is a spectacular object that can be clearly identified with the naked eye as something other than a star. Using binoculars, its clouds of nascent stars, luminous gas, and dust can be observed. The Trapezium cluster has many newborn stars, including several brown dwarfs, all of which are at an approximate distance of 1,500 light-years. Named for the four bright stars that form a trapezoid, it is largely illuminated by the brightest stars, which are only a few hundred thousand years old. Observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show both the extreme temperatures of the main stars—up to 60,000 kelvins—and the star forming regions still extant in the surrounding nebula.

M78 (NGC 2068) is a nebula in Orion. With an overall magnitude of 8.0, it is significantly dimmer than the Great Orion Nebula that lies to its south; however, it is at approximately the same distance, at 1600 light-years from Earth. It can easily be mistaken for a comet in the eyepiece of a telescope. M78 is associated with the variable star V351 Orionis, whose magnitude changes are visible in very short periods of time. Another fairly bright nebula in Orion is NGC 1999, also close to the Great Orion Nebula. It has an integrated magnitude of 10.5 and is 1500 light-years from Earth. The variable star V380 Orionis is embedded in NGC 1999.

Another famous nebula is IC 434, the Horsehead Nebula, near ζ Orionis. It contains a dark dust cloud whose shape gives the nebula its name.

NGC 2174 is an emission nebula located 6400 light-years from Earth.

Besides these nebulae, surveying Orion with a small telescope will reveal a wealth of interesting deep-sky objects, including M43, M78, as well as multiple stars including Iota Orionis and Sigma Orionis. A larger telescope may reveal objects such as the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024), as well as fainter and tighter multiple stars and nebulae. Barnard&#x27;s Loop can be seen on very dark nights or using long-exposure photography.

All of these nebulae are part of the larger Orion molecular cloud complex, which is located approximately 1,500 light-years away and is hundreds of light-years across. It is one of the most intense regions of stellar formation visible within our galaxy.

==History and mythology==
The distinctive pattern of Orion is recognized in numerous cultures around the world, and many myths are associated with it. Orion is used as a symbol in the modern world.

===Ancient Near East===

The Babylonian star catalogues of the Late Bronze Age name Orion &#x27;, &quot;The Heavenly Shepherd&quot; or &quot;True Shepherd of Anu&quot; – Anu being the chief god of the heavenly realms. The Babylonian constellation is sacred to Papshukal and Ninshubur, both minor gods fulfilling the role of &#x27;messenger to the gods&#x27;. Papshukal is closely associated with the figure of a walking bird on Babylonian boundary stones, and on the star map the figure of the Rooster is located below and behind the figure of the True Shepherd—both constellations represent the herald of the gods, in his bird and human forms respectively.

In ancient Egypt, the stars of Orion were regarded as a god, called Sah. Because Orion rises before Sirius, the star whose heliacal rising was the basis for the Solar Egyptian calendar, Sah was closely linked with Sopdet, the goddess who personified Sirius. The god Sopdu is said to be the son of Sah and Sopdet. Sah is syncretized with Osiris, while Sopdet is syncretized with Osiris&#x27; mythological wife, Isis. In the Pyramid Texts, from the 24th and 23rd centuries BC, Sah is one of many gods whose form the dead pharaoh is said to take in the afterlife.

The Armenians identified their legendary patriarch and founder Hayk with Orion. &quot;Hayk&quot; is also the name of the Orion constellation in the Armenian translation of the Bible.

The Bible mentions Orion three times, naming it &quot;Kesil&quot; (כסיל, literally – fool). Though, this name perhaps is etymologically connected with &quot;Kislev&quot;, the name for the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar (i.e. November–December), which, in turn, may derive from the Hebrew root K-S-L as in the words &quot;kesel, kisla&quot; (כֵּסֶל, כִּסְלָה, hope, positiveness), i.e. hope for winter rains.: Job 9:9 (&quot;He is the maker of the Bear and Orion&quot;), Job 38:31 (&quot;Can you loosen Orion&#x27;s belt?&quot;), and Amos 5:8 (&quot;He who made the Pleiades and Orion&quot;).

In ancient Aram, the constellation was known as &quot;Nephîlā′&quot;, the &quot;Nephilim&quot; are said to be Orion&#x27;s descendants.

===Greco-Roman antiquity===

In Greek mythology, Orion was a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter, born to Euryale, a Gorgon, and Poseidon (Neptune), god of the sea. One myth recounts Gaia&#x27;s rage at Orion, who dared to say that he would kill every animal on Earth. The angry goddess tried to dispatch Orion with a scorpion. This is given as the reason that the constellations of Scorpius and Orion are never in the sky at the same time. However, Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, revived Orion with an antidote. This is said to be the reason that the constellation of Ophiuchus stands midway between the Scorpion and the Hunter in the sky.

The constellation is mentioned in Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; (Ode 3.27.18), Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (Book 5, line 283) and &quot;Iliad&quot;, and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (Book 1, line 535).

===Middle East===

In medieval Muslim astronomy, Orion was known as &quot;al-jabbar&quot;, &quot;the giant&quot;. Orion&#x27;s sixth brightest star, Saiph, is named from the Arabic, &quot;saif al-jabbar&quot;, meaning &quot;sword of the giant&quot;.

===China===
In China, Orion was one of the 28 lunar mansions &quot;Sieu (Xiù)&quot; (宿). It is known as &quot;Shen&quot; (參), literally meaning &quot;three&quot;, for the stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt. (See Chinese constellations)

The Chinese character 參 (pinyin shēn) originally meant the constellation Orion (); its Shang dynasty version, over three millennia old, contains at the top a representation of the three stars of Orion&#x27;s belt atop a man&#x27;s head (the bottom portion representing the sound of the word was added later).

===India===
The &quot;Rigveda&quot; refers to the Orion Constellation as Mriga (The Deer). 

Nataraja, &#x27;the cosmic dancer&#x27;, is often interpreted as the representation of Orion. Rudra, the Rigvedic form of Shiva, is the presiding deity of Ardra nakshatra (Betelgeuse) of Hindu astrology.

The Jain Symbol carved in Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, India in 1st century BCE has striking resemblance with Orion.

Bugis sailors identified the three stars in Orion&#x27;s Belt as &quot;tanra tellué&quot;, meaning &quot;sign of three&quot;.

===European folklore===
In old Hungarian tradition, Orion is known as &quot;Archer&quot; (&quot;Íjász&quot;), or &quot;Reaper&quot; (&quot;Kaszás&quot;). In recently rediscovered myths, he is called Nimrod (Hungarian: &quot;Nimród&quot;), the greatest hunter, father of the twins Hunor and Magor. The π and o stars (on upper right) form together the reflex bow or the lifted scythe. In other Hungarian traditions, Orion&#x27;s belt is known as &quot;Judge&#x27;s stick&quot; (&quot;Bírópálca&quot;).

In Scandinavian tradition, Orion&#x27;s belt was known as &quot;Frigg&#x27;s Distaff&quot; (&quot;friggerock&quot;) or &quot;Freyja&#x27;s distaff&quot;.

The Finns call Orion&#x27;s belt and the stars below it &quot;Väinämöinen&#x27;s scythe&quot; (&quot;Väinämöisen viikate&quot;). Another name for the asterism of Alnilam, Alnitak and Mintaka is &quot;Väinämöinen&#x27;s Belt&quot; (&quot;Väinämöisen vyö&quot;) and the stars &quot;hanging&quot; from the belt as &quot;Kaleva&#x27;s sword&quot; (&quot;Kalevanmiekka&quot;).

In Siberia, the Chukchi people see Orion as a hunter; an arrow he has shot is represented by Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri), with the same figure as other Western depictions.

There are claims in popular media that the Adorant from the Geißenklösterle cave, an ivory carving estimated to be 35,000 to 40,000 years old, is the first known depiction of the constellation. Scholars dismiss such interpretations, saying that perceived details such as a belt and sword derive from preexisting features in the grain structure of the ivory.

===Americas===
The Seri people of northwestern Mexico call the three stars in the belt of Orion &quot;Hapj&quot; (a name denoting a hunter) which consists of three stars: &quot;Hap&quot; (mule deer), &quot;Haamoja&quot; (pronghorn), and &quot;Mojet&quot; (bighorn sheep). &quot;Hap&quot; is in the middle and has been shot by the hunter; its blood has dripped onto Tiburón Island.

The same three stars are known in Spain and most of Latin America as &quot;Las tres Marías&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Three Marys&quot;).
In Puerto Rico, the three stars are known as the &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (Spanish for The three Wise Men).

The Ojibwa (Chippewa) Native Americans call this constellation Kabibona&#x27;kan, the Winter Maker, as its presence in the night sky heralds winter.

To the Lakota Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion&#x27;s Belt) is the spine of a bison. The great rectangle of Orion is the bison&#x27;s ribs; the Pleiades star cluster in nearby Taurus is the bison&#x27;s head; and Sirius in Canis Major, known as Tayamnisinte, is its tail. Another Lakota myth mentions that the bottom half of Orion, the Constellation of the Hand, represented the arm of a chief that was ripped off by the Thunder People as a punishment from the gods for his selfishness. His daughter offered to marry the person who can retrieve his arm from the sky, so the young warrior Fallen Star (whose father was a star and whose mother was human) returned his arm and married his daughter, symbolizing harmony between the gods and humanity with the help of the younger generation. The index finger is represented by Rigel; the Orion Nebula is the thumb; the Belt of Orion is the wrist; and the star Beta Eridani is the pinky finger.

===Austronesian===

The seven primary stars of Orion make up the Polynesian constellation Heiheionakeiki which represents a child&#x27;s string figure similar to a cat&#x27;s cradle. Several precolonial Filipinos referred to the belt region in particular as &quot;balatik&quot; (ballista) as it resembles a trap of the same name which fires arrows by itself and is usually used for catching pigs from the bush. Spanish colonization later led to some ethnic groups referring to Orion&#x27;s belt as &quot;Tres Marias&quot; or &quot;Tatlong Maria.&quot;

In Māori tradition, the star Rigel (known as &quot;Puanga&quot; or &quot;Puaka&quot;) is closely connected with the celebration of Matariki. The rising of Matariki (the Pleiades) and Rigel before sunrise in midwinter marks the start of the Māori year.

In Javanese culture, the constellation is often called &quot;Lintang Waluku&quot; or &quot;Bintang Bajak&quot;, referring to the shape of a paddy field plow.

===Contemporary symbolism===
The imagery of the belt and sword has found its way into popular western culture, for example in the form of the shoulder insignia of the 27th Infantry Division of the United States Army during both World Wars, probably owing to a pun on the name of the division&#x27;s first commander, Major General John F. &quot;O&#x27;Ryan&quot;.

The film distribution company Orion Pictures used the constellation as its logo.

===Depictions===

In artistic renderings, the surrounding constellations are sometimes related to Orion: he is depicted standing next to the river Eridanus with his two hunting dogs Canis Major and Canis Minor, fighting Taurus. He is sometimes depicted hunting Lepus the hare. He sometimes is depicted to have a lion&#x27;s hide in his hand.

There are alternative ways to visualise Orion. From the Southern Hemisphere, Orion is oriented south-upward, and the belt and sword are sometimes called the saucepan or pot in Australia and New Zealand. Orion&#x27;s Belt is called &quot;Drie Konings&quot; (Three Kings) or the &quot;Drie Susters&quot; (Three Sisters) by Afrikaans speakers in South Africa and are referred to as &quot;les Trois Rois&quot; (the Three Kings) in Daudet&#x27;s &quot;Lettres de Mon Moulin&quot; (1866). The appellation &quot;Driekoningen&quot; (the Three Kings) is also often found in 17th- and 18th-century Dutch star charts and seaman&#x27;s guides. The same three stars are known in Spain, Latin America, and the Philippines as &quot;Las Tres Marías&quot; (The Three Marys), and as &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (The three Wise Men) in Puerto Rico.

Even traditional depictions of Orion have varied greatly. Cicero drew Orion in a similar fashion to the modern depiction. The Hunter held an unidentified animal skin aloft in his right hand; his hand was represented by Omicron2 Orionis and the skin was represented by the 5 stars designated Pi Orionis. Kappa and Beta Orionis represented his left and right knees, while Eta and Lambda Leporis were his left and right feet, respectively. As in the modern depiction, Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta represented his belt. His left shoulder was represented by Alpha Orionis, and Mu Orionis made up his left arm. Lambda Orionis was his head and Gamma, his right shoulder. The depiction of Hyginus was similar to that of Cicero, though the two differed in a few important areas. Cicero&#x27;s animal skin became Hyginus&#x27;s shield (Omicron and Pi Orionis), and instead of an arm marked out by Mu Orionis, he holds a club (Chi Orionis). His right leg is represented by Theta Orionis and his left leg is represented by Lambda, Mu, and Epsilon Leporis. Further Western European and Arabic depictions have followed these two models.

==Future==

Orion is located on the celestial equator, but it will not always be so located due to the effects of precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis. Orion lies well south of the ecliptic, and it only happens to lie on the celestial equator because the point on the ecliptic that corresponds to the June solstice is close to the border of Gemini and Taurus, to the north of Orion. Precession will eventually carry Orion further south, and by AD 14000, Orion will be far enough south that it will no longer be visible from the latitude of Great Britain.

Further in the future, Orion&#x27;s stars will gradually move away from the constellation due to proper motion. However, Orion&#x27;s brightest stars all lie at a large distance from the Earth on an astronomical scale—much farther away than Sirius, for example. Orion will still be recognizable long after most of the other constellations—composed of relatively nearby stars—have distorted into new configurations, with the exception of a few of its stars eventually exploding as supernovae, for example Betelgeuse, which is predicted to explode sometime in the next million years.

<text>Murray Bookchin (; January 14, 1921 – July 30, 2006) was an American social theorist, author, orator, historian, and political philosopher. Influenced by G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, and Peter Kropotkin, he was a pioneer in the environmental movement. Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of social ecology and urban planning within anarchist, libertarian socialist, and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and social ecology. Among the most important were &quot;Our Synthetic Environment&quot; (1962), &quot;Post-Scarcity Anarchism&quot; (1971), &quot;The Ecology of Freedom&quot; (1982), and &quot;Urbanization Without Cities&quot; (1987). In the late 1990s, he became disenchanted with what he saw as an increasingly apolitical &quot;lifestylism&quot; of the contemporary anarchist movement, stopped referring to himself as an anarchist, and founded his own libertarian socialist ideology called &quot;communalism&quot;, which seeks to reconcile and expand Marxist, syndicalist, and anarchist thought.

Bookchin was a prominent anti-capitalist, anti-fascist and advocate of social decentralization along ecological and democratic lines. His ideas have influenced social movements since the 1960s, including the New Left, the anti-nuclear movement, the anti-globalization movement, Occupy Wall Street, and more recently, the democratic confederalism of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. He was a central figure in the American green movement. An autodidact who never attended college, he is considered an important left theorist of the twentieth century.

== Biography ==
Bookchin was born in New York City to Nathan Bookchin (born Nacham Wisotsky) and his first wife, Rose (Kalusky) Bookchin, Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His father was from Mazyr (now Belarus) and his mother from Vilnius (Lithuania). He was embarrassed by his given name Mortimore and went by his childhood nickname, Murray. His father adopted the name of a relative, Bukczin, and anglicized it to Bookchin. His parents divorced in 1934. He grew up in the Bronx with his mother, uncle Daniel, and maternal grandmother, Zeitel, a Socialist Revolutionary who imbued him with Russian populist ideas.

After his grandmother&#x27;s death in 1930, he joined the Young Pioneers of America, the Communist youth organization (for children 9 to 14) and the Young Communist League (for youths) in 1935. He attended the Workers School near Union Square, where he studied Marxism. In the late 1930s he broke with Stalinism and gravitated toward Trotskyism, joining the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). In the early 1940s, he worked in a foundry in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he was a trade union organizer and shop steward for the United Electrical Workers as well as a recruiter for the SWP. Within the SWP, he adhered to the Goldman-Morrow faction, which broke away after the war ended. He was an auto worker and UAW member at the time of the great General Motors strike of 1945–46. In 1949, while speaking to a Zionist youth organization at City College, Bookchin met a mathematics student, Beatrice Appelstein, whom he married in 1951. They were married for 12 years and lived together for 35, remaining close friends and political allies for the rest of his life. They had two children, Debbie and Joseph. On religious views, Bookchin was an atheist, but was considered to be tolerant of religious views.

From 1947, Bookchin collaborated with a fellow lapsed Trotskyist, the German expatriate Josef Weber, in New York in the Movement for a Democracy of Content, a group of 20 or so post-Trotskyists who collectively edited the periodical &quot;Contemporary Issues – A Magazine for a Democracy of Content&quot;. &quot;Contemporary Issues&quot; embraced utopianism. The periodical provided a forum for the belief that previous attempts to create utopia had foundered on the necessity of toil and drudgery; but now modern technology had obviated the need for human toil, a liberatory development. To achieve this &quot;post-scarcity&quot; society, Bookchin developed a theory of ecological decentralism. The magazine published Bookchin&#x27;s first articles, including the pathbreaking &quot;The Problem of Chemicals in Food&quot; (1952). In 1958, Bookchin defined himself as an anarchist, seeing parallels between anarchism and environmentalism. His first book, &quot;Our Synthetic Environment,&quot; was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber, in 1962, a few months before Rachel Carson&#x27;s famous &quot;Silent Spring&quot;.

In 1964, Bookchin joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and protested racism at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. During 1964–1967, while living on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, he cofounded and was the principal figure in the New York Federation of Anarchists. His groundbreaking essay &quot;Ecology and Revolutionary Thought&quot; introduced environmentalism and, more specifically, ecology as a concept in radical politics. In 1968, he founded another group that published the influential &quot;Anarchos&quot; magazine, which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and sustainable technologies such as solar and wind energy, and on decentralization and miniaturization. Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the counterculture. His widely republished 1969 essay &quot;Listen, Marxist!&quot; warned Students for a Democratic Society (in vain) against an impending takeover by a Marxist group. &quot;Once again the dead are walking in our midst,&quot; he wrote, &quot;ironically, draped in the name of Marx, the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth century. So the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody, in turn, the October Revolution of 1917 and the civil war of 1918–1920, with its &#x27;class line,&#x27; its Bolshevik Party, its &#x27;proletarian dictatorship,&#x27; its puritanical morality, and even its slogan, &#x27;Soviet power&#x27;&quot;.

In 1969–1970, he taught at the Alternate U, a counter-cultural radical school based on 14th Street in Manhattan. In 1971, he moved to Burlington, Vermont, with a group of friends, to put into practice his ideas of decentralization. In the fall of 1973, he was hired by Goddard College to lecture on technology; his lectures led to a teaching position and to the creation of the Social Ecology Studies program in 1974 and the Institute for Social Ecology (ISE) soon thereafter, of which he became the director. In 1974, he was hired by Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey, where he quickly became a full professor. The ISE was a hub for experimentation and study of appropriate technology in the 1970s. In 1977–78 he was a member of the Spruce Mountain Affinity Group of the Clamshell Alliance. Also in 1977, he published &quot;The Spanish Anarchists&quot;, a history of the Spanish anarchist movement up to the revolution of 1936. During this period, Bookchin briefly forged some ties with the nascent libertarian movement, speaking at a Libertarian Party convention and contributing to a newsletter edited by Karl Hess. Nevertheless, Bookchin rejected the types of libertarianism that advocated unconstrained individualism.

In 1980, Bookchin co-established the New England Anarchist Conference (NEAC) to organize the anarchist movement in the United States. At its first meeting in October 1980, 175 anarchists from the northeastern US and Quebec attended. By the second conference in January 1981 in Somerville, Massachusetts, the NEAC devolved into sectarianism, which moved Bookchin to lose faith in a socialist revolution happening in the US.

During the 1980s, Bookchin engaged in occasional critiques of Bernie Sanders&#x27; mayorship in Burlington. Bookchin criticized Sanders&#x27; politics, claiming he lacked a drive to establish direct democracy, followed a Marxian deprioritization of ecology, and was a “&#x27;centralist&#x27; who narrowly focused on economic growth.&quot; Bookchin and his social ecologist colleagues in the Burlington Greens, which he co-founded with his former wife Bea Bookchin, criticized the Sanders administration for pushing for a luxury condo waterfront redevelopment, which was eventually rejected by Burlington voters. They advocated for a moratorium on growth, a moral economy, and social justice rooted in grassroots democracy.

In 1988, Bookchin and Howie Hawkins founded the Left Green Network &quot;as a radical alternative to U.S. Green liberals&quot;, based around the principles of social ecology and libertarian municipality.

In 1995, Bookchin lamented the decline of American anarchism into primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-Situationism, individual self-expression, and &quot;ad hoc adventurism,&quot; at the expense of forming a social movement. He formally broke with anarchism in 1999, describing himself in 2002 as a &quot;communalist&quot; in a major essay elaborating his late-life views, called &quot;The Communalist Project&quot;.

He continued to teach at the ISE until 2004. Bookchin died of congestive heart failure on July 30, 2006, at his home in Burlington, at the age of 85.

== Thought ==
In addition to his political writings, Bookchin wrote extensively on philosophy, calling his ideas dialectical naturalism. The dialectical writings of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, which articulate a developmental philosophy of change and growth, seemed to him to lend themselves to an organic, environmentalist approach. Although Hegel &quot;exercised a considerable influence&quot; on Bookchin, he was not, in any sense, a Hegelian. His philosophical writings emphasize humanism, rationality, and the ideals of the Enlightenment.

=== General sociological and psychological views ===
Bookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies. In &quot;The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy,&quot; he says that:
My use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a &quot;classless&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot; society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which—even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion—would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.
Bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche:
The objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern Freudians, it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day—not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception.
=== Humanity&#x27;s environmental predicament ===
Bookchin&#x27;s book about humanity&#x27;s collision course with the natural world, &quot;Our Synthetic Environment&quot;, was published six months before Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring.&quot;

Bookchin rejected Barry Commoner&#x27;s belief that the environmental crisis could be traced to technological choices, Paul Ehrlich&#x27;s views that it could be traced to overpopulation, or the even more pessimistic view that traces this crisis to human nature. Rather, Bookchin felt that our environmental predicament is the result of the cancerous logic of capitalism, a system aimed at maximizing profit instead of enriching human lives: &quot;By the very logic of its grow-or-die imperative, capitalism may well be producing ecological crises that gravely imperil the integrity of life on this planet.&quot;

The solution to this crisis, he said, is not a return to hunter-gatherer societies, which Bookchin characterized as xenophobic and warlike. Bookchin likewise opposed &quot;a politics of mere protest, lacking programmatic content, a proposed alternative, and a movement to give people direction and continuity.&quot; He claims we need:...a constant awareness that a given society&#x27;s irrationality is deep-seated, that its serious pathologies are not isolated problems that can be cured piecemeal but must be solved by sweeping changes in the often hidden sources of crisis and suffering—that awareness alone is what can hold a movement together, give it continuity, preserve its message and organization beyond a given generation, and expand its ability to deal with new issues and developments.The answer then lies in communalism, a system encompassing a directly democratic political organization anchored in loosely confederated popular assemblies, decentralization of power, absence of domination of any kind, and replacing capitalism with human-centered forms of production.

=== Social ecology ===

Social ecology is a philosophical theory associated with Bookchin, concerned with the relationship between ecological and social issues. It is not a movement but a theory primarily associated with his thought and elaborated over his body of work. He presents a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third &quot;thinking nature&quot; beyond biochemistry and physiology, which he argues is a more complete, conscious, ethical, and rational nature. Humanity, by this line of thought, is the latest development from the long history of organic development on Earth. Bookchin&#x27;s social ecology proposes ethical principles for replacing a society&#x27;s propensity for hierarchy and domination with that of democracy and freedom.

It emerged from a time in the mid-1960s, under the emergence of both the global environmental and the American civil rights movements, and played a much more visible role from the upward movement against nuclear power by the late 1970s. It presents ecological problems as arising mainly from social problems, in particular from different forms of hierarchy and domination beginning with gerontocracy and patriarchy and extending through various forms of oppression including gender, race, and class status. It seeks to resolve them through the model of a non-hierarchical ecological society based on self-determination at the local level, which opposes the current capitalist system of production and consumption. It aims to set up a moral, decentralized, united society, guided by reason. While Bookchin distanced himself from anarchism later in his life, the philosophical theory of social ecology is often considered to be a form of eco-anarchism.

Bookchin wrote about the effects of urbanization on human life in the early 1960s during his participation in the civil rights and related social movements. He then began to pursue the connection between ecological and social issues, culminating with his best-known book, &quot;The Ecology of Freedom&quot;, which he had developed over a decade. His argument, that human domination and destruction of nature follows from social domination between humans, was a breakthrough position in the growing field of ecology. He writes that life develops from self-organization and evolutionary cooperation (symbiosis). Bookchin wrote of preliterate societies organized around mutual need but ultimately overrun by institutions of hierarchy and domination, such as city-states and capitalist economies, which he attributes uniquely to societies of humans and not communities of animals. He proposes confederation between communities of humans run through democracy rather than through administrative logistics.

Bookchin&#x27;s work, beginning with anarchist writings on the subject in the 1960s, has continuously evolved. Towards the end of the 1990s, he increasingly integrated the principle of communalism, with aspirations more inclined towards institutionalized municipal democracy, which distanced him from certain evolutions of anarchism. Bookchin&#x27;s work draws inspiration from, and expands up, anarchism (mainly Kropotkin), Syndicalism, and Marxism (including the writings of Marx and Engels). Social ecology refuses the pitfalls of a Neo-Malthusian ecology which erases social relationships by replacing them with &quot;natural forces&quot;, but also of a technocratic ecology which considers that environmental progress must rely on technological breakthroughs and that the state will play an integral role in this technological development. According to Bookchin, these two currents depoliticize ecology and mythologize the past and the future.

In May 2016, the first &quot;International Social Ecology Meetings&quot; were organized in Lyon, France, which brought together a hundred radical environmentalists, decreasing figures and libertarians, most of whom came from France, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, but also from the United States, Guatemala and Canada. At the center of the debates: libertarian municipalism as an alternative to the nation state and the need to rethink activism.

==== Kurdish movement ====
Bookchin&#x27;s reflections on social ecology and libertarian municipalism also inspired Abdullah Öcalan, the historical leader of the Kurdish movement, to create the concept of democratic confederalism, which aims to bring together the peoples of the Middle East in a confederation of democratic, multicultural and ecological communes. Adopted by the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) since 2005, Öcalan&#x27;s project represents a major ideological shift away from their previous goal of establishing a Marxist–Leninist state. In addition to the PKK, Öcalan&#x27;s internationalist project was also well received by its Syrian counterpart, the Party of Democratic Union (PYD), which would become the first organization in the world to actually found a society based on the principles of democratic confederalism. On January 6, 2014, the cantons of Rojava, in Syrian Kurdistan, federated into autonomous municipalities, adopting a social contract which established a decentralized non-hierarchical society, based on principles of direct democracy, feminism, ecology, cultural pluralism, participatory politics and economic cooperativism.

=== Municipalism and communalism ===
Bookchin&#x27;s vision of an ecological society is based on highly participatory, grassroots politics, in which municipal communities democratically plan and manage their affairs through popular assembly, a program he called communalism. This democratic deliberation purposefully promotes autonomy and self-reliance, as opposed to centralized state politics. While this program retains elements of anarchism, it emphasizes a higher degree of organization (community planning, voting, and institutions) than general anarchism. In Bookchin&#x27;s communalism, these autonomous municipal communities connect with each other via confederations.

Starting in the 1970s, Bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the municipal level. In 1980 Bookchin used the term &quot;libertarian municipality&quot; to describe a libertarian socialist system in which institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the state with a confederation of free municipalities. In &quot;The Next Revolution&quot;, Bookchin stresses the link that libertarian municipalism has with his earlier philosophy of social ecology. He writes:

Bookchin proposes that these institutional forms must take place within differently scaled local areas. In a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way:

Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers—the municipal confederations and the nation state cannot coexist.

====Municipalization as a foundation for an ecological society====
Bookchin posits that neither privatization nor nationalization can effectively pave the way toward an ecological society. He asserts that both models are deeply embedded in structures of domination, failing to address the root causes of environmental crises. In contrast, Bookchin advocates for municipalization as a core principle in his libertarian municipalist framework

===Critique of privatization and nationalization===
Bookchin critiques private property as a central driver of both social and ecological harm, associating it with exploitation, domination, and the prioritization of profit over community and environmental well-being. According to Bookchin, systems based on private ownership promote competition and individualism, which he argues are incompatible with the cooperation and solidarity needed to build a fair and sustainable society.

Nationalization, often positioned as a remedy to capitalism&#x27;s excesses, is also seen by Bookchin as inadequate. He contends that nationalization typically shifts control from private companies to centralized bureaucratic entities, merely replacing one form of dominance with another. In this state-centered model, the apparatus of the state, rather than the market, assumes authority over economic activities. This can lead to what Bookchin describes as a &quot;privatized economy in a collectivized form,&quot; where workers remain detached from their labor and ecological exploitation persists.

== Legacy and influence ==
Though Bookchin, by his own recognition, failed to win over a substantial body of supporters during his own lifetime, his ideas have nonetheless influenced movements and thinkers across the globe.

Among these are the Kurdish People&#x27;s Protection Units (YPG) and closely aligned Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) in Turkey, which have fought the Turkish state since the 1980s to try to secure greater political and cultural rights for the country&#x27;s Kurds. The PKK is designated as a terrorist organization by the Turkish and United States governments, while the YPG has been considered an ally of the US against ISIS. Though founded on a rigid Marxist–Leninist ideology, the PKK has seen a shift in its thought and aims since the capture and imprisonment of its leader, Abdullah Öcalan, in 1999. Öcalan began reading a variety of post-Marxist political theory while in prison, and found particular interest in Bookchin&#x27;s works.

Öcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with Bookchin through his lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin&#x27;s &quot;student&quot; eager to adapt his thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to accept the request. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message &quot;My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan&#x27;s talents to guide them&quot;. When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as &quot;one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century&quot;, and vowed to put his theory into practice.

&quot;Democratic confederalism&quot;, the variation on communalism developed by Öcalan in his writings and adopted by the PKK, does not outwardly seek Kurdish rights within the context of the formation of an independent state separate from Turkey. The PKK claims that this project is not envisioned as being only for Kurds, but rather for all peoples of the region, regardless of their ethnic, national, or religious background. Rather, it promulgates the formation of assemblies and organizations beginning at the grassroots level to enact its ideals in a non-state framework beginning at the local level. It also places a particular emphasis on securing and promoting women&#x27;s rights. The PKK has had some success in implementing its programme, through organizations such as the Democratic Society Congress (DTK), which coordinates political and social activities within Turkey, and the Koma Civakên Kurdistan (KCK), which does so across all countries where Kurds live.

<text>Back pain (Latin: &quot;dorsalgia&quot;) is pain felt in the back. It may be classified as neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. The lumbar area is the most common area affected. An episode of back pain may be acute, subacute or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate to the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness or weakness in the legs and arms.
The majority of back pain is nonspecific and idiopathic. Common underlying mechanisms include degenerative or traumatic changes to the discs and facet joints, which can then cause secondary pain in the muscles and nerves and referred pain to the bones, joints and extremities. Diseases and inflammation of the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back. Tumors of the vertebrae, neural tissues and adjacent structures can also manifest as back pain.
Back pain is common; approximately nine of ten adults experience it at some point in their lives, and five of ten working adults experience back pain each year. Some estimate that as many of 95% of people will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain and is a major contributor to missed work and disability. For most individuals, back pain is self-limiting. Most people with back pain do not experience chronic severe pain but rather persistent or intermittent pain that is mild or moderate. In most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain-resolution outcomes on average after one year. In the United States, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40% of missed work days. It is the single leading cause of disability worldwide.
==Classification==
Back pain is classified in terms of duration of symptoms.

# Acute back pain lasts &lt;6 weeks
# Subacute back pain lasts between 6 and 12 weeks.
# Chronic back pain lasts for greater than 12 weeks.

==Causes==
There are many causes of back pain, including blood vessels, internal organs, infections, mechanical and autoimmune causes. Approximately 90 percent of people with back pain are diagnosed with nonspecific, idiopathic acute pain with no identifiable underlying pathology. In approximately 10 percent of people, a cause can be identified through diagnostic imaging. Fewer than two percent of cases are attributed to secondary factors, with metastatic cancers and serious infections, such as spinal osteomyelitis and epidural abscesses, accounting for approximately one percent.
=== Nonspecific ===
In as many as 90 percent of cases, no physiological causes or abnormalities on diagnostic tests can be found. Nonspecific back pain can result from back strain or sprains, which can cause peripheral injury to muscle or ligaments. Many patients cannot identify the events or activities that may have caused the strain. The pain can present acutely but in some cases can persist, leading to chronic pain.

Chronic back pain in people with otherwise normal scans can result from central sensitization, in which an initial injury causes a longer-lasting state of heightened sensitivity to pain. This persistent state maintains pain even after the initial injury has healed. Treatment of sensitization may involve low doses of antidepressants and directed rehabilitation such as physical therapy.

=== Spinal disc disease ===
Spinal disc disease occurs when the nucleus pulposus, a gel-like material in the inner core of the vertebral disc, ruptures. Rupturing of the nucleus pulposus can lead to compression of nerve roots. Symptoms may be unilateral or bilateral, and correlate to the region of the spine affected. The most common region for spinal disk disease is at L4–L5 or L5–S1. The risk for lumbar disc disease is increased in overweight individuals because of the increased compressive force on the nucleus pulposus, and is twice as likely to occur in men. A 2002 study found that lifestyle factors such as night-shift work and lack of physical activity can also increase the risk of lumbar disc disease. 

Severe spinal-cord compression is considered a surgical emergency and requires decompression to preserve motor and sensory function. Cauda equina syndrome involves severe compression of the cauda equina and presents initially with pain followed by motor and sensory. Bladder incontinence is seen in later stages of cauda equina syndrome.

=== Degenerative disease ===
Spondylosis, or degenerative arthritis of the spine, occurs when the intervertebral disc undergoes degenerative changes, causing the disc to fail at cushioning the vertebrae. There is an association between intervertebral disc space narrowing and lumbar spine pain. The space between the vertebrae becomes more narrow, resulting in compression and irritation of the nerves.

Spondylolithesis is the anterior shift of one vertebra compared to the neighboring vertebra. It is associated with age-related degenerative changes as well as trauma and congenital anomalies.

Spinal stenosis can occur in cases of severe spondylosis, spondylotheisis and age-associated thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Spinal stenosis involves narrowing of the spinal canal and typically presents in patients greater than 60 years of age. Neurogenic claudication can occur in cases of severe lumbar spinal stenosis and presents with symptoms of pain in the lower back, buttock or leg that is worsened by standing and relieved by sitting.

Vertebral compression fractures occur in four percent of patients presenting with lower back pain. Risk factors include age, female gender, history of osteoporosis, and chronic glucocorticoid use. Fractures can occur as a result of trauma but in many cases can be asymptomatic.

=== Infection ===
Common infectious causes of back pain include osteomyelitis, septic discitis, paraspinal abscess and epidural abscess. Infectious causes that lead to back pain involve various structures surrounding the spine.

Osteomyelitis is the bacterial infection of the bone. Vertebral osteomyelitis is most commonly caused by staphylococci. Risk factors include skin infection, urinary tract infection, IV catheter use, IV drug use, previous endocarditis and lung disease.

Spinal epidural abscess is commonly caused by severe infection with bacteremia. Risk factors include recent administration of epidurals, IV drug use or recent infection.

===Cancer===
Spread of cancer to the bone or spinal cord can lead to back pain. Bone is one of the most common sites of metastatic lesions. Patients typically have a history of malignancy. Common types of cancer that present with back pain include multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, spinal cord tumors, primary vertebral tumors and prostate cancer. Back pain is present in 29% of patients with systemic cancer. Unlike other causes of back pain that commonly affect the lumbar spine, the thoracic spine is most commonly affected. The pain can be associated with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, chills, fever, nausea and vomiting. Unlike other causes of back pain, neoplasm-associated back pain is constant, dull, poorly localized and worsens with rest. Metastasis to the bone also increases the risk of spinal-cord compression or vertebral fractures that require emergency surgical treatment.

=== Autoimmune ===

Inflammatory arthritides such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus can all cause varying levels of joint destruction. Among the inflammatory arthritides, ankylosing spondylitis is most closely associated with back pain because of the inflammatory destruction of the bony components of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis is common in young men and presents with a range of possible symptoms such as uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease.

=== Referred pain ===
Back pain can also be referred from another source. Referred pain occurs when pain is felt at a location different than the source of the pain. Disease processes that can present with back pain include pancreatitis, kidney stones, severe urinary tract infections and abdominal aortic aneurysms.

===Risk factors===
Heavy lifting, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise can increase the risk of back pain. Cigarette smokers are more likely to experience back pain than are nonsmokers. Weight gain in pregnancy is also a risk factor for back pain. In general, fatigue can worsen pain.

A few studies suggest that psychosocial factors such as work-related stress and dysfunctional family relationships may correlate more closely with back pain than do structural abnormalities revealed in X-rays and other medical imaging scans.

Back pain physical effects can range from muscle aching to a shooting, burning, or stabbing sensation. Pain can radiate down the legs and can be increased by bending, twisting, lifting, standing, or walking. While the physical effects of back pain are always at the forefront, back pain also can have psychological effects. Back pain has been linked to depression, anxiety, stress, and avoidance behaviors due to mentally not being able to cope with the physical pain. Both acute and chronic back pain can be associated with psychological distress in the form of anxiety (worries, stress) or depression (sadness, discouragement). Psychological distress is a common reaction to the suffering aspects of acute back pain, even when symptoms are short-term and not medically serious.

==Diagnosis==

Initial assessment of back pain consists of a history and physical examination. Important characterizing features of back pain include location, duration, severity, history of prior back pain and possible trauma. Other important components of the patient history include age, physical trauma, prior history of cancer, fever, weight loss, urinary incontinence, progressive weakness or expanding sensory changes, which can indicate a medically urgent condition.

Physical examination of the back should assess for posture and deformities. Pain elicited by palpating certain structures may be helpful in localizing the affected area. A neurologic exam is needed to assess for changes in gait, sensation and motor function.

Determining if there are radicular symptoms, such as pain, numbness or weakness that radiate down limbs, is important for differentiating between central and peripheral causes of back pain. The straight leg test is a maneuver used to determine the presence of lumbosacral radiculopathy, which occurs when there is irritation in the nerve root that causes neurologic symptoms such as numbness and tingling. Non-radicular back pain is most commonly caused by injury to the spinal muscles or ligaments, degenerative spinal disease or a herniated disc. Disc herniation and foraminal stenosis are the most common causes of radiculopathy.

Imaging of the spine and laboratory tests is not recommended during the acute phase. This assumes that there is no reason to expect that the patient has an underlying problem. In most cases, the pain subsides naturally after several weeks. People who seek diagnosis through imaging are typically less likely to receive a better outcome than are those who wait for the condition to resolve.

=== Imaging ===
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality for the evaluation of back pain and visualization of bone, soft tissue, nerves and ligaments. X-rays are a less costly initial option offered to patients with a low clinical suspicion of infection or malignancy, and they are combined with laboratory studies for interpretation.

Imaging is not warranted for most patients with acute back pain. Without signs and symptoms indicating a serious underlying condition, imaging does not improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Four to six weeks of treatment is appropriate before consideration of imaging studies. If a serious condition is suspected, MRI is usually most appropriate. Computed tomography is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. In cases of acute back pain, MRI is recommended for those with major risk factors or clinical suspicion of cancer, spinal infection or severe progressive neurological deficits. For patients with subacute to chronic back pain, MRI is recommended if minor risk factors exist for cancer, ankylosing spondylitis or vertebral compression fracture, or if significant trauma or symptomatic spinal stenosis is present.

Early imaging studies during the acute phase do not improve care or prognosis. Imaging findings are not correlated with severity or outcome.

=== Laboratory studies ===
Laboratory studies are employed when there are suspicions of autoimmune causes, infection or malignancy. Laboratory testing may include white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
* Elevated ESR could indicate infection, malignancy, chronic disease, inflammation, trauma or tissue ischemia.
* Elevated CRP levels are associated with infection.

Because laboratory testing lacks specificity, MRI with and without contrast media and often, biopsy are essential for accurate diagnosis 

===Red flags===
Imaging is not typically needed in the initial diagnosis or treatment of back pain. However, if there are certain &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms present, plain radiographs (X-ray), CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging may be recommended. These red flags include:
* History of cancer
* Unexplained weight loss
* Immunosuppression
* Urinary infection
* Intravenous drug use
* Prolonged use of corticosteroids
* Back pain not improved with conservative management
* History of significant trauma
* Minor fall or heavy lift in a potentially osteoporotic or elderly individual
* Acute onset of urinary retention, overflow incontinence, loss of anal sphincter tone, or fecal incontinence
* Saddle anesthesia
* Global or progressive motor weakness in the lower limbs

== Prevention ==
Moderate-quality evidence exists that suggests that the combination of education and exercise may reduce an individual&#x27;s risk of developing an episode of low back pain. Lesser-quality evidence points to exercise alone as a possible deterrent to the risk of the condition.

==Management==
=== Nonspecific pain ===
Patients with uncomplicated back pain should be encouraged to remain active and to return to normal activities.

The management goals when treating back pain are to achieve maximal reduction in pain intensity as rapidly as possible, to restore the individual&#x27;s ability to function in everyday activities, to help the patient cope with residual pain, to assess for side effects of therapy and to facilitate the patient&#x27;s passage through the legal and socioeconomic impediments to recovery. For many, the goal is to keep the pain at a manageable level to progress with rehabilitation, which then can lead to long-term pain relief. Also, for some people the goal is to use nonsurgical therapies to manage the pain and avoid major surgery, while for others surgery may represent the quickest path to pain relief.

Not all treatments work for all conditions or for all individuals with the same condition, and many must try several treatment options to determine what works best for them. The present stage of the condition (acute or chronic) is also a determining factor in the choice of treatment. Only a minority of people with back pain (most estimates are 1–10%) require surgery.

====Conservative Care====
Back pain is generally first treated with nonpharmacological therapy, as it typically resolves without the use of medication. Superficial heat and massage, acupuncture and spinal manipulation therapy may be recommended. There is poor evidence for the effectiveness of most interventional treatments (drugs and surgery) for back pain and hence non-interventional treatments should be prioritized in the vast majority of cases.
* Heat therapy is useful for back spasms or other conditions. A review concluded that heat therapy can reduce symptoms of acute and subacute low-back pain.
* Regular activity and gentle stretching exercises is encouraged in uncomplicated back pain and is associated with better long-term outcomes. Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in the abdomen and around the spine may also be recommended. These exercises are associated with better patient satisfaction, although they have not been shown to provide functional improvement. However, one review found that exercise is effective for chronic back pain but not for acute pain. Exercise should be performed under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Supervised walking programs have been shown to be cost-effective at reducing back pain recurrences.
* Massage therapy may provide short-term pain relief, but not functional improvement, for those with acute lower back pain. It may also offer short-term pain relief and functional improvement for those with long-term (chronic) and subacute lower pack pain, but this benefit does not appear to be sustained after six months of treatment. There do not appear to be any serious adverse effects associated with massage.
* Acupuncture may provide some relief for back pain. However, further research with stronger evidence is needed.
* Spinal manipulation appears to provide similar effects to other recommended treatments for chronic low back pain. There is no evidence it is more effective than other therapies or sham, or as an adjunct to other treatments, for acute low back pain
* &quot;Back school&quot; is an intervention that consists of both education and physical exercises. There is no strong evidence supporting the use of back school for treating acute, subacute, or chronic non-specific back pain.
* Insoles appear to be an ineffective treatment intervention.
* While traction for back pain is often used in combination with other approaches, there appears to be little or no impact on pain intensity, functional status, global improvement or return to work.

====Medication====
If nonpharmacological measures are ineffective, medication may be administered. However, caution should be undertaken with medications as long-term results of painkiller usage are worse than short-term.
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are typically attempted first. NSAIDs have been proven more effective than placebo, and are usually more effective than paracetamol (acetaminophen).
* Long-term use of opioids has not been properly tested to determine efficacy for treating chronic lower back pain. For severe back pain not relieved by NSAIDs or acetaminophen, opioids are sometimes used. However, they do not appear to be more effective than placebo. Opioids may not be better than NSAIDs or antidepressants for chronic back pain with regard to pain relief and gain of function. It is almost certain that over-prescription of opiates for conditions like back pain has been as a result of excess pharmaceutical company marketing rather than evidence of benefit, and many thousands of deaths have resulted. Back pain is considered one of the key conditions where opiate painkillers have been over-prescribed leading to the Opioid epidemic.
* Skeletal muscle relaxers may also be used. Their short-term use has been proven effective in the relief of acute back pain. However, the evidence of this effect has been disputed, and these medications do have negative side effects.
* For patients with nerve root pain and acute radiculopathy, there is evidence that a single dose of steroids, such as dexamethasone, may provide pain relief.
* Epidural corticosteroid injection (ESI) is a procedure in which steroid medications are injected into the epidural space. The steroid medications reduce inflammation and thus decrease pain and improve function. ESI has long been used to both diagnose and treat back pain, although recent evidence, including a 2025 clinical practice guideline published in BMJ, recommends against the use of ESI for chronic back pain due to a lack of efficacy.

===Surgery===
Surgery for back pain is typically used as a last resort, when serious neurological deficit is evident. A 2009 systematic review of back surgery studies found that, for certain diagnoses, surgery is moderately better than other common treatments, but the benefits of surgery often decline in the long term.

Surgery may sometimes be appropriate for people with severe myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome. Causes of neurological deficits can include spinal disc herniation, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, tumor, infection, and spinal hematomas, all of which can impinge on the nerve roots around the spinal cord. There are multiple surgical options to treat back pain, and these options vary depending on the cause of the pain.

When a herniated disc is compressing the nerve roots, hemi- or partial-laminectomy or discectomy may be performed, in which the material compressing on the nerve is removed. A multi-level laminectomy can be done to widen the spinal canal in the case of spinal stenosis. A foraminotomy or foraminectomy may also be necessary, if the vertebrae are causing significant nerve root compression. A discectomy is performed when the intervertebral disc has herniated or torn. It involves removing the protruding disc, either a portion of it or all of it, that is placing pressure on the nerve root. Total disc replacement can also be performed, in which the source of the pain (the damaged disc) is removed and replaced, while maintaining spinal mobility. When an entire disc is removed (as in discectomy), or when the vertebrae are unstable, spinal fusion surgery may be performed. Spinal fusion is a procedure in which bone grafts and metal hardware is used to fix together two or more vertebrae, thus preventing the bones of the spinal column from compressing on the spinal cord or nerve roots.

If infection, such as a spinal epidural abscess, is the source of the back pain, surgery may be indicated when a trial of antibiotics is ineffective. Surgical evacuation of spinal hematoma can also be attempted, if the blood products fail to break down on their own.

==Pregnancy==
About 50% of women experience low back pain during pregnancy. Some studies have suggested that women who have experienced back pain before pregnancy are at a higher risk of experiencing back pain during pregnancy. It may be severe enough to cause significant pain and disability in as many as one third of pregnant women. Back pain typically begins at approximately 18 weeks of gestation and peaks between 24 and 36 weeks. Approximately 16% of women who experience back pain during pregnancy report continued back pain years after pregnancy, indicating that those with significant back pain are at greater risk of back pain following pregnancy.

Biomechanical factors of pregnancy shown to be associated with back pain include increased curvature of the lower back, or lumbar lordosis, to support the added weight on the abdomen. Also, the hormone relaxin is released during pregnancy, which softens the structural tissues in the pelvis and lower back to prepare for vaginal delivery. This softening and increased flexibility of the ligaments and joints in the lower back can result in pain. Back pain in pregnancy is often accompanied by radicular symptoms, suggested to be caused by the baby pressing on the sacral plexus and lumbar plexus in the pelvis.

Typical factors aggravating the back pain of pregnancy include standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting and walking. Back pain in pregnancy may also be characterized by pain radiating into the thigh and buttocks, nighttime pain severe enough to wake the patient, pain that is increased at night or pain that is increased during the daytime.

Local heat, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and massage can be used to help relieve pain. Avoiding standing for prolonged periods of time is also suggested.

==Economics==
Although back pain does not typically cause permanent disability, it is a significant contributor to physician visits and missed work days in the United States, and is the single leading cause of disability worldwide. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons report approximately 12 million visits to doctor&#x27;s offices each year are due to back pain. Missed work and disability related to low back pain costs over $50 billion each year in the United States. In the United Kingdom in 1998, approximately £1.6 billion per year was spent on expenses related to disability from back pain.

<text>The Binding of Isaac (), or simply &quot;The Binding&quot; (), is a story from chapter 22 of the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. In the biblical narrative, God orders Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac on the mountain called Jehovah-jireh in the region of Moriah. As Abraham begins to comply, having bound Isaac to an altar, he is stopped by the Angel of the Lord; a ram appears and is slaughtered in Isaac&#x27;s stead, as God commends Abraham&#x27;s pious obedience to offer his son as a human sacrifice.

Especially in art, the episode is often called the Sacrifice of Isaac, although in the end Isaac was not sacrificed. Various scholars suggest that the original story of Abraham and Isaac may have been of a completed human sacrifice, later altered by redactors to substitute a ram for Isaac, while some traditions, including certain Jewish and Christian interpretations, maintain that Isaac actually was sacrificed. In addition to being addressed by modern scholarship, this biblical episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional sources of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

==Biblical narrative==
According to the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice. After Isaac is bound to an altar, a messenger from God stops Abraham before he can complete the sacrifice, saying, &quot;now I know you fear God&quot;. Abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of Isaac.
The passage states that the event occurred at &quot;the mount of the &quot; in &quot;the land of Moriah&quot;. Abraham then named the place &#x27;Jehovah-jireh&#x27; (the Lord will provide). 2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to &quot;mount Moriah&quot; as the site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, while Psalms 24:3, Isaiah 2:3 and 30:29, and Zechariah 8:3 use the term &quot;the mount of the &quot; to refer to the site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem, the location believed to be the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. In the Samaritan Pentateuch, Genesis 22:14, the phrase is taken to mean &quot;in the mountain the Lord was seen&quot;, the mountain being Mount Gerizim.

== Jewish views ==
In &quot;The Binding of Isaac, Religious Murders &amp; Kabbalah&quot;, Lippman Bodoff argues that Abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that God had no intention that he do so. Rabbi Ari Kahn elaborates this view on the Orthodox Union website as follows:

In &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, Maimonides argues that the story of the binding of Isaac contains two &quot;great notions&quot;. First, Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity&#x27;s capability to both love and fear God. Second, because Abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what God had asked him to do, the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same truth value as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty, notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision.
In &quot;Glory and Agony: Isaac&#x27;s Sacrifice and National Narrative&quot;, Yael Feldman argues that the story of Isaac&#x27;s binding, in both its biblical and post-biblical versions (the New Testament included), has had a great impact on the ethos of altruist heroism and self-sacrifice in modern Hebrew national culture. As her study demonstrates, over the last century the &quot;Binding of Isaac&quot; has morphed into the &quot;Sacrifice of Isaac,&quot; connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield.
In &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, Rabbi Louis Ginzberg argues that the binding of Isaac is a way for God to test Isaac&#x27;s claim to Ishmael, and to silence Satan&#x27;s protest about Abraham who had not brought up any offering to God after Isaac was born. It was also to show proof to the world that Abraham is a true God-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of God&#x27;s commands, even to sacrifice his own son:


Jacob Howland has pointed out that &quot;Ginzberg&#x27;s work must be used with caution, because his project fabricating a unified narrative from multiple sources inevitably makes the tradition of rabbinic commentary seem more univocal than it actually is.&quot; Ginzberg&#x27;s work does not encompass the way in which midrash on &#x27;Akedah mirrored the different needs of diverse Jewish communities. Isaac was resurrected after the slaughter in the version of medieval Ashkenaz. Spiegel has interpreted this as designed to recast the biblical figures in the context of the Crusades.

The Book of Genesis does not tell the age of Isaac at the time. Some Talmudic sages teach that Isaac was an adult aged thirty seven, likely based on the next biblical story, which is of Sarah&#x27;s death at 127 years, being 90 when Isaac was born. Isaac&#x27;s reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative. Some commentators have argued that he was traumatized and angry, often citing the fact that he and Abraham are never seen to speak to each other again; however, Jon D. Levenson notes that the biblical text never depicts them speaking before the binding, either.

In the Genesis Apocryphon discovered in the Qumrannic Caves Scrolls (Dead Sea Scrolls) in 1946, Hebrew tribal patriarch Lamech, son of Methuselah converses with Abraham who also speaks in first and third person narratives.

===Use in worship===
The narrative of the sacrifice and binding of Isaac is traditionally read in synagogue on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.

The practice of the Kabbalists, observed in some communities but not all, is to recite this chapter every day immediately after Birkot hashachar.

==Christian views==

The binding of Isaac is mentioned in the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the Old Testament: &quot;By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, &#x27;In Isaac your seed shall be called&#x27;, concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.&quot; (Hebrews 11:17–19, NKJV)

Abraham&#x27;s faith in God is such that he felt God would be able to resurrect the slain Isaac, in order that his prophecy (Genesis 21:12) might be fulfilled. Early Christian preaching sometimes accepted Jewish interpretations of the binding of Isaac without elaborating. For example, Hippolytus of Rome says in his &quot;Commentary on the Song of Songs&quot;, &quot;The blessed Isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world&quot; (&quot;On the Song&quot; 2:15).
Other Christians from the period saw Isaac as a type of the &quot;Word of God&quot; who prefigured Christ. This interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as Abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey (Genesis 22:4), or Abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son Isaac&#x27;s shoulder (Genesis 22:6). Another thing to note is how God reemphasizes Isaac being Abraham&#x27;s one and only son whom he loves (Genesis 22:2, 12, 16). As further support to the view of early Christians that the binding of Isaac foretells the Gospel of Jesus Christ, when the two went up there, Isaac asked Abraham &quot;where is the lamb for the burnt offering&quot; to which Abraham responded &quot;God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.&quot; (Genesis 22:7–8). However, it was a ram (not a lamb) that was ultimately sacrificed in Isaac&#x27;s place, and the ram was caught in a thicket (i.e. thorn bush) (Genesis 22:13). In the New Testament, John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him and said &quot;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world!&quot; (John 1:29). Thus, the binding is compared to the Crucifixion and the last-minute stay of sacrifice is a type of the Resurrection. Søren Kierkegaard describes Abraham&#x27;s actions as arising from the zenith of faith leading to a &quot;teleological suspension of the ethical&quot;.

Francis Schaeffer argues:

==Muslim views==

The version in the Quran differs from that in Genesis in two aspects: the identity of the sacrificed son and the son&#x27;s reaction towards the requested sacrifice. In Islamic sources, when Abraham tells his son about the vision, his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God&#x27;s command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. The son mentioned here is traditionally understood to be Ishmael. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing him. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised to reward Abraham. The next two verses state God also granted Abraham the righteous son Isaac and promised more rewards.

Among early Muslim scholars, there was a dispute over the identity of the son. One side of the argument believed it was Isaac rather than Ishmael (notably ibn Qutaybah and al-Tabari) interpreting the verse &quot;God&#x27;s perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac&quot; as referring to his making Abraham his closest one, and to his rescuing Isaac. The other side held that the promise to Sarah was of a son, Isaac, and a grandson, Jacob (Quran 11:71–74) excluded the possibility of a premature death of Isaac. Regardless, most Muslims believe that it is actually Ishmael rather than Isaac despite the dispute.

The submission of Abraham and his son is celebrated and commemorated by Muslims on the days of Eid al-Adha. During the festival, those who can afford and the ones in the pilgrimage sacrifice a ram, cow, sheep or a camel. Part of the sacrifice meat is eaten by the household and the remainder is distributed to the neighbors and the needy. The festival marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

==Modern research==
The binding also figures prominently in the writings of several of the more important modern theologians, such as Søren Kierkegaard in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; and Shalom Spiegel in &quot;The Last Trial&quot;. Jewish communities regularly review this literature, for instance the 2009 mock trial held by more than 600 members of the University Synagogue of Orange County, California. Derrida also looks at the story of the sacrifice as well as Kierkegaard&#x27;s reading in &quot;The Gift of Death&quot;.

In &quot;Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature&quot;, the literary critic Erich Auerbach considers the Hebrew narrative of the binding of Isaac, along with Homer&#x27;s description of Odysseus&#x27;s scar, as the two paradigmatic models for the representation of reality in literature. Auerbach contrasts Homer&#x27;s attention to detail and foregrounding of the spatial, historical, as well as personal contexts for events to the Bible&#x27;s sparse account, in which virtually all context is kept in the background or left outside of the narrative. As Auerbach observes, this narrative strategy virtually compels readers to add their own interpretations to the text.

===Redactors and narrative purpose===
Modern biblical critics operating under the framework of the documentary hypothesis have ascribed the binding&#x27;s narrative to the biblical source Elohist, on the grounds that it generally uses the specific term () and parallels characteristic E compositions. On that view, the second angelic appearance to Abraham (verses 14–18), praising his obedience and blessing his offspring, is in fact a later Jahwist interpolation to E&#x27;s original account (verses 1–13, 19). This is supported by the style and composition of these verses, as well as by the use of the name Yahweh for the deity.

More recent studies question the analysis of E and J as strictly separate. Coats argues that Abraham&#x27;s obedience to God&#x27;s command in fact necessitates praise and blessing, which he only receives in the second angelic speech. That speech, therefore, could not have been simply inserted into E&#x27;s original account. This has suggested to many that the author responsible for the interpolation of the second angelic appearance left their mark also on the original account (verses 1–13, 19).

It has also been suggested that these traces are in fact the first angelic appearance (verses 11–12), in which the Angel of Yahweh stops Abraham before he kills Isaac. The style and composition of these verses resemble that of the second angelic speech, and Yahweh is used for the deity rather than God. On that reading, in the original E version of the binding Abraham disobeys God&#x27;s command, sacrificing the ram &quot;instead of his son&quot; (verse 13) on his own responsibility and without being stopped by an angel: &quot;And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son; but Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son&quot; (verses 10, 13).

By interpolating the first appearance of the angel, a later redactor shifted responsibility for halting the test from Abraham to the angel (verses 11–12). The second angelic appearance, in which Abraham is rewarded for his obedience (verses 14–18), became necessary due to that shift of responsibility. This analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the binding and the story of Sodom (Genesis 18) in which Abraham asks God whether he will destroy the city without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: &quot;Far be it from you to do such a thing: Shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?&quot; According to this analysis, Abraham&#x27;s question and conversation with God was a rebellion against him and culminates in Abraham&#x27;s disobedience to God, refusing to sacrifice Isaac.

Francesca Stavrakopoulou said that it is possible that the story &quot;contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac&quot;. R. E. Friedman stated that in the original E story, Abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of Isaac, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of JE to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for Isaac. Likewise, Terence Fretheim wrote that &quot;the text bears no specific mark of being a polemic against child sacrifice&quot;. Wojciech Kosior also said that the genealogical snippet (Genesis 22:20–24) contain a hint to an alternative reading where Abraham sacrificed Isaac, since there would be no reason to list all these descendants of Abraham&#x27;s brother.

Interpretations of the text have contradicted the version where a ram is sacrificed. For example, Martin S. Bergmann stated &quot;The Aggadah rabbis asserted that &quot;father Isaac was bound on the altar and reduced to ashes, and his sacrificial dust was cast on Mount Moriah.&quot; A similar interpretation was made in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Margaret Barker said that &quot;Abraham returned to Bersheeba without Isaac&quot; according to Genesis 22:19, a possible sign that he was indeed sacrificed. Barker also said that wall paintings in the ancient Dura-Europos synagogue explicitly show Isaac being sacrificed, followed by his soul traveling to heaven. According to Jon D. Levenson a part of Jewish tradition interpreted Isaac as having been sacrificed. Similarly the German theologians and said that due to the grammatical perfect tense used to describe Abraham&#x27;s sacrifice of Isaac, he did, in fact, follow through with the action.

Rav Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel, said that the climax of the story, commanding Abraham not to sacrifice Isaac, is the whole point: to put an end to, and God&#x27;s total aversion to, the ritual of child sacrifice. According to Irving Greenberg the story of the binding of Isaac symbolizes the prohibition to worship God by human sacrifices, at a time when human sacrifices were the norm worldwide.

===Rite of passage===
It has been suggested that Genesis 22 contains an intrusion of the liturgy of a rite of passage, including mock sacrifice, as commonly found in early and preliterate societies, marking the passage from youth to adulthood.

== Music ==
The Binding of Isaac has inspired multiple pieces of music, including Marc-Antoine Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Sacrificium Abrahae&quot; (H.402, oratorio for soloists, chorus, doubling instruments, and bc; 1680–81), Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Canticle II: Abraham and Isaac&quot;, later adapted for inclusion in the War Requiem, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s Abraham and Isaac, Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Story of Isaac&quot; from the 1969 album &quot;Songs from a Room&quot;, and ”You want it darker” from the 2016 album &#x27;&#x27;You Want it Darker,&quot; eponymous &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; from &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (1965) by Bob Dylan, Sufjan Stevens&#x27; &quot;Abraham&quot; from the album &quot;Seven Swans&quot; (2004), Gilad Hochman&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Akeda&quot; for Solo Viola&quot; (2006), and Anaïs Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Dyin&#x27; Day&quot; from the album &quot;Young Man in America&quot; (2012).

Wilfred Owen&#x27;s poem &quot;The Parable of the Old Man and the Young&quot;, set to music by Benjamin Britten in his War Requiem, ends with the couplet &quot;But the old man would not so, but slew his son, And half the seed of Europe, one by one.&quot;

== Comparative ==
=== Greece: Toneia ===
The myth at the Heraion of Samos is that of Hera. According to the local tradition, the goddess was born under a &quot;lygos&quot; tree (&quot;Vitex agnus-castus&quot;, the &quot;chaste-tree&quot;). At the annual Samian festival called the &quot;Toneia&quot;, the &quot;binding&quot;, the cult image of Hera was ceremonially bound with &quot;lygos&quot; branches, before being carried down to the sea to be washed. The tree still featured on the coinage of Samos in Roman times and Pausanias mentions that the tree still stood in the sanctuary.

<text>Henry III of Castile (4 October 1379 – 25 December 1406), called the Suffering due to his ill health (, ), was the son of John I and Eleanor of Aragon. He succeeded his father as King of Castile in 1390.

== Birth and education ==
Henry was born in Burgos, the capital of Castile, the first-born child of the recently crowned king John I of Castile and his wife Eleanor of Aragon. His younger brother Ferdinand grew up to become king of Aragon.

His upbringing was entrusted to Inés Lasso de la Vega, the wife of John Niño. As a child he was educated by Diego de Anaya Maldonado, Bishop of Tui-Vigo, who later became Archbishop of Seville. His tutor was Juan Hurtado de Mendoza el Limpio and his confessor was the Dominican Alonso de Cusanza, who later became Bishop of Salamanca and León.

== Prince of Asturias ==
At the time of his wedding, he received the title Prince of Asturias with the approval of the court of Briviesca. This title designated him as the heir apparent. He was the first person to hold this title, with earlier heirs to the throne being known as &quot;infantes mayores&quot;.

In 1390, his father considered abdicating in his favour to gain the recognition of the Portuguese, but he was dissuaded from this plan by his council. They were against it because of the damage caused to the kingdom by earlier similar decisions. However, in October of the same year, King John died in Alcalá de Henares by falling off his horse, and Henry was proclaimed king.

He assumed power on 2 August 1393, at the age of 13, during a tumultuous period of changes in the regency.

== Reign ==
Despite his nickname, King Henry III engaged in a vigorous foreign policy and manoeuvres during the first few years of the 15th century. He was able to pacify the nobility and restore royal power.

Henry III was supported by the aristocracy and displaced their most powerful relatives (such as Alfonso Enríquez and his aunt, Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre). He repealed privileges granted by his predecessors at the Court of Castile, such as the alcabala (a heavy sales tax) and the right to attend the council. He increased the number of city magistrates and cleaned up the kingdom&#x27;s economy. He reduced persecution of the Jews and passed various bills against the violence, which had become particularly bad by 1391.

During King Henry&#x27;s reign, the Castilian fleet won several victories against the English; Henry III sent a naval fleet in 1399 that destroyed Tétouan in North Africa, a pirate base. In 1402, he began the colonisation of the Canary Islands, sending French explorer Jean de Béthencourt to do so. In 1396, he deflected a Portuguese invasion with an attack on Badajoz, finally signing a peace treaty with his brother-in-law, King John I of Portugal, on 15 August 1402.

Henry III also sent Payo Gómez de Sotomayor and Hernán Sánchez de Palazuelos, and later on 21 May 1403, Ruy González de Clavijo, as ambassadors to Timur to discuss the possibility of an alliance between the Timurid Empire and Castile against the Ottoman Empire. The latter recounted his travels in a book, Embajada a Tamorlán.

Henry III supported the papal pretension of Antipope Benedict XIII. He restarted the conflict against the kingdom of Granada, winning a victory at the Battle of Collejares, near Úbeda, which freed the town in 1406. However his untimely death later in that same year prevented him from completing this campaign. In 1406, King Henry built a pavilion (hunting lodge) on Mount El Pardo because of abundant game there. The lodge would later be transformed into the Royal Palace of El Pardo by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who would rule as King of Spain.

Due to Henry III&#x27;s poor health, he delegated part of his power to his brother King Ferdinand I of Aragon in the later part of his reign, who became regent while his son John II of Castile was too young to rule.

King Henry III died in the city of Toledo on 25 December 1406, while preparing a campaign against the Emirate of Granada.

== Tomb ==

After his death, Henry&#x27;s body was taken to the city of Toledo, where he was interred in a tomb in the Chapel of the New Monarchs of the Cathedral of Toledo, and his remains are still there today. The tomb is located above the choir stalls on the Gospel side and is in the Plateresque style. The box part is decorated with the shields of Castile and León, and the lower interior has three panels decorated with trophies. Above the three panels two cherubs hold a plaque on which is engraved the Monarch&#x27;s epitaph in medieval Spanish:
There is a recumbent statue of Henry III over the tomb, made in polychrome alabaster. Henry appears clothed in a Franciscan habit, although his hands are holding his sword in his girdle, which runs parallel to the Cordón de San Francisco. The king&#x27;s head in his crown rests on three rich cushions, and his feet are bare. Four kneeling angels are at the corners of the statue.

== Marriage and issue ==
Shortly after his birth, he was promised to be married to Beatrice of Portugal, the heir to the Portuguese throne. This was part of a peace treaty between Castile and Portugal, who had signed a truce after the Ferdinand Wars. But this marriage did not happen. Instead, Beatrice married his father, who would instigate a war of succession with John of Aviz.

On 17 September 1388, as part of the Treaty of Bayonne, Henry married Catherine of Lancaster (1372–1418), the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Constance of Castile, who was the elder daughter of King Peter. This ended a dynastic conflict and solidified the House of Trastámara. Their marriage ceremony took place in Palencia Cathedral and they had:

* Maria (1401–1458), wife of Alfonso V of Aragon and Queen of Aragon
* Catherine (1403–1439), wife of Infante Henry, Duke of Villena
* John II (1405–1454), King of Castile

<doc id="153825" wikidata="Q456012" url="?curid=153825" title="Chinese literature">
<text>The history of Chinese literature extends thousands of years, and begins with the earliest recorded inscriptions, court archives, building to the major works of philosophy and history written during the Axial Age. The Han (202 BC220 AD) and Tang (618–907 AD) dynasties were considered golden ages of poetry, while the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1271–1368) were notable for their lyrics (&quot;ci&quot;), essays, dramas, and plays. During the Ming and Qing, mature novels were written in written vernacular Chinese, an evolution from the preeminence of Literary Chinese patterned off the language of the Chinese classics. The introduction of widespread woodblock printing during the Tang and the invention of movable type printing by Bi Sheng (990–1051) during the Song rapidly spread written knowledge throughout China. Around the turn of the 20th century, the author Lu Xun (1881–1936) is considered an influential voice of vernacular Chinese literature.

== Pre-classical period ==
Formation of the earliest layer of Chinese literature was influenced by oral traditions of different social and professional provenance: cult and lay musical practices (&quot;Shijing&quot;), divination (&quot;Yi jing&quot;, &quot;Guicang&quot; and &quot;Lianshan&quot;), astronomy, ritual (&quot;Etiquette and Ceremonial&quot;), exorcism, etc. An attempt at tracing the genealogy of Chinese literature to religious spells and incantations (the six &quot;zhu&quot; 六祝, as presented in the &quot;Da zhu&quot; chapter of the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;) was made by Liu Shipei.

== Classical texts ==

There is a wealth of early Chinese literature dating from the Hundred Schools of Thought that occurred during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 BC). The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism, of Daoism, of Mohism, of Legalism, as well as works of military science and Chinese history. Note that, except for the books of poems and songs, most of this literature is philosophical and didactic; there is little in the way of fiction. However, these texts maintained their significance through both their ideas and their prose style.

The Confucian works in particular have been of high importance to Chinese culture and history, as a set of works known as the &quot;Four Books and Five Classics&quot; were, in the 12th century AD, chosen as the basis for the Imperial examination for any government post. These nine books therefore became the center of the educational system. They have been grouped into two categories: the &quot;Five Classics&quot;, allegedly commented and edited by Confucius, and the Four Books. The &quot;Five Classics&quot; are:
# the &quot;I Ching&quot;, or &quot;Classic of Changes&quot;, a divination manual;
# the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, a collection of poems, folk songs, festival and ceremonial songs, hymns and eulogies;
# the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; or &quot;Record of Rites&quot;;
# the &quot;Book of documents&quot;, an early Chinese prose collection of documents and speeches allegedly written by rulers and officials of the early Zhou period and earlier;
# the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, a historical record of Confucius&#x27; native state, Lu, from 722 to 479 BC.

The &quot;Four Books&quot; are:
# the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot;, a book of pithy sayings attributed to Confucius and recorded by his disciples;
# the &quot;Mencius&quot;, a collection of political dialogues;
# the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, a book that teaches the path to Confucian virtue; and
# the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, a book about education, self-cultivation and the Dao.

Other important philosophical works include the Mohist &quot;Mozi&quot;, which taught &quot;inclusive love&quot; as both an ethical and social principle, and &quot;Hanfeizi&quot;, one of the central Legalist texts.

Important Daoist classics include the &quot;Dao De Jing&quot;, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, and the &quot;Liezi&quot;. Later authors combined Daoism with Confucianism and Legalism, such as Liu An (2nd century BC), whose &quot;Huainanzi&quot; (&quot;The Philosophers of Huai-nan&quot;) also added to the fields of geography and topography.

Among the classics of military science, &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu (6th century BC) was perhaps the first to outline guidelines for effective international diplomacy. It was also the first in a tradition of Chinese military treatises, such as the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; (&quot;Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques&quot;, 1044 AD) and the &quot;Huolongjing&quot; (&quot;Fire Dragon Manual&quot;, 14th century AD).

== Historical texts, dictionaries and encyclopedias ==

The Chinese kept consistent and accurate court records, and although their calendars varied from court to court, these disparate records could be aligned without evident contradiction by the year 841 BC, at the beginning of the Gonghe Regency of the Western Zhou dynasty. The earliest known narrative history of China was the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, which was compiled no later than 389 BC, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BC historian Zuo Qiuming. The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; is thought to have been compiled as far back as the 6th century BC, and was certainly compiled by the 4th century BC, the latest date for the writing of the Guodian Chu Slips unearthed in a Hubei tomb in 1993. The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; included early information on geography in the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; chapter. The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; found in 281 AD in the tomb of the King of Wei, who was interred in 296 BC, provide another example; however, unlike the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, the authenticity of the early date of the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; is in doubt. Another early text was the political strategy book of the &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;, compiled between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC, with partial amounts of the text found amongst the 2nd century BC tomb site at Mawangdui. The oldest extant dictionary in China is the &quot;Erya&quot;, dated to the 3rd century BC, anonymously written but with later commentary by the historian Guo Pu (276–324). Other early dictionaries include the &quot;Fangyan&quot; by Yang Xiong (53 BC – 18 AD) and the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; by Xu Shen (58–147 AD). One of the largest was the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot; compiled by 1716 under the auspices of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722); it provides definitions for over 47,000 characters.

Although court records and other independent records existed beforehand, the definitive work in early Chinese historical writing was the &quot;Shiji&quot;, or &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; written by Han dynasty court historian Sima Qian (145 BC – 90 BC). This groundbreaking text laid the foundation for Chinese historiography and the many official Chinese historical texts compiled for each dynasty thereafter. Sima Qian is often compared to the Greek Herodotus in scope and method, because he covered Chinese history from the mythical Xia dynasty until the contemporary reign of Emperor Wu of Han while retaining an objective and non-biased standpoint. This was often difficult for the official dynastic historians, who used historical works to justify the reign of the current dynasty. He influenced the written works of many Chinese historians, including the works of Ban Gu and Ban Zhao in the 1st and 2nd centuries, and even Sima Guang&#x27;s 11th-century compilation of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, presented to Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1084 AD. The overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, created for each successive Chinese dynasty up until the Ming dynasty (1368–1644); China&#x27;s last dynasty, the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), is not included.

Large encyclopedias were also produced in China through the ages. The &quot;Yiwen Leiju&quot; encyclopedia was completed by Ouyang Xun in 624 during the Tang dynasty, with aid from scholars Linghu Defen and Chen Shuda. During the Song dynasty, the compilation of the Four Great Books of Song (10th century – 11th century), begun by Li Fang and completed by Cefu Yuangui, represented a massive undertaking of written material covering a wide range of different subjects. This included the &quot;Taiping Guangji&quot; (978), the &quot;Taiping Yulan&quot; (983), the &quot;Wenyuan Yinghua&quot; (986), and the &quot;Cefu Yuangui&quot; (1013). Although these Song dynasty Chinese encyclopedias featured millions of written Chinese characters each, their aggregate size paled in comparison to the later &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; (1408) of the Ming dynasty, which contained a total of 50 million Chinese characters. Even this size was trumped by later Qing dynasty encyclopedias, such as the printed the &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot; (1726), which featured over 100 million written Chinese characters in over 800,000 pages, printed in 60 different copies using copper-metal Chinese movable type printing. Other great encyclopedic writers include the polymath scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, the agronomist and inventor Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) and his &quot;Nongshu&quot;, and the minor scholar-official Song Yingxing (1587–1666) and his &quot;Tiangong Kaiwu&quot;.

== Classical poetry ==
The rich tradition of Chinese poetry began with two influential collections. In northern China, the &quot;Shijing&quot; or &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (approx. 11th–7th century BC) comprises over 300 poems in a variety of styles ranging from those with a strong suggestion of folk music to ceremonial hymns. The word &quot;shi&quot; has the basic meaning of poem or poetry, as well as its use in criticism to describe one of China&#x27;s lyrical poetic genres. Confucius is traditionally credited with editing the &quot;Shijing&quot;. Its stately verses are usually composed of couplets with lines of four characters each (or four syllables, as Chinese characters are monosyllabic), and a formal structure of end rhymes. Many of these early poems establish the later tradition of starting with a description of nature that leads into emotionally expressive statements, known as &quot;bi&quot;, , or sometime . Associated with what was then considered to be southern China, the &quot;Chuci&quot; is ascribed to Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC) and his follower Song Yu (fl. 3rd century BC) and is distinguished by its more emotionally intense affect, often full of despair and descriptions of the fantastic. In some of its sections, the &quot;Chu Ci &quot; uses a six-character per line meter, dividing these lines into couplets separated in the middle by a strong caesura, producing a driving and dramatic rhythm. Both the &quot;Shijing&quot; and the &quot;Chuci&quot; have remained influential throughout Chinese history.

During the greater part of China&#x27;s first great period of unification, begun with the short-lived Qin dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC) and followed by the centuries-long Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), the &quot;shi&quot; form of poetry underwent little innovation. But a distinctively descriptive and erudite &quot;fu&quot; form (not the same &quot;fu&quot; character as that used for the bureau of music) developed that has been called &quot;rhyme-prose&quot;, a uniquely Han offshoot of Chinese poetry&#x27;s tradition. Equally noteworthy is Music Bureau poetry (&quot;yuefu&quot;), collected and presumably refined popular lyrics from folk music. The end of the Han witnesses a resurgence of the &quot;shi&quot; poetry, with the anonymous &quot;19 Old Poems&quot;. This collection reflects the emergence of a distinctive five-character line that later became &quot;shi&quot; poetry&#x27;s most common line length. From the Jian&#x27;an reign period (196 – 220 AD) onward, the five-character line became a focus for innovations in style and theme. The Cao family, rulers of the Wei dynasty (220 – 265 AD) during the post-Han Three Kingdoms period, distinguished themselves as poets by writing poems filled with sympathy for the day-to-day struggles of soldiery and the common people. Taoist philosophy became a different, common theme for other poets, and a genre emphasizing true feeling emerged led by Ruan Ji (210–263). The landscape genre of Chinese nature poetry emerged under the brush of Xie Lingyun (385–433), as he innovated distinctively descriptive and complementary couplets composed of five-character lines. A farmland genre was born in obscurity by Tao Qian (365–427) also known as Tao Yuanming as he labored in his fields and then wrote extolling the influence of wine. Toward the close of this period in which many later-developed themes were first experimented with, the Xiao family of the Southern Liang dynasty (502–557) engaged in highly refined and often denigrated court-style poetry lushly describing sensual delights as well as the description of objects.

Reunified China&#x27;s Tang dynasty (618–907) high culture set a high point for many things, including poetry. Various schools of Buddhism (a religion from India) flourished as represented by the Chan (or Zen) beliefs of Wang Wei (701–761). His quatrains (&quot;jueju&quot;) describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line. Tang poetry&#x27;s big star is Li Bai (701–762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse () as well as the tonally regulated new style verse (&quot;jintishi&quot;). Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712–770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it. A parade of great Tang poets also includes Chen Zi&#x27;ang (661–702), Wang Zhihuan (688–742), Meng Haoran (689–740), Bai Juyi (772–846), Li He (790–816), Du Mu (803–852), Wen Tingyun (812–870), (listed chronologically) and Li Shangyin (813–858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure, and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu, now ranked alongside Li Bai. The distinctively different &quot;ci&quot; poetry form began its development during the Tang as Central Asian and other musical influences flowed through its cosmopolitan society.

China&#x27;s Song dynasty (960–1279), another reunification era after a brief period of disunity, initiated a fresh high culture. Several of its greatest poets were capable government officials as well including Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Su Shi (1037–1101), and Wang Anshi (1021–1086). The &quot;ci&quot; form flourished as a few hundred songs became standard templates for poems with distinctive and variously set meters. The free and expressive style of Song high culture has been contrasted with majestic Tang poems by centuries of subsequent critics who engage in fierce arguments over which dynasty had the best poetry. Additional musical influences contributed to the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s (1279–1368) distinctive &quot;qu&quot; opera culture and spawned the &quot;sanqu&quot; form of individual poems based on it.

Classical Chinese poetry composition became a conventional skill of the well-educated throughout the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. Over a million poems have been preserved, including those by women, such as Dong Xiaowan and Liu Rushi, and by many other diverse voices. Painter-poets, such as Shen Zhou (1427–1509), Tang Yin (1470–1524), Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), and Yun Shouping (1633–1690), created worthy conspicuous poems as they combined art, poetry and calligraphy with brush on paper. Poetry composition competitions were socially common, as depicted in novels, for example over dessert after a nice dinner. The Song versus Tang debate continues through the centuries. While China&#x27;s later imperial period does not seem to have broken new ground for innovative approaches to poetry, picking through its vast body of preserved works remains a scholarly challenge, so new treasures may yet be restored from obscurity.

== Classical prose ==

Early Chinese prose was deeply influenced by the great philosophical writings of the Hundred Schools of Thought (770–221 BC). The works of Mozi, Mencius, and Zhuang Zhou contain well-reasoned, carefully developed discourses that reveal much stronger organization and style than their predecessors. Mozi&#x27;s polemic prose was built on solid and effective methodological reasoning. Mencius contributed elegant diction and, like Zhuang Zhou, relied on comparisons, anecdotes, and allegories. By the 3rd century BC, these writers had developed a simple, concise and economical style that served as a model literary form for over two millennia. These were written in Classical Chinese, which mostly represented the spoken language during the Spring and Autumn period.

During the Tang dynasty, the ornate, artificial style of prose developed in previous periods was replaced by a simple, direct, and forceful prose based on examples from the Hundred Schools and the Han dynasty, the period in which the great historical works of Sima Tan and Sima Qian were published. This neoclassical style dominated prose writing for the next 800 years. It was exemplified in the work of Han Yu (768–824), a master essayist and strong advocate of a return to Confucian orthodoxy; Han Yu was later listed as one of the &quot;Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song&quot;.

The Song dynasty saw the rise in popularity of &quot;travel record literature&quot; (&quot;youji wenxue&quot;). Travel literature combined both diary and narrative prose formats, it was practised by seasoned travellers like Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641), and can be seen in the example of Su Shi&#x27;s &quot;Record of Stone Bell Mountain&quot;.

After the 14th century, vernacular fiction became popular, at least outside of court circles. Vernacular fiction covered a broader range of subject matter and was longer and more loosely structured than literary fiction. One of the masterpieces of Chinese vernacular fiction is the 18th-century domestic novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;.

=== Classical fiction and drama ===

Chinese fiction was rooted in the official histories and such less formal works as &quot;A New Account of the Tales of the World&quot; and &quot;In Search of the Supernatural&quot; (4th and 5th centuries); &quot;Finest Flowers from the World of Letters&quot;, a 10th-century compilation of earlier works; &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot; completed by a pilgrim to India named Xuanzang in 646; &quot;Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang&quot;, the best known collection of Literary Chinese &quot;chuanqi&quot; from the Tang dynasty; and the &quot;Taiping Guangji&quot;, which preserved the corpus of these Tang dynasty tales. There was a range of less formal works either oral or using oral conventions, such as &quot;bianwen&quot;, &quot;pingshu&quot;, and &quot;huaben&quot;, which formed background to the novel as early as the Song dynasty. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th–18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and Chinese authors generally did not present their works as fictional. Readers appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, relative emphasis on group behavior, and welfare of the society.

With the rise of monetary economy and urbanization beginning in the Song dynasty, there was a growing professionalization of entertainment fostered by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy and education. In both China and Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late Ming dynasty and early Qing dynasty was varied, self-conscious, and experimental.

== Modern literature ==

Scholars now tend to agree that modern Chinese literature did not erupt suddenly in the New Culture Movement (1910s–1920s). Instead, they trace its origins back at least to the late Qing period (1895–1911) and at most to the 17th century.

=== Late Qing (1895–1911) ===
The late Qing was a period of intellectual ferment sparked by a sense of national crisis. Intellectuals began to seek solutions to China&#x27;s problems outside of its own tradition. They translated works of Western expository writing and literature, which enthralled readers with new ideas and opened up windows onto new exotic cultures. Most outstanding were the translations of Yan Fu (嚴復) (1864–1921) and Lin Shu (林紓) (1852–1924). In this climate, a boom in the writing of fiction occurred, especially after the 1905 abolition of the civil service examination when literati struggled to fill new social and cultural roles for themselves. Stylistically, this fiction shows signs of both the Chinese novelistic tradition and Western narrative modes. In subject matter, it is strikingly concerned with the contemporary: social problems, historical upheaval, changing ethical values, etc. In this sense, late Qing fiction is modern. Important novelists of the period include Wu Woyao (吳沃堯) (1866–1910), Li Boyuan (李伯元) (1867–1906), Liu E (劉鶚) (1857–1909), and Zeng Pu (曾樸) (1872–1935).

The late Qing also saw a &quot;revolution in poetry&quot; (詩界革命), which promoted experimentation with new forms and the incorporation of new registers of language. However, the poetry scene was still dominated by the adherents to the Tongguang School (named after the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns of the Qing), whose leaders—Chen Yan (陳衍), Chen Sanli (陳三立), Zheng Xiaoxu (鄭孝胥), and Shen Zengzhi (沈曾植)—promoted a Song style in the manner of Huang Tingjian. These poets would become the objects of scorn by New Culturalists like Hu Shih, who saw their work as overly allusive, artificial, and divorced from contemporary reality.

In drama, the late Qing saw the emergence of the new &quot;civilized drama&quot; (文明戲), a hybrid of Chinese operatic drama with Western-style spoken drama. Peking opera and &quot;reformed Peking opera&quot; were also popular at the time.

=== Republican Era (1912–49) ===
The literary scene in the first few years before the collapse of the Qing in 1911 was dominated by popular love stories, some written in the classical language and some in the vernacular. This entertainment fiction would later be labeled &quot;Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies&quot; fiction by New Culturalists, who despised its lack of social engagement. Throughout much of the Republican era, Butterfly fiction would reach many more readers than its &quot;progressive&quot; counterpart.

In the course of the New Culture Movement during the 1910s and 1920s decades, the vernacular language largely displaced the classical in all areas of literature and writing. Literary reformers Hu Shih (1891–1962) and Chen Duxiu (1880–1942) declared the classical language &quot;dead&quot; and promoted the vibrant vernacular in its stead. Hu Shih once said, &quot;A dead language can never produce a living literature.&quot; In terms of literary practice, Lu Xun (1881–1936) is usually said to be the first major stylist in the new vernacular prose that Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu were promoting. Another female writer who, in the words of scholar Nicole Huang, &quot;persistently experimented with new literary language&quot; is Eileen Chang.

Though often said to be less successful than their counterparts in fiction writing, poets also experimented with the vernacular in new poetic forms, such as free verse and the sonnet. Given that there was no tradition of writing poetry in the vernacular, these experiments were more radical than those in fiction writing and also less easily accepted by the reading public. Modern poetry flourished especially in the 1930s, in the hands of poets like Zhu Xiang (朱湘), Dai Wangshu, Li Jinfa (李金發), Wen Yiduo, and Ge Xiao (葛蕭). Other poets, even those among the May Fourth radicals (e.g., Yu Dafu), continued to write poetry in classical styles.

May Fourth radicalism, combined with changes in the education system, made possible the emergence of a large group of women writers. While there had been women writers in the late imperial period and the late Qing, they had been few in number. These writers generally tackled domestic issues, such as relations between the sexes, family, friendship and war, Eileen Chang&#x27;s writing uses the spatial specificities of the modern apartment as essential to the construction of a vision of life in wartime. But they were revolutionary in giving direct expression to female subjectivity. Ding Ling&#x27;s story &quot;Miss Sophia&#x27;s Diary&quot; exposes the thoughts and feelings of its female diarist in all their complexity.

In the Republican period, the female literary archetypes of the &quot;New Woman&quot; and the &quot;Modern Girl&quot; developed as a response to the Confucian ideal of &quot;good wives&quot; and &quot;wise mothers.&quot; Depictions of these new feminine archetypes often varied significantly between female and male writers. In literature written by women, the Modern Girl represented the struggle women confronted in establishing their voices in a changing China. These Modern Girls were sometimes disillusioned with modernity. Male-authored works often portrayed the Modern Girl as a &quot;femme fatale&quot; who rejected chastity in favor of bodily pleasure and consumerism. The &quot;New Woman&quot; frequently emphasized nationalistic themes. Both of these archetypes appeared in literature dealing with debates over birth control and abortion in China.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of spoken drama. Most outstanding among playwrights of the day are Ouyang Yuqian, Hong Shen, Tian Han, and Cao Yu. More popular than this Western-style drama, however, was Peking opera, raised to new artistic heights by the likes of Mei Lanfang.

In these decades, mass-appeal fiction which elites deemed culturally insignificant became known as &quot;butterfly fiction,&quot; a label largely equivalent to the English phrase low-brow fiction.

In the late 1920s and 1930s, literary journals and societies espousing various artistic theories proliferated. Among the major writers of the period were Guo Moruo (1892–1978), a poet, historian, essayist, and critic; Mao Dun (1896–1981), the first of the novelists to emerge from the League of Left-Wing Writers and one whose work reflected the revolutionary struggle and disillusionment of the late 1920s; satirist and novelist Lao She (1899–1966); and Ba Jin (1904–2005), a novelist whose work was influenced by Ivan Turgenev and other Russian writers. In the 1930s Ba Jin produced a trilogy that depicted the struggle of modern youth against the age-old dominance of the Confucian family system. Comparison often is made between &quot;Jia&quot; (Family), one of the novels in the trilogy, and &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. Many of these writers became important as administrators of artistic and literary policy after 1949. Most of those authors who were still alive during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) were either purged or forced to submit to public humiliation.

The League of Left-Wing Writers founded in 1930 included Lu Xun among its leadership. By 1932 it had adopted the Soviet doctrine of socialist realism; that is, the insistence that art must concentrate on contemporary events in a realistic way, exposing the ills of nonsocialist society and promoting a glorious future under communism.

Other styles of literature were at odds with the highly-political literature being promoted by the League. The &quot;New Sensationists&quot; (新感覺派)—a group of writers based in Shanghai who were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism—wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Most important among these writers were Mu Shiying, Liu Na&#x27;ou (劉吶鷗), and Shi Zhecun. Other writers, including Shen Congwen and Fei Ming (廢名), balked at the utilitarian role for literature by writing lyrical, almost nostalgic, depictions of the countryside. Lin Yutang, who had studied at Harvard and Leipzig, introduced the concept of &quot;youmo&quot; (humor), which he used in trenchant criticism of China&#x27;s political and cultural situation before leaving for the United States.

Themes of &quot;revolution plus love&quot; became a left-wing literary fashion during the 1930s, although it was also criticized from the left including by Mao Dun. In this narrative formula, the story begins with conflict between the revolutionary mission and romantic love, followed by calls for the protagonists to devote themselves to revolution and set aside their personal feelings, and ultimately results in the couple working together for the revolution in a form of love itself. As described by academic David Der-Wei Wang, &quot;[R]evolution plus love functioned both as a literary trope, titillating and sustaining a society&#x27;s desire for self-reform, and as a political mandate, calling for the redisposition of the social body in both public and personal spheres.&quot;

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, there was a revival of writing classical-style poetry.

The Chinese Communist Party had established a base after the Long March in Yan&#x27;an. In 1942, Mao Zedong gave a series of lectures called &quot;Talks at the Yan&#x27;an Forum on Art and Literature&quot; that clearly made literature subservient to politics via the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement. The Yan&#x27;an Talks articulated the view that socialist literature should not merely reflect existing culture, but should help culturally produce the consciousness of a new society. Mao articulated five independent although related categories of creative consideration for socialist cultural production: (1) class stand, (2) attitude, (3) audience, (4) work style, and (5) popularization/massification. The Yan&#x27;an Talks would become the national guideline for culture after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Consistent with political goals of mobilizing the masses, literary depictions of Party cadres became important. Literature of the period represented good cadres as those who took the lead on the road to socialism while adopting a theme of antibureaucratism to criticize cadres who sought special privileges.

=== Maoist Era (1949–76) ===
After coming to power in 1949, the Communists gradually nationalized the publishing industry, centralized the book distribution system, and brought writers under institutional control through the Writers Union. A system of strict censorship was implemented, with Mao&#x27;s Yan&#x27;an Talks as the guiding force. Periodic literary campaigns targeted figures such as Hu Shih and other figures from the New Culture period, especially Hu Feng, a protege of Lu Xun who, along with his wife Mei Zhi, did not toe the Party line on literature. Socialist realism became the uniform style, and many Soviet works were translated.

The ability to satirize and expose the evils in contemporary society that had made writers useful to the Chinese Communist Party before its accession to power was no longer welcomed. Party cultural leaders such as Zhou Yang used Mao&#x27;s call to have literature &quot;serve the people&quot; to mount attacks on &quot;petty bourgeois idealism&quot; and &quot;humanitarianism&quot;. This conflict came to a head in the Hundred Flowers Campaign (1956–57). Mao Zedong initially encouraged writers to speak out against problems in the new society. Having learned the lessons of the anti-Hu Feng campaign, they were reluctant, but then a flurry of newspaper articles, films, and literary works drew attention to such problems as bureaucratism and authoritarianism within the ranks of the party. Shocked at the level of discontent, Mao&#x27;s Anti-Rightist Movement put large numbers of intellectuals through &quot;thought reform&quot; or sent them to labor camps.

At the time of the Great Leap Forward (1957–59), the government increased its insistence on the use of socialist realism and combined with it so-called revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Class struggle was a frequent narrative structure and political mode of expression in literature of the late 1950s. These narratives depicted class struggle as a way to resolve social conflict, usually through the protagonists uncovering a conspiracy between new and old class enemies.

Despite the literary control and strictures to limit subjects to contemporary China and the glories of the revolution, writers produced widely read novels of energy and commitment. Examples of this new socialist literature include &quot;The Builder&quot; (Chuangye Shi 創業史) by Liu Qing 柳青, &quot;The Song of Youth&quot; (Qing Chun Zhi Ge 青春之歌) by Yang Mo, &quot;Tracks in the Snowy Forest&quot; (Lin Hai Xue Yuan 林海雪原) by Qu Bo, &quot;Keep the Red Flag Flying&quot; (Hong Qi Pu 紅旗譜) by Liang Bin 梁斌, &quot;The Red Sun&quot; (Hong Ri 紅日) by Wu Qiang 吳強, and &quot;Red Crag&quot; by Luo Guangbin 羅廣斌 and Yang Yiyan (楊益言).

During the 1960s, the Maoist view of class struggle focused on challenging revisionism within society through the socialist education movement, and, motivated by concerns that Party bureaucrats might become a new bourgeoisie, implementing class struggle within the party itself. Literature of the period reflected both strands of class struggle.

Local government bureaus and work units composed cultural works such as songs and dramas in an effort to overturn traditional cultural preferences for early marriage, large families, and sons over daughters. Academic Sarah Mellors Rodriguez writes that though these works of birth planning propaganda may seem trite to modern audiences, their themes spoke directly to widespread concerns among Chinese people at the time.

In the first twenty years after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, many literary works addressed the close relationship between rural Chinese and the Communist Party.

At the same time, from the 1950s, in Taiwan has flourished modernist poetry, including avant-garde and surrealism, led by Qin Zihao (1902–1963) and Ji Xian (b. 1903).

==== Cultural Revolution ====
During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Mao&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing led the campaign against &quot;feudal&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot; culture. The only stage productions allowed were her &quot;Eight Model Operas&quot;, which combined traditional and western forms, while great fanfare was given to politically orthodox films and heroic novels, such as those by Hao Ran (浩然). The period has long been regarded as a cultural wasteland, but some now suggest that the leading works have an energy which is still of interest.

The principles for cultural production laid out by Mao in the 1942 Talks at the Yan&#x27;an Forum became dogmatized during the Cultural Revolution.

Mao Zedong has also written several poems such as:
**&quot;Changsha&quot; &quot;沁园春·长沙&quot;1925
**&quot;Double Ninth Festival&quot; &quot;采桑子·重阳&quot; 1929
**&quot;Long March&quot; &quot;七律·长征&quot; 1935
**&quot;Snow&quot; &quot;沁园春·雪&quot; 1936
**&quot;The People&#x27;s Liberation Army occupied Nanjing&quot; &quot;七律·人民解放军占领南京&quot; 1949
**&quot;Swimming&quot; &quot;水调歌头·游泳&quot; 1956
**&quot;Ode to the Plum Blossom&quot; &quot;卜算子咏梅&quot; 1961
Trends of promoting birth planning through art continued after Mao&#x27;s death. Under Hua Guofeng, a collection of songs, short plays, and skits relating to birth control were published as a volume titled &quot;Compilation of Birth Planning Literature and Art Propaganda Materials.&quot;

=== Opening and reform (1978–1989) ===
The arrest of Jiang Qing and the other members of the Gang of Four in 1976, and especially the reforms initiated at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, led writers to take up their pens again. Much of the literature in what would be called the &quot;new era&quot; (新時期) discussed the serious abuses of power that had taken place at both the national and the local levels during the Cultural Revolution. The writers decried the waste of time and talent during that decade and bemoaned abuses that had held China back. This literature, often called &quot;scar literature&quot;, or &quot;the literature of the wounded&quot;, discussed the experiences of sent-down youth with great though not complete frankness and conveyed disquieting views of the party and the political system. Intensely patriotic, these authors wrote cynically of the political leadership that gave rise to the extreme chaos and disorder of the Cultural Revolution. Many of these themes and attitudes were also found in Fifth Generation films of directors trained after 1978, many of which were based on published novels and short stories. Some of this fiction and cinema extended the blame to the entire generation of leaders and to the political system itself. The political authorities were faced with a serious problem: how could they encourage writers to criticize and discredit the abuses of the Cultural Revolution without allowing that criticism to go beyond what they considered tolerable limits?

During this period, the number of literary magazines rose sharply, and many from before the Cultural Revolution were revived. Poetry also changed in its form and content. Four &quot;misty poets&quot;, Bei Dao, Gu Cheng, Duo Duo and Yang Lian expressed themselves in deliberately obscure verse which reflected subjective realism rather than the realism of the sort promoted during the Cultural Revolution. There was a special interest in foreign works. Recent foreign literature was translated, often without carefully considering its interest for the Chinese reader. Literary magazines specializing in translations of foreign short stories became very popular, especially among the young.

Some leaders in the government, literary and art circles feared change was happening too fast. The first reaction came in 1980 with calls to combat &quot;bourgeois liberalism&quot;, a campaign that was repeated in 1981. These two difficult periods were followed by the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign in late 1983.

At the same time, writers remained freer to write in unconventional styles and to treat sensitive subject matter. A spirit of literary experimentation flourished in the second half of the 1980s. Fiction writers such as Wang Meng, Zhang Xinxin, and Zong Pu and dramatists such as Gao Xingjian experimented with modernist language and narrative modes. Another group of writers—collectively said to constitute the Xungen movement—including Han Shaogong, Mo Yan, Ah Cheng, and Jia Pingwa sought to reconnect literature and culture to Chinese traditions, from which a century of modernization and cultural and political iconoclasm had severed them. Other writers such as Yu Hua, Ge Fei, and Su Tong experimented in a more avant-garde mode of writing that was daring in form and language and showed a complete loss of faith in ideals of any sort.

=== Post-Tiananmen (1989–present) ===

In the wake of the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 and with the intensification of market reforms, literature and culture turned increasingly commercial and escapist. Wang Shuo, the so-called &quot;hooligan&quot; writer, is the most obvious manifestation of this commercial shift, though his fiction is not without serious intent. Some writers, such as Yan Lianke, continue to take seriously the role of literature in exposing social problems; his novel &quot;Dreams of Ding Village&quot; () deals with the plight of HIV-AIDS victims. As in the May Fourth Movement, women writers came to the fore. Many of them, such as Chen Ran, Wei Hui, Wang Anyi, and Hong Ying, explore female subjectivity in a radically changing society. Neo-realism is another important current in post-Tiananmen fiction, for instance in the writings of Liu Heng, Chi Li, Fang Fang, He Dun, and Zhu Wen.

According to Martin Woesler trends in contemporary Chinese literature include: &#x27;cult literature&#x27; with Guo Jingming&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a Sad River&quot; (), vagabond literature with Xu Zechen&#x27;s &quot;Running Through Beijing&quot; () Liu Zhenyun&#x27;s &quot;The Pickpockets&quot; (), underground literature with Mian Mian&#x27;s &quot;Panda Sex&quot; (), divided in historicizing literature with Yu Dan&#x27;s &quot;Confucius in Your Heart&quot; (), &#x27;longing for something&#x27; literature such as Yi Zhongtian, and in Tibetan literature with Alai, literature of the mega cities, women&#x27;s literature with Bi Shumin&#x27;s &quot;Women’s Boxing&quot; () and &quot;The Female Psychologist&quot; (), master narratives by narrators like Mo Yan with &quot;Life and Death are Wearing Me Out&quot; (). Oblique social criticism is also a popular form, for example Han Han&#x27;s novel &quot;His land&quot; (), which was written in a surreal style opposed to the uncritical mainstream, but ranked 1st in 2009 Chinese bestseller list. Another example is Yan Ge&#x27;s novel &quot;Family of Joy&quot; (), which was written in Sichuanese and won the Chinese Media Group New Talent Award in 2013.

Chinese language literature also flourishes in the diaspora—in South East Asia, the United States, and Europe. According to a 2014 report from the International Publishing Association, China is the largest publisher of books, magazines and newspapers in the world by volume. In book publishing alone, some 128,800 new titles of books were published in 2005, according to the General Administration of Press and Publication. There are more than 600 literary journals across the country. Living in France but continuing to write primarily in Chinese, Gao Xingjian became the first Chinese writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000. In 2012, Mo Yan also received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 2015, children&#x27;s author Cao Wenxuan was awarded the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the first Chinese author to win the top international children&#x27;s book prize (although several Chinese authors had previously been nominated).


=== Online literature ===

In the new millennium, online literature plays a much more important role in China than in the United States and the rest of the world. Most books are available online, where the most popular novels find millions of readers. They cost an average of 2 CNY, or roughly a tenth of the average price of a printed book.Chinese online literature, also called Chinese Web or Internet Literature, encompasses works written in the Chinese language that are created and consumed on digital platforms. Rising alongside the internet&#x27;s expansion, especially with the advent of mobile reading, this literature thrives on serialized publication and scrolling-based platforms. Early milestones trace back to the late 1990s with sites like Under the Banyan Tree (榕树下) and influential works such as Cai Zhiheng&#x27;s The First Intimate Contact on Taiwan&#x27;s Bulletin Board System (BBS). By the 2000s, Chinese Online Literature had transformed into a major cultural phenomenon, with platforms like Qidian and Jinjiang Literature City emerging to commercialize serialized storytelling. Platforms like Qidian introduced innovative freemium models, paving the way for profitable ventures such as Yuewen Literature (China Literature Limited), formed after a merger between Tencent and Shanda Literature in 2015. Shanda Literature Ltd. is an online publishing company that claims to publish 8,000 Chinese literary works daily. These platforms cater to market demands, focusing on popular genres like fantasy and cultivation fiction while offering flexible contracts for authors. Writers are paid either through royalties or salaries tied to daily output, turning online literature into a viable career for some. Authors like Tang Jia San Shao, for example, have earned millions from writing and adaptations of their works. Chinese online literature today remains sustained by a user-driven economy where readers actively engage with and influence writers through comments, ratings, and monetary gifts. Fandoms play a significant role, often steering story directions and motivating authors to stay consistent with updates. Internationally, platforms such as Wuxiaworld and Webnovel have brought Chinese genres like Xianxia and Wuxia to a global audience, leveraging translation teams and machine learning tools. Although AI-assisted translation shows promise, debates persist regarding its ethics and artistry compared to human efforts. Chinese online literature has also been the center of debates on censorship, especially within the topic of Danmei.

=== Book market ===

China buys many foreign book rights; nearly 16 million copies of the sixth book of the Harry Potter series were sold in Chinese translation. As &quot;China Book Review&quot; reported, the rights to 9,328 foreign titles – including many children&#x27;s books – went to China in 2007. China was nominated as a &quot;Guest of Honour&quot; at the Frankfurt Bookfair in 2009.

The book market in China traditionally orders books during book fairs, because the country lacks a national book ordering system. In 2006, 6.8 million titles were sold, not including an unknown number of banned titles, bootleg copies and underground publishing factories. Seven percent of all publishers are located in Shanghai. Because the industry lacks a national distribution system, many titles from publishers in the provinces can only be found there.

The central publishing houses belonging to ministries or (other) government institutions have their main seat at Beijing (40 percent of all publishers). Most regional publishing houses are situated in the capitals of the provinces. Universities also have associated presses. Private publishing is tolerated. 220,000 books were published in 2005. Among 579 publishers—almost five times more than thirty years ago—225 are supervised by ministries, commissions or the army; 348 are controlled by agencies; and six are even more independent. On the other hand, 100,000 private bookstores bring in the half of the income of the book industry.

China&#x27;s state-run General Administration of Press and Publication (新聞出版總署) screens all Chinese literature intended to be sold on the open market. The GAPP has the legal authority to screen, censor, and ban any print, electronic, or Internet publication in China. Because all publishers in China are required to be licensed by the GAPP, that agency also has the power to deny people the right to publish, and completely shut down any publisher who fails to follow its dictates. As a result, the ratio of official to unlicensed books is said to be 2:3. According to a report in ZonaEuropa, there are more than 4,000 underground publishing factories around China. The Chinese government continues to hold public book burnings on unapproved yet popular &quot;spiritual pollution&quot; literature, though critics claim this spotlight on individual titles only helps fuel book sales. Many new-generation Chinese authors who were targeted by such government action have been subsequently published in English and found success in western literary markets, such as Wei Hui&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Baby&quot;, Anchee Min&#x27;s controversial memoir &quot;Red Azalea&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine banned-book covergirl Chun Sue&#x27;s &quot;Beijing Doll&quot;, and Mian Mian&#x27;s &quot;Candy&quot;. Online bestseller &quot;Ghost Blows Out the Light&quot; had to be rewritten to remove references to the supernatural before it could be released in print.

=== Impact of translation on modern and contemporary Chinese writers ===

Translated literature has long played an important role in modern China. Some writers, such as Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Ba Jin and others were literary translators themselves, and many present day writers in China, such as the Nobel laureate Mo Yan, listed translated works as sources of enlightenment and inspiration.

==History books about Chinese literature ==
The first two known history books about Chinese literature were published by Japanese authors in the Japanese language. Kojō Tandō wrote the 700 page &quot;Shina bungakushi&quot; (支那文学史; &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot;), published in 1897. wrote the second ever such book in 1898, also called &quot;Shina bungakushi&quot;.

The first such book in English was &quot;A History of Chinese Literature&quot;, by Herbert Giles, published in 1901. 1904&#x27;s &quot;Zhongguo wenxue shi&quot; by was the first such history in Chinese. Lin Quanjia was inspired by a 1903 translation of Sasakawa&#x27;s book.

&quot;The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature&quot;, edited by Kang-i Sun Chang and Stephen Owen, is a fundamental contemporary 2-volumes set work published in 2010 by the Cambridge University Press.

Studies in history of the modern Chinese literature from the 17th century to 21st century were published in 2017 by the Harvard University Press as a fourth volume of new literary history series. The book &quot;A New Literary History of Modern China&quot;, edited by David Der-wei Wang, contains many scholarly essays and articles in time-line order.

== Contemporary Chinese literature in translation ==
Chinese literature is increasingly available in translation- there are now several well-established websites sharing information, for example, Paper Republic, Writing Chinese, Chinese Short Stories, My Chinese Books, Chinese Books for Young Readers.
In 2005, the Chinese government started a sponsoring program for translations of government-approved Chinese works, which has already resulted in more than 200 books being translated from Chinese into other languages.

<text>Joseph William Frazier (January 12, 1944November 7, 2011), nicknamed &quot;Smokin&#x27; Joe&quot;, was an American professional boxer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He was known for his strength, durability, formidable left hand, and relentless pressure fighting style. He was also the first boxer to defeat Muhammad Ali. Frazier won a gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics as an amateur, held the NYSAC heavyweight title from 1968 to 1973, and was the undisputed heavyweight champion from 1970 to 1973. 

Frazier emerged as the top contender in the late 1960s, becoming undisputed heavyweight champion in 1970. In 1971, he defeated Ali by unanimous decision in the highly anticipated Fight of the Century. Two years later, Frazier lost his title to George Foreman. Frazier&#x27;s last world title challenge came in 1975, but he was beaten by Ali in the brutal , the Thrilla in Manila. Frazier retired in 1976 after a second loss to Foreman but made a comeback in 1981, before retiring for good with a record of 32 wins, 4 losses, and 1 draw. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Frazier among the ten greatest heavyweights of all time.

&quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1967, 1970, and 1971, and the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1975. In 1999, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked him the eighth greatest heavyweight. He is an inductee of both the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame, having been a part of the inaugural induction class of 1990 for the IBHF.

His style was often compared with that of Henry Armstrong and occasionally Rocky Marciano and was dependent on bobbing, weaving, and relentless pressure to wear down his opponents. His best-known punch was a powerful left hook, which accounted for most of his knockouts. In his career, he lost to only two fighters, both former Olympic and world heavyweight champions: twice to Muhammad Ali and twice to George Foreman.

Frazier continued to train fighters in his gym in Philadelphia. His attitude towards Ali in later life was largely characterized by bitterness and contempt but was interspersed with brief reconciliations.

==Early life==
Frazier was born January 12, 1944, the twelfth child of Dolly Alston-Frazier and Rubin in Beaufort, South Carolina. He was raised in Laurel Bay, South Carolina, a rural community in Beaufort County, South Carolina. Frazier said that he was always close to his father, who carried him when he was a toddler &quot;over the 10 acres of farmland&quot; the Fraziers worked as sharecroppers &quot;to the still where he made his bootleg corn liquor, and into town on Saturdays to buy the necessities that a family of 10 needed.&quot; He was affectionately called &quot;Billie Boy&quot;.

Rubin Frazier had his left hand and part of his forearm amputated in a tractor accident the year that his son was born. Rubin Frazier and his wife, Dolly, had been in their car when their friend Arthur Smith, who was drunk, made a move for Dolly but was rebuffed. Stefan Gallucci, a local barkeep, recounted the experience. When the Fraziers drove away, Smith fired at them several times and hit Dolly in the foot and Rubin several times in his arm. Smith was convicted and sent to prison but did not stay long. Dolly said, &quot;If you were a good workman, the white man took you out of jail and kept you busy on the farm.&quot;

Frazier&#x27;s parents worked their farm with two mules: Buck and Jenny. The farmland was what country people called &quot;white dirt, which is another way of saying it isn&#x27;t worth a damn.&quot; They could not grow peas or corn on it, only cotton and watermelons.

===Introduction to boxing===
In the early 1950s, Frazier&#x27;s father bought a black and white television, and the family and others nearby came to watch boxing matches on it. Frazier&#x27;s mother sold drinks for a quarter as they watched boxers like Sugar Ray Robinson, Rocky Marciano, Willie Pep, and Rocky Graziano. One night, Frazier&#x27;s uncle, Israel, noticed his stocky build. &quot;That boy there... that boy is gonna be another Joe Louis&quot;, he remarked. The words made an impression on Joe. His classmates at school would give him a sandwich or a quarter to walk with them at final bell so that bullies would not bother them. Frazier said, &quot;Any &#x27;scamboogah&#x27; [disrespectful, low-down and foul person] who got in my face would soon regret it; Billie Boy could kick anybody&#x27;s ass.&quot; The day after his uncle&#x27;s comment, Frazier filled an old burlap sack with rags, corncobs, a brick, and Spanish moss. He hung the makeshift heavybag from an oak tree in the backyard. &quot;For the next 6, 7 years, damn near every day I&#x27;d hit that heavybag for an hour at a time. I&#x27;d wrap my hands with a necktie of my Daddy&#x27;s, or a stocking of my Momma&#x27;s or sister&#x27;s, and get to it,&quot; he remarked.

===Early work===
Not long after Frazier started working, his left arm was seriously injured while he was running from the family&#x27;s 300-pound hog. One day, Frazier poked the hog with a stick and ran away. The gate to the pigpen was open, however, and the hog chased him. Frazier fell and hit his left arm on a brick. His arm was torn badly, but as the family could not afford a doctor, the arm had to heal on its own. He was never able to keep it fully straight again.

When Frazier was 15 years old, he had been working on a farm for a family named Bellamy. They were both white men: Mac was younger and more easy-going, and Jim was rougher and somewhat backward. One day, a black kid about 12 years old accidentally damaged one of the Bellamys&#x27; tractors. Jim became so enraged he took off his belt and whipped the boy with his belt right there in the field. Frazier saw the event and went back to the packing house on the farm and told his black friends what he had seen. Soon, Jim saw Frazier and asked him why he told others what he had witnessed. Joe then told Bellamy he did not know what he was talking about. But Jim did not believe Frazier, and he told Frazier to get off the farm before he took off his belt again. Frazier told him to keep his pants up because he was not going to use his belt on him. Jim then analyzed Frazier for a bit and eventually said, &quot;Go on, get the hell outta here.&quot; Joe knew from that moment it was time for him to leave Beaufort, and he could see only hard times and low rent for himself. Even his mother could see it. She told Frazier, &quot;Son, if you can&#x27;t get along with the white folks, then leave home because I don&#x27;t want anything to happen to you.&quot;

The train fare from Beaufort to the cities up north was costly, and the closest bus stop was in Charleston, away. In 1958, a Greyhound Lines bus called &quot;The Dog&quot; by locals in Beaufort, made Beaufort a stop on its South Carolina route. Frazier had a brother, Tommy, in New York, and was told that he could stay with Tommy and his family. Frazier had to save up a bit before he could make the bus trip to New York and still have some money in his pocket, so he first went to work at the local Coca-Cola plant. Frazier recalled that the white guy would drive the truck and that he would do the real work stacking and unloading the crates. He worked with Coca-Cola until the government began building houses for the Marines stationed at Parris Island, when he was hired on a work crew at Parris Island.

===Departure for Philadelphia===
Nine months eventually passed since he got the boot from the Bellamy farm. With no fanfare and no tearful goodbyes, Frazier packed quickly and got the first bus heading north, where he settled in Philadelphia. &quot;I climbed on the Dog&#x27;s back and rode through the night. It was 1959; I was 15 years old and I was on my own,&quot; he later said.

==Career==
===Amateur boxing===
During Frazier&#x27;s amateur career, he won Golden Gloves heavyweight championships in 1962, 1963, and 1964. His only loss in three years as an amateur was to Buster Mathis. Mathis would prove to be Joe&#x27;s biggest obstacle to making the 1964 U.S. Olympic boxing team. They met in the final of the U.S. Olympic trials at the New York World&#x27;s Fair in the summer of 1964. Their fight was scheduled for three rounds and they fought with 10-oz gloves and with headgear, but the boxers who made it to Tokyo would wear no headgear and would wear 8-oz gloves. Frazier was eager to get back at Mathis for his only amateur loss and knocked out two opponents to get to the finals. However, once again when the dust settled, the judges had called it for Mathis, undeservedly Joe thought. &quot;All that fat boy had done was run like a thief- hit me with a peck and backpedal like crazy,&quot; he would remark.

Mathis had worn his trunks very high so that when Frazier hit Mathis with legitimate body shots, the referee took a dim view of them. In the second round, the referee had gone so far as to penalize Joe two points for hitting below the belt. &quot;In a three-round bout a man can&#x27;t afford a points deduction like that,&quot; Frazier said. He then returned to Philadelphia and felt as low as he had ever been and even thought of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer, Yank Durham, were able to talk him out of his doldrums and even suggested that Frazier make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate in case something happened to Mathis. Frazier agreed and was a workhorse there, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. &quot;Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn&#x27;t matter to me, I got in there and boxed all comers,&quot; he said. In contrast, Mathis was slacking off. In the morning, when the Olympic team would do their roadwork, Mathis would run a mile and start walking and say, &quot;Go ahead, big Joe. I&#x27;ll catch up.&quot;

Frazier&#x27;s amateur record was 38–2.

===1964 Summer Olympics===

In 1964, heavyweight representative Buster Mathis qualified but was injured, and so Frazier was sent as a replacement. At the heavyweight boxing event, Frazier knocked out George Oywello of Uganda in the round of 16, then knocked out Athol McQueen of Australia 40 seconds into the quarter-finals. He was the only American boxer left at the semi-final stage, facing the 6&#x27;2&quot;, 214-lb Vadim Yemelyanov of the Soviet Union.

&quot;My left hook was a heat-seeking missile, careening off his face and body time and again. Twice in the second round I knocked him to the canvas. But as I pounded away, I felt a jolt of pain shoot through my left arm. &quot;Oh damn, the thumb,&quot;&quot; Frazier said. He knew immediately the thumb of his left hand was damaged, but he was unsure as to the extent. &quot;In the midst of the fight, with your adrenaline pumping, it&#x27;s hard to gauge such things. My mind was on more important matters. Like how I was going to deal with Yemelyanov for the rest of the fight.&quot; The match ended when the Soviet&#x27;s handlers threw in the towel at 1:49 in the second round, and the referee raised Frazier&#x27;s injured hand in victory.

Now that Frazier was into the final, he mentioned his broken thumb to no one. He went back to his room and soaked his thumb in hot water and Epsom salts. &quot;Pain or not, Joe Frazier of Beaufort, South Carolina, was going for gold,&quot; he proclaimed. He went on to fight German Hans Huber, eight years his senior. Frazier was now used to fighting bigger guys, but not with a damaged left hand. When the opening bell sounded on fight night, Joe came out, started swinging punches, and threw his right hand more than usual that night. Every so often, he would use his left hook, but nothing landed with the kind of impact that he had managed in previous bouts. He won a 3–2 decision.

===Professional career===
After Frazier won the only American 1964 Olympic boxing gold medal, his trainer Yancey &quot;Yank&quot; Durham helped put together Cloverlay, a group of local businessmen (including a young Larry Merchant) who invested in Frazier&#x27;s professional career and allowed him to train full time. Durham was Frazier&#x27;s chief trainer and manager until Durham&#x27;s death in August 1973.

Frazier turned professional in 1965 by defeating Woody Goss by a technical knockout in the first round. He won three more fights that year, all by knockout and none going past the third round. Later that year, he was in a training accident that left him legally blind in his left eye. During pre-fight physicals, after reading the eye chart with his right eye, when prompted to cover his other eye, Frazier switched hands but covered his left eye for a second time, and state athletic commission physicians seemed not to notice or act.

Frazier&#x27;s second contest was of interest in that he was decked by Mike Bruce. Frazier took an &quot;8&quot; count by referee Bob Polis but rallied for a TKO over Bruce in the third round.

In 1966, as Frazier&#x27;s career was taking off, Durham contacted Los Angeles trainer Eddie Futch. The two men had never met, but Durham had heard of Futch, who had a reputation as one of the most respected trainers in boxing. Frazier was sent to Los Angeles to train before Futch agreed to join Durham as an assistant trainer. With Futch&#x27;s assistance, Durham arranged three fights in Los Angeles against journeyman Al Jones, veteran contender Eddie Machen and George &quot;Scrap Iron&quot; Johnson. Frazier knocked out Jones and Machen but surprisingly went through 10 rounds with Scrap Iron Johnson to win a unanimous decision. Johnson had apparently bet all his purse that he would survive to the final bell, noted &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;, and he somehow achieved it. However Johnson was known in the trade as &quot;impossibly durable&quot;.

After the Johnson match, Futch became a full-fledged member of the Frazier camp as an assistant trainer and strategist, who advised Durham on matchmaking. It was Futch who suggested that Frazier boycott the 1967 WBA Heavyweight Elimination Tournament to find a successor to Muhammad Ali after the Heavyweight Champion was stripped of his title for refusing to be inducted into the military, although Frazier was the top-ranked contender at the time.

Futch proved invaluable to Frazier as an assistant trainer and helped modify his style. Under Futch&#x27;s tutelage, Frazier adopted the bob-and-weave defensive style by making him more difficult for taller opponents to punch and giving Frazier more power with his own punches. Futch remained based in Los Angeles, where he worked as a supervisor with the US Postal Service, and flew to Philadelphia to work with Frazier during the final preparations for all of his fights.

After Durham died of a stroke on August 30, 1973, Futch was asked to succeed him as Frazier&#x27;s head trainer and manager. He was training the heavyweight contender Ken Norton, who lost a rematch against Ali less than two weeks before Durham&#x27;s death. Then, Norton&#x27;s managers, Robert Biron and Aaron Rivkind, demanded that Futch choose to train either Frazier or Norton, with Futch choosing Frazier.

====Mid-to-late 1960s====
Now in his second year, in September 1966 and somewhat green, Frazier won a close decision over rugged contender Oscar Bonavena, despite Bonavena flooring him twice in the second round. A third knockdown in that round would have ended the fight under the three knockdown rule. Frazier rallied and won a close split decision after 10 rounds. The Machen win followed that contest.

In 1967, Frazier stormed ahead winning all six of his fights, including a sixth-round knockout of Doug Jones and a brutal fourth round (TKO) of Canadian George Chuvalo. No boxer had ever stopped Chuvalo, but Frazier, despite the stoppage, was unable to floor Chuvalo, who would never be knocked down in his entire career despite fighting numerous top names.

By February 1967, Joe had scored 14 wins and his star was beginning to rise. This culminated with his first appearance on the cover of &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;. That month, he met Ali, who had not yet been stripped of his title. Ali said that Joe would never stand a chance of &quot;whipping&quot; him even in his wildest dreams. Later that year, Muhammad Ali was stripped of his world heavyweight title because of his refusal to accept the military draft during the Vietnam War.

To fill the vacancy, the New York State Athletic Commission held a bout between Frazier and Buster Mathis, who were undefeated going into the match, with the winner to be recognized as &quot;World Champion&quot; by New York State. Although the fight was not recognized as a World Championship bout by some, Frazier won by a knockout in the 11th round and staked a claim to the Heavyweight Championship.

====Laying claims====
Frazier first defended his claim by beating hard-hitting prospect Manuel Ramos of Mexico. His victory came in only two rounds.

He closed 1968 by again beating Oscar Bonavena via a 15-round decision in a hard-fought rematch. Bonavena fought somewhat defensively and allowed himself to be often bulled to the ropes, which let Frazier build a wide points margin. &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; showed Bonavena afterwards with a gruesomely bruised face. It had been a punishing match.

In 1969, Frazier defended his NYSAC title in Texas and beat Dave Zyglewicz, who had lost only once in 29 fights, by a first-round knockout. Then, he beat Jerry Quarry in a seventh-round stoppage. The competitive, exciting match with Quarry was named &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; fight of the year in 1969. Frazier showed he could do a lot more than just slug by using his newly honed defensive skills to slip, bob, and weave a barrage of punches from Quarry despite Quarry&#x27;s reputation as an excellent counter-punching heavyweight.

====World Championship win====
On February 16, 1970, Frazier faced WBA Champion Jimmy Ellis at Madison Square Garden. Ellis had outpointed Jerry Quarry in the final bout of the WBA elimination tournament for Ali&#x27;s vacated belt. Frazier had declined to participate in the WBA tournament to protest their decision to strip Ali. Ellis held impressive wins over Oscar Bonavena and Leotis Martin, among others. Beforehand, Ali had announced his retirement and relinquished the Heavyweight title, allowing Ellis and Frazier to fight for the undisputed title, but both lacked any lineal claim. Frazier won by a technical knockout when Ellis&#x27;s trainer Angelo Dundee would not let him come out for the fifth round following two fourth-round knockdowns, the first knockdowns of Ellis&#x27;s career. Frazier&#x27;s decisive win over Ellis was a frightening display of power and tenacity.

In his first title defense, Frazier traveled to Detroit to fight World Light Heavyweight Champion Bob Foster, who would go on to set a record for the number of title defenses in the light-heavyweight division. Frazier (26–0) retained his title by twice flooring the hard-punching Foster in the second round. The second knockdown was delivered by a devastating left hook, and Foster could not beat the count. Then came what was hyped as the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;, his first fight with Muhammad Ali, who had launched a comeback in 1970 after a three-year suspension from boxing. It would be the first meeting of two undefeated heavyweight champions (and the last until Mike Tyson faced Michael Spinks in 1988) since Ali (31–0) had not lost his title in the ring but been stripped because of his refusal to be conscripted into the armed forces. Some considered him to be the true champion, and the fight would crown the one true heavyweight champion.

====Fight of the Century: first fight versus Ali====

On March 8, 1971, at Madison Square Garden, Frazier and Ali met in the first of their three bouts which was called the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;. With an international television audience and an in-house audience that included singers and actors and with Burt Lancaster (who served as &quot;color commentator&quot; with the fight announcer, Don Dunphy), both undefeated heavyweights met in a media-frenzied atmosphere.

Several factors came together for Frazier in the fight. He was 27 and mentally and physically at his peak. Ali was 29 and coming back from a three-year absence. He had had two good wins in his comeback, including a bruising, fifteen-round technical knockout win over Oscar Bonavena.

Frazier and Futch noticed Ali&#x27;s tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali&#x27;s right hand and, once Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook at the spot that they knew Ali&#x27;s face would be a second later.

In a brutal and competitive contest, Frazier lost the first two rounds but was able to withstand Ali&#x27;s combinations. Frazier was known to improve in middle rounds, which was the case with Ali. Frazier came on strong after the third round by landing hard shots to the body and powerful left hooks to the head. Frazier won a 15-round unanimous decision, with scores of 9–6, 11–4, 8–6–1, and claimed the lineal title. Ali was taken to a hospital immediately after the fight to check that his severely-swollen right-side jaw was not actually broken. Frazier also spent time in hospital during the ensuing month, the exertions of the fight having been exacerbated by hypertension and a kidney infection.

Later that year, he fought a three-round exhibition against hard-hitting veteran contender Cleveland Williams. In 1972, Frazier successfully defended the title twice by knocking out Terry Daniels and Ron Stander in the fourth and fifth rounds, respectively. Daniels had earlier drawn with Jerry Quarry and Stander had knocked out Earnie Shavers.

====Title loss to George Foreman====

Frazier lost his undefeated record of 29–0 and his world championship, at the hands of the unbeaten George Foreman on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica. Despite Frazier being the overall favorite, Foreman towered 10 cm (4 in.) over the more compact champion along with an 8 in. reach advantage and dominated from the start. Over the course of two rounds, Foreman managed to knock Frazier down six times en route to a technical knockout victory.

Frazier won his next fight, a 12-round decision over Joe Bugner, in London to begin his quest to regain the title.

====Mid-1970s: second fight against Ali====
Frazier&#x27;s second fight against Ali took place on January 28, 1974, in New York City. In contrast to their previous meeting, the bout was a non-title fight, with Ali winning a 12-round unanimous decision. The fight was notable for the amount of clinching. After the fight Tony Perez, when asked about the violation from Ali, he replied that the only violation is if you hold and hit at the same time, although Ali was holding Frazier but he was not hitting.

Five months later, Frazier again battled Jerry Quarry in Madison Square Garden by winning the fight in the fifth round with a strong left hook to the ribs.

In March 1975, Frazier fought a rematch with Jimmy Ellis in Melbourne, Australia, and knocked him out in nine rounds. The win again established Frazier as the top heavyweight challenger for the title, which Ali had won from Foreman in the famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; five months earlier.

====Thrilla in Manila: third Ali fight====

Muhammad Ali and Frazier met for the third and final time in Cubao, Quezon City, which is a city within Metro Manila, the Philippines, on October 1, 1975. Prior to the fight, Ali took opportunities to mock Frazier by calling him a &#x27;&quot;gorilla&quot; and generally trying to irritate him.

The fight was a punishing display on both sides under oppressively-hot conditions. During the fight, Ali said to Frazier, &quot;They said you were through, Joe.&quot; Frazier said, &quot;They lied.&quot; Ali repeatedly held Frazier around the back of his neck with his right hand, a violation of the rules that went unpunished by the referee. After 14 grueling rounds, Ali returned to his corner demanding they cut his gloves and end the bout. However, Dundee ignored Ali. This proved fortuitous, as across the ring, Futch stopped the fight out of concern for his charge. Frazier had a closed left eye, an almost-closed right eye, and a cut. Ali later said that it was the &quot;closest thing to dying that I know of.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;11/8/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Ali told interviewer Reg Gutteridge that he felt this third Frazier fight was his best performance. When Gutteridge suggested his win over Cleveland Williams, Ali said, &quot;No, Frazier&#x27;s much tougher and rougher than Cleveland Williams.&quot;

====Second fight with Foreman====
In 1976, Frazier (32–3) fought George Foreman for a second time, shaving his head for the fight. Frazier was more restrained than usual and avoided walking into big shots like he had done in their first match. However, Foreman lobbed a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knockdown, the fight was stopped in the fifth round. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.

Frazier made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Rocky&quot; later in 1976 and dedicated himself to training local boxers in Philadelphia, where he grew up, including some of his own children. He also helped train Duane Bobick.

====1980s comeback and career as trainer====
In 1981, Frazier attempted a comeback. He drew over 10 rounds with hulking Floyd &quot;Jumbo&quot; Cummings in Chicago, Illinois. It was a bruising battle with mixed reviews. He then retired for good.

Then, Frazier involved himself in various endeavors. Among his sons who turned to boxing as a career, Frazier helped train Marvis Frazier, a challenger for Larry Holmes&#x27;s world heavyweight title. He also trained his daughter, Jacqui Frazier-Lyde, who became a WIBA world light-heavyweight champion whose most notable fight was a close majority decision points loss against Laila Ali, the daughter of his rival.

Frazier&#x27;s overall record was 32 wins, 4 losses, and 1 draw, with 27 wins by knockout. He won 73% of his fights by knockout, compared to 60% for Ali and 84% for Foreman. He was a member of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

In 1984, Frazier was the special referee for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes at Starrcade &#x27;84. He awarded the match to Flair because of Rhodes&#x27;s excessive bleeding.

In 1986, Frazier appeared as the &quot;cornerman&quot; for Mr. T against Roddy Piper at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum as part of WrestleMania 2. In 1989, Frazier joined Ali, Foreman, Norton, and Holmes for the tribute special &quot;Champions Forever&quot;.

Frazier was inducted into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 1996.

===Media appearances===
Frazier appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″, &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot;, in 1992, in which he was supposed to have been beaten up by Barney Gumble in Moe&#x27;s Tavern. Frazier&#x27;s son objected, so Frazier was instead shown beating up Gumble and putting him in a trash can. Frazier appeared in another episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; – &quot;Homer&#x27;s Paternity Coot&quot; in 2006. He appeared on-screen in the 8th series of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; (USA) television show as a guest-attendee at a Silent Auction event held for the season finale (won by Joan Rivers). Frazier appeared as himself in the Academy Award-winning 1976 movie, &quot;Rocky&quot;. Since the debut of the Fight Night series of games made by EA Sports, Frazier appeared in &quot;Fight Night 2004&quot;, &quot;Fight Night Round 2&quot;, &quot;Fight Night Round 3&quot;, &quot;Fight Night Round 4&quot; and &quot;Fight Night Champion&quot;.

===Books===

Frazier released his autobiography in March 1996, entitled &quot;Smokin&#x27; Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World, Smokin&#x27; Joe Frazier&quot;. Frazier promoted the book with a memorable appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on January 23, 1996.

He also wrote &quot;Box like the Pros&quot;, &quot;a complete introduction to the sport, including the game&#x27;s history, rules of the ring, how fights are scored, how to spar, the basics of defence and offence, the fighter&#x27;s workout, a directory of boxing gyms, and much more. Box Like the Pros is an instruction manual, a historical reference tool and an insider&#x27;s guide to the world&#x27;s most controversial sport.&quot;

==Financial issues and legal battles==

According to an article from The &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a combination of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days—Ali, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes—are millionaires.&quot; Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. &quot;Are you asking me how much money I have?&quot; he said. &quot;I got plenty of money. I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up over there in the back of the room.&quot; Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in his one-room apartment on the second floor of his gym in Philadelphia.

His daughter Jacqui Frazier-Lyde is a lawyer and worked on her father&#x27;s behalf in pursuit of money they claimed he was owed in a Pennsylvania land deal. In 1973, Frazier purchased 140 acres in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for $843,000. Five years later, a developer agreed to buy the farmland for $1.8 million. Frazier received annual payments from a trust that bought the land with money he had earned in the ring. However, when the trust went bankrupt, the payments ceased.

Frazier sued his business partners, insisting his signature had been forged on documents and he had no knowledge of the sale. In the ensuing years, the 140 acres was subdivided and turned into a residential community. The land is now worth an estimated $100 million.

==Relationship with Muhammad Ali==
Frazier and Ali were initially friends. During Ali&#x27;s enforced three-year lay-off from boxing for refusing to be drafted into the U.S. Army, Frazier lent him money, testified before Congress and petitioned US President Richard Nixon to have Ali&#x27;s right to box reinstated. Frazier supported Ali&#x27;s right not to serve in the army: &quot;If Baptists weren&#x27;t allowed to fight, I wouldn&#x27;t fight either.&quot;

However, in the build-up to their first fight, the Fight of the Century, Ali turned it into a &quot;cultural and political referendum&quot; by painting himself as a revolutionary and civil rights champion and Frazier as the white man&#x27;s hope. Ali called him an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; and a pawn of the white establishment as Frazier called him Clay. Ali successfully turned many black Americans against Frazier because Frazier never spoke out about race issues, and Ali could easily paint himself as hero to oppressed black people. Bryant Gumbel joined the pro-Ali anti-Frazier bandwagon by writing a major magazine article that asked, &quot;Is Joe Frazier a white champion with black skin?&quot; Frazier thought that was &quot;a cynical attempt by Clay to make me feel isolated from my own people. He thought that would weaken me when it came time to face him in that ring. Well, he was wrong. It didn&#x27;t weaken me, it awakened me to what a cheap-shot son of a bitch he was.&quot; Ali&#x27;s camp also hurled many insults at Frazier, calling him an &quot;ugly gorilla&quot;, though Ali had also compared other opponents to animals. He noted the hypocrisy of Ali calling him an Uncle Tom when his [Ali&#x27;s] trainer (Angelo Dundee) was of Italian descent. When told by Michael Parkinson that Frazier was not an Uncle Tom, he responded by saying, &quot;Then why does he insist on calling me Cassius Clay when even the worst of the white enemies recognize me as Muhammad Ali?&quot;

As a result of Ali&#x27;s campaign, Frazier&#x27;s children were bullied at school, and his family was given police protection after receiving death threats. Ali declared that if Frazier won, he would crawl across the ring and admit that Frazier was the greatest. After Frazier won by a unanimous decision, he called upon Ali to fulfill his promise and crawl across the ring, but Ali failed to do so. Ali called it a &quot;white man&#x27;s decision&quot; and insisted that he won.

During a televised joint interview prior to their second bout in 1974, Ali continued to insult Frazier, who took exception to Ali calling him &quot;ignorant&quot; and challenged him to a fight, which resulted in both of them brawling on the studio floor. Ali went on to win the 12-round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, the Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier &quot;the other type of negro&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot;, &quot;dumb&quot;, and a &quot;gorilla&quot; At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying &quot;This is Joe Frazier&#x27;s conscience... I keep it everywhere I go. This is the way he looks when you hit him.&quot; According to the fight&#x27;s promoter, Don King, that enraged Frazier, who took it as a &quot;character assassination&quot; and &quot;personal invective.&quot; One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier&#x27;s hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled, &quot;I am going to shoot you.&quot; After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier&#x27;s son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed by Marvis, Frazier responded, &quot;You ain&#x27;t me, son. Why isn&#x27;t he apologizing to me?&quot;

In his 1996 autobiography &quot;Smokin&#x27; Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World&quot;, Frazier consistently refers to Muhammad Ali as &quot;Cassius Clay&quot; and never deviates from that convention unless the book directly quotes someone else.

For years afterwards, Frazier retained his bitterness towards Ali and suggested that Ali&#x27;s battle with Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome was a form of divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a &quot;New York Times&quot; article: &quot;In a way, Joe&#x27;s right. I said a lot of things in the heat of the moment that I shouldn&#x27;t have said. Called him names I shouldn&#x27;t have called him. I apologize for that. I&#x27;m sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight.&quot; Frazier reportedly &quot;embraced it&quot; but later retorted that Ali apologized only to a newspaper, not to him. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m still waiting [for him] to say it to me.&quot; Ali responded, &quot;If you see Frazier, you tell him he&#x27;s still a gorilla.&quot; Ali also said in an interview, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to get on my knees and crawl and beg him to forgive me.&quot;

Frazier told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in May 2009 that he no longer held hard feelings for Ali. After Frazier&#x27;s death in November 2011, Ali was among those who attended the private funeral services for Frazier in Philadelphia. Jesse Jackson, who spoke during the service, asked those in attendance to stand and &quot;show your love&quot; and reportedly Ali stood with the audience and clapped &quot;vigorously&quot;.

==Later life==

Frazier lived and trained at 2917 N. Broad Street in Philadelphia, where he owned and managed Joe Frazier&#x27;s Gym. With the help of Peter Bouchard, Frazier formed the Smokin Joe Frazier Foundation, whose purpose was to give back to troubled and in-need youth. Bouchard volunteered to run the foundation for Frazier and attempted to get a bronze statue of Frazier erected in Philadelphia, but the city declined and opted for the &quot;Rocky statue&quot; instead. Once Frazier&#x27;s health declined, the foundation was shelved. In mid-2009, Frazier sold the gymnasium on Broad Street.

He was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure. He and his nemesis, Muhammad Ali, alternated over the years between public apologies and public insults. When Ali lit the 1996 Summer Olympics flame in Atlanta, Frazier told a reporter that he would like to throw Ali into the fire and felt that he should have been chosen to light the flame. Frazier made millions of dollars in the 1970s, but the reported mismanagement of his real estate contributed to some financial difficulties.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has named Joe Frazier&#x27;s Gym in its 25th list of America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in 2012. In 2013, the gym was named to the National Register of Historic Places.

Frazier continued to train young fighters, although he needed multiple operations for back injuries sustained in a car accident. He and Ali reportedly attempted a reconciliation in his final years. But in October 2006, Frazier still claimed to have won all three bouts between them. He declared to a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, when questioned about his bitterness toward Ali, &quot;I am what I am.&quot;

Frazier attempted to revive his music interests in late 2009. Notably popular for singing &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;, Frazier teamed up with Welsh Rock Solo artist Jayce Lewis to release his repertoire in the UK, later visiting the Welshman there to host a string of after-dinner speeches and music developments. It would notably be Frazier&#x27;s last appearance there.

==Death==

Frazier was diagnosed with liver cancer in late September 2011. By November 2011, he was under hospice care in Philadelphia, where he died on November 7 at the age of 67.
Upon hearing of Frazier&#x27;s death, Muhammad Ali said, &quot;The world has lost a great champion. I will always remember Joe with respect and admiration.&quot; 

On November 14, Frazier&#x27;s private funeral was held at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia and was attended by Muhammad Ali, Don King, Larry Holmes, Magic Johnson, Dennis Rodman, his friends and family, and others. Floyd Mayweather Jr. paid for Frazier&#x27;s funeral services. His body was buried at the Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, a short drive from the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church.

A statue of Frazier was commissioned from sculptor Lawrence Nowlan. Nowlan died unexpectedly, and ultimately a statue sculpted by Philadelphia sculptor Stephen Layne was erected at Xfinity Live! Philadelphia in 2015.
