<text>The Malmedy massacre was a German war crime committed by soldiers of the on 17 December 1944 at the Baugnez crossroads near the city of Malmedy, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945). Soldiers of summarily killed eighty-four U.S. Army prisoners of war (POWs) who had surrendered after a brief battle. The soldiers had grouped the U.S. POWs in a farmer&#x27;s field, where they used machine guns to shoot and kill the grouped POWs; many of the prisoners of war who survived the gunfire of the massacre were killed with a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; gunshot to the head. A few survived.

Besides the summary execution of the eighty-four U.S. POWs at the farmer&#x27;s field, the term &quot;Malmedy massacre&quot; also includes other massacres of civilians and POWs in Belgian villages and towns in the time after their first massacre of U.S. POWs at Malmedy; these war crimes were the subjects of the Malmedy massacre trial (May–July 1946), which was a part of the Dachau trials (1945–1947).

== Background ==
=== Political ===
Late in the Second World War, the Third Reich&#x27;s war-crime violations of the Geneva Conventions were a type of psychological warfare meant to induce fear of the and of the in the soldiers of the Allied armies and the U.S. Army on the Western Front (1939–1945) — thus Hitler ordered that battles be executed and fought with the same no-quarter brutality with which the and the fought the Red Army on the Eastern Front (1941–1945) in the Soviet Union.

=== Military ===
The objective of the Third Reich&#x27;s Ardennes Counteroffensive (Battle of the Bulge, 16 Dec. 1944 – 25 Jan. 1945) was that the 6th SS Panzer Army, commanded by SS General Sepp Dietrich, was to penetrate and break through the Allied front between the towns of Monschau and Losheimergraben (a cross-border village shared by the municipalities of Hellenthal and Büllingen) in order to then cross the River Meuse, and afterwards assault and capture the city of Antwerp.

For their part of the Ardennes counter-attack, the was the armored spearhead of the left wing of the 6th SS Panzer Army, under the command of Joachim Peiper. After the infantry had breached the U.S. lines, Peiper was to advance his tanks and armored vehicles on the road to Ligneuville and travel through the towns of Stavelot, Trois-Ponts, and Werbomont in order to reach and seize the bridges over the River Meuse that are in the vicinity of the city of Huy. Because the strategy of the Ardennes Counteroffensive had reserved the roads with the strongest roadway for the bulk traffic of the tanks of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, the convoys of traveled secondary roads with weak roadways that proved unsuitable for the weights of armored military vehicles, such as Tiger II tanks.

== German advance to the west ==
=== German attack ===

In December 1944, for the Ardennes Counteroffensive the Germans&#x27; initial, strategic position was east of the German-Belgium border and the Siegfried Line, near the town of Losheim, Belgium. To realize the German advance to the west, SS General Dietrich planned for the 6th SS Panzer Army to advance northwest, through Losheimergraben and Bucholz Station, and then drive through the towns of Honsfeld and Büllingen, and through the villages of Trois-Ponts, to then reach Belgian Route Nationale N23, and then cross the River Meuse.

For their part in the German advance to the west, was to travel the Lanzerath-Losheimergraben road and advance onto the town of Losheimergraben, immediately following the infantry tasked to capture the villages and towns immediately west of the International Highway. A destroyed bridge thwarted Peiper&#x27;s tactical plan; earlier in 1944, the retreating Germans had destroyed the Losheim-Losheimergraben bridge over the railroad, which in mid-December 1944 prevented from traveling that route to their objective — the town of Losheimergraben.

Moreover, Peiper&#x27;s alternative route also was thwarted, because the selected railroad overpass bridge could not bear the weight of armored military vehicles. In the event, the German combat engineers were slow to repair the damaged roadway of the Losheim-Losheimergraben road, which delay detoured the convoy of tanks and armored vehicles of onto the road through the town of Lanzerath enroute to Bucholz Station.

=== American counter-attack ===
The Germans were surprised that the Ardennes Counteroffensive on the northern front — the frontline &quot;bulge&quot; in the Battle of the Bulge — met much resistance from the U.S. Army; for most of a day, an American reconnaissance platoon of 22 soldiers (18 infantrymen and four artillery observers) battled and delayed approximately 500 paratroops in the village of Lanzerath, Belgium. The reconnaissance platoon&#x27;s defense of the village halted the convoy of tanks and armored vehicles for almost an entire day, slowing its advance towards the River Meuse and the city of Antwerp; the delay allowed the U.S. Army time to reinforce against the expected attacks by the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

At dusk, the German 9th Parachute Regiment (3rd Parachute Division) out-flanked and captured the American reconnaissance platoon as they withdrew for want of ammunition to continue the fight — halting the progress of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; through the village of Lanzerath. In that battle, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; paratroops killed one of the artillery observers and wounded 14 of the other American soldiers. Upon capturing the American reconnaissance platoon, the paratroops paused their attack out of caution, believing that a greater force of American infantry and tanks was hiding in the woods. For more than 12 hours, the over-cautious soldiers of the 9th Parachute Regiment did not act until the midnight arrival of Peiper&#x27;s tanks to Lanzerath; then the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; paratroops explored and found no American soldiers in the woods.

== Massacre at Büllingen ==
At 4:30 a.m. on 17 December 1944, the 1st SS Panzer Division was approximately 16 hours behind schedule when the convoys departed the village of Lanzerath enroute west to the town of Honsfeld. After capturing Honsfeld, Peiper detoured from his assigned route to seize a small fuel depot in Büllingen, where the infantry summarily executed dozens of U.S. POWs. Afterward, Peiper advanced to the west, toward the River Meuse and captured Ligneuville, bypassing the towns of Mödersheid, Schoppen, Ondenval, and Thirimont. The terrain and poor quality of the roads made the advance of difficult. At the exit to the village of Thirimont, the armored spearhead was unable to travel the road directly to Ligneuville, and Peiper deviated from the planned route: Rather than turning to the left, the armored spearhead turned to the right, and advanced toward the crossroads of Baugnez, equidistant from the cities of Malmedy, Ligneuville, and Waimes.

== Massacre at Baugnez crossroads ==
On 17 December 1944, between noon and 1:00 p.m., approached the Baugnez crossroads, two miles southeast of the city of Malmedy, Belgium. Meanwhile, a U.S. Army convoy of thirty vehicles, from B Battery of the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion, was negotiating the crossroads, and then turning right, towards Ligneuville and St. Vith, in order to join the US 7th Armored Division. The Germans saw the US convoy first, and the spearhead unit of fired upon and destroyed the first and last vehicles, immobilizing the convoy and halting the American advance. Out-numbered and out-gunned, those soldiers of the 285th Field Artillery surrendered to the .

After that brief battle with the American convoy, the tanks and armored vehicles of the convoy continued westward to Ligneuville. At the Baugnez crossroads, the infantry assembled the just-surrendered U.S. POWs in a farmer&#x27;s field, and added them to another group of U.S. POWs who had been captured earlier that day. The prisoners of war who survived the massacre at Malmedy said that a group of approximately 120 U.S. POWs stood in the farmer&#x27;s field when the fired machine guns at them. Panicked by the machine gun fire, some POWs fled, but the soldiers shot and killed most of the remaining POWs where they stood. Some G.I.s dropped to the ground and pretended to be dead. After machine-gunning the group of POWs, the soldiers walked amongst the POW corpses, searching for wounded survivors to kill with a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; gunshot to the head. Some of the fleeing POWs ran to and hid in a café at the Baugnez crossroads. The then set the café afire, and killed every U.S. POW who escaped the burning building.

===Responsibility===
There is dispute over which officer ordered the killing of U.S. POWs at Malmedy. Peiper, who had already left the Baugnez crossroads where the massacre occurred, and the commander of the 1st Panzer Battalion, Werner Poetschke, are both considered most likely responsible. After the end of the war, Poetschke was identified by various persons involved and eyewitnesses as the officer directly responsible for the initiative and for giving the order to subaltern officers to execute the American prisoners near the Baugnez crossroads. Whether or not Peiper himself gave the actual order, in addition to his command responsibility, he was responsible for creating the unit’s prevailing culture, in which caring for prisoners of war was a burden to be avoided.

== Massacre revealed ==
In the early afternoon of 17 December 1944, 43 U.S. POWs who survived the Malmedy massacre emerged from hiding from the and then sought help and medical aid in the nearby city of Malmédy, which was held by the U.S. Army. The first of the 43 survivors of the massacre were encountered by a patrol from the 291st Combat Engineer Battalion at about 2:30 p.m. on 17 December, hours after the massacre.

The inspector general of the First Army learned of the Malmedy massacre approximately four hours after the fact; by evening time, rumors that the were summarily executing U.S. POWs had been communicated to the rank and file soldiers of the U.S. Army in Europe. Unofficial orders spread to not take any SS men prisoner. American soldiers of the 11th Armored Division later summarily executed 80 Wehrmacht POWs in the Chenogne massacre on 1 January 1945.

== Recovery and investigation ==
Until the Allied counterattack against the Ardennes Counteroffensive, the crossroads at Baugnez, Belgium, lay behind the Nazi lines until 13 January 1945; and on 14 January, the U.S. Army reached the killing field where the German soldiers had summarily executed 84 U.S. POWs on 17 December 1944. Military investigators photographed the war crime scene and the frozen, snow-covered corpses before they were removed for autopsy and burial.

The forensic investigation documented the gunshot wounds for the war crimes prosecutions of the enemy officers and soldiers who killed U.S. POWs. Twenty of the 84 corpses of the murdered POWs had gunpowder burn residue on the head, indicating a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; gunshot to the head: a wound not sustained in self-defense. The corpses of 20 soldiers showed evidence of small-calibre gunshot wounds to the head, without the residue of a gunpowder burn; other POW corpses had one wound to the head, either in the temple or behind an ear; and 10 corpses showed fatal blunt trauma head injuries, in which blows by a rifle butt fractured the skull. These head wounds were in addition to the bullet wounds made by the machine guns. Most of the POW corpses were recovered from a small area in the farmer’s field, indicating that the Germans grouped the U.S. POWs to shoot them.

=== Responsibility ===
In 1949, a US Senate investigation concluded that in the thirty-six-day Battle of the Bulge the soldiers of murdered between 538 and 749 U.S. POWs, other investigations claimed that the killed fewer U.S. POWs, and put the figure of the dead as being between 300 and 375 US soldiers and 111 civilians executed by the .

== War crimes trial ==

The Malmedy massacre trial, from May to July 1946, established that the commanders in the field bore command responsibility for the killing surrendered U.S. POWs; specifically General Josef Dietrich (6th Panzer Army); Werner Poetschke (1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler); and Joachim Peiper () whose soldiers committed the actual war crime at Malmedy.

Regarding command responsibility for the actions of his officers and soldiers, Dietrich said he received from Hitler superior orders that no quarter was to be granted, no prisoners taken, and no pity shown towards Belgian civilians.

The war-crime cases of the and soldiers and officers were conducted at the Dachau trials held in the deactivated Dachau concentration camp, in occupied Germany, from 1945 to 1947. The Dachau Trials prosecuted and punished war criminals by imposing 43 death sentences (including Peiper and Dietrich), 22 sentences to life-long imprisonment, and eight sentences to short imprisonment. However, none of the death sentences were carried out, and Peiper and Dietrich were released in 1956 and 1955, respectively.

<text>Salvatore Maranzano (; July 31, 1886 – September 10, 1931), nicknamed Little Caesar, was an Italian-American mobster from the town of Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, and an early Cosa Nostra boss who led what later would become the Bonanno crime family in New York City. He instigated the Castellammarese War in 1930 to seize control of the American Mafia, winning the war after the murder of rival faction head Joe Masseria in April 1931. He then briefly became the Mafia&#x27;s &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;) and formed the Five Families in New York City but was murdered on September 10, 1931, on the orders of Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, who established The Commission, in which families shared power to prevent future turf wars.

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===
Salvatore Maranzano was the youngest of 12 children born to Domenico Maranzano and Antonina Pisciotta. Five of his siblings lived to adulthood: Mariano, Angelo, Nicolo, Giuseppe, and Angela. As a youngster, Maranzano had wanted to become a priest and even studied to become one, but later became associated with the Mafia in his homeland. Maranzano had a very commanding presence and was greatly respected by his underworld peers. He had a fascination with Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire, and enjoyed talking to his less-educated American Mafia counterparts about these subjects. Because of this, he was nicknamed &quot;Little Caesar&quot; by his underworld peers.

Maranzano emigrated from Sicily to the United States in the 1920s, settling in Brooklyn. The Sicilian &quot;mafioso&quot; Don Vito Ferro decided to make a bid for control of Mafia operations in the United States. From his base in Castellammare del Golfo, Maranzano was sent to seize control. While building a legitimate business as a real estate broker, Maranzano also maintained a growing bootlegging business, using the real estate company as a front for his illegal operations. He soon became involved in prostitution and the illegal smuggling of narcotics; he also took a liking to a young Joseph Bonanno and became his mentor.

=== Castellammarese War ===
To protect the criminal empire that Maranzano had built up, he declared war on his rival Joe Masseria, the boss of all bosses, in 1930, starting the Castellammarese War. In early 1931, Lucky Luciano decided to eliminate his boss, Masseria. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer Masseria&#x27;s death in return for receiving Masseria&#x27;s rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command. On April 15, Luciano invited Masseria and two other associates to lunch in a Coney Island restaurant. After finishing their meal, the mobsters decided to play cards. At that point, according to mob legend, Luciano went to the bathroom. Four gunmen – Vito Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel – then walked into the dining room and shot and killed Masseria. With Maranzano&#x27;s blessing, Luciano took over Masseria&#x27;s gang and became Maranzano&#x27;s lieutenant.

=== Boss of all bosses ===
With Masseria gone, Maranzano reorganized the Italian American gangs in New York City into the Five Families, headed by Luciano, Joe Profaci, Tommy Gagliano, Vincent Mangano, and himself. Each family would have a boss, underboss, capos, soldiers, and associates. The families (&quot;made men&quot;) would be composed of only full-blooded Italian American members, while associates could come from any background. However, Maranzano called a meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, and declared himself &quot;capo dei capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). Maranzano also whittled down the rival families&#x27; rackets in favor of his own. Luciano appeared to accept these changes, but was merely biding his time before removing Maranzano. Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that Maranzano was even greedier and more hidebound than Masseria had been.

Maranzano&#x27;s scheming, his arrogant treatment of his subordinates and his fondness for comparing his organization to the Roman Empire (he attempted to model the organization after Caesar&#x27;s military chain of command) did not sit well with Luciano and his ambitious friends, such as Vito Genovese, Frank Costello and others. Despite his advocacy for modern methods of organization, including crews of soldiers doing the bulk of a family&#x27;s illegal work under the supervision of a &quot;caporegime&quot;, at heart Maranzano was a &quot;Mustache Pete&quot; — an old-school mafioso too steeped in Old World ways. He was opposed to Luciano&#x27;s partnership with Jewish gangsters such as Meyer Lansky and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel. Luciano and his colleagues had intended all along to bide their time before getting rid of Maranzano.

=== Death ===
By September 1931, Maranzano realized Luciano was a threat, and hired Mad Dog Coll, an Irish gangster, to kill him. However, Tommy Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. On September 10, Maranzano ordered Luciano and Genovese to come to his office at the New York Central Building (now the Helmsley Building), at 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Convinced that Maranzano planned to murder them, Luciano decided to act first. He sent to Maranzano&#x27;s office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano&#x27;s people. They had been secured with the aid of Lansky, Siegel and Gambino. Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano&#x27;s bodyguards. The other two, aided by Lucchese, who was there to point Maranzano out, stabbed the boss multiple times before shooting him. This assassination was the first of what would later be called the &quot;Night of the Sicilian Vespers&quot;. Although there would have been few objections had Luciano declared himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot;, he abolished the title, believing the position created trouble among the families and would make himself a target for another ambitious challenger. Luciano subsequently created The Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime. Maranzano is buried in Saint John Cemetery, Queens, New York, near Luciano&#x27;s grave.

==In popular culture==
*The 1931 movie &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, starring Edward G. Robinson was, in part, based on Salvatore Maranzano.
*Maranzano plays a small fictionalized role in Mario Puzo&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Maranzano refused Don Vito Corleone&#x27;s proposal to share his monopoly on gambling in New York City, in exchange for police and political contacts and expansion into Brooklyn and the Bronx. Maranzano arranged for two of Al Capone&#x27;s gunmen to come to New York and finish Corleone. Through his contacts in Chicago, Corleone found out, and sent Luca Brasi to murder the gunmen. With Capone out of the picture, the great mob war of 1933 began in earnest. Desperate for peace, Maranzano agreed to a sit down in a restaurant in Brooklyn, where he was killed by Salvatore Tessio, a capo in the Corleone family. Afterwards, Corleone took over Maranzano&#x27;s organization and held a meeting to reorganize the American Mafia, something that the real-life Maranzano did.
*In the 1972 film &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Joseph Wiseman.
*In the 1981 NBC mini-series &quot;The Gangster Chronicles&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Joseph Mascolo.
*In the 1990 film &quot;Mobsters&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Michael Gambon, but is known as &quot;Faranzano&quot;. His death is also different in this movie, as &quot;Faranzano&quot; was thrown out of a building&#x27;s window in the film instead.
*In the 1999 film &quot;Lansky&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Ron Gilbert.
*In the 1999 Lifetime film &quot;Bonanno: A Godfather&#x27;s Story&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Edward James Olmos.
*In the 2011 &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;Immortal Sins&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Cris D&#x27;Annunzio.
*In the fifth season of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Giampiero Judica. In the show, his assassination is depicted as being ordered by Nucky Thompson, and Nucky&#x27;s brother Eli is one of the participating gunmen, finishing Maranzano off by shooting him in the head.
*In the 2021 film &quot;Lansky&quot;, Maranzano is portrayed by Jay Giannone. In the film, Meyer Lansky is present in the room before Bugsy Siegel stabs him to death.

<text>Trypanosomatida is a group of kinetoplastid unicellular organisms distinguished by having only a single flagellum. The name is derived from the Greek &quot;trypano&quot; (borer) and &quot;soma&quot; (body) because of the corkscrew-like motion of some trypanosomatid species. All members are exclusively parasitic, found primarily in insects. A few genera have life-cycles involving a secondary host, which may be a vertebrate, invertebrate or plant. These include several species that cause major diseases in humans. Some trypanosomatida are intracellular parasites, with the important exception of &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;.

== Medical importance ==

The three major human diseases caused by trypanosomatids are; African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness, caused by &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; and transmitted by tsetse flies), South American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease, caused by &quot;T. cruzi&quot; and transmitted by triatomine bugs), and leishmaniasis (a set of trypanosomal diseases caused by various species of &quot;Leishmania&quot; transmitted by sandflies).

== Evolution ==

The family is known from fossils of the extinct genus &quot;Paleoleishmania&quot; preserved in Burmese amber dating to the Albian (100 mya) and Dominican amber from the Burdigalian (20–15 mya) of Hispaniola. The genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; is also represented in Dominican amber in the extinct species &quot;T. antiquus&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

Three genera are dixenous (two hosts in the life cycle) – &quot;Leishmania&quot;, &quot;Phytomonas&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;. The remainder are monoxenous (one host in the life cycle). &quot;Paratrypanosoma&quot; appears to be the first evolving branch in this order. Fifteen genera are recognised in the &quot;Trypanosomatidae&quot; and there are three subfamilies – &quot;Blechomonadinae&quot;, &quot;Leishmaniinae&quot; and &quot;Strigomonadinae&quot;. The genera in the subfamily &quot;Strigomonadinae&quot; are characterised by the presence of obligatory intracellular bacteria of the Kinetoplastibacterium genus.

== Life cycle ==

Some trypanosomatids only occupy a single host, while many others are heteroxenous: they live in more than one host species over their life cycle. This heteroxenous life cycle typically includes the intestine of a bloodsucking insect and the blood and/or tissues of a vertebrate. Rarer hosts include other bloodsucking invertebrates, such as leeches, and other organisms such as plants. Different species go through a range of different morphologies at different stages of the life cycle, with most having at least two different morphologies. Typically the promastigote and epimastigote forms are found in insect hosts, trypomastigote forms in the mammalian bloodstream and amastigotes in intracellular environments. 

Among commonly studied examples, &quot;T. brucei&quot;, &quot;T. congolense&quot;, and &quot;T. vivax&quot; are extracellular, while &quot;T. cruzi&quot; and &quot;Leishmania&quot; spp. are intracellular. Trypanosomatids with intracellular stages express proteins on their surfaces. de Paiva &quot;et al.&quot;, 2015 illuminates δ-amastins&#x27; roles in intracellular success.

===Sexual reproduction===

Trypanosomatids that cause globally known diseases such leishmaniasis (&quot;Leishmania&quot; species), African trypanosomiasis referred to as sleeping sickness (&quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;), and Chagas disease (&quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;) were found to be capable of meiosis and genetic exchange. These findings indicate the capability for sexual reproduction in the Trypanosomatida.

== Morphologies ==

A variety of different morphological forms appear in the life cycles of trypanosomatids, distinguished mainly by the position, length and the cell body attachment of the flagellum. The kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus. Most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus. The various morphologies were originally named from the genus where the morphology was commonly found, although this terminology is now rarely used because of potential confusion between morphologies and genus. Modern terminology is derived from the Greek; &quot;mastig&quot;, meaning whip (referring to the flagellum), and a prefix which indicates the location of the flagellum on the cell. For example, the amastigote (prefix &quot;a-&quot;, meaning no flagellum) form is also known as the leishmanial form as all &quot;Leishmania&quot; have an amastigote life cycle stage.
* Amastigote (leishmanial). Amastigotes are a common morphology during an intracellular lifecycle stage in a mammalian host. All &quot;Leishmania&quot; have an amastigote stage of the lifecycle. &quot;Leishmania&quot; amastigotes are particularly small and are among the smallest eukaryotic cells. The flagellum is very short, projecting only slightly beyond the flagellar pocket.
* (leptomonad). The promastigote form is a common morphology in the insect host. The flagellum is found anterior of nucleus emerging directly from the anterior cell body. The kinetoplast is located in front of the nucleus, near the anterior end of the body.
* (crithidial). Epimastigotes are a common form in the insect host and &quot;Crithidia&quot; and &quot;Blastocrithidia&quot;, both parasites of insects, exhibit this form during their life cycles. The flagellum exits the cell anterior of nucleus and is connected to the cell body for part of its length by an undulating membrane. The kinetoplast is located between the nucleus and the anterior end.
* (trypanosomal). This stage is characteristic of the genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; in the mammalian host bloodstream as well as infective metacyclic stages in the fly vector. In trypomastigotes the kinetoplast is near the posterior end of the body, and the flagellum lies attached to the cell body for most of its length by an undulating membrane.
* (herpetomonad). A rarer morphology where the flagellum posterior of nucleus, passing through a long groove in the cell.
* . A morphotype where the flagellum does not extend beyond the deep flagellar pocket.

== Other features ==
Notable characteristics of trypanosomatids are the ability to perform trans-splicing of RNA and possession of glycosomes, where much of their glycolysis is confined to. The acidocalcisome, another organelle, was first identified in trypanosomes.

=== Bacterial endosymbiont ===

Six species of trypanosomatids are known to carry an additional proteobacterial endosymbiont, termed TPE (trypanosomatid proteobacterial endosymbionts). These trypansomatids (&quot;Strigomonas oncopelti&quot;, &quot;S. culicis&quot;, &quot;S. galati&quot;, &quot;Angomonas desouzai&quot;, and &quot;A. deanei&quot;) are in turn known as SHTs, for symbiont-harboring trypanosomatids. All such symbionts have a shared evolutionary origin and are classified in the Candidatus genus &quot;Kinetoplastibacterium&quot;.

As with many symbionts, the bacteria have a much reduced genome compared to their free-living relatives of genera &quot;Taylorella&quot; and &quot;Achromobacter&quot;. (GTDB finds the genus sister to &quot;Proftella&quot;, a symbiont of &quot;Diaphorina citri&quot;.) Reflecting their inability to live alone, they have lost genes dedicated to essential biological functions, relying on the host instead. They have modified their division to become synchronized with the host. In &quot;S. culicis&quot; at least, the TPE helps the host by synthesizing heme and producing essential enzymes, staying tethered to the kinetoplast.

<text>Boxing training is the training method that boxers use in order to get more fit for their sport.

== Training ==
A boxer&#x27;s training depends largely on the point in their career at which they are situated. If the boxer is just a beginner, a minimal training routine might consist of learning how to hit a heavy bag, a speed bag, or a double end bag (a small bag with a cord on top and bottom connecting it to the floor and ceiling) as well as doing shadowboxing in front of a mirror, skipping rope, calisthenics and jogging every day, as well as an occasional practice bout inside the ring (sparring). Most beginning boxers will spend most of their early careers conditioning and establishing the fundamentals. For the amateur or professional boxer preparing for a competition or bout, however, training is much more stringent. Boxing is widely considered one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.

=== Weight ===
Boxing, like several other fighting sports, categorizes its competitors into weight classes. Some fighters try to take advantage of this by dieting before weigh-in so that they can be bumped down a weight class. In extreme cases, a fighter may forgo solid food before the official weigh-in ceremony, and eat a lot afterward to compensate. In some very extreme cases, boxers have been forced to stop eating solid food up to three days before the weigh-in ceremony, in order to make weight for the fight. Sometimes, if a boxer doesn&#x27;t make the weight agreed for on the first weight-in, they might go to a sauna or to jog with a jacket to sweat and lose the extra pounds, however this is mainly water that the body holds. After weigh-ins, competitors will in general add on weight before the fight, resulting in them weighing anywhere from 5 to 25 lbs above the weight class.

A boxer will generally try to have the maximum weight possible within the Boxing weight classes they are fighting in, as a good boxer will be able to use their weight to their advantage.

=== Sparring ===

Sparring is &quot;practice fighting&quot; with the aim of training skills and fitness, not to determine a winner. Sparring should always involve use of a mouth-guard, head-guard and groin-guard. Sparring gloves are often more padded than gloves used in actual bouts. Sparring partners sometimes agree to practice particular types of punches or defense moves to focus their training.

== Equipment ==

Basic boxing training equipment includes:

=== Safety Equipment ===

*Hand wraps: Protect the knuckles and wrists when training and sparring.
*Speed Bag Gloves: Created to prevent the hands from getting hurt while hitting the speed bag, these gloves are the lightest gloves, yet offer more protection than hand wraps alone.
*Heavy Bag Gloves: Created to prevent the hands from getting hurt while hitting the heavy bag, and are insulated for your knuckles to reducing the risk of wrist, hand, and knuckle injury while hitting the Heavy bag. Normally bag gloves weigh anywhere from , but some prefer to train in both the varieties.
*Sparring Gloves: Contrary to popular belief, these gloves were designed to protect the boxer&#x27;s hands, not the opponent&#x27;s head. Generally weigh much more than professional fight gloves (16 oz.) in order to cushion blows and accustom boxers to added weights.
*Headgear: Used to protect boxers from soft tissue damage, (bruises, cuts, etc.), during sparring - also used in competition in amateur boxing. Headgear offers no protection from the effects of hard punches (stunning, knockdowns, KOs). It is important that boxers are aware of this otherwise headgear can produce a false sense of security leading a boxer to take punches rather than defend themselves.
*Groin Guard (or No-Foul Protector): Protects the groin against low punches, offers more comprehensive protection than a simple &#x27;cup&#x27; guard.
*Mouthpiece: (Sometimes known as gumshield, mouthguard). Used to protect the inside of the mouth and lips from getting cut by the teeth when a hard punch to the face is received. The mouthguard also helps to lock the top and bottom jaws together preventing painful damage to the jaw joint capsule when a boxer is struck by a hook. Important that it is worn in both sparring and its tough competition.

=== Training Equipment ===

*Jump Rope or Skipping rope: It is used to improve footwork and agility, and for aerobic fitness. also helps maintain stamina
*Focus mitts: Padded targets worn on the trainer&#x27;s hands for the boxer to strike and practice combinations.
*The Heavy Bag: Used to teach young boxers where exactly to hit an opponent and for all kinds of boxers to practice their combinations.
*The Speed Bag: Used to improve hand speed, hand-eye coordination and shoulder endurance.
*The Double End Bag: Also known as the floor-ceiling bag, crazy bag, or the reflex bag, the double end bag is hooked up by two thin elastic ropes to the gym&#x27;s ceiling and floor, and because of that, it moves around easily, giving the boxer good equipment for target practice and timing.
* The Maize Bag: Used to practice head movement and close-range combinations, such as uppercut/hook combinations.
* The Slam Man: Used to practice combinations of punches on a human shaped bag
*Medicine Ball: Used for plyometric training - often used when training in pairs (quick throwing/passing of the ball) or with a trainer.
*Mirror: Used by boxers to do shadow boxing.
*Boxing ring: When boxers are training, used to stage practice or competition bouts.
*Automated Boxing Scoring System: The first use of technology in boxing for training purposes. Monitors the boxers in real-time recording information on each blow.

<text>Hector International Airport is a civil-military public airport three miles (5 km) northwest of Fargo, in Cass County, North Dakota, United States. The busiest airport in North Dakota, it is owned by the City of Fargo Municipal Airport Authority. Fargo Air National Guard Base is located adjacent to the airport.
The airport was named after Martin Hector, who first leased, and then donated the original 50 acres of land to the city. Customs service is available for arrivals from Canada and other countries. Hector International has no scheduled passenger airline flights out of the country but has its international title (like many other airports) because of this customs service.

The airport is home to Fargo Air National Guard Base and the &quot;Happy Hooligans&quot; of the 119th Wing (119 WG), a unit of the North Dakota Air National Guard that operates the MQ-9 Reaper. 
The airport was the intended destination for the airplane carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. Richardson on February 3, 1959. The airplane crashed shortly after takeoff from Mason City, Iowa, killing the three musicians and the pilot.

==Facilities and aircraft==

Hector International Airport covers and has three runways: 18/36 is 9,001 x 150 ft (2,744 x 46 m), 9/27 is 6,302 x 100 ft (1,921 x 30 m), and 13/31 is 3,801 x 75 ft (1,159 x 46 m). Hector International has the longest public runway in North Dakota and can receive Boeing 747s.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 92,980 aircraft operations, an average of 255 per day. In December 2021, there were 203 aircraft based at the airport: 124 single-engine, 52 multi-engine, 22 jet, and 5 helicopters.

The current terminal was built in 1986 and designed by Foss Associates with Thompson Consultants.

In 2008 the airport completed the passenger terminal expansion and update that had begun in October 2006. The $15.5 million project designed by TL Stroh Architects updated the terminal and added a fifth gate, an additional baggage claim and expanded the security checkpoint area. TSA PreCheck was added in 2014.

Hector International Airport plans to begin a large terminal expansion project in 2024. The expansion will add four new gates bringing the terminal&#x27;s total number of gates to nine. The project is expected to cost $124 million. Completion of the terminal expansion and renovation is anticipated to take three to four years. The airport also plans to construct a parking garage adjacent to the terminal. The ramp will be connected to the terminal via skyway and will provide approximately 1,000 parking spaces. The parking ramp is expected to cost $43 million with construction scheduled to begin in 2024.

<doc id="152900" wikidata="Q1417326" url="?curid=152900" title="Finitism">
<text>Finitism is a philosophy of mathematics that accepts the existence only of finite mathematical objects. It is best understood in comparison to the mainstream philosophy of mathematics where infinite mathematical objects (e.g., infinite sets) are accepted as existing.

== Main idea ==
The main idea of finitistic mathematics is not accepting the existence of infinite objects such as infinite sets. While all natural numbers are accepted as existing, the &quot;set&quot; of all natural numbers is not considered to exist as a mathematical object. Therefore quantification over infinite domains is not considered meaningful. The mathematical theory often associated with finitism is Thoralf Skolem&#x27;s primitive recursive arithmetic.

== History ==
The introduction of infinite mathematical objects occurred a few centuries ago when the use of infinite objects was already a controversial topic among mathematicians. The issue entered a new phase when Georg Cantor in 1874 introduced what is now called naive set theory and used it as a base for his work on transfinite numbers. When paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox, Berry&#x27;s paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox were discovered in Cantor&#x27;s naive set theory, the issue became a heated topic among mathematicians.

There were various positions taken by mathematicians. All agreed about finite mathematical objects such as natural numbers. However there were disagreements regarding infinite mathematical objects. 
One position was the intuitionistic mathematics that was advocated by L. E. J. Brouwer, which rejected the existence of infinite objects until they are constructed.

Another position was endorsed by David Hilbert: finite mathematical objects are concrete objects, infinite mathematical objects are ideal objects, and accepting ideal mathematical objects does not cause a problem regarding finite mathematical objects. More formally, Hilbert believed that it is possible to show that any theorem about finite mathematical objects that can be obtained using ideal infinite objects can be also obtained without them. Therefore allowing infinite mathematical objects would not cause a problem regarding finite objects. This led to Hilbert&#x27;s program of proving both consistency and completeness of set theory using finitistic means as this would imply that adding ideal mathematical objects is conservative over the finitistic part. Hilbert&#x27;s views are also associated with the formalist philosophy of mathematics. Hilbert&#x27;s goal of proving the consistency and completeness of set theory or even arithmetic through finitistic means turned out to be an impossible task due to Kurt Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. However, Harvey Friedman&#x27;s grand conjecture would imply that most mathematical results are provable using finitistic means.

Hilbert did not give a rigorous explanation of what he considered finitistic and referred to as elementary. However, based on his work with Paul Bernays some experts such as have argued that primitive recursive arithmetic can be considered an upper bound on what Hilbert considered finitistic mathematics.

As a result of Gödel&#x27;s theorems, as it became clear that there is no hope of proving both the consistency and completeness of mathematics, and with the development of seemingly consistent axiomatic set theories such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, most modern mathematicians do not focus on this topic.

== Classical finitism vs. strict finitism ==
In her book &quot;The Philosophy of Set Theory&quot;, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow &quot;potentially infinite&quot; objects as classical finitists, and those who do not allow potentially infinite objects as strict finitists: for example, a classical finitist would allow statements such as &quot;every natural number has a successor&quot; and would accept the meaningfulness of infinite series in the sense of limits of finite partial sums, while a strict finitist would not. Historically, the written history of mathematics was thus classically finitist until Cantor created the hierarchy of transfinite cardinals at the end of the 19th century.

== Views regarding infinite mathematical objects ==
Leopold Kronecker remained a strident opponent to Cantor&#x27;s set theory:
Reuben Goodstein was another proponent of finitism. Some of his work involved building up to analysis from finitist foundations.

Although he denied it, much of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s writing on mathematics has a strong affinity with finitism.

If finitists are contrasted with transfinitists (proponents of e.g. Georg Cantor&#x27;s hierarchy of infinities), then also Aristotle may be characterized as a finitist. Aristotle especially promoted the potential infinity as a middle option between strict finitism and actual infinity (the latter being an actualization of something never-ending in nature, in contrast with the Cantorist actual infinity consisting of the transfinite cardinal and ordinal numbers, which have nothing to do with the things in nature):

== Other related philosophies of mathematics ==

Ultrafinitism (also known as ultraintuitionism) has an even more conservative attitude towards mathematical objects than finitism, and has objections to the existence of finite mathematical objects when they are too large.

Towards the end of the 20th century John Penn Mayberry developed a system of finitary mathematics which he called &quot;Euclidean Arithmetic&quot;. The most striking tenet of his system is a complete and rigorous rejection of the special foundational status normally accorded to iterative processes, including in particular the construction of the natural numbers by the iteration &quot;+1&quot;. Consequently Mayberry is in sharp dissent from those who would seek to equate finitary mathematics with Peano arithmetic or any of its fragments such as primitive recursive arithmetic.

<doc id="152902" wikidata="Q5298070" url="?curid=152902" title="Dormant Commerce Clause">
<text>The Dormant Commerce Clause, or Negative Commerce Clause, in American constitutional law, is a legal doctrine that courts in the United States have inferred from the Commerce Clause in Article I of the US Constitution. The primary focus of the doctrine is barring state protectionism. The Dormant Commerce Clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against, or unduly burdens, interstate or international commerce. Courts first determine whether a state regulation discriminates on its face against interstate commerce or whether it has the purpose or effect of discriminating against interstate commerce. If the statute is discriminatory, the state has the burden to justify both the local benefits flowing from the statute and to show the state has no other means of advancing the legitimate local purpose.

For example, it is lawful for Michigan to require food labels that specifically identify certain animal parts, if they are present in the product, because the state law applies to food produced in Michigan as well as food imported from other states and foreign countries; the state law would violate the Commerce Clause if it applied only to imported food or if it was otherwise found to favor domestic over imported products. Likewise, California law requires milk sold to contain a certain percentage of milk solids that federal law does not require, which is allowed under the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine because California&#x27;s stricter requirements apply equally to California-produced milk and imported milk and so does not discriminate against or inappropriately burden interstate commerce.

The doctrine was initially envisioned by Chief Justice John Marshall in the 1820s.

==Origin of the doctrine==

The idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive Federal power was discussed even before adoption of the Constitution. On September 15, 1787, the Framers of the Constitution debated in Philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without Congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses. James Madison believed that the mere existence of the Commerce Clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage: &quot;[Madison] was more and more convinced that the regulation of Commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority.&quot; Roger Sherman disagreed: &quot;The power of the United States to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the State regulations when such interferences happen; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction.&quot; Sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power, the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments. Ultimately, the Philadelphia Convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in Article I, Section 10, which says: &quot;No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage...&quot;

The word &quot;dormant&quot;, in connection with the Commerce Clause, originated in &quot;dicta&quot; of Chief Justice John Marshall. For example, in the case of &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden,&quot; Marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce &quot;can never be exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents, or lie dormant.&quot; In concurrence, Justice William Johnson was even more emphatic that the Constitution is &quot;altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to Congress of power over commerce.&quot; Later, in the case of &quot;Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co.&quot;, Marshall wrote: &quot;We do not think that the [state] act empowering the Black Bird Creek Marsh Company to place a dam across the creek, can, under all the circumstances of the case, be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state, or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject.&quot;

If Marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power, the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine eventually developed very differently: it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power, rather than an exclusive federal power, and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power. Thus, the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but &quot;not absolutely exclusive&quot;. The approach began in the 1851 case of &quot;Cooley v. Board of Wardens&quot;, in which Justice Benjamin R. Curtis wrote for the Court: &quot;Either absolutely to affirm, or deny that the nature of this [commerce] power requires exclusive legislation by Congress, is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power, and to assert concerning all of them, what is really applicable but to a part.&quot; The first clear holding of the Supreme Court striking down a state law under the Dormant Commerce Clause came in the 1873 case &quot;Reading Railroad Company v. Pennsylvania&quot;.

==Effect of the doctrine==
Justice Anthony Kennedy has written that: &quot;The central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to prevent.&quot; In order to determine whether a law violates a so-called &quot;dormant&quot; aspect of the Commerce Clause, the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce. In this context, &quot;discrimination&quot; simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.

Thus, in a dormant Commerce Clause case, a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests. Discriminatory laws motivated by &quot;simple economic protectionism&quot; are subject to a &quot;virtually per se rule of invalidity&quot;, which can only be overcome by a showing that the State has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose.

On the other hand, when a law is &quot;directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental&quot;, that is, where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a much more flexible approach, the general contours of which were outlined in &quot;Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.&quot; If the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist, but still has some impact on interstate commerce, the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test. The Court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits. If such is the case, the law is usually deemed unconstitutional. In &quot;Pike&quot;, the Court explained that a state regulation having only &quot;incidental&quot; effects on interstate commerce &quot;will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits&quot;. When weighing burdens against benefits, a court should consider both &quot;the nature of the local interest involved, and ... whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities&quot;. Thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety, or serve other legitimate state interests, but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose, are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test, a minimum level of scrutiny. In &quot;USA Recycling, Inc. v. Town of Babylon&quot;, 66 F.3d 1272, 1281 (C.A.2 (N.Y.), 1995), the court explained:

If the state activity constitutes &quot;regulation&quot; of interstate commerce, then the court must proceed to a second inquiry: whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only &quot;incidental&quot; effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce. As we use the term here, &quot;discrimination&quot; simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter. The party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against, or places some burden on, interstate commerce. &quot;Hughes v. Oklahoma&quot;, 441 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979). If discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects, and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests. If the challenging party cannot show that the statute is discriminatory, then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that &quot;is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.&quot;

==State taxation==
Over the years, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the language of the Commerce Clause contains a further, negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject.

More recently, in the 2015 case of &quot;Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne&quot;, the Court addressed Maryland&#x27;s unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in Maryland, and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside Maryland, &quot;without&quot; any tax credit for income tax paid to other states. The Court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. The Court faulted Justice Antonin Scalia&#x27;s criticism of the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by saying that he failed to &quot;explain why, under his interpretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause 
would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant Commerce Clause&quot;.

Application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the Court&#x27;s holdings that the Commerce Clause prevents a State from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole, as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear. The Court&#x27;s taxation decisions thus &quot;reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.&quot; 

===Formalistic approach===
As with the Court&#x27;s application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation, the pre-New Deal Court attempted to apply a formalistic approach to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce. The history is described in &quot;Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.&quot;, 514 U.S. 175 (1995):

The command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained, however, and the Court&#x27;s understanding of the dormant Commerce Clause has taken some turns. In its early stages, the Court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation &quot;in any form&quot;, &quot;even though the same amount of tax should be laid on (intrastate) commerce&quot;. This position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach, according to which, for example, the Court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce, or upon the &quot;freight carried&quot; in interstate commerce, but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises, or &quot;&#x27;in lieu of all taxes upon (the taxpayer&#x27;s) property,&#x27;&quot; Dissenting from this formal approach in 1927, Justice Stone remarked that it was &quot;too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value.&quot; 

===Decline of formalism===
Accompanying the revolution in approach in the Court&#x27;s Congressional powers jurisprudence, the New Deal Court began to change its approach to state taxation as well. The &quot;Jefferson Lines&quot; decision continues:

In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with Justice Stone&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue&quot;, 303 U.S. 250, which examined New Mexico&#x27;s franchise tax, measured by gross receipts, as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in New Mexico but circulated both inside and outside the State. Although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent, Justice Stone added a dash of the pragmatism that, with a brief interlude, has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law. ... The Court explained that &quot;[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.&quot; 

During the transition period, some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax, and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved, whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not. Under this formalistic approach, a tax might be struck down, and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence, but under another name, and then withstand review.

The absurdity of this approach was made manifest in the two &quot;Railway Express&quot; cases. In the first, a tax imposed by the state of Virginia on American business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce. But then, in the second, Virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a &quot;franchise tax&quot; on &quot;intangible property&quot; in the form of &quot;going concern&quot; value as measured by gross receipts.

The Court upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the prohibition on privilege taxes, even though the impact of the old tax and new were essentially identical. There was no real economic difference between the statutes in &quot;Railway Express I&quot; and &quot;Railway Express II&quot;. The Court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way. Yet under the Spector rule, the economic realities in &quot;Railway Express I&quot; became irrelevant. The Spector rule (against privilege taxes) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship, and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the Commerce Clause.

The death knell of formalism occurred in &quot;Complete Auto Transit, Inc v. Brady&quot;, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), which approved a Mississippi privilege tax upon a Michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to Mississippi dealers. The Court there explained:

Appellant&#x27;s attack is based solely on decisions of this Court holding that a tax on the &quot;privilege&quot; of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce. See, e. g., &quot;Spector Motor Service v. O&#x27;Connor&quot;, 340 U.S. 602 (1951); &quot;Freeman v. Hewit&quot;, 329 U.S. 249 (1946). This rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the &quot;privilege of doing business&quot;; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax. The rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of &quot;free trade&quot; immunity from state taxation. 

&quot;Complete Auto Transit&quot; is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause. In overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se, the Court noted the following, in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence:

We note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the State to justify a tax, or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or that the tax is not fairly apportioned.

These four factors, nexus, relationship to benefits, discrimination, and apportionment, have come to be regarded as the four Complete Auto Transit factors applied repeatedly in subsequent cases. Complete Auto Transit must be recognized as the culmination of the Court&#x27;s emerging commerce clause approach, not just in taxation, but in all of its aspects. Application of Complete Auto Transit to State taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture, requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law.

==Taxation of international commerce==
In addition to satisfying the four-prong test in &quot;Complete Auto Transit&quot;, the Supreme Court has held state taxes which burden international commerce cannot create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from &quot;speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments&quot;. 

In &quot;Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance&quot;, 505 U.S. 71 (1992), the Supreme Court considered a case in which Iowa taxed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, without allowing a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, but not dividends from domestic subsidiaries operating outside Iowa. This differential treatment arose from Iowa&#x27;s adoption of the definition of &quot;net income&quot; used by the Internal Revenue Service. For federal income tax purposes, dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected a Commerce Clause claim because Kraft failed to show &quot;that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to Iowa&#x27;s taxing scheme.&quot; Considering an Equal Protection Clause challenge, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the use of the federal government&#x27;s definitions of income were convenient for the state and was &quot;rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency&quot;. The Supreme Court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce. The Supreme Court held that &quot;a State&#x27;s preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause even if the State&#x27;s own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination.&quot;

==Local processing requirements==
Discrimination in the flow of interstate commerce has arisen in a variety of contexts. A line of important cases has dealt with local processing requirements. Under the local processing requirement, a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce.

===No local processing preference===
The basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials. Examples of Supreme Court decisions in this vein are set out in its &quot;Carbone&quot; decision. They include &quot;Minnesota v. Barber&quot;, 136 U.S. 313, (1890) (striking down a Minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the State, whether originating within or without the State, to be examined by an inspector within the State); &quot;Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel&quot;, 278 U.S. 1 (1928) (striking down a Louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be exported unless the heads and hulls had first been removed within the State); &quot;Johnson v. Haydel&quot;, 278 U.S. 16 (1928) (striking down analogous Louisiana statute for oysters); &quot;Toomer v. Witsell&quot;, 334 U.S. 385 (1948) (striking down South Carolina statute that required shrimp fishermen to unload, pack, and stamp their catch before shipping it to another State); &quot;Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.&quot;, supra (striking down Arizona statute that required all Arizona-grown cantaloupes to be packaged within the State prior to export); &quot;South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke&quot;, 467 U.S. 82 (1984) (striking down an Alaska regulation that required all Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export). The Court has defined &quot;protectionist&quot; state legislation as &quot;regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors&quot;. &quot;New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach&quot;, 486 U.S. 269, 273–274 (1988).

===&quot;Carbone&quot;: local processing law benefiting private entity===
In the 1980s, spurred by RCRA&#x27;s emphasis on comprehensive local planning, many states and municipalities sought to promote investment in more costly disposal technologies, such as waste-to-energy incinerators, state-of-the-art landfills, composting and recycling. Some states and localities sought to promote private investment in these costly technologies by guaranteeing a longterm supply of customers. For about a decade, the use of regulation to channel private commerce to designated private disposal sites was greatly restricted as the result of the Carbone decision discussed below.

Flow control laws typically came in various designs. One common theme was the decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills, incinerators, composters or other costly disposal sites. In some locales, choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws, or municipal finance concerns. If a county or other municipality issued general obligation bonds for construction of a costly incinerator, for example, state laws might require a special approval process. If approval could be obtained, the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations, or might impact the governmental body&#x27;s credit rating: in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired. But by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility, a private entity could issue its own bonds, privately, on the strength of the public&#x27;s waste assurance.

The private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices. It can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level, in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources. Ironically, these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause.

The Town of Clarkstown had decided that it wanted to promote waste assurance through a local private transfer station. The transfer station would process waste and then forward the waste to the disposal site designated by the town. The ordinance had the following features:

Waste hauling in the Town of Clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers, subject to local regulation. The scheme had the following aspects:
# The town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company. Thus the designated facility was a private company.
# The Town of Clarkstown forced private haulers to bring their solid waste for local processing at the designated transfer station, even if the ultimate destination of solid waste was an out-of-state disposal site.
# The primary rationale for forcing in-state waste into the designated private transfer station was financial; it was seen as a device to raise revenue to finance the transfer station.

The Town of Clarkstown&#x27;s ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of Supreme Court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements. In short, it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited. A long line of Supreme Court case law had struck down local processing requirements when applied to goods or services in interstate commerce. As the Court in &quot;Carbone&quot; wrote:

We consider a so-called flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality. The avowed purpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of the facility. Because it attains this goal by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market, we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.

The Court plainly regarded the decision as a relatively unremarkable decision, not a bold stroke. As the Court wrote: &quot;The case decided today, while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of decisions, rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.&quot; And, the Court made it plain, that the problem with Clarkstown&#x27;s ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company:

In this light, the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid ... The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service. Out-of-state meat inspectors, or shrimp hullers, or milk pasteurizers, are deprived of access to local demand for their services. Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource—be it meat, shrimp, or milk—for the benefit of local businesses that treat it. 511 U.S. at 392–393.

===United Haulers: local processing law benefiting public entity===
The Court&#x27;s 2007 decision in &quot;United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority&quot; starkly illustrates the difference in result when the Court finds that local regulation is not discriminatory. The Court dealt with a flow control regimen quite similar to that considered in Carbone. The &quot;only salient difference is that the laws at issue here require haulers to bring waste to facilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation.&quot; The Court decided that the balancing test should apply, because the regulatory scheme favored the government owned facility, but treated all private facilities equally.

Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors. &quot;Conceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities.&quot; &quot;General Motors Corp. v. Tracy&quot;, 519 U.S. 278 (1997). But States and municipalities are not private businesses—far from it. Unlike private enterprise, government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. . . . These important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business.

The Court&#x27;s further explained:

By the 1980s, the Counties confronted what they could credibly call a solid waste &quot;&#x27;crisis.&#x27;&quot; ... Many local landfills were operating without permits and in violation of state regulations. Sixteen were ordered to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing the public tens of millions of dollars. These environmental problems culminated in a federal clean-up action against a landfill in Oneida County; the defendants in that case named over local businesses and several municipalities and school districts as third-party defendants The &quot;crisis&quot; extended beyond health and safety concerns. The Counties had an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, enduring price fixing, pervasive overcharging, and the influence of organized crime. Dramatic price hikes were not uncommon: In 1986, for example, a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks&#x27; notice

The Court would not interfere with local government&#x27;s efforts to solve an important public and safety problem.

The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government. The dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition. In this case, the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties have chosen the government to provide waste management services, with a limited role for the private sector in arranging for transport of waste from the curb to the public facilities. The citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce. But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort. It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services. &quot;The Commerce Clause significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce, but it does not elevate free trade above all other values.&quot;

==Health and safety regulation==
The history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers, on the one hand, as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce. The exact dividing line between the two interests, the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety, and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern. One Court has written as follows:

Not surprisingly, the Court&#x27;s effort to preserve a national market has, on numerous occasions, come into conflict with the states&#x27; traditional power to &quot;legislat[e] on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens.&quot; &quot;Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit&quot;, 362 U.S. 440, 443 (1960). On these occasions, the Supreme Court has &quot;struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States&#x27; police powers, each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the Nation.&quot; &quot;Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison&quot;, 520 U.S. 564, 596 (1997) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing &quot;Okla. Tax Comm&#x27;n v. Jefferson Lines&quot;, 514 U.S. 175, 180–183 (1995)); see generally Boris I. Bittker, Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce § 6.01[A], at 6–5 (&quot;[T]he boundaries of the [State&#x27;s] off-limits area are, and always have been, enveloped in a haze.&quot;). Those rules are &quot;simply stated, if not simply applied.&quot; Camps Newfound/Owatonna, 520 U.S. at 596 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

A frequently cited example of the deference afforded to the powers of state and local government may be found in &quot;Exxon Corp. v. Maryland&quot;, 437 U.S. 117 (1978), where the State of Maryland barred producers of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in the state. &quot;The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce,&quot; the Court wrote. The &quot;Clause protects interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.&quot;

Similarly, in &quot;Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.&quot;, 449 U.S. 456 (1981) the Court upheld a state law that banned nonreturnable milk containers made of plastic but permitted other nonreturnable milk containers. The Court found that the existence of a burden on out-of-state plastic industry was not &#x27;clearly excessive&#x27; in comparison to the state&#x27;s interest in promoting conservation. And the court continued:In Exxon, the Court stressed that the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations. A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purpose is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry. Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State&#x27;s legitimate purpose does such a regulation violate the commerce clause. When a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce, the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce. In &quot;Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines&quot; 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the United States Supreme Court stated: &#x27;These safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court. If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective. Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field. Unless we can conclude on the whole record that &quot;the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it&quot; we must uphold the statute.

==Exceptions==
There are two notable exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause to survive court challenges.

===Congressional authorization===
The first exception occurs when Congress has legislated on the matter. See &quot;Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. v. State Board of California&quot;, . In this case the Dormant Commerce Clause is no longer &quot;dormant&quot; and the issue is a Commerce Clause issue, requiring a determination of whether Congress has approved, preempted, or left untouched the state law at issue.

===Market participation exception===
The second exception is &quot;market participation exception&quot;. This occurs when the state is acting &quot;in the market&quot;, like a business or customer, rather than as a &quot;market regulator&quot;. For example, when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks, rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps, it is acting &quot;in the market&quot;. Like any other business in such cases, a state may favor or shun certain customers or suppliers.

The Supreme Court introduced the market participant doctrine in &quot;Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.&quot;, 426 U.S. 794 (1976), which upheld a Maryland program that offered bounties to scrap processors to destroy abandoned automobile hulks. See also &quot;Wisconsin Dep&#x27;t of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations v. Gould Inc.&quot;, 475 U.S. 282, 289 (1986); &quot;Reeves, Inc. v. Stake&quot;, 447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980). Because Maryland required out-of-state processors, but not in-state processors, to submit burdensome documentation to claim their bounties, the state effectively favored in-state processors over out-of-state processors. The Court held that because the state was merely attaching conditions to its expenditure of state funds, the Maryland program affected the market no differently than if Maryland were a private company bidding up the price of auto hulks. Because the state was not &quot;regulating&quot; the market, its economic activity was not subject to the anti-discrimination principles underlying the dormant Commerce Clause—and the state could impose different paperwork burdens on out-of-state processors. &quot;Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.&quot;

Another important case is &quot;White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.&quot;, in which the Supreme Court held that the City of Boston could require its building contractors to hire at least fifty percent of their workforce from among Boston residents. 460 U.S. at 214–15. Because all of the employees covered by that mandate were &quot;in a substantial if informal sense, &#x27;working for the city,&#x27; &quot; Boston was considered to be simply favoring its own residents through the expenditures of municipal funds. The Supreme Court stated, &quot;when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause.&quot; Id. at 208. Nothing in the Constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local.

Other important cases enunciating the market participation exception principle are &quot;Reeves, Inc. v. Stake&quot;, and &quot;South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke&quot;, . The &quot;Reeves&quot; case outlines the market participation exception test. In this case state-run cement co-ops were allowed to make restrictive rules (e.g. rules not to sell out-of-state). Here, this government-sponsored business was acting restrictively like an individually owned business and this action was held to be constitutional. &quot;South-Central Timber&quot; is important because it limits the market exception. &quot;South-Central Timber&quot; holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant, but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market.

The &quot;market participation exception&quot; to the dormant Commerce Clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests, because limits from other laws and Constitutional limits still apply. In &quot;United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Camden&quot;, , the city of Camden, New Jersey had passed an ordinance requiring that at least forty percent of the employees of contractors and subcontractors on city projects be Camden residents. The Supreme Court found that while the law was not infirm because of the Dormant Commerce Clause, it violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. Justice Rehnquist&#x27;s opinion distinguishes the market-participant doctrine from the privileges and immunities doctrine. Similarly, Congress has the power itself under the Commerce Clause to regulate and sanction states acting as &quot;market participants&quot;, but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate Article IV.

In the 21st century, the dormant Commerce Clause has been a frequent legal issue in cases arising under state laws regulating some aspects of Internet activity. Because of the interstate, and often international, nature of Internet communications, state laws addressing internet-related subjects such as spam, online sales or online pornography can often trigger Dormant Commerce Clause issues.

==Criticism of the doctrine==
A &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;dormant&quot; component to the Commerce Clause has been the subject of scholarly discussion for many decades. Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have rejected the notion of a Dormant Commerce Clause. They believe that such a doctrine is inconsistent with an originalist interpretation of the Constitution—so much so that they believe the doctrine is a &quot;judicial fraud&quot;.

A number of earlier Supreme Court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine. For example, Chief Justice Taney said this in 1847:

If it was intended to forbid the States from making any regulations of commerce, it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it, when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers ... [T]he legislation of Congress and the States has conformed to this construction from the foundation of the government ... The decisions of this court will also, in my opinion, when carefully examined, be found to sanction the construction I am maintaining.

However, that statement by Taney in 1847 was before the doctrine morphed in the 1851 case of &quot;Cooley v. Board of Wardens&quot;, in which Justice Benjamin R. Curtis wrote for the Court that the Commerce Clause does not always require &quot;exclusive legislation by Congress&quot;.

==Puerto Rico==
In &quot;Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vázquez&quot;, 977 F.2d 1, 7–8 (1st Cir. 1992), the First Circuit held that the dormant Commerce Clause applies to Puerto Rico.

<text>Ensete is a genus of monocarpic flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is one of the three genera in the banana family, Musaceae, and includes the false banana or enset (&quot;E. ventricosum&quot;), an economically important food crop in Ethiopia.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Ensete&quot; was first described by Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (or Horaninov, 1796–1865) in his &quot;Prodromus Monographiae Scitaminarum&quot; of 1862 in which he created a single species, &quot;Ensete edule&quot;. However, the genus did not receive general recognition until 1947 when it was revived by E. E. Cheesman in the first of a series of papers in the &quot;Kew Bulletin&quot; on the classification of the bananas, with a total of 25 species.

Taxonomically, the genus &quot;Ensete&quot; has shrunk since Cheesman revived the taxon. Cheesman acknowledged that field study might reveal synonymy and the most recent review of the genus by Simmonds (1960) listed just six. Recently the number has increased to seven as the Flora of China has, not entirely convincingly, reinstated &quot;Ensete wilsonii&quot;. There is one species in Thailand, somewhat resembling &quot;E. superbum&quot;, that has not been formally described, and possibly other Asian species.

It is possible to separate &quot;Ensete&quot; into its African and Asian species.

;Africa
:&quot;Ensete gilletii&quot; synonym &quot;Ensete livingstonianum&quot; - native range W. Tropical Africa to Malawi
:&quot;Ensete homblei&quot; - native range is SE. DR Congo to N. Zambia
:&quot;Ensete perrieri&quot; – endemic to Madagascar but intriguingly like the Asian &quot;E. glaucum&quot;
:&quot;Ensete ventricosum&quot; – enset or false banana, widely cultivated as a food plant in Ethiopia

;Asia
:&quot;Ensete glaucum&quot; – widespread in Asia from India to Papua New Guinea
:&quot;Ensete superbum&quot; – Western Ghats of India
:&quot;Ensete wilsonii&quot; – Yunnan, China, but doubtfully distinct from &quot;E. glaucum&quot;
:&quot;Ensete&quot; sp. &quot;Thailand&quot; – possibly a new species or a disjunct population of &quot;E. superbum&quot;

=== Extinct species ===
&quot;Ensete oregonense&quot; Clarno Formation, Oregon, United States, Eocene

<text>Jolie Gabor, Countess de Szigethy (born Janka Tilleman; September 30, 1896 – April 1, 1997) was a Hungarian-born American jeweler and socialite, known as the mother of actresses and fellow socialites Magda, Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor.

==Family==

Gabor was born Janka Tilleman on September 30, 1896, in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. Her parents were Jona (or Jónás) Hersch Tilleman (son of Schie Tilleman and Scheindel Grossman) and Chawe Feige (later Franceska) Tilleman (née Reinharz, Reinharcz, or Reinhartz; daughter of Eiseg Reinharz and Dorottya Stein); both of Jolie&#x27;s parents were of Galician Jewish ancestry (Galicia was then part of the Austrian Empire, present-day in Poland and in Ukraine). The Tillemans were jewelers who owned a jewellery shop known as &quot;The Diamond House&quot;. Her father changed his forenames to József. The Tilleman family&#x27;s Jewish descent was also cited by a surgeon, Dr. Laszlo Tauber, also Jewish and a friend and neighbor of the Gabors in Budapest.

The Reinharz family of Gabor&#x27;s mother had established jewelry shops in Vienna; her mother&#x27;s uncle helped the Tillemans open their jewelry business, &quot;The Diamond House&quot;, located at Rákóczi utca 54. in Budapest. Franceska (Josef Tilleman&#x27;s widow), briefly married a medical doctor and general physician, Dr. Miksa Kende (né Kohn), son of Mór Lipót Kohn and Resi Kohn.

Gabor was the aunt of Annette Tilleman (b. 1931), daughter of Jolie&#x27;s brother Sebestyén Tilleman, and wife of Hungarian-American U.S. Representative Tom Lantos (né Lantos Tamás Péter, in Budapest), the first, and to date only, Holocaust survivor to serve in either house of the United States Congress. Szebasztian Tilleman (or Tillemann as his branch of the family style themselves) and his mother, the Tilleman matriarch Franceska, were killed during an apparent Allied bombing raid on Budapest in 1944.

Addressing her birth forename, usually reserved for Hungarian males, Gabor stated, &quot;My parents were so eager to have a son they named me Jancsi, which translated comes out Little John or Johnny&quot;. Her birth certificate, however, indicates her birth name was &quot;Janka&quot;. The third of five surviving children, Gabor&#x27;s siblings comprised three sisters and one brother: Dóra, Eugénia (&quot;Zseni&quot; or &quot;Janette&quot;), Rozália (&quot;Rosalie&quot; or &quot;Rozalie&quot;), and Sebestyén (or Szebasztian; nicknamed &quot;Seb&quot;). A sister, Sydonia, died shortly after birth in 1895. Jolie&#x27;s other sisters are all believed to have survived the war. Rozália emigrated to Australia with her first husband, Emmanuel Reiss. Dóra returned to Hungary, where she and her husband, Hugo Klein, died. Eugénia married Armin Arvay; the surname later anglicized to &quot;Harvey&quot;. 

Although born in 1896, Gabor claimed to have been born in 1900, once jokingly stating that she had lied so much about her age she did not remember her actual birth date. Her obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a birth year of 1900. On a ship&#x27;s passenger manifest dated December 30, 1945, Gabor gave her age as 45 years and two months, which would make her year of birth 1900. Her birth certificate, however, confirms her birth year to be 1896. Author Dominick Dunne stated, in 1995, that Gabor was believed to be 109, which would mean a birth year of approximately 1886. A 1900 year of birth, however, would have made her 13 at the time of her first marriage. 

The 1987 edition of &quot;Biographical Dictionary&quot;, cites Jolie Gabor&#x27;s complete birthdate to be September 29, 1896, as does the 1959 &quot;International Celebrity Register&quot;.

==Career==

In the 1930s, Gabor opened &quot;Crystello&quot;, a shop selling crystal and porcelain in Budapest, as well as &quot;Jolie&#x27;s&quot;, a handmade-costume-jewelry shop at 4 Kígyó utca in Budapest; she also established another branch of that shop in Győr. Eventually there were five such shops in the Budapest area. The firm&#x27;s jewels also incorporated semiprecious stones and were admired for their old-fashioned settings and workmanship.

&quot;Just like Bulgari is known in Rome, that&#x27;s how well-known I was in Budapest&quot;, Jolie once stated. &quot;Jolie&#x27;s did so well that at holiday time they were standing outside in line waiting until somebody goes out from the inside.&quot; The rise of Nazism in Germany forced her to curtail her retail business, Gabor recalled, &quot;Everybody told, &#x27;Jolie is crazy to go now to Berlin and Leipzig for jewelry.&#x27; I never went again.&quot;

She was forced to close the stores when Hungary was occupied by the Germans, at which time she and other family members fled to Portugal. They were assisted by Carlos Sampaio Garrido, Portuguese ambassador to Hungary — Gabor&#x27;s daughter Magda reportedly was either his aide or his mistress — who provided safe passage to many Hungarian Jews in 1944. An article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; stated in 2001 that it was under Sampaio&#x27;s guidance that the family &quot;... had been spirited out of the country ...&quot; Her brother, Sebestyén (or Sebastian), also a jeweler, spent part of the war in labor camps, beginning in 1942, until he and their widowed mother, Franceska, were later killed in a Budapest bombing raid.

Gabor arrived in the United States on December 30, 1945, aged 49. She opened a successful costume jewelry business (called simply &quot;Jolie Gabor&quot;) in New York City in 1946, with $7,200 borrowed from her daughters. It later moved to 699 Madison Avenue. Gabor also established a branch of the firm in Palm Springs, California. Among the company&#x27;s designers were Elsa Beck and Stephen Kelen d&#x27;Oxylion, as well as her own daughter, Magda. One of the saleswomen was Evangelia Callas, mother of future opera diva Maria Callas. In 1953 the store introduced ornamental metal fingernails studded with rhinestones. 

In 1975, almost 80 years old, Jolie signed with the Keene Lecture Bureau as an inspirational speaker. She toured the country speaking about the relationship between beauty and female empowerment.

==Publications==

Gabor lent her name to two books:
* &quot;Jolie Gabor&quot; (Mason Charton, 1975), an as-told-to memoir co-written by Cindy Adams, a newspaper columnist and family friend. Gabor approached Adams to write the book in 1972, even though Gabor fretted that her daughters would dislike the publication. &quot;I am sure it will be a Hungarian tragedy when they read what I have said&quot;, she told Adams. &quot;My husband will throw me out and my daughters won&#x27;t speak to me.&quot; Regarding the book, Gabor told another reporter, &quot;Always [a woman] can do something. She makes a new hairdo, she makes a new make-up. If the nose isn&#x27;t good, she fixes it. That is why I write the book. It&#x27;s never too late for a new look, a new business, a new husband or lover. When we think life is over, it&#x27;s always ready to begin&quot;.
* &quot;Jolie Gabor&#x27;s Family Cookbook&quot; (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1962), which was written with Jean and Ted Kaufman, and contains more than 300 traditional Eastern European recipes.

She is also described, in league with her three very famous daughters and her influence upon them, by Darwin Porter in his award-winning biography, &quot;Those Glamorous Gabors, Bombshells from Budapest&quot; (Blood Moon Productions, 2013).

==Television appearances==

In 1957, Jolie Gabor appeared as a mystery guest on the show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; In 1950, Gabor made a cameo as a jeweler in &quot;Black Jack&quot;. In 1955, Gabor appeared in &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;. In 1960, Gabor appeared in &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot;.

==Marriages==

Gabor was married three times:

:* Vilmos Gábor (b. – div. July 7, 1962), a Hungarian army officer, who achieved the rank of colonel; they married on September 13, 1914, and divorced in 1939. He was the father of her three children: Magda (b. 1915), Zsa Zsa (b. 1917), and Eva Gabor (b. 1919).
:* Howard Peter Christman (b. May 22, 1894 – div. March 1986; &quot;a.k.a.&quot; Peter Howard Christman), a New York City restaurant manager; they married in 1947 and divorced in 1948.
:* Count Odon Szigethy (b. July 12, 1912 – div. September 30, 1989; &quot;a.k.a.&quot; Odon Szigethi, Edmond de Szigethy), a Hungarian refugee; they married in New York City, New York, on March 3, 1957. She wore a gown by Romanian-American fashion designer, Livia Sylva. &quot;He&#x27;s a moneymaker,&quot; Gabor said, in a 1976 interview, of Szigethy, &quot;He takes care of me; he takes care of my business, my three homes in Florida, New York, and Connecticut. When I marry him, darling, he looks younger than me, but now, he looks older.&quot;

==Death==

Gabor was preceded in death by her youngest daughter, Eva, although she apparently was never told of Eva&#x27;s death. She died less than two years later, in Palm Springs, California, of natural causes on April 1, 1997, at age 100. Two months after Jolie&#x27;s death, her eldest daughter, Magda, died. Zsa Zsa died on December 18, 2016, aged 99. Jolie had one grandchild, Francesca Hilton (Zsa Zsa&#x27;s daughter), who died in 2015. Zsa Zsa was reportedly never told about Hilton&#x27;s death.

Gabor de Szigethy is buried in Desert Memorial Park, Cathedral City, California.

<text>Eva Gabor ( ; February 11, 1919 – July 4, 1995) was a Hungarian-American actress and socialite. Gabor voiced Duchess and Miss Bianca in the Disney animations &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990). She was popular in her role on the 1965–1971 television sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot; as Lisa Douglas, the wife of Eddie Albert&#x27;s character Oliver Wendell Douglas. Gabor was an actress in film, on Broadway, and on television. She was also a businesswoman, marketing wigs, clothing, and beauty products. Her elder sisters, Zsa Zsa and Magda Gabor, were also actresses and socialites.

==Early life==
Gabor was born in Budapest, Hungary, the youngest of three daughters of Vilmos Gábor, a soldier, and his wife, trained jeweler Jolie (born Janka Tilleman). Her parents were both from Hungarian Jewish families. She was the first of the sisters to immigrate to the U.S., shortly after her first marriage to a Swedish osteopath, Dr. Eric Drimmer, whom she married in 1937 when she was 18 years old.

==Early career==
Her first movie role was in the U.S. in 1941&#x27;s &quot;Forced Landing&quot; at Paramount Pictures. During the 1950s, she appeared in several feature films, including &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;, starring Elizabeth Taylor; and &quot;Artists and Models,&quot; which featured Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. These roles were bit parts. In 1953, she was given her own television talk show, &quot;The Eva Gabor Show&quot;, which ran for one season (1953–54). Through the rest of the 1950s and early 1960s she appeared on television and in movies. She appeared in one episode of the mystery series &quot;Justice&quot; and was on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; as the &quot;mystery challenger.&quot; Her film appearances during this era included a remake of &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot;, and &quot;It Started with a Kiss.&quot;

==&quot;Green Acres&quot;==

In 1965, Gabor got the role of Lisa Douglas, whose attorney husband Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert) decides to leave the &quot;rat race&quot; of city life. He buys a farm in a rural community, forcing Lisa to leave her beloved big-city urban life. The Paul Henning sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot; aired on CBS. &quot;Green Acres&quot; was set in Hooterville, the same backdrop for &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; (1963–70), and would occasionally cross over with its sister sitcom. Despite proving to be a ratings hit, staying in the top 20 for its first four seasons, &quot;Green Acres&quot;, along with another sister show, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, was cancelled in 1971 in the CBS network&#x27;s &quot;rural purge&quot; — a policy to get rid of the network&#x27;s rural-based television shows.

In 1966, Eva Gabor and Johnny Carson played &quot;Twister&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

==Later career==

In 1972, Gabor launched her eponymous fashion collection with Luis Estévez, a Cuban-born American fashion designer.

Gabor later did voice-over work for Disney movies, providing the European-accented voices of Duchess in &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, and Miss Bianca in &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, as well as the Queen of Time in the Sanrio film &quot;Nutcracker Fantasy&quot;. She was a panelist on the Gene Rayburn-hosted &quot;Match Game&quot;. From 1983 to 1984, she was on the &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; starring Gene Rayburn and Jon Bauman.

Eva appeared as Aunt Renee in the fourth season of “Hart to Hart”, and in 1983, she reunited with Eddie Albert on Broadway as the Grand Duchess Olga Katrina in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;. In 1990, she attempted a TV series comeback in the CBS sitcom pilot &quot;Close Encounters&quot;; the pilot aired as a special that summer, but did not make it to series status. She toured post-communist Hungary after a 40-year absence on an episode of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;.

==Personal life==
Eva Gabor was married five times. She had no biological children:
* Eric Valdemar Drimmer, a Swedish-born masseur turned osteopath and psychologist. They wed in London on June 3, 1937, and divorced in Los Angeles, on February 25, 1942 (the divorce was finalized on March 6); Gabor claimed cruelty, saying, &quot;I wanted to have babies and lead a simple family life but my husband objected to me having children&quot;.
* Charles Isaacs, an American investment broker. They married on September 27, 1943, and divorced on April 2, 1949.
* John Elbert Williams, MD, a plastic surgeon. They married on April 8, 1956, and divorced on March 20, 1957.
* Richard Brown, a textile manufacturer, who later became a writer and director. They married at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 4, 1959, and divorced in Santa Monica, California, in June 1973.
* Frank Gard Jameson Sr., an aerospace executive and former vice president of Rockwell International. They married in the Vivian Webb Chapel of The Webb Schools, Claremont, California on September 21, 1973. Gabor became stepmother to Jameson&#x27;s four children. The couple, however, divorced in 1983. 

Gabor also had a long term on-and off affair with actor Glenn Ford which began during the filming of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot; in 1957. They dated between their marriages and almost married in the early 1970s.

After her final marriage, Gabor was involved in a relationship with TV producer Merv Griffin until her death. Reuters reported that this was a platonic relationship to hide Griffin&#x27;s suspected homosexuality.

==Death==
Gabor died in Los Angeles on Independence Day 1995, from respiratory failure and pneumonia, following a fall in a bathtub in Mexico, where she had been on vacation. Her funeral was held on July 11, 1995, at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills.

The youngest sister, Eva predeceased her elder sisters and her mother. Eldest sister Magda and mother Jolie Gabor both died two years later, in 1997. Elder sister Zsa Zsa died from cardiac arrest on December 18, 2016.

<text>Magdolna &quot;Magda&quot; Gabor (June 11, 1915 – June 6, 1997) was a Hungarian-American socialite and actress, and the elder sister of Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor.

==Early life==
The eldest daughter of a jeweler, Jolie (1896–1997), and a soldier, Vilmos Gábor (1881–1962), she was born in 1915 in Budapest. Her parents were both from Jewish families. She is listed in &quot;Hungary: Jewish Names from the Central Zionist Archives&quot;, under her first married name, as &quot;Magda Bychowsky&quot;.

During World War II, Gabor was reported to have been the fiancée of the Portuguese ambassador to Hungary, Carlos Sampaio Garrido; another source claims she was his mistress and another claims she was his aide. After she fled to Portugal in 1944, following the Nazi occupation of Hungary with Sampaio&#x27;s assistance, she was reportedly the mistress of a Spanish nobleman, José Luis de Vilallonga. Gabor arrived in the United States in February 1946, from Natal, Brazil. Within a year of her arrival she married an American citizen, William Rankin, and remained in the country.

==Marriages==
Gabor was married six times. She was widowed twice, divorced three times, and one marriage was annulled. All the unions were childless. Her husbands, in chronological order, were:
* Jan Bychowsky (m. November 19, 1937 – May 22, 1944; his death), a reputed Polish count and RAF pilot. Gabor gave her name as &quot;Magda de Bychowsky&quot; and her marital status as divorced on a February 11, 1946, airline passenger manifest, accessed on ancestry.com, December 30, 2011; according to this form, she had left her city of residence (Lisbon, Portugal), where she lived at 17 Buenos Aires, and arrived in New York City to visit her family.
* William M. Rankin (m. December 3, 1946 – August 11, 1947; divorced) an American playwright and screenwriter (&quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, among other films); they divorced in Los Angeles in 1947. He was born on March 31, 1900, and died in March 1966.
* Sidney Robert Warren (m. July 14, 1949 – 1950; divorced) an attorney. They married in Riverhead, Long Island, New York, in 1949, and divorced the following year.
* Arthur &quot;Tony&quot; Gallucci (m. April 1, 1956 – January 22, 1967; his death), president of Samuel Gallucci &amp; Son, &quot;one of the oldest building contracting concerns in the United States&quot;. They wed in Franklin, New Jersey. He died of cancer in 1967.
* George Sanders (m. December 5, 1970 – January 6, 1971; annulled) a British actor, who had previously been married to her sister Zsa Zsa. They married in Riverside, California.
* Tibor R. Heltai (m. August 5, 1972 – 1975; divorced) an economic consultant who became a real-estate broker. They married in Southampton, New York, in 1972, separated in June 1973 and divorced two years later in 1975.

==Death==
Gabor died on June 20, 1997, five days before her 82nd birthday and two months after the death of her mother. The cause was kidney failure. She was interred next to her mother in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

<text>Holly Rachel Candy (; born 11 May 1983), known professionally as Holly Valance, is an Australian and British actress, singer and model, and a right-wing political activist.

Valance became well known for her role as Felicity Scully on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; (1999–2002) and later played Nika Volek in &quot;Prison Break&quot; (2005–2006). Her film roles include &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;Pledge This!&quot; (2006), &quot;Taken&quot; (2008), and &quot;Kambakkht Ishq&quot; (2009). Her first album, &quot;Footprints&quot; (2002), provided three top three singles: &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot;, &quot;Down Boy&quot; and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;. The title song of her second and final album, &quot;State of Mind&quot; (2003), was also a UK top ten single. She has become involved in UK and US politics as a prominent supporter and fundraiser for Nigel Farage and Donald Trump.

==Early life==

Holly Valance was born on 11 May 1983, as Holly Rachel Vukadinović, in Fitzroy, Victoria, to a Serbian father from Montenegro, Rajko Vukadinović, and a British mother of English and Spanish descent Rachel (née Stephens) from Southampton. Her father was a former pianist and model in his native Belgrade, Serbia, former Yugoslavia. Her mother, whose father was a relative of comedian Benny Hill, was a model in the United Kingdom. 
Valance&#x27;s parents divorced in 1986. Valance has a sister, Coco. Rajko later remarried and Holly has a half-sister, Olympia, who has also acted in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Paige Smith (2014–2018, 2020, 2022). In Melbourne Rajko ran a &quot;trendy imported European clothes store&quot;. 

Valance started modelling as a teenager, when &quot;she posed for supermarket catalogues and ad campaigns and by 14 she was earning $200 an hour modelling children&#x27;s clothes and teenage lingerie.&quot; She grew up in Melbourne and moved to the UK when she was 18; she holds both Australian and British citizenship. After two years she moved to Los Angeles, where she spent seven years before returning to the United Kingdom.

==Career==
===1999–2003: &quot;Neighbours&quot; and music===
In 1999 at age 16, Valance was cast in the Australian TV soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, as Felicity &quot;Flick&quot; Scully. Soon after gaining the role she left her Catholic school, &quot;where girls were given detention for wearing make-up or having a hem above the knee.&quot; She appeared in Human Nature&#x27;s music video for &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; (November 2000), &quot;in a raunchy shower scene.&quot; Valance left &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 2002 to start her music career. Her first single, released in April 2002, was &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot;, an English language cover version of Turkish singer, Tarkan&#x27;s &quot;Şımarık&quot;. It entered both the ARIA Singles and UK Singles Charts at No. 1. It charted in the top ten in seventeen countries, and went to number one in North Macedonia. The song was nominated for four ARIA Music Awards in 2002.

Valance&#x27;s second single, &quot;Down Boy&quot; (September), peaked at No. 2 in the UK and No. 3 in Australia.

===2013–present: Hiatus and other projects===
In 2013, Valance took a hiatus from her artistic career to prioritise her family, and has since been doing charity work as Ambassador of The Children&#x27;s Trust, the UK&#x27;s leading charity for children with brain injury and neurodisability. Since then, her only new role has been an appearance in the movie &quot;Red Herring&quot;, released in 2015 and shot in 2013. On 28 July 2022, Valance was seen in a cameo appearance as Felicity Scully, in what was intended to be the final-ever &quot;Neighbours&quot; episode. Her appearance was filmed in the UK alongside that of Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s character, Beth Brennan.

==Personal life==
From 2005 to 2009, Valance dated Australian actor Alex O&#x27;Loughlin. In 2010, she started dating British property developer Nick Candy, whom she married on 29 September 2012 in Beverly Hills, California. The couple have two daughters. The first was born in November 2013. and the second in September 2017

=== Political views ===
In February 2024, Valance attended the launch of the new British conservative movement Popular Conservatism, led by former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss. In a series of clips posted on X (formerly known as Twitter), Valance was interviewed by Christopher Hope of GB News, and was asked about her views on various issues. Her view on &quot;the climate crisis or lack of&quot; was that &quot;cleaner, cheaper energy is what we need&quot;. Asked about her political views, she said, &quot;I would say that everyone starts off as a leftie and then wakes up at some point after making money, working, trying to run a business, trying to buy a home then realises what crap ideas they all are, and then you go to the right.&quot; Valance said her top political priority was Britain leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and the establishment of a British bill of rights, adding that &quot;the trickle-down effect would be a huge step in the right direction&quot;.

A close personal friend of Nigel Farage, Valance said she persuaded him to stand for Parliament in the 2024 general election. In a 2024 interview she stated she was a member of Reform UK and would be voting for them in the general election. She said, &quot;I support anybody that sticks to what they believe in and isn&#x27;t a turncoat, and doesn&#x27;t do a million flip-flops and U-turns.&quot; She helped the party raise £1.5 million within days of Farage&#x27;s return as leader, and has donated approximately £100,000 herself. In December 2024 it was announced that Valance&#x27;s husband would become treasurer of Reform UK.

Having previously stayed at Donald Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago resort, in 2024 she became the &quot;UK poster girl&quot; for Trump&#x27;s US presidential campaign, and co-hosted a large fundraiser in London on 11 June.

===Legal issues===
In January 2002, Valance dismissed her then-manager Scott Michaelson by telephone, 15 months before his contract was due to expire. In 2003, Michaelson&#x27;s company sued Valance&#x27;s company for breach of contract, won the case and was awarded damages by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. During the trial, Valance&#x27;s mother said Michaelson had been negligent as a manager, which forced her to take over from him. The former &quot;Neighbours&quot; cast member Kym Valentine also gave evidence that Valance &quot;said she was feeling bad, a bit stressed out, because she was leaving Scott&quot; and that &quot;she said the solicitors for her record company would get her out of the contract and would be faxing him the paper work (from the UK) to do so.&quot; In court, Valance denied that she had said this to Valentine, even though she had signed an affidavit stating she had no recollection of the conversation.

Justice Clifford Einstein declared that Valence&#x27;s company had showed *a calculated disregard of the rights of [Michaelson&#x27;s company] Biscayne as well as a cynical pursuit of benefit&quot;. The court ordered Valance&#x27;s company to pay Michaelson&#x27;s company $350,000 including $47,264.56 &quot;from shares Ms Valance and Mr Michaelson had bought together on the London Stock Exchange&quot;,: Michaelson&#x27;s application for a percentage of profits from sales of her album &quot;State of Mind&quot; was denied.

<doc id="152916" wikidata="Q1752846" url="?curid=152916" title="Nipper">
<text>Nipper (1884 – September 1895) was a British dog. He is best known as the subject of the 1898 painting &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;, painted posthumously by his owner Francis Barraud. 

== Background ==
Nipper was born in 1884 in Bristol, England, and died in September 1895. He was likely a mixed-breed dog, although most early sources suggest that he was a Smooth Fox Terrier, or perhaps a Jack Russell Terrier, or possibly &quot;part Bull Terrier&quot;. He was named Nipper because he would often &quot;nip&quot; at the backs of visitors&#x27; legs.

Nipper originally lived with his owner, Mark Henry Barraud, in the Prince&#x27;s Theatre where Barraud was a scenery designer. When Barraud died in 1887, his brothers Philip and Francis took care of the dog, then Francis took Nipper to Liverpool, and later to Mark&#x27;s widow in Kingston upon Thames, London. Nipper died of natural causes in 1895 and was buried in Kingston upon Thames at Clarence Street, in a small park surrounded by magnolia trees.

==His Master&#x27;s Voice==

In 1898, three years after Nipper&#x27;s death, Francis Barraud, the brother of Nipper&#x27;s original owner, painted a picture of the dog listening intently to an Edison-Bell cylinder phonograph. Thinking the Edison-Bell Company located in New Jersey, United States, might be interested in the painting, he offered it to James E. Hough, Edison-Bell&#x27;s British representative, who promptly replied, &quot;Dogs don&#x27;t listen to phonographs&quot;.

On 31 May 1899, Barraud visited the Maiden Lane offices of The Gramophone Company to inquire about borrowing a brass horn to replace the original black horn in order to brighten up the painting. When Gramophone Company founder and manager William Barry Owen was shown the painting, he suggested that if the artist painted out the cylinder machine and replaced it with a Berliner disc gramophone, he would buy the painting. Barraud obliged. The slogan &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;, along with the painting, was sold to The Gramophone Company for £100 () – half for the copyright and half for the physical painting itself. The original oil painting hung in The Gramophone Company&#x27;s headquarters, and then in EMI&#x27;s boardroom in Hayes, Middlesex for many years. It appears that after the image was copyrighted, two employees of the Gramophone Company, William Sinkler Darby and Theodore Bernard Birnbaum, recorded a Mutoscope in 1900 entitled &#x27;Nipper runs amok!&#x27;. A similar looking dog was used to act as Nipper.

The Gramophone Company did not begin using Nipper&#x27;s image on its record labels until 1909. The Gramophone Company&#x27;s American affiliate the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor), registered the trademark for use in the United States on 10 July 1900, with it entering into use in 1901, and used the dog and Gramophone on its products and advertising.

== Legacy ==
As time progressed, Nipper&#x27;s resting place was built upon, and a branch of Lloyds Bank now occupies the site. On the wall of the bank, just inside the entrance, a brass plaque commemorates the site as Nipper&#x27;s resting place.

Nipper&#x27;s likeness has been reproduced into pocket watches, salt and pepper shakers, paperweights, cigar lighters, stuffed toys, coin banks, coffee mugs, T-shirts, neckties and clocks. These advertising items have long been popular collectables. 

A depiction of Nipper appeared in RCA television advertisements, and later versions with his &quot;son&quot;, a puppy named Chipper who was added to the RCA family in 1991. Real dogs played the roles of Nipper and Chipper, but Chipper had to be replaced much more frequently, since his character is a puppy.

A Baltimore street leading to a development of town-houses is named Nipper Way, where a statue of Nipper resided for a brief time before being relocated.

On 10 March 2010, a small road near to the dog&#x27;s final resting place in Kingston upon Thames was officially named Nipper Alley.

Statues

A four-ton Nipper can be seen on the roof of the former RCA distribution building now owned by Arnoff Moving &amp; Storage. The site is located at 991 Broadway in Albany, New York. 

A statue of Nipper was purchased by Jim Wells from RCA in Baltimore for $1, where it originally graced the former RCA Building on Russell Street. After spending many years on private property in Nipper Park in Merrifield, Virginia, perched over Lee Highway (U.S. Route 29), it has now been returned to Baltimore, Maryland. Nipper now sits atop the Maryland Historical Society building at Park Avenue and West Centre Street in Baltimore, and the statue now includes a gramophone.

A small statue of Nipper in the United Kingdom can be seen perched above a doorway in the Merchant Venturers Building on the corner of Park Row and Woodland Road in Bristol; this building, part of the University of Bristol, stands near the site of the old Prince&#x27;s Theatre.

In Orlando, Florida, at Walt Disney World, a replication of Nipper with a gramophone appeared inside of a spaceship on the Space Mountain rollercoaster, and remained until the sponsorship from RCA to Walt Disney ended, upon which he was made into a robot dog and moved elsewhere within the queue.

Various reproductions of Nipper can be found in the permanent exhibition of the in Montreal, Quebec, a museum dedicated to the work of Emile Berliner and his companies that Nipper was the face of.

In 1984, a life-sized ornament of Nipper appears in the music video of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s song &quot;Time After Time&quot;.

In May 2017, the City of Albany held a contest for various groups or artists to submit designs for creative, painted Nipper statues which were placed throughout the city. Ten of the contestants were chosen to create ten Nipper statues – which were displayed for one year and then auctioned off for charity.

<doc id="152917" wikidata="Q3747851" url="?curid=152917" title="Footprints (Holly Valance album)">
<text>Footprints is the debut studio album by Australian singer Holly Valance. It was released by London Records on 14 October 2002 in the United Kingdom. Valance worked with a variety of producers on the album, including Cutfather &amp; Joe, Julian Gallagher, Jem Godfrey, Nellee Hooper, Bill Padley, Richard Stannard, and Phil Thornalley.

The album was a success in the United Kingdom, where the first single &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot; reached the top position on the singles chart. &quot;Footprints&quot; peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, selling over 100,000 copies and being certified Gold. In Valance&#x27;s home country of Australia, success was similar. &quot;Footprints&quot; reached the top fifteen, sold over 35,000 copies, and was later certified Gold. All three of its singles also reached the top 3 on the singles chart. &quot;Footprints&quot; was also successful in Japan, where the album reached number nineteen on the Oricon albums chart and sold 159,606 copies. It was later certified Gold.

==Critical reception==

Allmusic rated the album three and a half stars out of five. Caroline Sullivan from &quot;The Guardian&quot; found that Valance&#x27;s &quot;Kylie impersonation lacks the self-deprecating charm of the original, without which this &quot;project&quot; feels like an ambitious soap starlet chancing her arm. Despite producer Nellee Hooper affixing a bit of acoustic gravitas to the likes of &quot;Down Boy,&quot; &quot;Footprints&quot; quickly comes up against Valance&#x27;s breathy mediocrity. That said, the burbling &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; makes it clear that Valance&#x27;s primary purpose is to disturb impressionable men, making the album a triumph in that respect.&quot;

In 2020, the album was reappraised by Louis Hanson, writing for &quot;Pedestrian&quot;. Hanson praised the album&#x27;s &quot;nostalgic futurism&quot; and &quot;there was something so fresh about the album’s sound, particularly in the Australian music industry at the time.&quot; He continued: &quot;To listen to &quot;Footprints&quot; in 2020 is to experience pure early-2000s pop in all its glory.&quot;

==Singles==
&quot;Kiss Kiss&quot; was the first single released by Valance. The single was released in April 2002 and went straight to No. 1 on the UK and Australian charts.

&quot;Down Boy&quot; was the second single.

&quot;Naughty Girl&quot; was the third and final single from the album, becoming a Top 3 hit in Australia and Top 20 single in the UK. A fourth and final single, &quot;Tuck Your Shirt In&quot;, was scheduled for release in the UK on 10 March 2003; however, the single was cancelled.

<doc id="152918" wikidata="Q5050691" url="?curid=152918" title="Castor Cracking Group">
<text>Castor Cracking Group (CCG) was a demo group from Sweden, and were active on the ZX Spectrum during 1986–1988. They were one of the first groups for the ZX Spectrum with their release of &quot;Castor Intro&quot; early in 1986.

Originally they named themselves after Castor in the constellation Gemini, but despite having &quot;Crack&quot; in their name, they actually (at least according to themselves) never cracked any software.

Technically, their demos were not very advanced – they even programmed many of them in BASIC and compiled the result for release. However, their significance lies in their early entry onto the scene.

<doc id="152925" wikidata="Q678251" url="?curid=152925" title="Waverley (novel)">
<text>Waverley; or, ’Tis Sixty Years Since is a historical novel by Walter Scott (1771–1832). Scott was already famous as a poet, and chose to publish &quot;Waverley&quot; anonymously in 1814 as his first venture into prose fiction. It is often regarded as one of the first historical novels in the Western tradition.

Edward Waverley, a young English gentleman, is commissioned into a Scottish regiment shortly before the Jacobite rising of 1745. He goes on leave to visit a family friend, the Baron of Bradwardine, and is shocked to find that Bradwardine and his followers are supporters of Charles Edward Stuart, the exiled Jacobite prince. Waverley is forced to choose between his loyalty to the Crown and his admiration for the Jacobites&#x27; romantic cause. His gentlemanly actions gain him friends in this precarious situation, on both sides of the rising, who stand him in good stead when the Jacobites are eventually defeated.

Scott chose to publish his later novels as being &quot;by the author of &quot;Waverley&quot;&quot;. In a letter shortly after publication, Scott writes: &quot;I shall not own &quot;Waverley&quot;; my chief reason is that it would prevent me of the pleasure of writing again.&quot; His series of works on similar themes written during the same period have become collectively known as the &quot;Waverley Novels&quot;. The novel was well received by contemporary critics, and well-liked by those who purchased novels in the early 19th century. It has continued in favour with later critics.

In 1818 Scott was granted a baronetcy, becoming Sir Walter Scott. It was an open secret that he was &quot;the author of &quot;Waverley&quot;&quot;, and he admitted this at a public dinner in 1827.

==Composition and sources==
Evidence about the composition of the first volume of &quot;Waverley&quot; is inconclusive, but it was probably begun in 1808 and laid aside, continued in 1810 and again laid aside, and eventually taken up and completed in the later part of 1813. The second and third volumes were written in the spring and early summer of 1814. Scott had an intimate acquaintance with Jacobite history, and &quot;Waverley&quot; draws on an extensive range of anecdotal and historical literary material. He had talked to people who had been involved in the 1745 uprising, or to those who had known them. He drew on the resources of his extensive library for relevant printed material. Among the most consistently helpful books were: 
* John Home, &quot;The History of the Rebellion in the Year 1745&quot; (1802)
* Edmund Burt, &quot;Letters from a Gentleman in the North of Scotland&quot; (1754)
* Donald Macintosh, &quot;A Collection of Gaelic Proverbs, and Familiar Phrases&quot; (1785).

==Editions==
The first edition of &quot;Waverley&quot;, in three volumes, consisting of 1000 copies, was published in Edinburgh on 7 July 1814 by Archibald Constable and Co. and in London later in the month by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827, publication was anonymous. The price was one guinea (£1.05). The first edition was followed by two further editions, together comprising 4000 copies, in the same year, with small authorial revisions, and by several more editions extending into the early 1820s: Scott was involved in at least one of these, the sixth edition of 1816. In early 1826 Scott returned to &quot;Waverley&quot;, revising the text and writing an introduction and notes for a complete edition of the Waverley Novels: this took some time to materialise after the 1826 financial crash, but eventually the novel appeared as the first and second volumes of the &quot;Magnum&quot; edition in June and July 1829.

The first critical edition, by Claire Lamont, was published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in 1981. The standard edition is now that edited by P. D. Garside in 2007, as the first volume of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels: this is based on the first edition with emendations to restore authorial readings from the manuscript and the second and third editions. The new Magnum material is included in Volume 25a.

==Plot==

===Background===
It is the time of the Jacobite uprising of 1745 which sought to restore the Stuart dynasty in the person of Charles Edward Stuart, known as &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;. A young English dreamer and soldier, Edward Waverley, is sent to Scotland that year. He journeys north from his aristocratic family home, Waverley-Honour, in the south of England, first to the Scottish Lowlands and the home of family friend Baron Bradwardine, then into the Highlands and the heart of the rebellion and its aftermath.

===Plot summary===
Edward is at ease in the family estate owned by his uncle, Sir Everard Waverley, who maintains the family&#x27;s traditional Tory and Jacobite sympathies. He spends time with his parents as well, though less time after his mother dies when he is about 12 or 13 years old. His Whig father works for the Hanoverian government in nearby Westminster. Edward has a sense of his honour, but he starts life with no political affiliation. Edward is given a commission in the Hanoverian army by his father and posted to Dundee. After some military training, he takes leave to visit the Baron of Bradwardine, a friend of his uncle, and meets the baron&#x27;s lovely daughter Rose.
When wild Highlanders visit Bradwardine&#x27;s castle, Edward is intrigued and goes to the mountain lair of the Clan Mac-Ivor, meeting the Chieftain Fergus and his sister Flora, who turn out to be active Jacobites preparing for the insurrection. Edward has overstayed his leave and is accused of desertion and treason, then arrested. The highlanders rescue him from his escort and take him to the Jacobite stronghold at Doune Castle, then on to Holyrood Palace, where he meets Bonnie Prince Charlie, with whom he is charmed.

Encouraged by the beautiful Flora Mac-Ivor, Edward goes over to the Jacobite cause and takes part in the Battle of Prestonpans of September 1745. The battle is recounted in some detail. Undaunted by the light, inaccurate guns, the Highlander army continues its charge; however, the centre becomes bogged down in marshy land, and in driving forward the men&#x27;s different speeds of advance cause them to form into a &quot;V&quot;. One of the soldiers who tumbles into the marsh is the Hanoverian Colonel Talbot, whom Waverley picks up on his horse, saving his life. This man is a close friend of his Waverley uncle. Edward gets separated from Fergus and both their bands in one battle that the government troops were winning. Edward finds local people who take him in until he can leave safely after events are calmer and the snows are gone. He sees a newspaper that informs him that his father has died, so he heads to London.

When the Jacobite cause fails in 1746, Talbot intervenes to get Edward a pardon. Edward visits the decrepit estate of Baron Bradwardine, attacked by soldiers. After making contact with the baron, he asks for his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage, and soon is the established lover of Rose. The baron is also pardoned. Edward seeks Flora the day before her brother&#x27;s trial; she plans to join a convent in France. Edward then attends the trial in Carlisle at which Fergus Mac-Ivor is condemned to death, and is with him in the hours before his execution. Edward then returns to his uncle and aunt on the Waverley Honour and begins preparations for their wedding and also to make the legal appearances to assure the pardons of Edward and his future father-in-law. The Talbots restore the Baron&#x27;s estate, taken from him for his Jacobite activities, and repair it completely, restored to the original appearance with Bradwardine&#x27;s family crests.

Ch. 2 Waverley Honour.—A Retrospect: Edward Waverley&#x27;s father Richard defects to the Whigs, which almost leads his older brother Sir Everard, a confirmed Tory and bachelor, to disinherit him and his family, but he has second thoughts and warms to Edward as a young boy.

Ch. 3 Education: Transferred to Sir Everard&#x27;s seat, Waverley-Honour, to be educated by his chaplain Mr Pembroke, Edward is allowed to follow a lively but undisciplined course of reading which stimulates his imagination rather than benefiting his understanding.

==Themes and motifs==

===Tolerance===
Scott&#x27;s work shows the influence of the 18th-century Enlightenment. He believed every human was basically decent regardless of class, religion, politics, or ancestry. Tolerance is a major theme in his historical works. The &quot;Waverley Novels&quot; express his belief in the need for social progress that does not reject the traditions of the past. &quot;He was the first novelist to portray peasant characters sympathetically and realistically, and was equally just to merchants, soldiers, and even kings.&quot;

According to L J Swingle, discussing the writers of the Romantic period:

This inquiry as to the distinctive natures of different things explains why particular mental orientations or crucial turns of thought in the literature of the period are frequently marked by some kind of &quot;species&quot; identification. Probably the most dramatic example occurs in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, when the title character -- after wavering between opposed truth-possibilities in a manner that recalls Scott&#x27;s Edward Waverley -- finally finds himself (literally) in identification with his own species

===Heroines===
The literary critic Alexander Welsh suggests that Scott exhibits similar preoccupations within his own novels. The heroines of the &quot;Waverley&quot; series of novels have been divided into two types: the blonde and the brunette, along the lines of fairness and darkness that marks Shakespearean drama, but in a much more moderate form. Welsh writes:

The proper heroine of Scott is a blonde. Her role corresponds to that of the passive hero – whom, indeed, she marries at the end. She is eminently beautiful, and eminently prudent. Like the passive hero, she suffers in the thick of events but seldom moves them. The several dark heroines, no less beautiful, are less restrained from the pressure of their own feelings...They allow their feelings to dictate to their reason, and seem to symbolize passion itself.

This is evident in &quot;Waverley&quot;. Rose is eminently marriageable; Flora is eminently passionate. However, we should also note that Welsh is, first, establishing a typology, which in part is age-old, but is also reinforced throughout the Waverley Novels, second, that Scott, or his narrators, allow the female characters thoughts, feelings and passions that are often ignored or unacknowledged by the heroes, such as Waverley.

A different interpretation of character is provided by Merryn Williams. Recognising the passivity of the hero, she argues that Scott&#x27;s women were thoroughly acceptable to nineteenth-century readers. They are – usually – morally stronger than men, but they do not defy them, and their self-sacrifice &quot;to even the appearance of duty&quot; has no limits. Thus, Flora will defy Waverley but not Fergus to any significant extent, and has some room to manoeuvre, even though limited, only after the latter&#x27;s death.

Yet another view considers Flora to be the woman representing the past, while Rose symbolises a modern rational Scotland in the post-Union settlement.

===Humour===
The opening five chapters of &quot;Waverley&quot; are often thought to be dour and uninteresting, an impression in part due to Scott&#x27;s own comments on them at the end of chapter five. However, John Buchan thought the novel a &quot;riot of fun and eccentricity&quot;, seemingly a minority opinion. Scott does, however, attempt to be comic, or at least to follow the conventions of the picaresque novel. The comments on the relay of information via Dyers Weekly Letter, the self-explanatory name of the lawyer, Clippurse, Sir Everard&#x27;s desire and courting of the youngest sister, Lady Emily, all point in this direction.

Scott uses a common humorous reference to the Old Testament story that David and supporting malcontents took refuge from Saul in a cave near the town of Adullam. When the Jacobite army marches south through the North of England, they are greeted with distrust rather than the anticipated support from English Jacobites or Tories. Eventually a few diehards or desperate individuals do join them, and the Baron of Bradwardine welcomes these recruits while remarking that they closely resemble David&#x27;s followers at the Cave of Adullam; &quot;&quot;videlicet&quot;, every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, which the vulgate renders bitter of soul; and doubtless&quot; he said &quot;they will prove mighty men of their hands, and there is much need that they should, for I have seen many a sour look cast upon us.&quot;

===Fear of civil war===
The division in the Waverley family had been caused by the English Civil War of the mid-seventeenth century. Fear of civil war is ever-present in Waverley not just as subject matter or historical reality, but a primal fear as deep in Scott as in Shakespeare as manifested by various allusions throughout the novel and by direct references to &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Henry VI&quot; in chapter 71.

===Quixotism===
As Scott describes him, Edward Waverley is like Don Quixote in his manner of educating himself by much reading, but as &quot;an unstructured education&quot;, and as Scott says in the novel &quot;consisting of much curious, though ill-arranged and miscellaneous information.&quot; Critics of Scott&#x27;s novels did not see the influence of Miguel de Cervantes in the same way as Scott describes it. Scott further clarifies the degree of this similarity to Quixote in the novel, in his instructions to his readers that:

From the minuteness with which I have traced Waverley&#x27;s pursuits, and the bias which they unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader may perhaps anticipate, in the following tale, an imitation of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author, in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring.

==Reception==

===19th century===
Upon publication, &quot;Waverley&quot; had an astonishing success. Almost all of the reviewers of &quot;Waverley&quot; were favourable, praising the truth to nature of the characters (both major and minor) and manners. Adverse criticisms were more diverse. &quot;The Anti-Jacobin Review&quot; and &quot;The Critical Review&quot; considered the work too Scottish, and the latter (assuming Scott&#x27;s authorship) thought it odd for an established poet to become a &#x27;scribbler&#x27; while &quot;The New Annual Register&quot; found it less interesting than might have been expected from his hand. &quot;The British Critic&quot; detected a tendency to caricature and broad farce. &quot;The Scourge&quot; thought the novel lacked pathos and sublimity. In &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot; John Wilson Croker, writing anonymously like all the reviewers, compared it to Dutch paintings, congenial rather than exalted, and advised the author to stick to history, while &quot;The Scourge&quot; considered that Scott did not take readers beyond their usual susceptibilities. Francis Jeffrey in &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot; found the work hastily and often indifferently written and judged those passages where the author addresses the reader directly flippant and unworthy. &quot;Waverley&quot; was published anonymously, but half of the reviews ascribed it with varying degrees of certainty to Scott. Many readers too recognized his hand. Contemporary author Jane Austen wrote: &quot;Walter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. It is not fair. He has Fame and Profit enough as a Poet, and should not be taking the bread out of other people&#x27;s mouths. I do not like him, and do not mean to like &quot;Waverley&quot; if I can help it but fear I must&quot;.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon was a great admirer of Scott and one of her poetical illustrations () relates to a painting by Daniel Maclise of &quot;The Hall of Glennaquoich. A Highland Feast&quot;, a scene taken from &quot;Waverley&quot;.

In Eckermann&#x27;s &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot;, Goethe lauded &quot;Waverley&quot; as &quot;the best novel by Sir Walter Scott,&quot; and he asserted that Scott &quot;has never written anything to surpass, or even equal, that first published novel.&quot; He regarded Scott as a genius and as one of the greatest writers of English of his time, along with Lord Byron and Thomas Moore. Discussing Scott&#x27;s talent as a writer, Goethe stated, &quot;You will find everywhere in Walter Scott a remarkable security and thoroughness in his delineation, which proceeds from his comprehensive knowledge of the real world, obtained by lifelong studies and observations, and a daily discussion of the most important relations.&quot;

In 1815, Scott was given the honour of dining with George, Prince Regent, who wanted to meet &quot;the author of Waverley&quot;. It is thought that at this meeting Scott persuaded George that as a Stuart prince he could claim to be a Jacobite Highland Chieftain, a claim that would be dramatised when George became King and visited Scotland.

===20th century===
E. M. Forster is renowned as one of Scott&#x27;s fiercest and unkindest critics. His critique has received fierce opposition from Scott scholars, who believe his attack is a symptom of his ignorance, perhaps of literature, but more certainly of all things Scottish. This hostility reaches academic circles, as is made evident by Allan Massie&#x27;s lecture &quot;The Appeal of Scott to the Practising Novel&quot;, the inaugural lecture at the 1991 Scott conference. Defence of Scott subsumes a defence of a national culture against the attacks of Englishness. Others have, however, suggested that this misrepresents Forster&#x27;s case.

Georg Lukács re-established Scott as a serious novelist. Lukács is most adamant in his belief that &quot;Waverley&quot; is the first major historical novel of modern times. This is clear from the distinction he draws between the eighteenth-century novel of manners, where social realities are described with little attention to diachronic change, and the eruption of history in the lives of communities, as occurs in historical novels. Furthermore, that &quot;Waverley&quot; marks an important watershed is firmly stated in Lukács&#x27; opening sentence, that &quot;The historical novel arose at the beginning of the nineteenth century at about the time of Napoleon&#x27;s collapse.&quot;

==Namesakes==
*Waverley Station in Edinburgh takes its name from the novel, as did the streets Waverley Park and Waverley Place, the Waverley Line between Edinburgh and Carlisle. The Scott Monument is near the station.
*A succession of paddle steamers have been named after the novel, culminating in the present PS &quot;Waverley&quot;
*Waverly Place in Greenwich Village, New York City, was named for the novel in 1833, a year after Scott&#x27;s death, though the name was misspelled.
*The Waverley Pen made by MacNiven &amp; Cameron of Edinburgh was named after the novel, after the Waverley nib was first made in 1850. The pen was marketed from 1864.
*The town of Waverley, New Zealand also takes its name from the novel.
*In the United States, the following communities were named after the novel:
**Waverly, Alabama
**Waverly, Florida
**Waverly Hall, Georgia
**Waverly, Iowa

**Waverly, Missouri
**Waverly, Nebraska (several of its street names also get their name from the novel)
**Waverly, New York
**Waverly, Ohio
**Waverly, Pennsylvania
**Waverly, Tennessee
**Waverly, Virginia
*The Waverley (West Point, Mississippi) mansion was named after the novel.
*Waverly (Marriottsville, Maryland), a 1700s slave plantation in America.
*Waverley, Sydney New South Wales, Australia Waverley takes its name from a home built near Old South Head Road in 1827 by Barnett Levey (or Levy) (1798–1837). It was named Waverley House, after the title of his favourite book, Waverley, by author Sir Walter Scott. Waverley Municipality was proclaimed in June 1859. The house was a distinctive landmark and gave its name to the surrounding suburb.
*The neighbouring suburbs of Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley in Melbourne, Australia.
*The village of Waverley, Nova Scotia, Canada was named by American immigrant businessman Charles P. Allen after the Book.

==Miscellany==
*The character of &quot;Fergus Mac-Ivor&quot; in &quot;Waverley&quot; was drawn from the flamboyant Chieftain Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry. During the King&#x27;s visit to Scotland, Glengarry made several dramatic unplanned intrusions on the pageantry.
*The proposition &quot;Scott is the author of Waverley&quot; is one of the examples whose meaning Bertrand Russell studied in his paper &quot;On Denoting&quot;.
*The character of Davie Gellatley, who is described as &quot;an innocent&quot; or a &quot;fool&quot;, is thought to be based on Jamie Fleeman, the Laird of Udny&#x27;s Fool.

<text>Farnham is a market town and civil parish in Surrey, England, around southwest of London. It is in the Borough of Waverley, close to the county border with Hampshire. The town is on the north branch of the River Wey, a tributary of the Thames, and is at the western end of the North Downs. The civil parish, which includes the villages of Badshot Lea, Hale and Wrecclesham, covers and had a population of 39,488 in 2011.

Among the prehistoric objects from the area is a woolly mammoth tusk, excavated in Badshot Lea at the start of the 21st century. The earliest evidence of human activity is from the Neolithic and, during the Roman period, tile making took place close to the town centre. The name &quot;Farnham&quot; is of Saxon origin and is generally agreed to mean &quot;meadow where ferns grow&quot;. From at least 803, the settlement was under the control of the Bishops of Winchester and the castle was built as a residence for Bishop Henry de Blois in 1138. Henry VIII is thought to have spent part of his childhood under the care of Bishop Richard Foxe and is known to have lived at Farnham Castle when he was 16.

In the late medieval period, the primary local industry was the production of kersey, a coarse, woollen cloth. In the early modern period, the town&#x27;s weekly corn market was said to the second largest in England after London. Between 1600 and the 1970s, the area was a centre for growing hops and for the brewing industry. The town began to expand in the early Victorian period, stimulated in part by the opening of the railway in 1849 and the arrival of the army in nearby Aldershot in 1855. Farnham became an Urban District in 1894, but under the Local Government Act 1972, it became part of the Borough of Waverley. The civil parish and town council were created in 1984.

The Farnham area has long been associated with the creative arts and with pottery making in particular. One of three campuses of the University for the Creative Arts is to the west of the centre and there are numerous works of public art on display in the town. Notable buildings in the civil parish include the ruins of Waverley Abbey and the 18th century Willmer House, now the location of the Museum of Farnham. Politician William Cobbett and writer George Sturt were both born in Farnham, as was Maud Gonne, the Irish republican suffragette. More recent residents have included the watercolour artist, William Herbert Allen, the Formula One driver, Mike Hawthorn, the England cricketer, Graham Thorpe, and the England rugby union captain, Jonny Wilkinson.

==Toponymy==
The oldest surviving record of Farnham is from a copy of a
 charter, in which the settlement appears as &quot;Fernham&quot;. The name is written as &quot;Fearnhamme&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; from and as &quot;Ferneham&quot; in Domesday Book. The town first appears with its modern spelling &quot;Farnham&quot; in 1233. The name is thought to derive from the Old English words &quot;fearn&quot; and &quot;ham&quot; and is generally agreed to mean &quot;homestead or enclosure where ferns grow&quot;. Alternatively the second part could derive from &quot;hamm&quot;, meaning &quot;river meadow&quot;.

==Geography==

Farnham&#x27;s history and present status are mainly the result of its geography; a combination of river, streams, fresh water springs and varied soils, together with a temperate climate, was attractive in prehistoric times. The geology of the area continues to influence the town, both in terms of communications, scenic and botanic variety and the main local industries of agriculture and minerals extraction. Farnham Geological Society is an active organisation in the town, and the Museum of Farnham has a collection of geological samples and fossils.

Farnham lies in the valley of the North Branch of the River Wey, which rises near Alton, merges with the South Branch at Tilford, and joins the River Thames at Weybridge. The mainly east–west alignment of the ridges and valleys has influenced the development of road and rail communications. The most prominent geological feature is the chalk of the North Downs which forms a ridge (the Hog&#x27;s Back) to the east of the town, and continues through Farnham Park to the north of the town centre, and westwards to form the Hampshire Downs. The land rises to more than above sea level (ASL) to the north of the town at Caesar&#x27;s Camp which, with the northern part of the park, lies on gravel beds. There are a number of swallow holes in the park where this stratum meets the chalk. The historic core of the town lies on gravel beds at an altitude of roughly 70 metres (230 ft) ASL on an underlying geology of Gault Clay and Upper Greensand and the southern part of the town rises to more than on the Lower Greensand.

===Climate===
Farnham has a temperate maritime climate, free from extreme temperatures, with moderate rainfall and often breezy conditions. The nearest official weather station to Farnham is Alice Holt Lodge, just under southwest of the town centre.

The highest temperature recorded was , in July 2006. In an &#x27;average&#x27; year, the warmest day would reach , with 18.1 days attaining a temperature of or higher.

The lowest temperature recorded was in February 1986. On average, 57.7 nights of the year will register an air frost.

Annual rainfall averages 821mm, with at least 1mm of rain reported on 126.0 days. All averages refer to the 1991–2020 observation period.

==History==
===Prehistory===
====Stone Age====
Farnham&#x27;s history extends back hundreds of thousands of years to the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic or early Stone Age, on the basis of stone tools such as many Handaxes found around the town. Most of these were collected by antiquarians in the later 19th and early 20th Century. Additionally prehistoric animal bones, sometimes found together with the aforementioned flint tools in deep gravel pits such as a woolly mammoth tusk, excavated in Badshot Lea at the start of the 21st century. The first known settlement in the area was in the Mesolithic period, some 7,000 years ago; a cluster of pit dwellings and evidence of a flint-knapping industry from that period has been excavated a short distance to the east of the town. There was a Neolithic long barrow at nearby Badshot Lea, now destroyed by quarrying. This monument lay on the route of the prehistoric trackway known as the Harrow Way or Harroway, which passes through Farnham Park, and a sarsen stone still stands nearby, which is believed to have marked the safe crossing point of a marshy area near the present Shepherd and Flock roundabout.

====Bronze Age====
Occupation of the area continued to grow through the Bronze Age. Two bronze hoards have been discovered on Crooksbury Hill, and further artefacts have been found, particularly at sites in Green Lane and near the Bourne spring in Farnham Park. A significant number of Bronze Age barrows occur in the area, including a triple barrow at Elstead and an urnfield cemetery at Stoneyfield, near the Tilford road.

====Iron Age====
Hill forts from the early Iron Age have been identified locally at Botany Hill to the south of the town, and at Caesar&#x27;s Camp to the north. The latter is a very large earthwork on a high promontory, served by a spring which emerges from between two conglomerate boulders called the Jock and Jenny Stones. &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Ring&quot; earthworks on Crooksbury Hill date from the later Iron Age. The final era of the Iron Age, during the 1st century AD, found Farnham within the territory of the Belgic tribe Atrebates led by Commius, a former ally of Caesar, who had brought his tribe to Britain following a dispute with the Romans. A hut dating from this period was discovered at the Bourne Spring and other occupation material has been discovered at various sites, particularly Green Lane.

===Roman Britain===
During the Roman period the district became a pottery centre due to the plentiful supply of gault clay, oak woodlands for fuel, and good communications via the Harrow Way and the nearby Roman road from Silchester to Chichester. Kilns dating from about AD 100 have been found throughout the area, including Six Bells (near the Bourne Spring), Snailslynch and Mavins Road, but the main centre of pottery had been Alice Holt Forest, on the edge of the town, since about AD 50, just 7 years after the arrival of the Romans. The Alice Holt potteries continued in use, making mainly domestic wares, until about AD 400. Near the Bourne Spring two Roman buildings were discovered; one was a bath-house dating from about AD 270 and the other a house of later date. The Roman Way housing estate stands on this site. William Stukeley propounded that Farnham is the site of the lost Roman settlement of Vindomis, although this is now believed to be at Neatham, near Alton. Large hoards of Roman coins have been discovered some south-west of Farnham in Woolmer Forest and a temple has been excavated at Wanborough, about to the east.

===The Anglo-Saxon period===
In the 7th century, Surrey passed into the hands of King Caedwalla of Wessex, who also conquered Kent and Sussex, and founded a monastery at Farnham in 686.

It was the Anglo-Saxons who gave the town its name—Farnham and it is listed as &quot;Fearnhamme&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. They arrived in the 6th century and, in AD 688, the West Saxon King Caedwalla donated the district around Farnham to the Church, and to the diocese of Winchester. A Saxon community grew up in the valley by the river. By the year 803 Farnham had passed into the ownership of the Bishop of Winchester and the Manor of Farnham remained so (apart from two short breaks) for the next thousand years. Although Farnham is documented in Saxon texts and most of the local names are derived from their language, there is only one fully attested Saxon site in Farnham, just off the lower part of Firgrove Hill, where a road called Saxon Croft is now sited. Here several Saxon weaving huts from about AD 550 were discovered in 1924.

In 892 Surrey was the scene of another major battle when a large Danish army, variously reported at 200, 250 and 350 ship-loads, moved west from its encampment in Kent and raided in Hampshire and Berkshire. Withdrawing with their loot, the Danes were intercepted and defeated at Farnham by an army led by Alfred the Great&#x27;s son, the future Edward the Elder, and fled across the Thames towards Essex.

====The Hundred of Farnham====
A hundred (county subdivision) was an area that had a general overlord of its lords of the manor, entitled to charge certain rents to certain intermediate lords. Parishes within Farnham hundred were: Frensham (including tything Pitfold with Churt) (partly in the hundred of Alton) Elstead, the liberty of Dockenfield, the liberty of Waverley, Seal (now Seale) the tythings of Badshot, Runfold, Culverlands, Tilford with Culverlands, Farnham, Runwick, Wrecklesham (now Wrecclesham), and Bourne.

In the 14th century, Farnham hundred was owned by the Bishop of Winchester and was one of the wealthiest on the bishop&#x27;s rolls.

===After the Norman invasion===
Farnham appears in Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Farnham as &quot;Ferneham&quot;, one of the five great &quot;minster&quot; churches in Surrey. Its Domesday assets were: 40 hides; 1 church, 6 mills worth £2 6s 0d, 43 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 175½ hogs. It rendered £53.

Waverley Abbey, the first Cistercian abbey in England, was founded in 1128 by William Giffard, Bishop of Winchester about south of the town centre. King John visited Waverley in 1208, and Henry III in 1225. The abbey produced the famous Annals of Waverley, an important reference source for the period. By the end of the 13th century the abbey was becoming less important. By the time it was suppressed by Henry VIII in 1536 as part of the dissolution of the monasteries there were only thirteen monks in the community.

The town is midway between Winchester and London and, in 1138, Henry de Blois (grandson of William the Conqueror and brother of King Stephen) started building Farnham Castle to provide accommodation for the Bishop of Winchester in his frequent journeying between his cathedral and the capital. The castle&#x27;s garrison provided a market for farms and small industries in the town, accelerating its growth. west of the town is Barley Pound, the remains of an 11th-century precursor of Farnham Castle.

Farnham was granted its charter as a town in 1249 by William de Ralegh, then Bishop of Winchester.

The Blind Bishop&#x27;s Steps, a series of steps leading along Castle Street up to the Castle, were originally constructed for Bishop Richard Foxe (godfather of Henry VIII).

The Black Death hit Farnham in 1348, killing about 1,300 people, at that time about a third of the population. In 1625 Farnham was again subject to an outbreak of the plague which, together with a severe decline in the local woollen industry (the local downland wool being unsuitable for the newly fashionable worsted) led by the 1640s to a serious economic depression in the area. Local wool merchants were, like merchants throughout the country, heavily taxed by Charles I to pay for his increasingly unpopular policies.

===The Civil War===
Against this background the English Civil War began, with Farnham playing a major part. Here, support for the Parliamentarians was general. The castle was considered a potential rallying point for Royalists, resulting in the installation of a Roundhead garrison there in 1642. As the King&#x27;s forces moved southwards, taking Oxford, Reading and Windsor, the garrison commander at Farnham (a noted poet), Captain George Wither, decided to evacuate the castle; the new High Sheriff of Surrey (John Denham, a Royalist sympathiser and another noted poet) then occupied the vacant castle with 100 armed supporters. With the castle and much of the surrounding area in Royalist hands, Parliament despatched Colonel Sir William Waller to Farnham to retake the castle. The defenders refused to surrender but Waller&#x27;s men used a petard to destroy the castle gates and overcame them, with only one fatality, and took the High Sheriff prisoner.

The following year, as the Royalists strengthened their position west of Farnham, the garrison at Farnham Castle was strengthened when it became the headquarters of the Farnham regiment of foot or &quot;Greencoats&quot;, with some eight to nine hundred officers and men, supported by a number of troops of horse. Further reinforcement by three regiments from London, 4,000 strong under Waller&#x27;s command arrived in Farnham that October prior to an unsuccessful foray to recapture Winchester from the Royalists. Eight thousand Royalists under Ralph Hopton (a former friend of Waller) advanced on Farnham from the west and skirmishes took place on the outskirts of town. Despite further reinforcement for Waller from Kent, Hopton&#x27;s entire army gathered on the heathland just outside Farnham Park. There was some skirmishing but Hopton&#x27;s men withdrew. Through the next few years Farnham was an important centre of Parliamentary operations and the garrison cost Farnham people dearly in terms of local taxes, provisioning and quartering; even the lead from the Town Hall roof had been requisitioned to make bullets. A number of local women were widowed following the pressing of local men into the militia. The bombardment of Basing House was by a train of heavy cannon assembled at Farnham from other areas and, in 1646, most of the garrison was removed from Farnham to form a brigade to besiege Donnington Castle near Newbury. The King surrendered shortly afterwards at Newark and a small garrison remained at Farnham.

In 1647, having escaped from custody at Hampton Court, the King rode through Farnham at dawn on 12 November with a small party of loyal officers, en route to the Isle of Wight, where he sought sanctuary under the protection of Colonel Robert Hammond, a Parliamentarian officer but with Royalist sympathies. The following March, Oliver Cromwell stayed at Farnham for discussions concerning the marriage of his daughter to a Hampshire gentleman, although some historians have speculated that this was cover for secret negotiations with the King.

Following the rebellion during the summer of 1648 the keep was partially dismantled at the orders of Cromwell, to make further occupation by garrison indefensible. In late November that year Hammond was summoned to Farnham, where he was arrested and the King was removed under military escort to the mainland. On 20 December the King and his escort entered Farnham, where groups of men, women and children gathered at the roadside to welcome him and touch his hand. That night the King lodged at Culver Hall (now Vernon House) in West Street before the party continued to London for Charles&#x27;s trial and execution in January 1649. The King gave his night cap to Henry Vernon, owner of Culver Hall, &quot;as a token of Royal favour&quot;. Records show that the following period of interregnum until restoration of the monarchy in 1660 was a time of prosperity and growth for Farnham. In 1660 the bishops of Winchester were restored to the adjoining Bishops Palace, which remained their residence until 1927. From 1927 until 1955 it was a residence of the bishops of the newly created diocese of Guildford. The castle is currently owned by English Heritage.

===Post-restoration===
Farnham became a successful market town; the author Daniel Defoe wrote that Farnham had the greatest corn-market after London, and describes 1,100 fully laden wagons delivering wheat to the town on market day. During the 17th century, other new industries evolved: greenware pottery (a pottery, dating from 1873, still exists on the outskirts of the town), wool and cloth, the processing of wheat into flour, and eventually hops, a key ingredient of beer. The Anglican divine, Augustus Montague Toplady, composer of the hymn Rock of Ages (1763, at Blagston) was born in Farnham in 1740 – a plaque now marks the building on West Street where he was born.
The radical MP, soldier, farmer, journalist and publisher William Cobbett was born in Farnham in 1763, in a pub called the Jolly Farmer. The pub still stands, and has since been renamed the William Cobbett.

The London and South Western Railway arrived in 1848 and, in 1854, neighbouring Aldershot became the &quot;Home of the British Army&quot;. Both events had a significant effect on Farnham. The fast link with London meant city businessmen could think of having a house in the country and still be in close contact with the office; Farnham thereby became an early example of a &#x27;commuter town&#x27;. Also, the railway did not reach Aldershot until 1870; during the intervening period soldiers would be carried by train to Farnham station and then march to Aldershot. Many officers and their families chose to billet in Farnham itself. The railway was electrified by the Southern Railway company in 1937 as far as Alton, and a carriage shed for the new electric stock was built in Weydon Lane. This building, which carried fading camouflage paint for many years after World War II, was replaced in 2006.

In 1895 Farnham Urban District Council (FUDC) was formed. In 1930 the council purchased Farnham Park, a large park occupying much of the former castle grounds. That same year, St Joan of Arc Church was built on Waverley Lane, it was dedicated to St Joan of Arc because Farnham Castle was a residence of Cardinal Henry Beaufort who presided over the saint&#x27;s trial. The FUDC was abolished in 1973 by the Local Government Act of the previous year. Farnham, together with Hindhead, Haslemere, Cranleigh and surrounding areas were absorbed into the new Waverley District Council (latterly Waverley Borough Council) with its headquarters in Godalming. In 1984 Farnham Parish Council became Farnham Town Council, taking on some of the minor roles of the former FUDC from Waverley.

Farnham Maltings, Bridge Square was once a tannery; the site expanded to become part of the Farnham United Breweries, which included its own maltings. Taken over by a major brewer (Courage) brewing ceased but malting continued into the 1960s, when Courage planned to sell off the site for redevelopment. The people of Farnham raised enough money to buy the building so that it could be converted into a community centre for the town. Other buildings in Farnham once linked to the Farnham Maltings include The Oasthouse (now offices) in Mead Lane and The Hop Kiln (now private residences) on Weydon Lane.

==Transport==
===Rail===

Farnham railway station is served by South Western Railway services between Alton and Waterloo. South Western Railway also manage the station. Services to Guildford are facilitated by a line running in that direction. The Alton Line becomes a single track between Farnham and Alton station. The station formerly served as the terminus for the Tongham railway until passenger services ceased in July 1937.

===Roads===
The A31 Farnham bypass links the town by road to Winchester, Alton and Guildford; the A325 links the town to Farnborough and to the A3 (London-Portsmouth) at Greatham. The A287 links Farnham to the M3 at Hook and the A3 at Hindhead.

===Buses===
Farnham is served by several bus routes, the majority of bus services originate from Aldershot bus station and are run by Stagecoach. The &quot;Waverley Hoppa&quot; provides demand-responsive transport for travel between Farnham and the surrounding villages.

===Air===
The nearest airport for business passengers is Farnborough Airport. The nearest major airport is London Heathrow Airport which is by road. Gatwick Airport and Southampton Airport are each about away by main roads.

===Recreational routes===
Farnham is the western starting point of the North Downs Way National Trail, which is predominantly footpath.
The Pilgrims Way which follows long sections of the North Downs Way traditionally runs from Winchester to Canterbury. The footpath known as St. Swithun&#x27;s Way has created a more pleasant route to Winchester than the modern road network which constitutes a lot of the Pilgrims Way.
The southern suburb of Rowledge lies adjacent to the north western fringes of the South Downs National Park.

National Cycle Route 22 passes through Farnham, connecting it to Guildford, East Surrey, Isle of Wight and the New Forest.

==Economy==

Farnham is a market town with many shops located along the main thoroughfare running through West Street, The Borough and East Street. The town has a significant number of independent retailers, some of which have been in business since the 19th century, such as Rangers Furnishing Stores (est. 1895), Elphicks department store (est. 1881) and Pullingers (est. 1850). The latter evolved into the Pullingers Art Shop chain and is thought to be Farnham&#x27;s oldest surviving business. There are also branches of many national retailers and grocery markets.

Castle Street&#x27;s market stalls have been replaced by semi-permanent &quot;orangery&quot; style buildings. Once a month a farmers&#x27; market is held in the central car park where produce from farms in Farnham and the surrounding area is sold. The Farnham Maltings hosts a monthly market selling arts, crafts, antiques and bric-a-brac with specialist fairs and festivals held there on a less regular basis.

==Public services==
===Public library===
Farnham Library moved to its current site in the grounds of Vernon House in April 1990. Refurbished in November 2005, it is a community lending library service run by Surrey County Council. The library is housed in the historic Vernon House at which King Charles I slept on his way to his trial and execution in London in 1649, commemorated by a plaque on the building wall. The library features public gardens with sculptures provided by local artists and UCA students.

===Museum of Farnham===

The Museum of Farnham is located at Willmer House, an 18th-century town house with a decorative brickwork façade in West Street. It houses a collection of artefacts spanning several periods of the town&#x27;s history and prehistory.

The museum was founded in 1961 to provide the Farnham community with a collection dedicated to the history of the local area in an elegant Grade I listed Georgian townhouse which still retains many original features, including a walled garden. The displays include items from a large and eclectic collection; from archaeological artefacts to nationally important artworks by local artists and an extensive costume collection. The museum has a Local Studies Library.

===Leisure and recreation===
There are two main parks in Farnham town centre: Farnham Park and Gostrey Meadow. Farnham Park is adjacent to Farnham Castle. Gostrey Meadow is in the centre of Farnham, next to the river Wey, and includes a fenced children&#x27;s play area. There is a skate park and leisure centre next to the town centre.

===Hospital===
Farnham Hospital is directly north east of the town. It was once the main hospital in the area, including accident and emergency services, but that role is now taken by Frimley Park Hospital.
Farnham once had a second hospital which was at the end of Bardsley Drive, on the site which is now Lynton Close.

===Cemeteries===
The town has four cemeteries, all maintained by Farnham Town Council: Hale Cemetery in Upper Hale; Badshot Lea Cemetery on Badshot Lea Road; Green Lane Cemetery and the West Street Cemetery.

==Tourism==
The town has a number of attractive houses from various periods, and many passages which reveal hidden parts of the town including old workshops, historic cottages and hidden gardens. Farnham Castle was built by the Normans and updated over the years as the Palace of the Bishops of Winchester. The former Bishops&#x27; Palace of the castle is now a training and conference centre, which also manages the keep, recently made more accessible by a Heritage Lottery Fund Grant. The keep is open to the public, and organised tours of the palace are held weekly.

Many of the places mentioned in the books of George Sturt can be seen, and Waverley Abbey, the first Cistercian Abbey in England, is open to the public. Farnham borders the Surrey Hills National Landscape and the North Downs Way long-distance path starts here. Alice Holt Forest is nearby, as are Frensham Ponds and many heaths and downland scenery. The Rural Life Living Museum is nearby at Tilford, and the town is a suitable tourist base for Winchester, the Mid-Hants Railway and canal trips on the Basingstoke Canal and Wey Navigation.

==Culture==
Farnham has a strong association with the creative arts. Farnham School of Art opened in 1866 and was associated with the Arts and Crafts movement when architects such as Edwin Lutyens and Harold Falkner, painters such as George Watts and W. H. Allen, potters such as Mary Watts and landscape gardeners such as Gertrude Jekyll worked in the area. Farnham has several art galleries: the New Ashgate Gallery in Lower Church Lane has exhibitions by established and new artists in a variety of media, the exhibition changing on the first Saturday of each month. The gallery at Farnham Maltings also has frequent exhibitions.

===Entertainment===
Farnham Maltings has diverse concerts including opera, folk and acoustic music gigs, band evenings and stand up comedy nights, as well as shows and workshops for younger people. There is a cinema run every Wednesday at the Maltings. The Maltings hosts an &quot;Acoustic Fridays&quot; evening once a month. A regular blues night takes place in the &quot;Cellar Bar&quot; and the whole venue is taken over for the annual Blues Festival. In keeping with the town&#x27;s historical link with hop-growing and beer, the Farnham Maltings holds the Farnham Beer Exhibition, an annual event that started in 1977, known as “Farnham Beerex”. There are many pubs in Farnham, many of which have live music regularly.

Farnham has an annual carnival, usually held on the last Saturday in June, organised by two charitable service organisations, the Farnham Lions Club and The Hedgehogs. Castle Street is closed for the evening, with bands playing on a stage in the street, a beer tent, barbecue, and sideshows. A procession of carnival floats, marching bands, tableaux, trade floats and classic vehicles parade through the main streets of the town. Local schools also participate in the parade, which has a different theme each year. Staff of the local Kar Ling Kwong Chinese restaurant traditionally perform the Lion Dance each year as part of the parade, the restaurant closed in February 2019. There is also a smaller Hale Carnival which takes place in the village of Hale in the North of Farnham. This is usually held on the first Saturday of July.

===The arts===
William Herbert Allen, the notable English landscape watercolour artist, lived and worked in Farnham for most of his career. He was Master of Farnham Art School from 1889 to 1927 and many of his works depict landscapes of the Farnham area. Illustrator Pauline Baynes spent much of her childhood in Farnham and trained at the Farnham School of Art. A popular fantasy artist, Josephine Wall, was born and educated in the town.

Since Roman times the wealden clay of the area has been exploited for pottery and brickmaking. Pottery continued on a small-scale commercial basis until the closure of Farnham Pottery at Wrecclesham in 1998, when it passed to the Farnham Buildings Preservation Trust. Farnham Pottery, in addition to utility wares, became famous during the Arts and Crafts movement for their decorative wares, either hand-thrown or moulded and decorated in a variety of coloured glazes, particularly &quot;Farnham Greenware&quot;. There was close co-operation between the pottery and Farnham School of Art (now a campus of University for the Creative Arts).

The Castle Theatre in Castle Street was replaced by the Redgrave Theatre in 1974 which, itself, closed down in 1998 due to the decline of repertory theatre in England. In 1998 &#x27;The New Farnham Repertory Company&#x27;, now renamed Farnham Rep, was formed to carry on the tradition of repertory theatre in the town. The Farnham Theatre Association campaigns for a theatre in Farnham, either in the form of a restored Redgrave Theatre or a new building.

====The Maltings====

Productions still regularly take place at the Maltings, which produces work and receives touring shows. Productions are occasionally held in the grounds of Farnham Library. Various genres of music are promoted at the Maltings, where there is a dance studio. The Maltings is a creative arts centre, catering for all ages, with workshops, clubs, groups and sessions involved in craft, theatre, music and writing, including Rock Choir, amongst others.

====The New Ashgate Gallery====
The New Ashgate Gallery is a non-profit, educational charity based in Farnham. It specialises in contemporary art and craft, organising a programme of exhibitions and projects with artists and makers. Established in 1959, the gallery is the longest running craft space in South of England and was the first provincial gallery to showcase both local and international artists. Architect Paul Archer designed a quarter-million pound redevelopment for the Gallery that was finished in 2004. The gallery organises established platforms to present new work through exhibitions projects such as the &quot;Surrey Artist of the Year&quot; competition, organised with the Surrey Open Studios, the Hothouse, an early career maker support programme with the Crafts Council, and the annual, open call &quot;Rising Stars&quot; touring exhibition that provides information, guidance, networking and exhibition opportunities to emerging and graduating artists from the UK and internationally.

====Peter Pan====
It was in Farnham, whilst living at Black Lake Cottage, a remote woodland retreat near Tilford, that J. M. Barrie was inspired to write &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

Bourne Wood

The nearby Bourne Wood is a popular film location appearing in Gladiator, and Wonder Woman.

==Education==
Farnham has a broad mix of state, religious and private schools. There are eight infant schools, nine primary/junior schools, three secondary schools and two schools for pupils with special educational needs.
There are also four independent schools in the Farnham area.

Farnham College (part of Guildford College) provides further education. The University for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester or UCA (a merger of the local Surrey Institute of Art &amp; Design, University College and Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design) provides higher education.

The area includes some of the top state schools (academies) in the country including South Farnham School, Weydon School and many others who consistently rank highly in school results year on year including South Farnham which has, more than once, been rated the best state primary school in the country based on exam results.

Farnham Grammar School was created some time before 1585 (when a donation by a Richard Searle was recorded &quot;to the maintenance of the school in Farnham&quot;). In 1905 the town centre assets of the old grammar school, located in West Street, were sold in order to purchase and build new premises in fields to the south of the town. In 1973 this campus became a Sixth Form College and was renamed Farnham College.

==Sport==

There are various sporting facilities in Farnham of which the local leisure centre is one. The centre is run by DC Leisure on behalf of Waverley borough council. The leisure centre was built in 1981 with a swimming pool and training pool, gym and main hall for team sports. The entire centre was refurbished in 2010, during which the swimming pool was lengthened by four centimetres to exactly 25 metres to allow galas to be held.

The town is represented in the non-league football pyramid by Farnham Town F.C., who compete in the premier division of the Combined Counties League. There is a second football club, Farnham United FC which has several youth teams as well one adult team, Farnham United.

Farnham has a public golf course which is next to the cricket ground directly behind Farnham Castle. It was designed by Sir Henry Cotton. It is a nine-hole, par-three golf course.

A horse named Farnham took part in the 1850 Grand National but was largely unregarded by the public and finished outside the first four.

Carlin Motorsport are based in the town.

==Demography and housing==
In 1901, the population of Farnham was about 14,000.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Gostrey Meadow===

Until the late 17th century, Gostrey Meadow was part of a larger area of land owned by the Bush Hotel. The estate became progressively fragmented as building plots were sold and by 1900, the meadow was being used as an illegal rubbish dump. The site was purchased by the UDC in 1909 and repurposed as a public park. The area was landscaped and the ground flattened. The drinking fountain was installed in 1911 and, the following year, the public shelter and wooden bridge over the Wey were opened. The war memorial at the east end of the meadow was designed by the architect, W. C. Watson, in Portland stone and was dedicated in April 1921.

===Farnham Park===
The area now known as Farnham Park was created for Bishop William of Wykeham in 1376 and was initially known as the New or Little Park. Like the larger Old or Great Park to the west, it was used as a deer park for Farnham Castle. By 1690, the Great Park was being used as farmland, but the Little Park was used for intended purpose until the late 18th century. Under Bishop Brownlow North in the early 19th century, the park was landscaped with the addition of walkways and planting of new trees. were offered for sale to the borough in 1928 and the purchase was completed in July the following year.

===Tice&#x27;s Meadow, Badshot Lea===
The Tice&#x27;s Meadow at Badshot Lea was previously a former quarry, operated by Hanson plc. Sand and gravel extraction ended in 2010 and the site was redeveloped as a community nature reserve. A formal opening ceremony took place in May 2018, following the installation of two new footbridges over the River Blackwater. Tice&#x27;s Meadow was purchased by Surrey County Council in 2021, supported by funding from five other local councils. The reserve features areas of open water, exposed gravel islands, seedbeds and woodlands. It provides a habitat for bird species, including reed warblers and sand martins, and has been designated a Site of Nature Conservation Interest. In November 2022, the Tice&#x27;s Meadow Bird Group was given a National Biodiversity Network award for its work in surveying and recording bird species at the site.

<text>A bluebell wood is a woodland that in springtime has a carpet of flowering bluebells (&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot;) underneath a newly forming leaf canopy. The thicker the summer canopy, the more the competitive ground-cover is suppressed, encouraging a dense carpet of bluebells, whose leaves mature and die down by early summer. Other common woodland plants which accompany bluebells include the yellow rattle and the wood anemone.

==Locations==

Bluebell woods are found in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as elsewhere in Europe. Bluebells are a common indicator species for ancient woodlands, so bluebell woods are likely to date back to at least 1600. Some introduced portions of bluebell woods can occur in places where they&#x27;ve been heavily naturalised such as the Pacific Northwest, Mid-Atlantic Region, and British Columbia.

==Literature==

Gerard Manley Hopkins, an English poet, was very keen on the plant as revealed by these lines of his poem &quot;May Magnificat&quot;
&lt;poem&gt;And azuring-over greybell makes
Wood banks and brakes wash wet like lakes&lt;/poem&gt;

In his journal entry for 9 May 1871 Hopkins says:

In the little wood opposite the light they stood in blackish spreads or sheddings like spots on a snake. The heads are then like thongs and solemn in grain and grape-colour. But in the clough through the light they come in falls of sky-colour washing the brows and slacks of the ground with vein-blue, thickening at the double, vertical themselves and the young grass and brake-fern combed vertical, but the brake struck the upright of all this with winged transomes. It was a lovely sight. - The bluebells in your hand baffle you with their inscape, made to every sense. If you draw your fingers through them they are lodged and struggle with a shock of wet heads; the long stalks rub and click and flatten to a fan on one another like your fingers themselves would when you passed the palms hard across one another, making a brittle rub and jostle like the noise of a hurdle strained by leaning against; then there is the faint honey smell and in the mouth the sweet gum when you bite them.

<text>Benasque (; in Benasquese dialect: &quot;Benás&quot;; ) () is a town in the comarca of Ribagorza, province of Huesca, (Spain). It is the main town in the Benasque Valley, located in the heart of the Pyrenees and surrounded by the highest peaks in that range.

== Climate ==
The climate is of a high mountain type, with cool summers, and cold winters and frequent snow. Its average annual temperature is 9.4 degrees Celsius (at 1138 meters above sea level).

== Language ==
 
The regional language of Benasque is a Catalan–Aragonese transitional dialect that shares features with Gascon (Occitan). It is usually called &quot;patués&quot; (&quot;patois&quot;) by its native speakers. Possessing features that are transitional between Aragonese and Catalan, it has sometimes been classified as a variety of Catalan.

To promote the local language, the local council has held an annual writing and poetry competition in &quot;patués&quot; since 1999. Separate awards are given to young and grown-up authors.

<doc id="152940" wikidata="Q813562" url="?curid=152940" title="Bebung">
<text>Bebung (German: &quot;a trembling&quot;; ) is a type of vibrato executed on the clavichord.

When a clavichord key is pressed, a small metal tangent strikes a string and remains in contact with it for as long as the key is held down. By applying a rocking pressure up and down the key with the finger, a performer can slightly alter the tension of the string itself, producing the vibrato quality known as &quot;bebung&quot;. While the vibrato on fretless string instruments such as the violin typically oscillates in pitch both above and below the nominal note, clavichord &quot;bebung&quot; can only produce pitches above the note.

Sheet music does not often explicitly indicate &quot;Bebung&quot;. Composers assumed that, like other ornaments, performers would apply &quot;bebung&quot; at their discretion. Where sheet music does indicate &quot;bebung&quot;, it appears as a series of dots above or below a note, with the number of dots indicating the number of finger movements. For example: &lt;score&gt;
{ \time 4/2 \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \override TextScript #&#x27;avoid-slur = #&#x27;inside \override TextScript #&#x27;outside-staff-priority = ##f \slurUp \hideNotes f&quot;4( \unHideNotes f&#x27;2^\markup { \halign #0 . . . . } \hideNotes f&quot;4) }&lt;/score&gt;

Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach called the vibrato &quot;Bebung&quot;, however other composers like Johann Mattheson had described the term earlier on. C.P.E Bach often used Bebung in his music, and says it was one of the reasons why the clavichord was superior to the recent pianoforte. In 1789, Daniel Gottlob Türk added the Bebung definition to the pianoforte, yet instead of the rocking-pressure, it is restating the tone/note by continuously and gently pressuring it. While, Alexander Agricola used it in vocal works.

<doc id="152943" wikidata="Q990103" url="?curid=152943" title="Haverfordwest">
<text>Haverfordwest ( , ; ) is the county town of Pembrokeshire, Wales, and the most populous urban area in Pembrokeshire with a population of 14,596 in 2011. It is also a community consisting of 12,042 people, making it the second most populous community in the county after Milford Haven. The suburbs include the former parish of Prendergast, Albert Town and the residential and industrial areas of Withybush (housing, retail parks, hospital, airport and showground).

Haverfordwest has a strategic location: it was the lowest bridging point of the Western Cleddau before the Cleddau Bridge opened in 1975.

==Topography==

Haverfordwest is a market town, the county town of Pembrokeshire and an important road network hub between Milford Haven, Pembroke Dock, Fishguard and St David&#x27;s as a result of its position at the tidal limit of the Western Cleddau. The majority of the town, comprising the old parishes of St. Mary, St. Martin and St. Thomas, lies on the right (west) bank of the river. On the left bank are the suburbs of Prendergast and Cartlett. At this point, a pair of sandstone ridges extending from east to west and separated by a deep, narrow valley, are cut through by the Western Cleddau. This leaves two high spurs on the west side of the river. On the northern spur, the castle and its surrounding settlement form the core of St Martin&#x27;s parish. On the southern spur, the High Street ascends steeply from the river and forms the core of St Mary&#x27;s parish. From the foot of each spur, ancient bridges cross the river to Prendergast: St Martin&#x27;s Bridge (&quot;the Old Bridge&quot;) and St Mary&#x27;s Bridge (&quot;the New Bridge&quot;, built in 1835). St Thomas&#x27;s parish occupies the south side of the southern spur. From these core areas, the town has spread, mainly along the ridges. In addition to the four ancient parish churches, the remains of an Augustinian priory are visible at the southern edge of the town.

==Toponymy==
The name of the town means &quot;ford used by heifers&quot; or &quot;ford used by goats&quot; from Old English &quot;hæfer&quot;. In local dialect, it is pronounced &quot;Harford&quot;. &quot;West&quot; was added in the 15th century, to distinguish the town from Hereford. It is marked as &quot;Herfordwest&quot; on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. The Welsh name is said by B. G. Charles to be &quot;merely a corruption of the English name&quot;.

==History==

Haverfordwest has been English-speaking for centuries. South Pembrokeshire is known as &#x27;Little England Beyond Wales&#x27;, but because the markets traded with Welsh farmers in the north and east, there has always been a significant Welsh-speaking influence. The suburb of Prendergast seems to have originated as an extramural Welsh dormitory, dating from the times when all agricultural trade had to pass through the borough, and the fearful Normans before the destruction of Anglo-Norman power in 1136 tried to prevent Welshmen bearing arms from entering within the castle walls after nightfall.

===Origins===
Scores of Iron Age and Roman coinage and artefact discoveries, and excavations by the Dyfed Archaeological Trust under the direction of Heather James at Carmarthen (Moridunum) in the 1980s, point to significant Roman penetration to this westernmost part of Wales. The strategic position of Haverfordwest with its defensive bluff overlooking the lowest fordable point on the western Cleddau and accessible to sea traffic would have required a Roman presence, probably modest in scale, from the 1st century AD to protect supplies to and from the coast, e.g. the Roman legionary headquarters at Caerleon were roofed with slates from the lower slopes of the Preseli Hills. In 1992, aerial photography identified a Roman road running to the west of Carmarthen, past Wiston to Poyston Cross, raising the possibility of Roman fortlets at strategic river crossings at Whitland and Haverfordwest. Edward Llwyd&#x27;s note to Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; (ed. 1695) refers to a valuable find of silver coins at Llanboidy, the latest coin being one of Domitian struck in AD 91. In the 1920s Sir Mortimer Wheeler partially excavated a Roman dwelling or villa at Wolfscastle; work was restarted in 2002 by Professor Merroney. James Phillips, in &quot;The History of Pembrokeshire&quot; (published 1909), records a find of Roman silver coins in Haverfordwest, the earliest dated coin a Valerian and the latest a Claudius Gothicus. The museum in which the coins were deposited has been &quot;scattered to the winds&quot; and the whereabouts of the coins is unknown.

Phillips claimed that the pre-Norman name of Haverfordwest was Caer Alun, so named by the Emperor Maximus (Macsim Gwledig). His sources are not given but the &quot;Cambro-Briton&quot; in 1822 also recorded that Maximus, the last Roman Emperor of Britain, a man who for a time divided the Roman Empire with Theodosius I, on withdrawing Roman legions from Britain granted civic status and Celtic names to a number of pacified Romano-British settlements, including Southampton, Chichester, Old Sarum near Salisbury, Carmarthen (Caerfyrddin) and Haverfordwest (Caer Alun). Maximus had married Elen, a Welsh noblewoman, and they had three sons. Phillips claims that the name actually given to the town was Caer Elen, in honour of his wife (the name later changing to Caer Alun).

===Medieval period===

The ecclesiastical centre of the area (perhaps the seat of a bishop in the Age of the Saints) was probably one of the several churches of the local St Ismael, most probably St. Ishmael&#x27;s. This occurred around 1110.

The proposition that Haverfordwest Castle was founded by Tancred, a Flemish Marcher Lord, is questionable. The Marcher Lords were not Flemish but Norman barons originally along the Marches (Anglo-Welsh border). The castle is recorded as having been founded in 1100 by the Norman Gilbert de Clare. The Flemings, said to have arrived in three groups in 1107, 1111 and 1151, are likely to have participated in its later development for their own and the Normans&#x27; protection from the Welsh warlords. It is recorded that the Constable of the castle in 1207 was Itohert, son of Richard Tancard, possibly a descendant of the first Tancred.

The Flemish presence, reputed to result from floods in the Low Countries, was more likely to have consisted initially of Flemish mercenaries originally in the invading army of William the Conqueror, who in reward for their part in William&#x27;s victory were granted lands in parts of Northern Britain, and in Wales in the Gower, and Geraldus Cambrensis recorded their presence in the Hundred of Roose in Pembrokeshire.

A Fleming, Wizo, who died in 1130 founded at Wiston a motte and bailey fortification, the forerunner of the stone castle, for protection against the Welsh warlords: the Flemings were reportedly unpopular wherever they settled. The precarious position of Normans and Flemings was demonstrated in 1136 when the Normans, having already lost 500 men in battle at Loughor, re-recruited from Lordships from all over South Wales and led by Robert fitz Martin at Crug Mawr near Cardigan attacked Owain Gwynedd and his army. Routed, they fled over the Teifi Bridge which collapsed; the retreating Normans drowning under the weight of their armour. Their leader Richard de Clare had previously been intercepted and killed by Iorwerth ab Owen. Wiston and the castle were overrun in 1147 by Hywel Sais, son of Lord Rhys. Ranulf Higden, in his &quot;Polychronicus&quot;, records the Flemings as extinct in Pembrokeshire by 1327 but Flemish mercenaries reappear in 1400 when at the behest of Henry IV they joined an army of 1,500 English settlers who marched north from Pembrokeshire to attack the army of Owain Glyndŵr at Mynydd Hyddgen. The attack was repulsed with heavy casualties and legend has it that English prisoners were spared but surviving Flemish mercenaries were massacred or sold into slavery.

St Mary&#x27;s Church originated at the end of the 12th century and the current (Grade I listed) building was constructed between the 13th and 15th centuries and prominently visible at the top of the High Street.

Haverfordwest rapidly grew, initially around the castle and St Martin&#x27;s Church (the settlement being called Castletown), then spreading into the High Street area. It immediately became the capital of the hundred of Roose (part of Little England beyond Wales), and because of its pivotal position, the commercial centre of western Dyfed, which it has remained to this day. In common with other British towns, its growth was rapid during the period up to 1300, and its extent by then was much the same as it was in the early 19th century. A large town by the standards of the time, its population was probably around 4,000–5,000. It received its first marcher charter from William Marshall, 1st Earl of Pembroke sometime between 1213 and 1219, and obtained the lucrative trading privileges of an English borough. It traded both by land and sea and had a busy tidal quay on the river below the &quot;New&quot; Bridge. At least ten guilds operated, and there was significant woollen cloth manufacture. In 1545, the town was designated a county corporate by Henry VIII, with the aim of supporting a campaign against piracy in local waters. It was one of only two such counties corporate in Wales (the other being Carmarthen), and remained officially &quot;The Town and County of Haverfordwest&quot; until the abolition of the borough in 1974.

In common with other large towns in Europe, Haverfordwest was hit hard by the Black Death in 1348, suffering both depopulation (perhaps by more than 50%) and diminution of trade. Large parts of the town were abandoned, and it did not start to recover until the Tudor period. At the end of the 17th century, the town was still significantly smaller than in 1300. In 1405, the town was burned by the French allies of Owain Glyndwr, although in its early history Haverfordwest suffered less than most towns in Wales from such depredations.

===Post-medieval===
During the English Civil War, the burgesses of the borough supported Parliament, while the ruling gentry were Royalist. As a result, there was considerable conflict, and the town changed hands five times. There followed a period of stagnation in which the comparative status of the town declined.

===20th century===
Some 1,200 men of Pembrokeshire lost their lives in World War I, and Haverfordwest was the location chosen for the County of Pembroke War Memorial, unveiled in 1921. Its current location is Picton Place, close by County Hall, and it is Grade II listed. Haverfordwest was bombed for the first time during World War II on 24 September 1940. The City Road and New Road areas were hit, although there had been little preparation and no warning siren sounded. There were no casualties.

Haverfordwest today has the air of a typical small country market town, but the centre still conveys the feel of the important mediaeval borough. The once run-down riverside area has been renovated and Bridge Street has been pedestrianised and improved.

Haverford Township, Haverford and Havertown in Pennsylvania, United States, are all named after Haverfordwest.

===21st century===
In October 2022, the remains of 307 people, including children, were unearthed by archaeologists working on the remnants of a medieval priory found beneath the old Ocky White building, a former department store which closed in 2013. It is believed that the graveyard could have been used until the early 18th century.

==Governance==
===Local government===

There are two tiers of local government covering Haverfordwest, at community (town) and county level: Haverfordwest Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. The town council is based at the Old Wool Market on Quay Street. Pembrokeshire County Council is also based in Haverfordwest, at County Hall on Freemens Way.

For local government purposes the community of Haverfordwest comprises five wards: Castle, Prendergast, Portfield, Priory and Garth. The community has its own town council and mayor.

Pembrokeshire County Council conducted an extensive review of community boundaries in 2007 which made a number of submissions to the boundary commission for Wales. These submissions included a number of recommendations for the extension of the Haverfordwest community boundary where there had been perceived community overspill due to housing developments. These suggestions were mostly implemented, with one significant exception leading to an increase in the number of electors in the Haverfordwest community. One area of contention concerned the status of the village of Merlin&#x27;s Bridge which continues to have its own community council despite its close proximity to Haverfordwest and a degree of community overspill. As such the conurbation of Haverfordwest and Merlin&#x27;s Bridge is the most populous urban area in Pembrokeshire though Haverfordwest&#x27;s community boundaries mean it is only the second most populous community in the county after Milford Haven.

Haverfordwest is twinned with Oberkirch, Germany.

===Senedd and Westminster representation===
Haverfordwest is part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire Senedd constituency, where the local Senedd Member is Paul Davies of the Conservative Party.

In the UK Parliament, Haverfordwest is part of the Mid and South Pembrokeshire constituency, currently represented by Henry Tufnell of Welsh Labour. Prior to the 2024 general election, Haverfordwest had been part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency since 1997, represented by Stephen Crabb, a Welsh Conservative and Chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, since 2005.

Historically, a constituency of Haverfordwest made the town one of very few places within Wales allowed to act as a borough constituency and elect a member to the English Parliament from the sixteenth century. In the nineteenth century, the constituency was expanded by the Reform Act 1832 to include nearby Fishguard and Narberth before being abolished and replaced by the Pembroke &amp; Haverfordwest constituency as part of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

===Administrative history===
Haverfordwest was an ancient borough, receiving its first charter from Henry II in 1169. The borough was given the right to appoint its own sheriff in 1479, and in 1545 was declared to be a county corporate. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The borough covered all of the parish of St Mary, parts of the parishes of St Martin, St Thomas, Prendergast, and Uzmaston, and an extra-parochial area (deemed to be a parish from 1866) called Furzy Park and Portfield. Under the Local Government Act 1894, parishes which straddled borough boundaries were split into separate parishes for the parts inside and outside the borough. The part of Uzmaston within the borough therefore became a parish called Cartlett, the part of Prendergast outside the borough became a parish called North Prendergast, and the parts of St Martin and St Thomas parishes outside the borough became parishes called St Martin Hamlet and St Thomas Hamlet respectively. The parishes outside the borough were all included in the Haverfordwest Rural District. The six parishes within the borough after 1894 were therefore Cartlett, Furzy Park and Portfield, Prendergast, St Mary, St Martin, and St Thomas. These were urban parishes and so did not have their own parish councils, with the lowest level representative body being the Haverfordwest Borough Council.

Haverfordwest&#x27;s status as a county corporate from 1545 made it independent from Pembrokeshire. When elected county councils were established in 1889 the town was brought back into Pembrokeshire for local government purposes, being under the control of Pembrokeshire County Council and losing its separate police force at the same time. For other purposes the town retained its independence from the county, having its own Lord Lieutenant until 1931, and keeping its own Quarter Sessions until 1951. The status of county corporate was finally abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. One remaining legacy from Haverfordwest&#x27;s former status as a county corporate is that it retains the right to appoint its own sheriff.
Haverfordwest had a medieval guildhall which stood at the top (west end) of High Street in front of St Mary&#x27;s Church. The guildhall served as the meeting place for both the borough corporation and the Pembrokeshire Quarter Sessions until the 1830s. In 1837 the county authorities built themselves Shire Hall at the bottom (east end) of High Street. The guildhall was demolished and the borough corporation met instead in a room above the north porch of St Mary&#x27;s Church until that room was demolished in 1861. In 1871 the borough acquired newly built premises at 1 St Mary&#x27;s Lane to serve as the council&#x27;s offices and meeting place. In 1954 the borough council moved to Picton House at 2 Picton Place, an 1830s house on the bank of the Western Cleddau, and remained based there until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1974.

Haverfordwest Municipal Borough was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the district of Preseli (renamed Preseli Pembrokeshire in 1987) within the county of Dyfed. A community covering the former borough was established at the same time, with its council taking the name Haverfordwest Town Council. Preseli Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996 and the area became part of a re-established Pembrokeshire. Haverfordwest Town Council continued to use the former borough council&#x27;s premises at Picton House as its headquarters until 2020, when it moved to the Old Wool Market, a converted late eighteenth century wool market and warehouse building on the quayside.

==Demography==
The 2011 census recorded a population of 12,042 living within the community boundary. The urban area extends beyond the community boundary in various places, notably at Merlin&#x27;s Bridge to the south of the town, which forms a separate community but is deemed by the Office for National Statistics to form part of the Haverfordwest built-up area. The population of the Haverfordwest built-up area was 14,596 in 2011.

==Economy==

In accordance with its status as a sub-regional hub-town, Haverfordwest continues to serve as Pembrokeshire&#x27;s principal commercial and retail centre. The development of the riverside shopping centre in Withybush on the outskirts of the town includes Marks &amp; Spencer in 2010 and Debenhams in 2013.

A new town library opened in 2018 in the former Riverside Market building.

Concerns about the relative decline of the historic town centre compared to the growth of the retail centre at Withybush led to Welsh historian John Davies expressing his concern that Haverfordwest is becoming &quot;a medieval town surrounded by tin sheds&quot;.

==Education==
Schools and colleges in Haverfordwest:

* Haverfordwest Grammar School, 1488–1978, became a public school in the 1920s, making it one of only two public schools in Wales at that time.
* Haverfordwest High VC School, an English-medium secondary school, was formed in 2018 by the merger of Sir Thomas Picton School and Tasker Milward School.
*Pembrokeshire College, an affiliated college of the University of Glamorgan, is situated in the Merlin&#x27;s Bridge suburb of the town. The college serves as the principal centre of further and higher education in Pembrokeshire.

<text>Severino Antinori (born 6 September 1945 in Civitella del Tronto) is an Italian gynecologist and embryologist. He has publicly taken controversial positions over &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilisation (IVF) and human cloning. On 13 May 2016 Antinori was arrested and accused of kidnapping a woman, and stealing her ovules.

He began his career interested in veterinary biology. He studied at the University of Rome La Sapienza, graduating in 1972 with a degree in medicine. Initially he worked in gastroenterology, but following a lecture by Patrick Steptoe he re-trained in obstetrics and gynecology, moving into reproductive and infertility work from 1978. He set up his own clinic in Rome in 1982. In 1986, he pioneered the use of the ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) process in Italy. From 1989 he extended IVF to women who had passed the menopause.

In 1994 he assisted Rossana Della Corte, aged 63, in becoming pregnant. She became one of the oldest women in history to give birth.

In May 2006 it was announced that 62-year-old East Sussex child psychiatrist, Patricia Rashbrook, was seven months pregnant after being treated by Antinori, who said that 62 or 63 was the upper limit for IVF in healthy women. He commented that he would only consider couples with at least 20 years&#x27; life expectancy left for fertility treatment. Josephine Quintavalle, from Comment on Reproductive Ethics (CORE), accused Rashbrook of selfishness and said it would be extremely difficult for a child to have a mother who is as old as a grandmother.

In May 2009, after it was announced a 66-year-old woman was pregnant he criticised her decision saying that he felt she was too old and may not live long enough to raise her child.

==Human cloning==
Antinori publicised his interest in human cloning from 1998; working with Panayiotis Zavos he argued in favour of cloning as an opportunity for infertile couples, who cannot use other methods. Genetic material from the father would be injected into an egg, which would then be implanted into the woman&#x27;s womb to grow. The resulting child would, in theory, have exactly the same physical characteristics as the father.

Antinori told an Italian newspaper that more than 1,500 couples had volunteered as candidates for his research programme. In November 2002, Antinori announced that he had successfully used cloning to induce pregnancy in three women, with the birth of the first child expected in January 2003. He refused to give the identities of the women or details of where they lived, and mainstream scientists and doctors expressed scepticism about his claims.

On Thursday 25 October 2001, the BBC aired its Horizon programme in which Antinori and Zavos were the vocal proponents of human cloning. They promised they would produce the first human clones &quot;within a year&quot;. The claim was refuted by Professor Lorraine Young of the Roslin Institute following her pioneering work with Doctor Ian Wilmut which culminated in the creation of Molly and Dolly, the worlds first cloned mammals. Young had discovered that the reason cloning was an inherently flawed technique was due to the process scrambling the positioning of DNA-associated methyl molecules which controlled the timing of DNA expression. Young warned Antinori and Zavos that they had &quot;no understanding&quot; of the issues and were &quot;missing everything&quot; with regard the fidelity of a repeatable cloning process. She further predicted that cloning was a technology that may never be successfully harnessed. Antinori and Zavos failed to heed the warnings of Professor Young and other specialists, and as of May 2020 have failed to lend credence to their claim of having been successful in cloning a viable mammalian embryo.

== Charges of egg theft ==
In 2016, Antinori was arrested on suspicion of stealing eggs by removing them from a patient&#x27;s ovaries without her consent under the guise of performing a procedure on her to remove an ovarian cyst. He had recently hired a Spanish nurse at his clinic, and then diagnosed her with an ovarian cyst for the sole purpose of harvesting her eggs without her knowledge. Antinori was arrested at Fiumicino airport, charged with aggravated robbery and causing personal injury, and placed under house arrest.

<text>The data link layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking. This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer. The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and may also provide the means to detect and possibly correct errors that can occur in the physical layer.

The data link layer is concerned with local delivery of frames between nodes on the same level of the network. Data-link frames, as these protocol data units are called, do not cross the boundaries of a local area network. Inter-network routing and global addressing are higher-layer functions, allowing data-link protocols to focus on local delivery, addressing, and media arbitration. In this way, the data link layer is analogous to a neighborhood traffic cop; it endeavors to arbitrate between parties contending for access to a medium, without concern for their ultimate destination. When devices attempt to use a medium simultaneously, frame collisions occur. Data-link protocols specify how devices detect and recover from such collisions, and may provide mechanisms to reduce or prevent them.

Examples of data link protocols are Ethernet, the IEEE 802.11 WiFi protocols, ATM and Frame Relay. In the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), the data link layer functionality is contained within the link layer, the lowest layer of the descriptive model, which is assumed to be independent of physical infrastructure.

==Function==
The data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link. Within the semantics of the OSI network architecture, the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer, and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer. That transfer can be reliable or unreliable; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance, and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors. In those cases, higher-level protocols must provide flow control, error checking, acknowledgments, and retransmission.

The frame header contains the source and destination addresses that indicate which device originated the frame and which device is expected to receive and process it. In contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer, layer 2 addresses are flat, meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs.

In some networks, such as IEEE 802 local area networks, the data link layer is described in more detail with media access control (MAC) and logical link control (LLC) sublayers; this means that the IEEE 802.2 LLC protocol can be used with all of the IEEE 802 MAC layers, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, IEEE 802.11, etc., as well as with some non-802 MAC layers such as FDDI. Other data-link-layer protocols, such as HDLC, are specified to include both sublayers, although some other protocols, such as Cisco HDLC, use HDLC&#x27;s low-level framing as a MAC layer in combination with a different LLC layer. In the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), the data link layer is divided into three sub-layers (application protocol convergence, logical link control and media access control).

==Sublayers==
The data link layer is often divided into two sublayers: &quot;logical link control&quot; (LLC) and &quot;media access control&quot; (MAC).

===Logical link control sublayer===
The uppermost sublayer, LLC, multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer, and optionally provides flow control, acknowledgment, and error notification. The LLC provides addressing and control of the data link. It specifies which mechanisms are to be used for addressing stations over the transmission medium and for controlling the data exchanged between the originator and recipient machines.

===Media access control sublayer===
MAC may refer to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time (e.g. CSMA/CD). Other times it refers to a frame structure delivered based on MAC addresses inside.

There are generally two forms of media access control: distributed and centralized. Both of these may be compared to communication between people. In a network made up of people speaking, i.e. a conversation, they will each pause a random amount of time and then attempt to speak again, effectively establishing a long and elaborate game of saying &quot;no, you first&quot;.

The Media Access Control sublayer also performs frame synchronization, which determines the start and end of each frame of data in the transmission bitstream. It entails one of several methods: timing-based detection, character counting, byte stuffing, and bit stuffing.
* The time-based approach expects a specified amount of time between frames.
* Character counting tracks the count of remaining characters in the frame header. This method, however, is easily disturbed if this field is corrupted.
* Byte stuffing precedes the frame with a special byte sequence such as DLE STX and succeeds it with DLE ETX. Appearances of DLE (byte value 0x10) have to be escaped with another DLE. The start and stop marks are detected at the receiver and removed as well as the inserted DLE characters.
* Similarly, bit stuffing replaces these start and end marks with flags consisting of a special bit pattern (e.g. a 0, six 1 bits and a 0). Occurrences of this bit pattern in the data to be transmitted are avoided by inserting a bit. To use the example where the flag is 01111110, a 0 is inserted after 5 consecutive 1&#x27;s in the data stream. The flags and the inserted 0&#x27;s are removed at the receiving end. This makes for arbitrary long frames and easy synchronization for the recipient. The stuffed bit is added even if the following data bit is 0, which could not be mistaken for a sync sequence, so that the receiver can unambiguously distinguish stuffed bits from normal bits.

==Services==
The services provided by the data link layer are:
*Encapsulation of network layer data packets into frames
*Frame synchronization
* In the logical link control (LLC) sublayer:
**Error control (automatic repeat request, ARQ), in addition to ARQ provided by some transport-layer protocols, to forward error correction (FEC) techniques provided on the physical layer, and to error-detection and packet canceling provided at all layers, including the network layer. Data-link-layer error control (i.e. retransmission of erroneous packets) is provided in wireless networks and V.42 telephone network modems, but not in LAN protocols such as Ethernet, since bit errors are so uncommon in short wires. In that case, only error detection and canceling of erroneous packets are provided.
**Flow control, in addition to the one provided on the transport layer. Data-link-layer flow control is not used in LAN protocols such as Ethernet, but in modems and wireless networks.
* In the medium access control (MAC) sublayer:
**Multiple access methods for channel-access control, for example CSMA/CD protocols for collision detection and re-transmission in Ethernet bus networks and hub networks, or the CSMA/CA protocol for collision avoidance in wireless networks.
** Physical addressing (MAC addressing)
**LAN switching (packet switching), including MAC filtering, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) and TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
** Data packet queuing or scheduling
**Store-and-forward switching or cut-through switching
**Quality of service (QoS) control
**Virtual LANs (VLAN)

==Error detection and correction==
In addition to framing, the data link layer may also detect and recover from transmission errors. For a receiver to detect transmission errors, the sender must add redundant information as an error detection code to the frame sent. When the receiver obtains a frame it verifies whether the received error detection code matches a recomputed error detection code.

An error detection code can be defined as a function that computes the (amount of redundant bits) corresponding to each string of total number of bits. The simplest error detection code is the parity bit, which allows a receiver to detect transmission errors that have affected a single bit among the transmitted bits. If there are multiple flipped bits then the checking method might not be able to detect this on the receiver side. More advanced methods than parity error detection do exist providing higher grades of quality and features.

A simple example of how this works using metadata is transmitting the word &quot;HELLO&quot;, by encoding each letter as its position in the alphabet. Thus, the letter &quot;A&quot; is coded as 1, &quot;B&quot; as 2, and so on as shown in the table on the right. Adding up the resulting numbers yields 8 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 52, and 5 + 2 = 7 calculates the metadata. Finally, the &quot;8 5 12 12 15 7&quot; numbers sequence is transmitted, which the receiver will see on its end if there are no transmission errors. The receiver knows that the last number received is the error-detecting metadata and that all data before is the message, so the receiver can recalculate the above math and if the metadata matches it can be concluded that the data has been received error-free. Though, if the receiver sees something like a &quot;7 5 12 12 15 7&quot; sequence (first element altered by some error), it can run the check by calculating 7 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 51 and 5 + 1 = 6, and discard the received data as defective since 6 does not equal 7.

More sophisticated error detection and correction algorithms are designed to reduce the risk that multiple transmission errors in the data would cancel each other out and go undetected. An algorithm that can even detect if the correct bytes are received but out of order is the cyclic redundancy check or CRC. This algorithm is often used in the data link layer.

==Relation to the TCP/IP model==

In the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), OSI&#x27;s data link layer functionality is contained within its lowest layer, the link layer. The TCP/IP link layer has the operating scope of the link a host is connected to, and only concerns itself with hardware issues to the point of obtaining hardware (MAC) addresses for locating hosts on the link and transmitting data frames onto the link. The link-layer functionality was described in RFC 1122 and is defined differently than the data link layer of OSI, and encompasses all methods that affect the local link.

The TCP/IP model is not a top-down comprehensive design reference for networks. It was formulated for the purpose of illustrating the logical groups and scopes of functions needed in the design of the suite of internetworking protocols of TCP/IP, as needed for the operation of the Internet. In general, direct or strict comparisons of the OSI and TCP/IP models should be avoided, because the layering in TCP/IP is not a principal design criterion and in general, considered to be &quot;harmful&quot; (RFC 3439). In particular, TCP/IP does not dictate a strict hierarchical sequence of encapsulation requirements, as is attributed to OSI protocols.

<text>The Science Museum is a major museum on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London. It was founded in 1857 and is one of the city&#x27;s major tourist attractions, attracting 3.3 million visitors annually in 2019.

Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Science Museum does not charge visitors for admission, although visitors are requested to make a donation if they are able. Temporary exhibitions may incur an admission fee.

It is one of the five museums in the Science Museum Group.

==Founding and history==

The museum was founded in 1857 under Bennet Woodcroft from the collection of the Royal Society of Arts and surplus items from the Great Exhibition as part of the South Kensington Museum, together with what is now the Victoria and Albert Museum. It included a collection of machinery which became the &quot;Museum of Patents&quot; in 1858, and the &quot;Patent Office Museum&quot; in 1863. This collection contained many of the most famous exhibits of what is now the Science Museum.

In 1883, the contents of the Patent Office Museum were transferred to the South Kensington Museum. In 1885, the Science Collections were renamed the &quot;Science Museum&quot; and in 1893 a separate director was appointed. The Art Collections were renamed the &quot;Art Museum&quot;, which eventually became the Victoria and Albert Museum.

When Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone for the new building for the Art Museum, she stipulated that the museum be renamed after herself and her late husband. This was initially applied to the whole museum, but when that new building finally opened ten years later, the title was confined to the Art Collections and the Science Collections had to be divorced from it. On 26 June 1909 the Science Museum, as an independent entity, came into existence.

The Science Museum&#x27;s present quarters, designed by Sir Richard Allison, were opened to the public in stages over the period 1919–28. This building was known as the East Block, construction of which began in 1913 and was temporarily halted by World War I. As the name suggests it was intended to be the first building of a much larger project, which was never realized. However, the museum buildings were expanded over the following years; a pioneering &quot;Children&#x27;s Gallery&quot; with interactive exhibits opened in 1931, the Centre Block was completed in 1961–3, the infill of the East Block and the construction of the Lower &amp; Upper Wellcome Galleries in 1980, and the construction of the Wellcome Wing in 2000 result in the museum now extending to Queen&#x27;s Gate.

===Centennial volume: &quot;Science for the Nation&quot;===
The leading academic publisher, Palgrave Macmillan, published the official centenary history of the Science Museum on 14 April 2010. The first complete history of the Science Museum since 1957, &quot;Science for the Nation: Perspectives on the History of the Science Museum&quot; is a series of individual views by Science Museum staff and external academic historians of different aspects of the Science Museum&#x27;s history. While it is not a chronological history in the conventional sense, the first five chapters cover the history of the museum from the Brompton Boilers in the 1860s to the opening of the Wellcome Wing in 2000. The remaining eight chapters cover a variety of themes concerning the museum&#x27;s development.

==Galleries==
The Science Museum consists of two buildings – the main building and the Wellcome Wing. Visitors enter the main building from Exhibition Road, while the Wellcome Wing is accessed by walking through the Energy Hall, &quot;Exploring Space&quot; and then the &quot;Making the Modern World&quot; galleries (see below) at ground floor level.

=== Main building – Level 0 ===

====The Energy Hall====
The Energy Hall is the first area that most visitors see as they enter the building. On the ground floor, the gallery contains a variety of steam engines, including the oldest surviving James Watt beam engine, which together tell the story of the British Industrial Revolution.

Also on display is a recreation of James Watt&#x27;s garret workshop from his home, Heathfield Hall, using over 8,300 objects removed from the room, which was sealed after his 1819 death, when the hall was demolished in 1927.

====Exploring Space====
&quot;Exploring Space&quot; is a historical gallery, filled with rockets and exhibits that tell the story of human space exploration and the benefits that space exploration has brought us (particularly in the world of telecommunications).

====&quot;Making the Modern World&quot;====

&quot;Making the Modern World&quot; displays some of the museum&#x27;s most remarkable objects, including &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; (the oldest surviving steam locomotive), Crick&#x27;s double helix, and the command module from the Apollo 10 mission, which are displayed along a timeline chronicling man&#x27;s technological achievements.

A V-2 rocket, designed by German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, is displayed in this gallery. Doug Millard, space historian and curator of space technology at the museum, states: &quot;We got to the Moon using V-2 technology but this was technology that was developed with massive resources, including some particularly grim ones. The V-2 programme was hugely expensive in terms of lives, with the Nazis using slave labour to manufacture these rockets&quot;.

Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket used to be displayed in this gallery. After a short UK tour, since 2019 &quot;Rocket&quot; is on permanent display at the National Railway Museum in York, in the Art Gallery.

=== Main Building – Level 1 ===

==== &quot;Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries&quot; ====
The &quot;Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries&quot; is a five-gallery medical exhibition which spans ancient history to modern times with over 3000 exhibits and specially commissioned artworks. Many of the objects on display come from the Wellcome Collection started by Henry Wellcome. One of the commissioned artworks is a large bronze sculpture of Rick Genest titled &quot;Self-Conscious Gene&quot; by Marc Quinn. The galleries occupy the museum&#x27;s entire first floor and opened on 16 November 2019.

=== Main Building – Level 2 ===

==== The Clockmakers Museum ====
The Clockmakers Museum is the world&#x27;s oldest clock and watch museum which was originally assembled by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in London&#x27;s Guildhall.

==== &quot;Science City 1550–1800: The Linbury Gallery&quot; ====
The &quot;Science City 1550–1800: The Linbury Gallery&quot; shows how London grew to be a global hub for trade, commerce and scientific enquiry.

==== &quot;Mathematics: The Winton Gallery&quot; ====
The &quot;Mathematics: The Winton Gallery&quot; examines the role that mathematicians have had in building our modern world. In the landing area to access the gallery (stair C) is a working example of Charles Babbage&#x27;s Difference engine No.2. This was built by the Science Museum and its main part completed in 1991, to celebrate 200 years since Babbage&#x27;s birth, and was designed by Zaha Hadid Architects.

==== &quot;Information Age&quot; ====

The &quot;Information Age&quot; gallery has exhibits covering the development of communications and computing over the last two centuries. It explores the six networks that have transformed global communications: The Cable, The Telephone Exchange, Broadcast, The Constellation, The Cell and The Web It was opened on 24 October 2014 by the Queen, Elizabeth II, who sent her first tweet from here.

=== Main Building – Level 3 ===

====&quot;Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery&quot; ====
One of the most popular galleries in the museum is the interactive &quot;Wonderlab:The Equinor Gallery&quot;, formerly called &quot;Launchpad&quot;. The gallery is staffed by &quot;Explainers&quot; who demonstrate how exhibits work, conduct live experiments and perform shows to schools and the visiting public.

====&quot;Flight&quot;====
The &quot;Flight&quot; gallery charts the development of flight in the 20th century. Contained in the gallery are several full sized aeroplanes and helicopters, including Alcock and Brown&#x27;s transatlantic Vickers Vimy (1919), Spitfire and Hurricane fighters, as well as numerous aero-engines and a cross-section of a Boeing 747. It opened in 1963 and was refurbished in the 1990s.

=== Wellcome Wing ===

==== &quot;Power Up&quot; (Level 1) ====
&quot;Power Up&quot; is an interactive gaming gallery showcasing the history of video games and consoles from the past 50 years. Visitors can play on over 150 consoles, featuring consoles from the Binatone TV Master to the Play Station 5.

The &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; gallery hosts topical science stories and free exhibitions including:

* Mission to Mercury: Bepi Columbo
* &quot;Driverless: Who&#x27;s in control?&quot; (exhibition ended January 2021)

==== &quot;IMAX: The Ronson Theatre&quot; (Entrance from Level 0) ====
The &quot;IMAX: The Ronson Theatre&quot; is an IMAX cinema which shows educational films (most in 3-D), as well as blockbusters and live events. It features a screen measuring 24.3 by 16.8 metres, with both a dual IMAX with Laser projection system and a traditional IMAX 15/70mm film projector, and an IMAX 12-channel sound system.

==== &quot;Who Am I?&quot; (Level 1) ====
Visitors to the &quot;Who Am I?&quot; gallery can explore the science of who they are through intriguing objects, provocative artworks and hands-on exhibits.

==== &quot;Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery&quot; (Level 2) ====
&quot;Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery&quot; explores how the world can generate and use energy more sustainably to urgently reduce carbon dioxide emissions from global energy systems and limit the impact of climate change.

==Temporary and touring exhibitions==

==Events==
===&quot;Astronights&quot; for Children===
The Science Museum organises &quot;Astronights&quot;, &quot;all-night extravaganza with a scientific twist&quot;. Up to 380 children aged between 7 and 11, accompanied by adults, are invited to spend an evening performing fun &quot;science based&quot; activities and then spend the night sleeping in the museum galleries amongst the exhibits. In the morning, they&#x27;re woken to breakfast and more science, watching a show before the end of the event.

===&#x27;Lates&#x27; for Adults===
On the evening of the last Wednesday of every month (except December) the museum organises an adults only evening with up to 30 events, from lectures to silent discos. Previous Lates have seen conversations with the actress activist Lily Cole and Biorevolutions with the Francis Crick Institute which attracted around 7000 people, mostly under the age of 35.

===Cancellation of James D. Watson talk===
In October 2007, the Science Museum cancelled a talk by the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, James D. Watson, because he claimed that IQ test results showed black people to have lower intelligence than white people. The decision was criticised by some scientists, including Richard Dawkins, but supported by other scientists, including Steven Rose.

== Former galleries ==

The museum has undergone many changes in its history with older galleries being replaced by new ones.
* &quot;The Children&#x27;s Gallery&quot; – 1931–1995 Located in the basement, it was replaced by the under fives area called &quot;The Garden&quot;.
* &quot;Agriculture&quot; – 1951–2017 Located on the first floor, it looked at the history and future of farming in the 20th century. It featured model dioramas and object displays. It was replaced by &quot;Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries&quot; in 2019.
* &quot;Shipping&quot; – 1963–2012. Located on the second floor, its contents were 3D scanned and made available online. It was replaced by Information Age.

* &quot;Land Transport&quot; – 1967–1996 Located on the ground floor, it displayed vehicles and objects associated with transport on land, including rail and road. It was replaced by the Making the Modern World gallery in 2000.
* &quot;Glimpses of Medical History&quot; – 1981–2015 Located on the fourth floor, it contained reconstructions and dioramas of the history of practised medicine. It was not replaced, but subsumed into Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries which opened on the museum&#x27;s first floor in November 2019.
* &quot;Science and the Art of Medicine&quot; – 1981–2015 Located on the fifth floor, which featured exhibits of medical instruments and practices from ancient days and from many countries. It was not replaced, but subsumed into Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries which opened on the museum&#x27;s first floor in November 2019.
* &quot;Launchpad&quot; – 1986–2015 Originally opening on the ground floor, in 1989 it moved to the first floor replacing Textiles. Then in 2000 to the basement of the newly built Wellcome Wing. In 2007, it moved to its final location on the third floor, replacing the George III gallery. It was replaced by Wonderlab in 2016.
* &quot;Challenge of Materials&quot; – 1997–2019 Located on the first floor, explored the diversity and properties of materials. It was designed by WilkinsonEyre and featured an exhibit &quot;Materials House&quot; by Thomas Heatherwick.
* &quot;Cosmos and Culture&quot; – 2009–2017 Located on the first floor, it featured astronomical objects showing the study of the night sky. It was replaced by &quot;Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries&quot; in 2019.
* &quot;Atmosphere&quot; – 2010–2022. The &quot;Atmosphere&quot; gallery explored the science of climate.
* &quot;Engineer your Future&quot; – 2014–2023. The &quot;Engineer your Future&quot; gallery explored whether you have the problem solving and team working skills to succeed in a career in engineering.
* &quot;The Secret Life of the Home&quot; – 1995–2024. &quot;The Secret Life of the Home&quot; showed the development of household appliances mostly from the late 19th and early 20th century, although some were earlier. This gallery closed permanently on 2 June 2024.

== Storage, library and archives ==
Blythe House, 1979–2019, the museum&#x27;s former storage facility in West Kensington, while not a gallery, it offered tours of the collections housed there. Objects formerly housed there are being transferred to the National Collections Centre, at the Science Museum Wroughton, in Wiltshire.

The Science Museum has a dedicated library, and until the 1960s was Britain&#x27;s National Library for Science, Medicine and Technology. It holds runs of periodicals, early books and manuscripts, and is used by scholars worldwide. It was, for a number of years, run in conjunction with the library of Imperial College, but in 2007 the library was divided over two sites. Histories of science and biographies of scientists were kept at the Imperial College Library until February 2014 when the arrangement was terminated, the shelves were cleared and the books and journals shipped out, joining the rest of the collection, which includes original scientific works and archives at the National Collections Centre.

Dana Research Centre and Library previously an event space and cafe, reopened in its current form in 2015. Open to researchers and members of the public, it allows free access to almost 7,000 volumes, which can be consulted on site.

== Sponsorship ==
The Science Museum has been sponsored by major organisations including Shell, BP, Samsung and GlaxoSmithKline. Some have been controversial. The museum declined to give details of how much it receives from oil and gas sponsors. Equinor is also the title sponsor of &quot;Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery&quot;, an exhibition for children, while BP is one of the funding partners of the museum&#x27;s STEM Training Academy. Equinor&#x27;s sponsorship of the Wonderlab exhibit was on the basis that the Science Museum would not make any statement to damage the oil firm&#x27;s reputation.

Shell has influenced how the museum presents climate change in its programme sponsored by the oil company. The museum has signed a gagging clause in its agreement with Shell not to &quot;make any statement or issue any publicity or otherwise be involved in any conduct or matter that may reasonably be foreseen as discrediting or damaging the goodwill or reputation&quot; of Shell.

The museum signed a sponsorship contract with the Norwegian oil and gas company Equinor which contained a gagging clause, stating the museum would not say anything that could damage the fossil fuel company&#x27;s reputation.

=== Reactions to sponsorship by fossil fuel companies ===
The museum&#x27;s director, Ian Blatchford, defended the museum&#x27;s sponsorship policy, saying: &quot;Even if the Science Museum were lavishly publicly funded I would still want to have sponsorship from the oil companies.&quot;

Scientists for Global Responsibility called the museum&#x27;s move &quot;staggeringly out-of-step and irresponsible&quot;. Some presenters, including George Monbiot, pulled out of climate talks on finding they were sponsored by BP and the Norwegian oil company Equinor. Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment said the &quot;carbon capture exhibition is not &#x27;greenwash&#x27;&quot;.

There have been protests against the sponsorship; in May 2021, a group calling themselves &#x27;Scientists for XR&#x27; (Extinction Rebellion) locked themselves to a mechanical tree inside the museum. The UK Student Climate Network carried out an overnight occupation in June 2021, and were threatened with arrest. In August 2021, members of Extinction Rebellion held a protest inside and outside the museum with a pink dodo.

In 2021, Chris Rapley, a climate scientist, resigned from the museum&#x27;s advisory board because of oil and gas company sponsorship.

In 2021, more than 40 senior academics and scientists said they would not work with the Science Museum due to its financial relationships with the fossil fuel industry.

In 2022, more than 400 teachers signed an open letter to the museum promising to boycott it following sponsorship of the museum&#x27;s Energy Revolution exhibition by the coal mining company Adani.

<text>The Portuguese war (Physalia physalis), also known as the man-of-war or bluebottle, is a marine hydrozoan found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. It is considered to be the same species as the Pacific man o&#x27; war or bluebottle, which is found mainly in the Pacific Ocean. The Portuguese man o&#x27; war is the only species in the genus Physalia, which in turn is the only genus in the family Physaliidae. 

The Portuguese man o&#x27; war is a conspicuous member of the neuston, the community of organisms that live at the surface of the ocean. It has numerous microscopic venomous cnidocytes which deliver a painful sting powerful enough to kill fish, and even, in some cases, humans. Although it superficially resembles a jellyfish, the Portuguese man o&#x27; war is in fact a siphonophore. Like all siphonophores, it is a colonial organism, made up of many smaller units called zooids. Although they are morphologically quite different, all of the zooids in a single specimen are genetically identical. These different types of zooids fulfill specialized functions, such as hunting, digestion and reproduction, and together they allow the colony to operate as a single individual.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;man o’ war&quot; comes from the man-of-war, a sailing warship, and the animal&#x27;s resemblance to the Portuguese version (the caravel) at full sail.

==Taxonomy==
The bluebottle, Pacific man o&#x27; war or Indo-Pacific Portuguese man o&#x27; war, distinguished by a smaller float and a single long fishing tentacle, was originally considered a separate species in the same genus (&quot;P. utriculus&quot;). The name was synonymized with &quot;P. physalis&quot; in 2007, and it is now considered a regional form of the same species.

==Coloniality==
The man o&#x27; war is described as a colonial organism because the individual zooids in a colony are evolutionarily derived from either polyps or medusae, i.e. the two basic body plans of cnidarians. Both of these body plans comprise entire individuals in non-colonial cnidarians (for example, a jellyfish is a medusa, while a sea anemone is a polyp). All zooids in a man o&#x27; war develop from the same single fertilized egg and are therefore genetically identical. They remain physiologically connected throughout life, and essentially function as organs in a shared body. Hence, a Portuguese man o&#x27; war constitutes a single organism from an ecological perspective, but is made up of many individuals from an embryological perspective.

Most species of siphonophores are fragile and difficult to collect intact. However, &quot;P. physalis&quot; is the most accessible, conspicuous, and robust of the siphonophores, and much has been written about this species. The development, morphology, and colony organization of &quot;P. physalis&quot; is very different from that of other siphonophores. Its structure, embryological development, and histology have been examined by several authors. These studies provide an important foundation for understanding the morphology, cellular anatomy, and development of this species.

==Description==

Like all siphonophores, &quot;P. physalis&quot; is a colonial organism: each animal is composed of many smaller units (zooids) that hang in clusters from under a large, gas-filled structure called the pneumatophore.

Seven different types of zooids have been described in the man o&#x27; war, and all of these are interdependent on each other for survival and performing different functions, such as digestion (s), reproduction (gonozooids) and hunting (dactylozooids). A fourth type of zooid is the pneumatophore. Three of these types of zooids are of the medusoid type (gonophores, s, and vestigial nectophores), while the remaining four are of the polypoid type (free gastrozooids, tentacle-bearing zooids, gonozooids and gonopalpons). However, naming and categorization of zooids varies between authors, and much of the embryonic and evolutionary relationships of zooids remains unclear.

The pneumatophore or bladder is the most conspicuous part of the man o&#x27; war. This large, gas-filled, translucent structure is pink, purple or blue in color; it is long and rises as much as above the water. The pneumatophore functions as both a flotation device and a sail, allowing the animal to move with the prevailing wind. The gas in the pneumatophore is mostly air which diffuses in from the surrounding atmosphere, but it also contains as much as 13% carbon monoxide, which is actively produced by the animal. In the event of a surface attack, the pneumatophore can be deflated, allowing the animal to temporarily submerge.

New zooids are added by budding as the colony grows. Long tentacles hang below the float as the animal drifts, fishing for prey to sting and drag up to its digestive zooids.

The colony hunts and feeds through the cooperation of two types of zooids: tentacle-bearing zooids known as dactylozooids (or palpons), and gastrozooids. The palpons are equipped with tentacles, which are typically about in length but can reach over . Each tentacle bears tiny, coiled, thread-like structures called nematocysts. Nematocysts trigger and inject venom on contact, stinging, paralyzing, and killing molluscs and fishes. Large groups of Portuguese man o&#x27; war, sometimes over 1,000 individuals, may deplete fisheries. Contraction of tentacles drags the prey upward and into range of the gastrozooids. The gastrozooids surround and digest the food by secreting digestive enzymes. &quot;P. physalis&quot; typically has multiple stinging tentacles, but a regional form (previously known as a separate species, &quot;P. utriculus&quot;) has only a single stinging tentacle.

The main reproductive zooids, the gonophores, are situated on branching structures called gonodendra. Gonophores produce sperm or eggs. Besides gonophores, each gonodendron also contains several other types of specialized zooids: gonozooids (which are accessory gastrozooids), nectophores (which have been speculated to allow detached gonodendra to swim), and vestigial nectophores (also called jelly polyps; the function of these is unclear).

==Life cycle==
Man o&#x27; war individuals are dioecious, meaning each colony is either male or female. Gonophores producing either sperm or eggs (depending on the sex of the colony) sit on a tree-like structure called a gonodendron, which is believed to drop off from the colony during reproduction. Mating takes place primarily in the autumn, when eggs and sperm are shed from gonophores into the water. As neither fertilization nor early development has been directly observed in the wild, it is not yet known at what depth these occur.

A fertilized man o&#x27; war egg develops into a planula that buds off new zooids as it grows, gradually forming a new colony. This development initially occurs under the water, and has been reconstructed by comparing different stages of planulae collected at sea. The first two structures to emerge are the pneumatophore (sail) and a single, early feeding zooid called a protozooid. Later, gastrozooids and tentacle-bearing zooids are added. Eventually, the growing pneumatophore becomes buoyant enough to carry the immature colony on the surface of the water.

==Ecology==

===Predators and prey===

The Portuguese man o&#x27; war is a carnivore. Using its venomous tentacles, it traps and paralyzes its prey while reeling it inwards to its digestive polyps. It typically feeds on small fish, molluscs, shrimp and other small crustaceans, and zooplankton.

The organism has few predators; one example is the loggerhead sea turtle, which feeds on the Portuguese man o&#x27; war as a common part of its diet. The turtle&#x27;s skin, including that of its tongue and throat, is too thick for the stings to penetrate. Also, the blue sea slug specializes in feeding on the Portuguese man o&#x27; war, as does the violet sea snail. The ocean sunfish&#x27;s diet, once thought to consist mainly of jellyfish, has been found to include many species, including the Portuguese man o&#x27; war.

The man-of-war fish, &quot;Nomeus gronovii&quot;, is a driftfish native to the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is notable for its ability to live within the deadly tentacles of the Portuguese man o&#x27; war, upon whose tentacles and gonads it feeds. Rather than using mucus to prevent nematocysts from firing, as is seen in some of the clownfish sheltering among sea anemones, the man-of-war fish appears to use highly agile swimming to physically avoid tentacles. The fish has a very high number of vertebrae (41), which may add to its agility and primarily uses its pectoral fins for swimming—a feature of fish that specialize in maneuvering tight spaces. It also has a complex skin design and at least one antibody to the man o&#x27; war&#x27;s toxins. Although the fish seems to be 10 times more resistant to the toxin than other fish, it can be stung by the dactylozooides (large tentacles), which it actively avoids. The smaller gonozooids do not seem to sting the fish and the fish is reported to frequently nibble on these tentacles.

===Commensalism and symbiosis===

The Portuguese man o&#x27; war is often found with a variety of other marine fish, including yellow jack. These fish benefit from the shelter from predators provided by the stinging tentacles, and for the Portuguese , the presence of these species may attract other fish to eat.

The blanket octopus is immune to the venom of the Portuguese man o&#x27; war. Individuals have been observed to carry broken man o&#x27; war tentacles, which males and immature females rip off and use for offensive and defensive purposes.

==Venom==
The stinging, venom-filled nematocysts in the tentacles of the Portuguese man o&#x27; war can paralyze small fish and other prey. Detached tentacles and dead specimens (including those that wash up on shore) can sting just as painfully as those of the live organism in the water and may remain potent for hours or even days after the death of the organism or the detachment of the tentacle.

Stings usually cause severe pain to humans, lasting one to three hours. Red, whip-like welts appear on the skin that last two or three days after the sting. In some cases, the venom may travel to the lymph nodes and may cause symptoms that mimic an allergic reaction, including swelling of the larynx, airway blockage, cardiac distress and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fever, circulatory shock and in extreme cases, even death, although this is extremely rare. Medical attention for those exposed to large numbers of tentacles may become necessary to relieve pain or open airways if the pain becomes excruciating or lasts for more than three hours, or if breathing becomes difficult. Instances in which the stings completely surround the trunk of a young child are among those that may be fatal.

The species is responsible for up to 10,000 human stings in Australia each summer, particularly on the east coast, with some others occurring off the coast of South Australia and Western Australia.

===Treatment of stings===
Stings from a Portuguese man o&#x27; war can result in severe dermatitis characterized by long, thin, open wounds that resemble those caused by a whip. These are not caused by any impact or cutting action, but by irritating urticariogenic substances in the tentacles.

Treatment for sting pain is immersion in water for 20 minutes. The cnidocyte found in the box jellyfish react differently than the nematocyst in the Portuguese man o&#x27; war; cnidocytes are inhibited by application of vinegar, but nematocysts can discharge more venom if vinegar is applied.

==Distribution==
The species is found throughout the world&#x27;s oceans, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, but occasionally also in temperate regions.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. physalis&quot; is a member of the neuston (the floating community of organisms that live at the interface between water and air). This community is exposed to a unique set of environmental conditions including prolonged exposure to intense ultraviolet light, risk of desiccation, and rough sea conditions. The gas-filled bladder, or pneumatophore, remains at the surface, while the remainder is submerged. The animal has no means of propulsion; it moves passively, driven by the winds, currents, and tides. Winds can drive them into bays or onto beaches. Often, finding a single Portuguese man o&#x27; war is followed by finding many others in the vicinity. The Portuguese man o&#x27; war is well known to beachgoers for the painful stings delivered by its tentacles. Because they can sting while beached, the discovery of a man o&#x27; war washed up on a beach may lead to the closure of the beach.

==Drifting dynamics==

&quot;P. physalis&quot; uses a float filled with carbon monoxide and air as a sail to travel by wind for thousands of miles, dragging behind long tentacles that deliver a deadly venomous sting to fish. This sailing ability, combined with a painful sting and a life cycle with seasonal blooms, results in periodic mass beach strandings and occasional human envenomations, making &quot;P. physalis&quot; the most infamous of the siphonophores. Despite being a common occurrence, the origin of the man o&#x27; war or bluebottle before reaching the coastline is not well understood, and neither is the way it drifts at the surface of the ocean.

===Left- and right-handedness===

The Portuguese man o&#x27; war is asymmetrically shaped: the zooids hang down from either the right or left side of the midline of the pneumatophore or bladder. The pneumatophore can be oriented towards the left or the right. This phenomenon may be an adaptation that prevents an entire population from being washed on shore to die. The &quot;left-handed&quot; animals sail to the right of the wind, while the &quot;right-handed&quot; animals sail to the left. The wind will always push the two types in opposite directions, so at most half the population will be pushed towards the coast. Regional populations can have substantial differences in float size and the number of tentacles used for hunting. The regional form previously known as &quot;P. utriculus&quot; has a bladder rarely exceeding in length and has one long hunting tentacle that is less than long. In comparison, the typical man o&#x27; war has a float of around , and several hunting tentacles that can reach in mature colonies when fully extended. When combined with the trailing action of the tentacles, this left- or right-handedness makes the colony sail sideways relative to the wind, by about 45° in either direction. Colony handedness has therefore been theorized to influence man o&#x27; war migration, with left-handed or right-handed colonies potentially being more likely to drift down particular respective sea routes. Handedness develops early in the colony&#x27;s life, while it is still living below the surface of the sea.

===Mathematical modelling===
Since they have no propulsion system, the movement of the man o&#x27; war can be modelled mathematically by calculating the forces acting on it, or by advecting virtual particles in ocean and atmospheric circulation models. Earlier studies modelled the movement of the man o&#x27; war with Lagrangian particle tracking to explain major beaching events. In 2017, Ferrer and Pastor were able to estimate the region of origin of a significant beaching event on the southeastern Bay of Biscay. They ran a Lagrangian model backwards in time, using wind velocity and a wind drag coefficient as drivers of the man o&#x27; war motion. They found that the region of origin was the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. In 2015 Prieto et al. included both the effect of the surface currents and wind to predict the initial colony position prior to major beaching events in the Mediterranean. This model assumed the man o&#x27; war was advected by the surface currents, with the effect of the wind being added with a much higher wind drag coefficient of 10%. Similarly, in 2020 Headlam et al. used beaching and offshore observations to identify a region of origin, using the joint effects of surface currents and wind drag, for the largest mass man o&#x27; war beaching on the Irish coastline in over 150 years. These earlier studies used numerical models in combination with simple assumptions to calculate the drift of this species, excluding complex drifting dynamics. In 2021, Lee &quot;et al.&quot; provide a parameterisation for Lagrangian modelling of the bluebottle by considering the similarities between the bluebottle and a sailboat. This allowed them to compute the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces acting on the bluebottle and use an equilibrium condition to create a generalised model for calculating the drifting speed and course of the bluebottle under any wind and ocean current conditions.

<doc id="152958" wikidata="Q982914" url="?curid=152958" title="Hexokinase">
<text>A hexokinase is an enzyme that irreversibly phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose phosphate. In most organisms, glucose is the most important substrate for hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate is the most important product. Hexokinase possesses the ability to transfer an inorganic phosphate group from ATP to a substrate.

Hexokinases should not be confused with glucokinase, which is a specific hexokinase found in the liver. All hexokinases are capable of phosphorylating several hexoses but hexokinase IV(D) is often misleadingly called glucokinase, though it is no more specific for glucose than the other mammalian isoenzymes.

==Variation==
Genes that encode hexokinase have been discovered in every domain of life, and exist among a variety of species that range from bacteria, yeast, and plants to humans and other vertebrates. The enzymes from yeast, plants and vertebrates all show clear sequence evidence of homology, but those of bacteria may not be related.

They are categorized as &quot;actin fold&quot; proteins, sharing a common ATP binding site core that is surrounded by more variable sequences which determine substrate affinities and other properties.

Several hexokinase isoenzymes that provide different functions can occur in a single species.

==Reaction==
The intracellular reactions mediated by hexokinases can be typified as:
:Hexose-CH2OH + MgATP → Hexose-CH2O-PO + MgADP + H+
where hexose-CH2OH represents any of several hexoses (like glucose) that contain an accessible -CH2OH moiety.
==Consequences of hexose phosphorylation==
Phosphorylation of a hexose such as glucose often limits it to a number of intracellular metabolic processes, such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis. This is because phosphorylated hexoses are charged, and thus more difficult to transport out of a cell.

In patients with essential fructosuria, metabolism of fructose by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate is the primary method of metabolizing dietary fructose; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals.

==Size of different isoforms==
Most bacterial hexokinases are approximately 50 kDa in size. Multicellular organisms including plants and animals often have more than one hexokinase isoform. Most are about 100 kDa in size and consist of two halves (N and C terminal), which share much sequence homology. This suggests an evolutionary origin by duplication and fusion of a 50 kDa ancestral hexokinase similar to those of bacteria.

==Types of mammalian hexokinase==
There are four important mammalian hexokinase isozymes () that vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions, and physiological function. They were designated hexokinases A, B, C, and D on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility. The alternative names hexokinases I, II, III, and IV (respectively) proposed later are widely used.

===Hexokinases I, II, and III===
Hexokinases I, II, and III are referred to as low-&quot;K&quot;m isoenzymes because of a high affinity for glucose (below 1 mM). Hexokinases I and II follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics at physiological concentrations of substrates. All three are strongly inhibited by their product, glucose-6-phosphate. Molecular masses are around 100 kDa. Each consists of two similar 50kDa halves, but only in hexokinase II do both halves have functional active sites.

* Hexokinase I/A is found in all mammalian tissues, and is considered a &quot;housekeeping enzyme,&quot; unaffected by most physiological, hormonal, and metabolic changes.
* Hexokinase II/B constitutes the principal regulated isoenzyme in many cell types and is increased in many cancers. It is the hexokinase found in muscle and heart. Hexokinase II is also located at the mitochondria outer membrane so it can have direct access to ATP. The relative specific activity of hexokinase II increases with pH at least in a pH range from 6.9 to 8.5.
* Hexokinase III/C is substrate-inhibited by glucose at physiological concentrations. Little is known about the regulatory characteristics of this isoenzyme.

===Hexokinase IV (&quot;glucokinase&quot;)===
Mammalian hexokinase IV, also referred to as glucokinase, differs from other hexokinases in kinetics and functions.

The location of the phosphorylation on a subcellular level occurs when glucokinase translocates between the cytoplasm and nucleus of liver cells. Glucokinase can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough; it does not follow Henri–Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and has no &quot;K&quot;m; It is half-saturated at glucose concentrations 100 times higher than those of hexokinases I, II, and III.

Hexokinase IV is monomeric, about 50kDa, displays positive cooperativity with glucose, and is not allosterically inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate.

Hexokinase IV is present in the liver, pancreas, hypothalamus, small intestine, and perhaps certain other neuroendocrine cells, and plays an important regulatory role in carbohydrate metabolism. In the β cells of the pancreatic islets, it serves as a glucose sensor to control insulin release, and similarly controls glucagon release in the α cells. In hepatocytes of the liver, glucokinase responds to changes of ambient glucose levels by increasing or reducing glycogen synthesis.

==In glycolysis==
Glucose is unique in that it can be used to produce ATP by all cells in both the presence and absence of molecular oxygen (O2). The first step in glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase.
 

By catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose 6-phosphate, hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells. This reaction also initiates all physiologically relevant pathways of glucose utilization, including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The addition of a charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures &#x27;trapping&#x27; of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose, and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose) within cells, as charged hexose phosphates cannot easily cross the cell membrane.

==Association with mitochondria==
Hexokinases I and II can associate physically to the outer surface of the external membrane of mitochondria through specific binding to a porin, or voltage dependent anion channel. This association confers hexokinase direct access to ATP generated by mitochondria, which is one of the two substrates of hexokinase. Mitochondrial hexokinase is highly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumor cells, with levels up to 200 times higher than normal tissues. Mitochondrially bound hexokinase has been demonstrated to be the driving force for the extremely high glycolytic rates that take place aerobically in tumor cells (the so-called Warburg effect described by Otto Heinrich Warburg in 1930).

==Deficiency==
Hexokinase deficiency is a genetic autosomal recessive disease that causes chronic haemolytic anaemia. Chronic haemolytic anaemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for hexokinase. The mutation causes a reduction of the hexokinase activity, and hence hexokinase deficiency.

<doc id="152959" wikidata="Q2351129" url="?curid=152959" title="Ashdown Forest">
<text>Ashdown Forest is an ancient area of open heathland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top of the High Weald National Landscape. It is situated south of London in the county East Sussex, England. Rising to an elevation
of above sea level, its heights provide expansive vistas across the heavily wooded hills of the Weald to the chalk escarpments of the North Downs and South Downs on the horizon.

Ashdown Forest originated as a medieval hunting forest created soon after the Norman conquest of England. By 1283 the forest was fenced in by a &quot;pale&quot; enclosing an area of . Thirty-four &quot;gates&quot; and &quot;hatches&quot; in the pale, still remembered in place names such as Chuck Hatch and Chelwood Gate, allowed local people to enter to graze their livestock, collect firewood, and cut heather and bracken for animal bedding. The forest continued to be used by the monarchy and nobility for hunting into Tudor times, including notably Henry VIII, who had a hunting lodge at Bolebroke Castle, Hartfield and who courted Anne Boleyn at nearby Hever Castle.

Ashdown Forest has a rich archaeological heritage. It contains much evidence of prehistoric human activity, with the earliest evidence of human occupation dating back to 50,000 years ago. There are important Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Romano-British remains. The forest was the centre of a nationally important iron industry on two occasions, during the Roman occupation of Britain and in the Tudor period when, in 1496, England&#x27;s first blast furnace was built at Newbridge, near Coleman&#x27;s Hatch, marking the beginning of Britain&#x27;s modern iron and steel industry. In 1693, more than half the forest was taken into private hands, with the remainder set aside as common land. The latter today covers and is the largest area with open public access in South East England. The ecological importance of Ashdown Forest&#x27;s heathlands is reflected by its designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as a Special Protection Area for birds, and as a Special Area of Conservation for its heathland habitats. It is part of the European Natura 2000 network as it hosts some of Europe&#x27;s most threatened species and habitats.

Ashdown Forest is famous for serving as inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood, the setting for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories written by A. A. Milne. Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest and took his son, Christopher Robin, walking there. The artist E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books.

==Settlements==
Ashdown Forest notably lacks any significant settlements within the large boundary defined by its medieval pale. There are however a number of villages situated on the edge of the forest adjacent to the pale or close to it. These include Nutley, Fairwarp, Danehill and Maresfield to the south and Forest Row and Hartfield to the north. The town of Crowborough abuts the forest on its eastern side while the town of East Grinstead lies to the north-west.

==Toponymy==
Ashdown Forest does not seem to have existed as a distinct entity before the Norman Conquest of 1066, nor is it mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The area that was to become known as Ashdown Forest was merely an unidentified part of the Forest of Pevensel, a Norman creation within the Rape of Pevensey that had been carved out of a much larger area of woodland, the Weald, which itself was a part of the prehistoric forest cover of the British landmass, the British wildwood. The first recorded reference to Ashdown Forest by name is in the period 1100–1130, when Henry I confirmed the right of monks to use a road across the forest of &quot;Essessdone&quot;, a right which the monks claimed to have held since the Conquest.

&quot;Ashdown Forest&quot; consists of words from two different languages. The first word, &quot;Ashdown&quot;, is of Anglo-Saxon origin. It is probably derived from the personal name of an individual or people called &quot;Æsca&quot;, combined with &quot;dūn&quot;, Old English for hill or down, hence &quot;Æsca&#x27;s dūn&quot;—the hill of Æsca. It has no connection with ash trees, which have never been common given the soil conditions.

The second word, &quot;forest&quot;, is a term here used by the Normans to denote land that was subject to forest law, a harsh and much resented supplement to the common law that was designed to protect, for the king&#x27;s benefit, the beasts of the chase, such as deer and wild boar, and the vegetation (the &quot;vert&quot;) that provided them with food and cover. Forest law prescribed severe penalties, particularly in the 11th and 12th centuries, for those who transgressed, and for a time it governed large parts of the English countryside, including entire counties such as Surrey and Essex. However, while forest land was legally set aside by the crown for hunting and protected its sovereign right to all wild animals, commoners were still able to exercise—within strict limits—many of their traditional or customary rights, for example, to pasture their swine in the woods or collect wind-blown branches and trees. Thus, in the 13th century, the commoners of Ashdown were recorded as grazing large numbers of swine and cattle on the forest alongside the many deer that were kept for aristocratic sport and the provision of venison.

Note that &quot;forest&quot; does not have the modern meaning of &quot;heavily wooded&quot;. Medieval hunting forests like Ashdown consisted of a mixture of heath, woodland and other habitats in which a variety of game could flourish, and where deer in particular could find both open pasture for browsing and woodland thickets for protective cover.

==Shape and extent==
Ashdown Forest is shaped, roughly speaking, like an inverted triangle, some from east to west and the same distance from north to south.

The boundary of the forest can be defined in various ways, but the most important is that given by the line of the medieval pale, which goes back to its origins as a hunting forest. The pale, first referred to in a document of 1283, consisted of a ditch and bank surmounted by an oak palisade. in length, it enclosed an area of some . The original embankment and ditch, albeit now rather degraded and overgrown, can still be discerned in places today.

In 1693 the forest assumed its present-day shape when just over half its then was assigned for private enclosure and improvement, while the remainder, about , was set aside as common land. Much of the latter was distributed in a rather fragmentary way around the periphery of the forest close to existing settlements and smallholdings (&quot;see map&quot;). Many present-day references to Ashdown Forest, including those made by the conservators, treat the forest as synonymous and co-terminous with this residual common land; this can lead to confusion: according to one authority &quot;when people speak of Ashdown Forest, they may mean either a whole district of heaths and woodland that includes many private estates to which there is no public access, or they may be talking of the [common land] where the public are free to roam&quot;.

Most of today&#x27;s common land lies within the medieval pale, although one tract, near Chelwood Beacon, acquired quite recently by the forest conservators, extends outside. The conservators have acquired other tracts in recent years as suitable opportunities have arisen, for example at Chelwood Vachery, as part of a policy to extend the amount of land that they regulate and protect within the pale. According to the definition used by the conservators, which relates to the land for which they have statutory responsibility, the area of Ashdown Forest is .

==Geology==
The underlying geology of Ashdown Forest is mostly sandstone, predominantly the Lower Cretaceous Ashdown Formation. This forms a layer varying from thick, consists of fine-grained, silty interbedded sandstones and siltstones with subordinate amounts of shale and mudstone. It is the oldest Cretaceous geological formation that crops out in the Weald.

The Ashdown Formation has been exposed by the erosion, over many millions of years, of a geological dome, the Weald-Artois Anticline, a process which has left the dome&#x27;s oldest layers, the resistant sandstones that form its central east–west axis, as a high forest ridge that includes Ashdown, St. Leonard&#x27;s, and Worth forests. This forest ridge, the most prominent part of the High Weald, is surrounded by successive concentric bands of younger sandstones and clays, and finally chalk. These form hills or vales depending on their relative resistance to erosion. Consequently, what the viewer sees when looking north or south across the Weald from the heights of Ashdown Forest is a series of successively younger geological formations. These include heavily wooded lowlands formed on Weald Clay, the high Greensand Ridge escarpment that rises prominently to the north, and, on the horizon, the chalk escarpments of the North Downs and South Downs (see diagram, right).

The Ashdown Formation is the lowest (oldest) layer of the Hastings Beds, which comprise (in sequence) the Ashdown Formation, Wadhurst Clay Formation, and Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation, and which are now thought to be predominantly fluvial flood-plain deposits. The Hastings Beds in turn represent the oldest part of the series of Cretaceous geological formations that make up the Weald-Artois Anticline, comprising (in sequence, from oldest to youngest) the Hastings Beds, Weald Clay, Lower Greensand, Gault, Upper Greensand, and Chalk. The anticline, which stretches from South East England into northern France, and is breached by the English Channel, was created soon after the end of the Cretaceous period as a result of the Alpine orogeny. Ashdown Forest is itself situated on a local dome, the Crowborough Anticline.

Much of the iron ore that provided the raw material for the iron industry of Ashdown Forest was obtained from the Wadhurst Clay, which is sandwiched between the Ashdown Sands and Tunbridge Wells Sands (the latter encircles Ashdown Forest forming an extensive district of hilly, wooded countryside). Outcrops of Wadhurst Clay, which occurs as both nodules and in tabular masses, are distributed discontinuously in a horseshoe shape around Ashdown Forest, which has influenced the historical geography of iron-working around the forest.

Like the rest of the Weald, Ashdown lay beyond the southern limits of Quaternary ice sheets, but the whole area was subject at times to a severe periglacial environment that has contributed to its geology and shaped its landforms.

==Ecology==
Ashdown Forest is one of the largest single continuous blocks of lowland heath, semi-natural woodland and valley bog in south east England. Its geology is a major influence on its biology and ecology. The underlying sandstone geology of the Ashdown Sands, when combined with a local climate that is generally wetter, cooler and windier than the surrounding area owing to the forest&#x27;s elevation, which rises from to over above sea level, gives rise to sandy, largely podzolic soils that are characteristically acid, clay, and nutrient-poor. On these poor, infertile soils have developed heathland, valley mires and damp woodland. These conditions have never favoured cultivation and have been a barrier to agricultural improvement.

The forest predominantly consists of &quot;lowland heathland&quot;. Of the 2,472 ha of forest common land, 55% (1365 ha) is heathland while 40% (997 ha) is mixed woodland. Lowland heathland is a particularly valuable but increasingly threatened habitat harbouring rare plant and animal species, which lends the forest importance at a European level. The survival of the forest&#x27;s extensive heathlands has become all the more important when set against the large-scale loss of English lowland heathland over the last 200 years; within the county of East Sussex, heathland has shrunk by 50% over the last 200 years, and most of what remains is in Ashdown Forest.

===Flora===

====Heathland====
Ashdown Forest is noted for its heathland plants and flowers, such as the marsh gentian, but it also provides other distinctive or unusual plant habitats.

The extensive areas of dry heath are dominated by ling (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), bell heather (&quot;Erica cinerea&quot;) and dwarf gorse (&quot;Ulex minor&quot;). Important lichen communities include &quot;Pycnothelia papillaria&quot;. Common bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;) is dominant over large areas. On the damper heath, cross-leaved heath (&quot;Erica tetralix&quot;) becomes dominant with deer-grass (&quot;Trichophorum cespitosum&quot;. The heath and bracken communities form a mosaic with acid grassland dominated by purple moor-grass (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;) mingled with many specialised heathland plants such as petty whin (&quot;Genista anglica&quot;), creeping willow (&quot;Salicaceae&quot; sp.) and heath spotted orchid (&quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot;).

In the wet areas are found several species of sphagnum moss together with bog asphodel (&quot;Narthecium ossifragum&quot;), common cotton-grass (&quot;Eriophorum angustifolium&quot;) and specialities such as marsh gentian (&quot;Gentiana pneumonanthe&quot;), ivy-leaved bell flower (&quot;Wahlenbergia hederacea&quot;), white-beaked sedge (&quot;Rhynchospora alba&quot;) and marsh club moss (&quot;Lycopodiella inundata&quot;). The marsh gentian, noted for its bright blue trumpet-like flowers, has a flowering season lasting from July well into October and is found in about a dozen colonies.

Gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;), silver birch (&quot;Betula pendula&quot;), pedunculate oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) and Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) are scattered across the heath, in places forming extensive areas of secondary woodland and scrub. Older woodlands consist of beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) and sweet chestnut (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;). These contain bluebell (&quot;Hyacinthinoides non-scripta&quot;), bilberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;), hard fern (&quot;Blechnum spicant&quot;) and honeysuckle (&quot;Lonicera periclymenum&quot;) with birds-nest orchid (&quot;Neottia nidus-avis&quot;) and violet helleborine (&quot;Epipactis purpurata&quot;) found particularly under beech. In the woodlands can also be found wood anemone (&quot;Anemone nemorosa&quot;) and common wood sorrel (&quot;Oxalis acetosella&quot;).

====Streams and ponds====
Forest streams, often lined by alder trees such as &quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;, and grey sallow &quot;Salix cinerea&quot;, birch and oak, cut through the soft sandstone forming steep-sided valleys (ghylls) that are sheltered from winter frosts and remain humid in summer, creating conditions more familiar in the Atlantic-facing western coastal regions of Britain. Uncommon bryophytes such as the liverwort &quot;Nardia compressa&quot; and a range of ferns including the mountain fern &quot;Oreopteris limbosperma&quot; and the hay-scented buckler fern &quot;Dryopteris aemula&quot; thrive in this “Atlantic” microclimate.

The damming of streams, digging for marl, and quarrying have produced several large ponds containing, particularly in former marl pits, localised rafts of broad-leaved pondweed &quot;Potamogeton natans&quot;, beds of bulrush (reedmace) &quot;Typha latifolia&quot; and water horsetail &quot;Equisetum fluviatile&quot;.

====Woodland====
Woodland covers nearly of the forest, 40% of its area Most of the woodland on the common land of the forest is young and contains few older trees; there is little &quot;ancient woodland&quot;, defined as woodland that has been continuously wooded since 1600. Almost all the latter that exists within the medieval forest pale is found on land that was set aside in the 1693 division of the forest for private ownership and exploitation. Some wooded ghylls however do contain older trees and there are a few individual old trees, especially beech, that mark former boundaries.

The two most common forms of forest woodland are oak woods on acid brown earth soils, including hazel and chestnut coppice (62% of the total woodland area), and birch woods with oak in degenerating heathlands (27%). Alder trees growing in wet and waterlogged peaty soils account for about 1% of the woodland, while birch and willow trees growing in wet areas each account for less than 1%. Beechwoods growing on acid brown earth soils account for another 3%.

The clumps of Scots pine that form such a distinctive, iconic hilltop feature of Ashdown Forest were first planted in 1816 by the Lord of the Manor to provide habitats for blackgame. 20th-century plantings comprise Macmillan Clump near Chelwood Gate (commemorating former British prime-minister Harold Macmillan, who lived at Birch Grove, on the edge of the forest at Chelwood Gate), Kennedy Clump (commemorating a visit to the area by John F. Kennedy, when he stayed with Macmillan), Millennium Clump and Friends Clump, planted in 1973 to mark the Year of the Tree.
===Fauna===

====Birds====
Important populations of heath and woodland birds are found on the forest, notably Dartford warbler &quot;Sylvia undata&quot; (the forest has all-year resident populations of this, Britain&#x27;s scarcest heathland bird species, which has seen a resurgence since the early 1990s) and European nightjar &quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;. Because of this, it has been designated as a Special Protection Area and it is a popular destination for bird-watchers.

The forest contains four main bird habitats:
* Open lowland heath, with various species of gorse and heather: Dartford warbler (&quot;Sylvia undata&quot;), stonechat (&quot;Saxicola rubecola&quot;) and meadow pipit (&quot;Anthus trivialis&quot;); in the summer, Eurasian skylark (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;), common linnet (&quot;Carduelis cannabina&quot;), yellowhammer (&quot;Emberiza citrinella&quot;) and common cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;); and in winter, rarely, hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;).
* Open areas of grassland, heather or gorse, with some bogs, interspersed with single trees or clumps of trees, particularly Scots pine: lesser redpoll (&quot;Carduelis cabaret&quot;), goldcrest (&quot;Regulus regulus&quot;); in the summer, woodlark (&quot;Lullula arborea&quot;), tree pipit (&quot;Anthus sylvestris&quot;), nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;), common redstart (&quot;Phoenicurus phoenicurus&quot;), spotted flycatcher (&quot;Muscicapa striata&quot;), common snipe (&quot;Gallinago gallinago&quot;), Eurasian hobby (&quot;Falco subbuteo&quot;), Eurasian woodcock (&quot;Scolopax rusticola&quot;), and yellowhammer; in spring and autumn, northern wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;), whinchat (&quot;Saxicola rubetra&quot;), common crossbill (&quot;Loxia curvirostra&quot;); and in winter, rarely, great grey shrike (&quot;Lanius exubitor&quot;).
* Scrub areas, especially on the boundary between woodland and heath/grassland: common reed bunting (&quot;Emberiza schoeniclus&quot;); in the summer, turtle dove (&quot;Streptopelia turtur&quot;); in winter, Eurasian siskin &quot;Carduelis spinus&quot; and lesser redpoll (&quot;Acanthis cabaret&quot;).
* Mixed woodlands of oak, birch and sweet chestnut, often with Scots pine: stock dove (&quot;Columba oenas&quot;), marsh tit (&quot;Parus palustris&quot;), tawny owl (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;), Eurasian bullfinch (&quot;Pyrrhula pyrrhula&quot;) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;); in the summer common firecrest (&quot;Regulus ignicapillus&quot;); common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) (occasional visitor).

====Insects====
The forest supports a rich invertebrate fauna, with many heathland specialities. Half of Britain&#x27;s 46 breeding species of damselflies and dragonflies (the Odonata) have been recorded, the scarcer among them being the black darter, brilliant emerald and small red damselfly. It is also an important home for the golden-ringed dragonfly, which flies from mid-June to early September. Of the forest&#x27;s 34 species of butterfly, the most spectacular, the purple emperor, can be hard to see. Another speciality, the silver-studded blue, is by contrast plentiful, with the main food plants of its caterpillars being gorses and heathers.

====Deer====
Deer have been a major feature of Ashdown Forest, at least since its days as a medieval hunting forest. Red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), an integral part of Wealden culture since as far back as 6,000-8,000 years ago, and fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama&quot;)—brought by the Romans from mainland Europe—, present in Sussex in the Romano-British era and particularly favoured by the Normans for hunting, were both commonly hunted in the forest until the 17th century; around that time, the red deer had disappeared completely from the forest while fallow deer numbers had sharply declined. The depletion of the woodlands (which provided deer with cover), the deterioration of the forest pale (which allowed them to escape) and the depredations of poachers were all factors in their decline.

Fallow deer returned in the 20th century, probably escapees from the Sackville estate, Buckhurst Park. The population roaming the forest has grown sharply in the last three decades, in-common with deer herds elsewhere in England, and they now number in their thousands. Also present are roe deer (&quot;Capreolus&quot; &quot;capreolus&quot;), the only native deer still roaming the forest, and two recently-introduced Asian species, the &quot;barking deer&quot;, or muntjac (&quot;Muntiacus muntjak&quot;), and the sika (&quot;Cervus nippon&quot;).

Many deer are involved in collisions with motor vehicles on local roads, especially as they move around the forest to feed at dawn and dusk, and many are killed. In 2009, forest rangers dealt with 244 deer casualties, compared with 266 the year before; however, this is likely to be a significantly low estimate, as the rangers cannot deal with all the accidents that occur. The forest conservators have identified a need to reduce the deer population and have begun working with neighbouring private landowners on measures to cull them.

==== Exmoor ponies ====
Exmoor ponies graze on the Ashdown Forest to help tackle a variety of fast-growing botanical species, and thus keep the heathland habitat balanced by preventing scrub encroachment. The Exmoor ponies are not truly domesticated; rather, they are managed by the Ashdown Forest which keeps them enclosed within large areas.

==Landscape of Ashdown Forest==

Ashdown Forest&#x27;s landscape in the early 19th century was famously described by William Cobbett: At about from Grinstead you come to a pretty village, called Forest-Row, and then, on the road to Uckfield, you cross Ashurst Forest, which is a heath, with here and there a few birch scrubs upon it, verily the most villainously ugly spot I saw in England. This lasts you for , getting, if possible, uglier and uglier all the way, till, at last, as if barren soil, nasty spewy gravel, heath and even that stunted, were not enough, you see some rising spots, which instead of trees, present you with black, ragged, hideous rocks.

The predominantly open, heathland landscape of Ashdown Forest described so vividly by Cobbett in 1822 and later immortalised by E.H. Shepard in his illustrations for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories is essentially man-made: in the absence of human intervention, heathlands such as Ashdown&#x27;s are quickly taken over by scrub and trees. Ashdown&#x27;s heathlands date back to medieval times, and quite possibly earlier. Two elements were important in shaping this landscape: the local population of commoners, who exploited the forest&#x27;s resources over many centuries; and the iron industry of the forest, which flourished in the 16th century.

The commoners played an important role in maintaining the forest as a predominantly heathland area by exercising their rights of common to exploit its resources in a variety of ways: by grazing livestock such as pigs and cattle, which suppressed the growth of trees and scrub; by cutting trees for firewood and for other uses; by cutting dead bracken, fern and heather for use as bedding for their livestock in winter; by periodically burning areas of heathland to maintain pasture; and so on. At times, the numbers of livestock being grazed on the forest was very large: at the end of the 13th century the commoners were turning out 2,000-3,000 cattle, alongside the 1,000-2,000 deer that were also present, while according to a 1293 record the forest was being grazed by more than 2,700 swine.

A second important factor was the heavy depletion of the forest&#x27;s woodlands by the local iron industry, which grew very rapidly in the late 15th and 16th centuries, following the introduction of the blast furnace in the 1490s, which led to a huge demand for charcoal. For example, large-scale tree cutting took place in the south of the forest to feed the iron works of the cannon maker Ralph Hogge. The loss of trees caused such concern for the Crown that as early as 1520 it was lamented that &quot;much of the King&#x27;s woods were cut down and coled [turned into charcoal] for the iron mills, and the forest digged for Irne [iron] by which man and beast be in jeopardy&quot;. This ravaging of the forest&#x27;s woodlands was later mitigated by the adoption of coppice management for the provision of sustainable supplies of charcoal. The impact of the industry on the forest, although significant, was however ultimately short-lived, as it died out in the 17th century.

==Conservation measures==
The open heathland landscape of Ashdown Forest described by Cobbett in the 1820s and depicted by Shepard in the 1920s changed dramatically soon after the end of World War II when the commoners&#x27; exploitation of the forest - exercising their rights of common to graze livestock, cut bracken, etc. - declined to very low levels. The result was a regeneration of woodland and the loss of heathland: the proportion of heathland in the forest fell from 90% in 1947 to 60% in 2007. The forest conservators have now committed to maintaining the proportion of heathland at 60% and to returning it to &#x27;favourable&#x27; condition. Their efforts are being funded under a ten-year &quot;Higher Level Stewardship&quot; (HLS) agreement with Natural England; signed in August 2006, it is the largest such scheme in South East England.

The conservators have taken various steps to prevent natural regeneration of woodland. Regular mowing of bracken is carried out: an area of 266 ha out of the 400 ha on the forest has been mown twice a year since 2000. Large areas of the highly invasive &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; have been cleared, initially funded by the Forestry Commission, and now carried on by local volunteers. Birch and other tree saplings are cut down in the winter.

The conservators have taken steps to promote livestock grazing on the forest as part of their heathland management policy. Grazing is considered to be a cheaper and more effective way of restoring and maintaining heathland than the use of mowing machinery. Sheep (which are a recent introduction to the forest, having only become &#x27;commonable&#x27; since 1900) are particularly useful because they graze scrub and in places that are difficult to mow. In 1996 the Secretary of State for the Environment gave permission for a fenced enclosure, representing about one-third of the forest&#x27;s 1,500 ha of heathland, to be created in the south and west chases to allow commoners to graze their livestock in safety.

The enclosure of the common lands of the forest with fencing to enable grazing was and remains somewhat controversial with some members of the public. Exploring alternatives to enclosure, the conservators undertook a close-shepherded grazing pilot project from 2007 to 2010 with funding from the HLS scheme. A flock of Hebridean sheep, ultimately 300 in number, was guided by a shepherd and an assistant to graze unenclosed areas of the forest heathland. Among the advantages of this approach were that no fencing was required and grazing could be targeted on the most overgrown areas; among the disadvantages were its high labour intensity, high costs and low impact. The conservators have now begun using temporary electric fencing, which can be moved around to isolate different parts of the heathland, to enable the flock to graze without requiring close supervision by a shepherd.

==Statutory designations==
Ashdown Forest is an area of European ecological importance. It is designated by the UK government as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protection Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and a Nature Conservation Review site. 
It lies within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. An area of 103 hectares is Old Lodge Local Nature Reserve, most of which is managed by the Sussex Wildlife Trust.

Though not a statutory designation, Ashdown Forest forms part of the &quot;Western Ouse Streams and Ashdown Forest Biodiversity Opportunity Area&quot;, and is thus a subject of the &quot;Sussex Biodiversity Action Plan&quot;, which aims to focus conservation bodies, local government and statutory agencies on work to conserve and enhance the habitats and species of Sussex.

The areas covered by the statutory designations are not identical to and are generally larger than the area of forest administered by the conservators. The SSSI covers , mainly because, in addition to the forest land covered by the conservators, it also includes the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Pippingford Park Dry Training Area, accounting for 11% () of the SSSI, Hindleap Warren, Broadstone Warren and Old Lodge, which covers . The SPA covers while the SAC covers .

==Recreation and leisure==
Ashdown Forest is the largest public access space in south east England, and the largest area of open, uncultivated countryside. A 2008 visitor survey estimated that at least 1.35 million visits are made each year. The most common reason given for visiting the forest was its &quot;openness&quot;. Most visitors (85%) coming by car travelled 10 km or less and there were 62 dogs for every 100 visitors.

Despite such large numbers of visitors, the forest has retained its celebrated tranquillity and sense of openness. The commons are freely open to the public, who are attracted by the large, elevated expanse of unspoiled heaths and woodlands where they may walk, picnic or simply sit while taking in the glorious views. Various bye-laws passed by the conservators help protect the forest environment for the public good, prohibiting such activities as, for example, mountain biking, off-road driving of motor vehicles, camping and the lighting of fires.

===Travelling to Ashdown Forest===
Most visitors come by car, and access is straightforward. The forest is crossed by a major road, the A22, which provides access from the M25 and M23 motorways. There are over 40 car parks across the forest to discourage drivers from parking their vehicles on roadsides. In January 2022 the Conservators announced the findings of a public consultation and then voted to introduce car parking charges to the forest for the first time The nearest railway station is at , which receives frequent train services from London. The railway stations at , , and are also nearby. Two bus services cross the forest, the 261 service from East Grinstead railway station to Uckfield and the 270 service from East Grinstead railway station to Haywards Heath. London Gatwick Airport is about 30 minutes away by car, and London Heathrow Airport is around 1 hour away by car.

===Visitor information===
The &quot;Ashdown Forest Centre&quot; is the main visitor centre for the forest. The forest&#x27;s principal tourism organisation is the &quot;Ashdown Forest Tourism Association&quot;.

===Recreational, sports and leisure activities===
Ashdown Forest is very popular with walkers. Two long-distance footpaths, the Vanguard Way and Wealdway cross the forest and meet near Old Lodge. The Wealdway passes through Five Hundred Acre Wood, the Hundred Acre Wood of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. The &quot;Ashdown Forest Centre&quot; produces a series of leaflets detailing walks in various parts of the forest, which may also be downloaded from its website.

There are of tracks on the forest that may be ridden by horse once an annual permit has been obtained from the conservators. The main horse-riding organisation is the &quot;Ashdown Forest Riding Association&quot;, which has around 200 members.

The forest, with its attractive landscapes, vistas and hills, is a popular destination for road cyclists, races and cyclosportives such as the &quot;Hell of the Ashdown&quot;. Former Tour de France rider Sean Yates lives at Forest Row and has taken Lance Armstrong training here. Off-road cycling and mountain biking is prohibited for environmental reasons, except along public bridleways. A local pressure group is campaigning for this ban to be lifted.

The &quot;Royal Ashdown Forest Golf Club&quot; occupies a large area of leasehold land in the northern part of the forest near Forest Row. It is a traditional members&#x27; club founded in 1888 at the instigation of Earl De La Warr, lord of the manor, who became its first president. Its two 18-hole heathland courses are notable for the absence of bunkers (at the insistence of the conservators). As elsewhere in Ashdown Forest, trees and bracken scrub have invaded following the cessation of grazing and decreased wood cutting by the commoners, and the club is working with the conservators to restore the golf courses to their original heathland character.

The principal hotel within the forest is the &quot;Ashdown Park Hotel &amp; Country Club&quot;, a listed 19th-century mansion house set in .

==Visitor attractions==
===The Ashdown Forest Centre===
The Ashdown Forest Centre, situated opposite Ashdown Park Hotel between Wych Cross and Coleman&#x27;s Hatch, houses a visitor centre and is the administrative base for the Board of Conservators of Ashdown Forest. Completed in 1983, it consists of three old reconstructed barns. The visitor centre has a permanent display about the forest&#x27;s history and wildlife, details of walks in the forest and much other useful information for visitors, and an exhibition area for local craft and art work. It is open 7 days a week during the summer, weekends in the winter, and on bank holidays except Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

===Vachery Forest Garden===
Landscaped in 1925 by Col. Gavin Jones for F.J. Nettlefold, this &#x27;lost&#x27; forest garden is situated in a remote, secluded steep-sided valley near Wych Cross. It was acquired by the conservators in 1994 and is now undergoing restoration. Already uncovered are a 250 metre gorge constructed using limestone brought from Cheddar Gorge, many unusual trees and a string of small lakes connected by sluices and weirs. The garden, which is open to the public, is part of Chelwood Vachery, a medieval estate dating back to at least 1229, and whose name may come from the French &quot;vache&quot;, referring to the grazing of cattle here by Michelham Priory. A leaflet describing a walk through Chelwood Vachery is available from the Ashdown Forest Centre. The nearest car-park is &quot;Trees&quot; on the A22 road between Wych Cross and Nutley.

===Old Lodge Nature Reserve===
Old Lodge Nature Reserve, managed by Sussex Wildlife Trust, offers open vistas of the forest&#x27;s heathland. A well-marked nature trail leads round most of the hilly 76 hectare reserve, which contains acidic ponds and areas of pine woodland. The reserve is notable for dragonfly, nightjar, redstart, woodcock, tree pipit, stonechat and adder. It has been designated a Local Nature Reserve.

===Nutley Windmill===
Nutley Windmill, which stands just north of the Nutley to Duddleswell road, is thought to be about 300 years old and is a rare example of an open-trestle post mill (the whole body of the mill can be rotated on its central post to face the wind). It has been restored to full working order and is open to the public. It is within easy walking distance of Friend&#x27;s Clump car-park.

===The Airman&#x27;s Grave===
The &#x27;Airman&#x27;s Grave&#x27; is, despite its name, not a grave but a memorial to the six man crew of a Wellington bomber of 142 Squadron who were killed when it crashed on the southern slopes of the Forest on the morning of 31 July 1941 as it returned from a raid on Cologne during World War II. The memorial, which is a simple stone-walled enclosure on the heathland between Nutley and Duddleswell, shelters a white cross surrounded by a tiny garden of remembrance. The memorial began with a wooden cross erected at the crash site by the mother of Sergeant Victor Ronald Sutton, the second pilot, who was aged 24 at the time of his death. A short public ceremony takes place each year on Remembrance Sunday when a wreath is laid by a Forest Ranger, at the request of Mrs Sutton, together with ones on behalf of the Conservators of Ashdown Forest, the Ashdown Forest Foundation, the Society of the Friends of Ashdown Forest, the Ashdown Forest Riding Association and a variety of local groups. The Ashdown Forest Centre has published a circular walk to the memorial from Hollies car park.

===Newbridge Furnace===
At the foot of Kidd&#x27;s Hill, in woods lying west of the road from Coleman&#x27;s Hatch to Gills Lap, are the largely grassed-over remains of a 15th-century ironworks that mark the beginnings of Britain&#x27;s modern iron and steel industry. A dedication placed at the site by the Wealden Iron Research Group reads: &quot;Newbridge Furnace. At the behest of King Henry VII, the first English blast furnace, for the smelting of iron, was established in this place. 13 December A.D. 1496. Here, the water from the pond, held back by the dam or bay, gave power to the bellows of the furnace to make cast iron; and to a finery where the &#x27;great water hammer&#x27; enabled immigrant French workers to forge bars of wrought iron. The works had a modest output, which cannot have exceeded 150 tons of iron a year. Early products included the ironwork of gun carriages for a military campaign in Scotland, and were soon to number guns and shot as well. From small beginnings, in this secluded corner of Sussex, grew the ironworks of the Weald, and subsequently the iron and steel industry throughout Great Britain.&quot;

===The forest pale===
Possibly as early as the 13th century, Ashdown Forest was enclosed as a hunting park, mainly for deer, by a long &quot;pale&quot;. This consisted of an earth bank 4–5 feet high surmounted by an oak paling fence with a deep ditch on the forest side that allowed deer to enter but not to leave. It enclosed an area of over 20½ square miles (5,300 hectares). Entry was via 34 gates and hatches, &quot;gates&quot; being used for access by wheeled vehicles, commoners&#x27; animals and mounted groups, &quot;hatches&quot; by pedestrians. These names survive in local place-names such as Chuck Hatch and Chelwood Gate. Some of these entrances were, and still are, marked by pubs, for example the 18th-century Hatch Inn at Coleman&#x27;s Hatch, which occupies three former cottages believed to date to 1430 that later may have housed ironworkers from the nearby blast furnace at Newbridge.

It is not known precisely when the pale was built. Forest management accounts of 1283 refer to the cost of repairing the pale and building new lengths. However, the granting of the &quot;Free-chase of Ashdon&quot; to John of Gaunt in 1372 and its renaming as &quot;Lancaster Great Park&quot; (see below) implies that the forest may only have been recently enclosed (&quot;chase&quot; denoted an open hunting ground, &quot;park&quot; an enclosed one).

The condition of the forest pale seems to have deteriorated significantly during the Tudor period. This coincided with, and may be partly linked to, the rapid growth under the Tudors of the local iron-making industry with its huge demand for raw materials in and around Ashdown Forest, such as charcoal and ironstone. This ultimately led to an appeal to King James, soon after his accession to the throne, for Ashdown&#x27;s forest fences to be repaired in order to preserve the king&#x27;s game. However, the pale seems to have fallen into almost complete disrepair by the end of the 17th century.

The bank and ditch associated with the pale are still visible in places around Ashdown Forest today, for example at Legsheath and adjacent to the car-park for Poohsticks Bridge on Chuck Hatch Lane.

A survey and research of the Pale of Ashdown Forest was undertaken as part of the Historic Environment Awareness Project, run by East Sussex County Council&#x27;s Archaeology team, over 2011/2012 and the final report was published online.

===Winnie-the-Pooh===
Ashdown Forest is famous as the setting for the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; stories, written by A. A. Milne. The first book, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, was published in 1926 with illustrations by E. H. Shepard. The second book, &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, also illustrated by Shepard, was published in 1928. These hugely popular stories were set in and inspired by Ashdown Forest.

Alan Milne, a writer who was born and lived in London, bought a country retreat for himself and his family at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield, East Sussex, in 1925. This old farmhouse was situated on the banks of a tributary of the River Medway and lay just beyond the northern boundary of Ashdown Forest, about a mile from the ancient forest entrance at Chuck Hatch. The family would stay at Cotchford Farm at weekends and in the Easter and summer holidays. It was easy to walk from the farmhouse up onto the forest, and these walks were frequently family occasions which would see Milne, his wife, Daphne, his son, Christopher Robin, and his son&#x27;s nanny, Olive, going &quot;in single file threading the narrow paths that run through the heather&quot;. Christopher, who was an only child born in 1920 and whose closest childhood relationship was with his nanny, spent his early years happily exploring the forest. It is the Ashdown Forest landscape, and Christopher&#x27;s reports of his experiences and discoveries there, that provided inspiration and material for A.A. Milne&#x27;s stories. As Christopher Milne wrote later: &quot;Anyone who has read the stories knows the forest and doesn&#x27;t need me to describe it. Pooh’s Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical&quot;.

Several of the sites described in the books can be easily identified, although their names have been changed. For example, Five Hundred Acre Wood, which is a dense beech wood that was originally sold off from the forest in 1678 and is today privately owned, and which Christopher would sometimes walk through to reach the forest, became &quot;Hundred Acre Wood&quot;. The hilltop of Gills Lap, crowned by pine trees and visible from miles around, became &quot;Galleon&#x27;s Lap&quot;. The &quot;North Pole&quot; and &quot;Gloomy Place&quot; are in Wren’s Warren Valley, a short walk north-east of Gill&#x27;s Lap, as is &quot;The Dark and Mysterious Forest&quot;.

Furthermore, the landscapes depicted in Shepard’s illustrations for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories, which are very evocative of Ashdown Forest, can in many cases be matched up to actual views, allowing for a degree of artistic licence. Shepard&#x27;s sketches of pine trees and other forest scenes are now exhibited at the V&amp;A Museum in London.

A free leaflet, “Pooh Walks from Gill&#x27;s Lap”, which is available from the Ashdown Forest Centre and downloadable from its website, describes a walk that takes in many locations familiar from the Pooh stories including &quot;Galleon&#x27;s Lap&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted Place&quot;, the &quot;Heffalump Trap&quot; and Lone Pine, &quot;North Pole&quot;, &quot;100 Aker Wood&quot; and Eeyore’s &quot;Sad and Gloomy Place&quot;.

A memorial plaque to Milne and Shepard can be found at Gill&#x27;s Lap. Its heading is a quotation from the Pooh stories: &quot;...and by and by they came to an enchanted place on the very top of the forest called Galleons Lap&quot;. The dedication reads: &quot;Here at Gill&#x27;s Lap are commemorated A. A. Milne 1882-1956 and E.H. Shepard 1879-1976 who collaborated in the creation of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and so captured the magic of Ashdown Forest and gave it to the world&quot;.

Poohsticks Bridge, which is open to the public, lies outside the forest on the northern edge of Posingford Wood, near Chuck Hatch. A path leads to the bridge from a car-park on Chuck Hatch Lane, just off the B2026 Maresfield to Hartfield road. The original bridge was built in 1907, restored in 1979 and completely rebuilt in 1999. So popular is the game of Poohsticks that the surrounding area has been denuded of twigs and small branches by the many visitors.

&quot;Pooh Corner&quot;, situated on the High Street in Hartfield village, sells Winnie-the-Pooh related products and offers information for visitors.
==History==

===Brief history===

Ashdown Forest came into existence as a Norman deer hunting forest in the period following the Norman Conquest of 1066.

At the highest points of the Ashdown Forest are the remains of several Barrow Mounds dated by the University of Sussex to the late Iron Age. At the nearby Pippingford Army Training Area there is a large hilltop settlement mound that is a Class A Listed Protection Ancient Monument site. The site includes Iron Age stock and hunting enclosures with recent finds of leaf-cut flint arrow heads dated to the middle Bronze Age period now on display in the East Grinstead Museum. (2013). The Hilltop hunting settlement is thought to have been constructed by the local Wealden Chieftain named Crugh who was gifted lands by his High Wealden Chieftain Uncle who lived at Marks Cross in East Sussex.

Prior to the conquest, Ashdown seems simply to have been an unnamed part of the vast, sparsely populated, and in places dense and impenetrable woodland known to the Anglo-Saxons as &quot;Andredes weald&quot; (&quot;the forest of Andred&quot;), from which the present-day Weald derives its name. The Weald, of which Ashdown Forest is the largest remaining part, stretched for between the chalk escarpments of the North and South Downs and for over from east to west from Kent into Hampshire.

Ashdown Forest is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 but, as part of the forest of Pevensel, the sub-division of the Weald that the Normans created within the Rape of Pevensey, it had already been granted by William the Conqueror to his half-brother Robert, Count of Mortain. This rape was strategically and economically important, extending as it did inland northwards from the English Channel coast towards London, and was guarded, as was the case with the other six Sussex rapes, by a castle. It was awarded to Robert, along with several hundred manors across England, in recognition of his support for William during the Norman conquest of England. Two important conditions applied to a forest like Pevensel: the king could keep and hunt deer there, while the commoners – tenant farmers who had smallholdings near the forest – could continue to graze their livestock there and cut wood for fuel and bracken for livestock bedding.

1095 – death of Robert de Mortain. Ashdown is then held by the lords of Pevensey Castle – a succession of high status members of the Norman and Plantagenet aristocracy, including several queens of England – for most of the next 200 years.

1100–1130 – Ashdown Forest is first referred to by name when Henry I confirms that monks can continue to use a road across the forest of &quot;Essendone&quot;. The monks&#x27; claim that they have held the right since the Conquest implies the area was known by this name at least as far back as then.

1268 – in the reign of Henry III, Ashdown Forest is vested in the Crown in perpetuity. The forest was subsequently used for deer hunting by Edward II, who built a hunting lodge near Nutley that was later to be used by John of Gaunt.

1282 – first documentary references to the forest pales appear in accounts prepared by a ranger recording the costs of timber that have been cut;

1372 – Edward III grants the &quot;Free-chase of Ashdon&quot; to his third son, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. It becomes known as Lancaster Great Park. The park then reverts to the Crown along with the rest of the Duchy of Lancaster after John of Gaunt&#x27;s death in 1399. But for the next 300 years, until 1672, the forest is still referred to as &quot;Lancaster Great Park&quot;.

1662 – Lancaster Great Park is &quot;disafforested&quot; by Charles II, giving free rein to the Earl of Bristol to make &#x27;improvements&#x27;.

1693 – Ashdown Forest (the former Lancaster Great Park) is divided up, and it assumes its present-day shape. Just over half of it – in portions of widely varying sizes, but with the largest ones tending to be located towards the centre of the forest – is allotted for &#x27;inclosure and improvement&#x27; by private interests. The rest is retained as common land for use by those local landowners and tenants who possess rights of common.

1881 – the commoners of Ashdown Forest reach a successful conclusion to their defence of a lawsuit brought by the Lord of the Manor which contested the nature and extent of their rights of common on the forest (known as the &quot;Great Ashdown Forest Case&quot;).

1885 – the Commons Regulation (Ashdown Forest) Provisional Order Confirmation Act 1885 introduces bye-laws to regulate and protect the forest, and a Board of Conservators is established.

1984 – a significant part of the forest was set a blaze by a local school boy, Anthony Martin. Eight fire engines were called to the scene and the fire was controlled.

1988 – the freehold of the forest is acquired by East Sussex County Council from the executors of the Lord of the Manor, forestalling the possibility that the remaining common land of the forest would be broken up and sold off into private hands.

===The 1693 division of Ashdown Forest===
During the 17th century, under both the Stuart monarchy and during the Interregnum, there were repeated proposals to &quot;inclose&quot; (enclose) and develop the forest. Under James I and Charles I parcels of land were sold off piecemeal. During the Interregnum the condition of the forest deteriorated so much that by the time of the Restoration, in 1660, it was in a state where &quot;the whole forest [is] laid open and made waste&quot;. Attempts to enclose and improve the forest (for example, by introducing rabbit farming, or sowing crops) were however strongly opposed throughout by the local commoners, who claimed rights of common on the forest, having exercised them &quot;from time out of mind&quot;, as well as by neighbouring estates who claimed right of pasture there.

In 1662 the forest was granted to one of Charles II&#x27;s closest allies, George Digby, Earl of Bristol, and it was formally disafforested to allow Bristol a free hand to improve it. His attempts to do so were however frustrated &quot;by the crossness of the neighbourhood&quot;; the fences he erected were thrown down and the crops he sowed were trampled by cattle. He defaulted on his rental payments to the Crown and left. Subsequent Lords of the Manor suffered similar opposition from the commoners. Compromise proposals were made to divide up the forest that would leave sufficient common land to meet the needs of commoners, while giving the rest up for improvement.

These unresolved tensions came to a head when, in 1689, a major landowner and &#x27;Master of the Forest&#x27;, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, brought a legal suit against 133 commoners in the court of the Duchy of Lancaster. The court decided to appoint commissioners to divide up Ashdown Forest&#x27;s in a way that would meet the needs of both defendants and plaintiffs. The commissioners made their award on 9 July 1693. They set aside , mostly in the vicinity of farms and villages, as common land, where the commoners were granted sole right of pasturage and the right to cut birch, alder and willow (but no other trees). The commoners were however excluded forever from the rest of the forest, about 55 per cent of its area, which was assigned for &quot;inclosure and improvement&quot; (though substantial areas had already been enclosed by then, so in such cases the decree was merely confirming the status quo).

The land award of 1693 is largely responsible for shaping the map of Ashdown Forest today. The common land is highly fragmented and irregular in shape, broken up by many private enclosures, large and small. It tends to lie on the periphery of the forest near existing settlements. Some of the largest enclosures, such as Hindleap Warren, Prestridge Warren, Broadstone Warren and Crowborough Warren, mostly lying towards the centre of the forest, were used for a time for intensive rabbit farming. Some of these enclosures have today acquired interesting uses: Pippingford Park, in the very centre of the forest, occupied by the army in 1939 as a defence against Operation Sea Lion, remains an important military training area, Broadstone Warren is a scout camp and activity centre, while Hindleap Warren is an outdoor education centre.

Although the 1693 land award envisaged enclosure and improvement for profitable gain, the land it allotted to private exploitation has in fact largely remained uncultivated; this has helped Ashdown Forest to retain the appearance of being an extensive area of wild country that is so valued today. That said, there is nevertheless a visible contrast between the areas of common land, maintained by the conservators, which are predominantly heathland, and the extensive privately held lands, which are generally either quite heavily wooded or cleared for pasture.

===The Great Ashdown Forest Case===
In 1876-82 a renewed challenge to commoners&#x27; rights became known as the &quot;Great Ashdown Forest Case&quot;, one of the most famous legal disputes of Victorian England.

On 13 October 1877 John Miles was seen on the forest cutting &quot;litter&quot; (heather and bracken for livestock bedding and other uses) on behalf of Bernard Hale, his employer and the owner of a local estate, by a keeper, George Edwards. Edwards was a well-known and unpopular local man who was acting as the representative of the Lord of the Manor of Duddleswell, Reginald Sackville, 7th Earl De La Warr, who owned the land on which the forest stood. In a test case, the Earl challenged the right of Hale to cut litter. Hale, who claimed ownership of his estate made him a commoner of the forest, argued that he was entitled to send his men onto the forest to cut and remove bracken, fern, heather and other plants. The Earl maintained that the commoners&#x27; rights of pasturage and herbage granted under the 1693 decree only entitled them to graze their animals on the commons. At the end of a protracted and complicated legal case, the court ruled against the commoners, who included some of the wealthiest landowners in Sussex. They appealed, and their appeal was upheld in 1881, but only on one ground, that it had been a long-standing practice for commoners to cut and take away litter from the forest, and they were therefore entitled to continue to do so under the Prescription Act 1832.

Resolution of the case in favour of the commoners led directly to today&#x27;s framework of forest governance, with the passing of the first Ashdown Forest Act in 1885 and the establishment of a board of conservators for the forest.

===Formation of the Board of Conservators===


Following the conclusion of the Ashdown Forest case, a board of conservators was established by act of Parliament in 1885 to oversee the forest bye-laws, including the protection of commoner&#x27;s rights. More acts of Parliament followed, which further refined the governance of the forest, culminating in the Ashdown Forest Act 1974.

===Sale of the forest into public ownership===
In the 1980s the Lord of the Manor, William Sackville, 10th Earl De La Warr, offered Ashdown Forest for sale direct to the local authority, East Sussex County Council, if they would buy it; otherwise he would probably sell the forest piecemeal on the open market. On 25 November 1988 this threat to split up the forest was averted when, with the benefit of donations from many sources, including the proceeds of a public appeal, East Sussex County Council purchased the freehold of Ashdown Forest from the executors of the Earl, who had died the previous February. The freehold was then vested by the council in a newly created charitable trust, the Ashdown Forest Trust.

==The iron industry of Ashdown Forest==
Ashdown Forest&#x27;s iron industry flourished in the two eras when the Weald was the main iron-producing region of Britain, namely in the first 200 years of the Roman period (1st to 3rd centuries AD) and in the Tudor period (late 15th and 16th centuries). Ashdown was favoured by the widespread presence of iron-ore, extensive woodlands for the production of charcoal, and deep, steep-sided valleys (locally known as &quot;ghylls&quot;) that could be dammed to provide water power for furnaces and forges.

The forest is the site of Britain&#x27;s first confirmed blast furnace, at Newbridge, which began operation in 1496. Henry VII commissioned it for the production of heavy metalwork for gun carriages for his war against the Scots. Immigrants from Northern France brought with them the technology for a furnace that they would operate.

Spurred by the development of blast furnaces, the iron industry grew very rapidly during the 16th century and would become noted for the casting of cannons and cannonballs for the English navy. The celebrated ironmaster and gunfounder Ralph Hogge, who in 1543 made the first one-piece, cast-iron cannon in England at nearby Buxted, drew his raw materials from the southern part of the forest. However, the huge demand for raw materials and fuel, particularly charcoal, heavily depleted Ashdown Forest&#x27;s woodlands, causing much concern and prompting commissions of enquiry by the king. In due course coppice management was used to ensure a more sustainable supply.

In the 17th century the industry would die out as a result of competition from lower-cost iron-producing areas.

==Archaeology==

Ashdown Forest is rich in archaeology: there are more than 570 archaeological sites, including Bronze Age round barrows, Iron Age enclosures, prehistoric field systems, Roman iron workings, the medieval pale, medieval and post-medieval pillow mounds for the rearing of rabbits, and remains of late 18th-century military kitchen mounds that are among the only surviving ones in the United Kingdom.

The earliest known trace of human activity in Ashdown Forest is a stone hand axe found near Gills Lap, which is thought to be about 50,000 years old. The vast majority of finds date from the Mesolithic (10,000-4,000 BC) and onwards into the modern era.

The London to Lewes Way, one of three Roman roads that connected London with the important Wealden iron industry, crosses Ashdown Forest in a north–south direction, and would have been used to transport iron products from the forest to London and the coast. The agger of the road, whose foundations include iron slag, can be seen at Roman Road car park.

==Ownership and administration==
The freehold of Ashdown Forest, which essentially consists of the common land set aside in 1693, when the ancient forest was divided up by decree of the Duchy of Lancaster, plus a number of later land acquisitions, is owned by the Ashdown Forest Trust, a registered charity controlled and managed by East Sussex County Council. Ownership was vested in the trust after the council bought the freehold from the executors of the Lord of the Manor, the 10th Earl De La Warr, in November 1988. This purchase was the culmination of a high-profile and passionate fund-raising campaign by members of the public, which included a £175,000 endorsement by Christopher Robin Milne (by then living and working in Devon), who were concerned that the earl&#x27;s stated intention, in the absence of a purchase of the forest by the county council, was to sell it piecemeal into private hands, a possibility which seemed to become more likely when the earl died before the contract could be completed. Fortunately, the county council was able to complete the purchase from the executors, the council matching the amount raised by the public campaign to enable the asking price of over £1 million to be met.

The forest is regulated and protected by an independent Board of Conservators established under the Ashdown Forest Act 1885. The creation of the board followed the resolution of the protracted 19th-century dispute between the commoners and the 7th Earl De La Warr over rights of common on the forest. The structure of the board, originally composed entirely of commoners, altered significantly during the 20th century. Currently, of its sixteen members, nine are appointed by East Sussex County Council (one of whom represents the lord of the manor, the Ashdown Forest Trust), two by Wealden District Council, and the remaining five are elected by the commoners, of whom four must be commoners. The day-to-day management of the forest is the responsibility of a director, Mrs Pat Buesnel, the clerk to the conservators, Mrs Ros Marriott, and a number of supporting staff, including a team of forest rangers.

The conservators are required to act in accordance with a number of acts of Parliament pertaining to the forest, of which the latest, the Ashdown Forest Act 1974, states (section 16):

A number of byelaws have been passed by the conservators under the 1974 act to protect the forest and to preserve its perceived special character, particularly its tranquillity. These include prohibitions on off-roading driving, mountain-biking, horse-riding (except by permit), camping, the lighting of fires, digging and the dumping of rubbish.

Finding adequate funding for the regulation and conservation of the forest has been a persistent issue. The income of the conservators in 2009-10 was £751,000, of which almost half was accounted for by funding from the government&#x27;s Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) scheme, which requires the conservators to achieve certain objectives, such as restoring the heathlands to &quot;favourable condition&quot;. Grants from the local authorities and the Ashdown Forest Trust accounted for another fifth. In 2009-10 there was a small surplus of income over expenditure (57% of which was staff costs). Cuts in local government expenditure and the ending of the current programme of HLS funding in 2016 present major challenges.

Large numbers of volunteers support the work of the conservators by undertaking conservation work in the forest. Many of these are recruited by the &quot;Friends of the Ashdown Forest&quot;, which has almost 1000 members. Fundraising by the Friends has helped towards the purchase of capital equipment for forest management such as motor vehicles and enabled the conservators to buy back parcels of land within the ancient pale for re-incorporation into the forest.

In 1994 the Board of Conservators, with the help of funding from East Sussex County Council, purchased of woodland at Chelwood Vachery (an estate that dates back to at least 1229), including an early 20th-century garden and lake system, after the estate was divided up and offered for sale by its owner. The land is now undergoing restoration as a forest garden and is open to the public.

==Ashdown Forest&#x27;s common land and its commoners==

The common land of Ashdown Forest, amounting to some , consists of specific areas of the forest, registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965, which only those who possess particular rights of common - commoners - are entitled to use and exploit in certain specified ways. These common rights are attached to certain landholdings around the forest, not to individual people, and are passed on when properties are sold or inherited. Since 1885 the common land has been regulated and protected by a statutory Board of Conservators.

Contrary to widespread belief, a &#x27;common&#x27; in England is not &#x27;public land&#x27;. However, in the case of Ashdown Forest, the conservators have given the public open access to the common land, subject to compliance with bye-laws that largely aim to preserve the special character of the forest.

A right of common may be defined as:

...a right, which one or more persons may have, to take or use some portion of that which another man&#x27;s soil naturally produces...
On Ashdown Forest the rights of common have varied over time. Those that remain today, which are subject to local byelaws and are under the control of the conservators, are:

*&quot;pasturage&quot; (or grazing rights): the right to graze sheep, cattle, goats, geese or mill horses (horses that provide power for the mill) on the forest.
*&quot;estovers&quot;: today, understood to be the right to cut birch, willow or alder for use in the &quot;ancestral hearth&quot;, which may only be exercised at certain times and in certain areas designated by the conservators.
*brakes and &quot;litter&quot;: the right to cut brake (bracken) and heather and to collect litter for the principal purpose of bedding down livestock in winter on the land-holding.

Today, to a varying degree, every property possessing common rights has some or all of these rights over the registered common land of the forest.

To become a commoner a person must acquire &quot;commonable&quot; land; conversely, a person selling a commonable property ceases to be a commoner. Where a commonable property is sold off in smaller portions, the commonable rights are apportioned in accordance with the area of each portion. All commoners are obliged to pay a &quot;Forest Rate&quot; (based on the area of commonable land held) to contribute towards the administration of the forest by the Board of Conservators, and they are entitled to elect five commoners&#x27; representatives to the Board.

A sharp decline in commoning after the end of World War II resulted in a rapid loss of the forest&#x27;s open heathland to scrub and trees, threatening the many specialised and rare plants and animals that depend on the heathland and jeopardising the forest&#x27;s famous open landscape with its magnificent vistas, so well captured in EH Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; illustrations. The Board of Conservators has responded by moving beyond its original administrative and regulatory functions to play a more active, interventionist role in combating the invasion of scrub and trees with the aim of restoring the heathland to a favourable condition.

==Notable people==
* A. A. Milne, author of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories, lived at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield, having bought the old farmhouse, situated about a mile from the ancient forest entrance at Chuck Hatch, in 1925.
* Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also lived at Cotchford Farm, and died there in 1969.
* Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, lived at Crowborough, on the eastern edge of the forest. Locations around the forest found their way into his stories.
* Richard Jefferies, nature writer, lived at Crowborough for a period while he wrote some of his most famous essays.
* Harold Macmillan, former British Prime Minister, lived at Birch Grove, near Chelwood Gate; the Macmillan Clump of trees is named in his honour.
* Major Edward Dudley Metcalfe, best friend and equerry of Edward VIII, lived in a grey stone house in the forest.
* The Irish poet W. B. Yeats, and his wife Georgie Yeats spent their honeymoon at the forest, during October – November 1917, at the Ashdown Forest Hotel, Forest Row, East Sussex, which was renamed and is now called Royal Ashdown Forest Golf Club. During the course of their honeymoon, the couple experimented with automatic writing, a joint experience that greatly influenced the poetry of Yeats and led to the publication of his philosophical–esoterical book &quot;A Vision&quot;.

<text>A motor neuron (or motoneuron or efferent neuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.

A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Individual twitches can become indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.

Although the word &quot;motor neuron&quot; suggests that there is a single kind of neuron that controls movement, this is not the case. Indeed, upper and lower motor neurons—which differ greatly in their origins, synapse locations, routes, neurotransmitters, and lesion characteristics—are included in the same classification as &quot;motor neurons.&quot; Essentially, motor neurons, also known as motoneurons, are made up of a variety of intricate, finely tuned circuits found throughout the body that innervate effector muscles and glands to enable both voluntary and involuntary motions. Two motor neurons come together to form a two-neuron circuit. While lower motor neurons start in the spinal cord and go to innervate muscles and glands all throughout the body, upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex and travel to the brain stem or spinal cord. It is essential to comprehend the distinctions between upper and lower motor neurons as well as the routes they follow in order to effectively detect these neuronal injuries and localise the lesions. 

== Development ==
Motor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. In the neural tube cells are specified to either the rostral-caudal axis or ventral-dorsal axis. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain (pMN). Transcription factors here include Pax6, OLIG2, Nkx-6.1, and Nkx-6.2, which are regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh). The OLIG2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression, a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development.

Further specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors. There are 13 Hox transcription factors and along with the signals, determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character. In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns. 
== Anatomy and physiology ==

=== Upper motor neurons ===

Upper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are giant pyramidal cells. The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract. Corticomotorneurons project from the primary cortex directly onto motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. They are unique to primates and it has been suggested that their function is the adaptive control of the hands including the relatively independent control of individual fingers. Corticomotorneurons have so far only been found in the primary motor cortex and not in secondary motor areas.

=== Nerve tracts ===

Nerve tracts are bundles of axons as white matter, that carry action potentials to their effectors. In the spinal cord these descending tracts carry impulses from different regions. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. There are seven major descending motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord:
* Lateral corticospinal tract
* Rubrospinal tract
* Lateral reticulospinal tract
* Vestibulospinal tract
* Medial reticulospinal tract
* Tectospinal tract
* Anterior corticospinal tract

=== Lower motor neurons ===

Lower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories.

According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:
* Somatic motor neurons
* Special visceral motor neurons
* General visceral motor neurons

==== Somatic motor neurons ====
Somatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the &quot;alpha efferent neurons&quot;, &quot;beta efferent neurons&quot;, and &quot;gamma efferent neurons&quot;. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.
* Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called &quot;ventral horn cells&quot;. A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. Motor units are split up into 3 categories:
**Slow (S) motor units stimulate small muscle fibers, which contract very slowly and provide small amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue, so they are used to sustain muscular contraction, such as keeping the body upright. They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen. They are also called red fibers.
**Fast fatiguing (FF) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups, which apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly. They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts of energy, such as jumping or running. They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence do not require oxygen. They are called white fibers.
**Fast fatigue-resistant motor units stimulate moderate-sized muscles groups that do not react as fast as the FF motor units, but can be sustained much longer (as implied by the name) and provide more force than S motor units. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy.
In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. This process is also called the stretch reflex.
* Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles, with collaterals to extrafusal fibres. There are two types of beta motor neurons: Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers. Fast Contracting- These innervate intrafusal fibers.
*Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. There are two types of gamma motor neurons: Dynamic- These focus on Bag1 fibers and enhance dynamic sensitivity. Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity.
* Regulatory factors of lower motor neurons 
**&quot;Size Principle&quot; – this relates to the soma of the motor neuron. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. By reducing unnecessary muscle fiber recruitment, the body is able to optimize energy consumption.
** &quot;Persistent Inward Current (PIC)&quot; – recent animal study research has shown that constant flow of ions such as calcium and sodium through channels in the soma and dendrites influence the synaptic input. An alternate way to think of this is that the post-synaptic neuron is being primed before receiving an impulse. 
** &quot;After Hyper-polarization (AHP)&quot; – A trend has been identified that shows slow motor neurons to have more intense AHPs for a longer duration. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate.

==== Special visceral motor neurons ====
These are also known as &quot;branchial motor neurons&quot;, which are involved in facial expression, mastication, phonation, and swallowing. Associated cranial nerves are the oculomotor, abducens, trochlear, and hypoglossal nerves.
==== General visceral motor neurons ====
These motor neurons indirectly innervate cardiac muscle and smooth muscles of the viscera ( the muscles of the arteries): they synapse onto neurons located in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic), located in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which themselves directly innervate visceral muscles (and also some gland cells).

In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is &quot;monosynaptic&quot; involving only one motor neuron, either &quot;somatic&quot; or &quot;branchial&quot;, which synapses onto the muscle. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is &quot;disynaptic&quot; involving two neurons: the &quot;general visceral motor neuron&quot;, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle.

All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic, whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. (see Table)

=== Neuromuscular junctions ===
A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. As a result, if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed, the twitches can superimpose on one another, either through summation or a tetanic contraction. In summation, the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch. The twitches thus superimpose on one another, leading to a force greater than that of a single twitch. A tetanic contraction is caused by constant, very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.

The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles bound to the plasma membrane of the axon terminals. The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate. Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound, an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell. The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential. T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is this chemical release that causes the target muscle fiber to contract.

In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile. Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself. This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles (by decreasing their electrophysiological activity) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions, rather than on the muscles themselves.

=== Synaptic input to motor neurons ===
Motor neurons receive synaptic input from premotor neurons. Premotor neurons can be 1) spinal interneurons that have cell bodies in the spinal cord, 2) sensory neurons that convey information from the periphery and synapse directly onto motoneurons, 3) descending neurons that convey information from the brain and brainstem. The synapses can be excitatory, inhibitory, electrical, or neuromodulatory. For any given motor neuron, determining the relative contribution of different input sources is difficult, but advances in connectomics have made it possible for fruit fly motor neurons. In the fly, motor neurons controlling the legs and wings are found in the ventral nerve cord, homologous to the spinal cord. Fly motor neurons vary by over 100X in the total number of input synapses. However, each motor neuron gets similar fractions of its synapses from each premotor source: ~70% from neurons within the VNC, ~10% from descending neurons, ~3% from sensory neurons, and ~6% from VNC neurons that also send a process up to the brain. The remaining 10% of synapses come from neuronal fragments that are unidentified by current image segmentation algorithms and require additional manual segmentation to measure.

<text>Kim Dae-jung (, ; 6 January 192418 August 2009) was a South Korean politician, activist and statesman who served as the eighth president of South Korea from 1998 to 2003.

Kim entered politics as a member of the new wing of the Democratic Party. He was an opposition politician who carried out a democratization movement against the military dictatorship from the Third Republic in the 1960s to the Fifth Republic in the 1980s. He ran unsuccessfully in presidential elections in 1971, 1987, and 1992. In the country&#x27;s 15th presidential election in 1997, he defeated Grand National Party candidate Lee Hoi-chang through an alliance with Kim Jong-pil and DJP. Kim was the first opposition candidate to win the presidency. At the time of his inauguration in 1998, he was 74 years old, making him the oldest president in Korean history.

He promoted the Sunshine Policy, a policy of détente toward North Korea, and held the first-ever inter-Korean summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in June 2000. He was a 2000 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea and Japan in December 2000. He was the first South Korean to be awarded a Nobel Prize, the second being awarded to Han Kang in 2024 for Literature. He was sometimes referred to as &quot;the Nelson Mandela of Asia&quot;. After completing his term in 2003, he died at the age of 85 on 18 August 2009, due to multiple organ failure and respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia.

==Early life==

Kim Dae-Jung was born on 6 January 1924, but he later edited his birth date to 3 December 1925, to avoid conscription under Japanese colonial rule. Kim was the second of seven children. His father, Kim Un-sik, was a farmer. Kim was a 12th generation descendant of Kim Ik-soo (김익수;金益壽) who served as Second Minister of the Board of War (병조참판;兵曹參判) and the civil minister (문신;文臣) who was involved in the construction of Gwansanggam during Joseon period. Ik-soo is the grandson of Kim Young-jeong (김영정;金永貞) of Gimhae Kim clan, this makes him a distant relative of Kim Jong-pil. Kim was born on the island of Hauido, Sinan County, Zenranan-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan (now South Jeolla Province, South Korea). Kim&#x27;s family had moved to the nearby port city of Mokpo so that he could finish high school. He had to change his name to Toyota Taichū (豊田大中) because of the passing of the sōshi-kaimei ordinance.

Kim graduated from Mokpo Commercial Middle School in 1944, and worked as a clerk at a Japanese-managed shipping company. In 1945, Kim married his first wife Cha Yong-ae, going on to have two sons. After the Japanese defeat in World War II and the liberation of Korea, he was elected as the chairman of the company&#x27;s management committee. In 1946, as newly liberated Korea debated how to govern themselves for the first time in 40 years, he joined a nationalist organization with both pro-Communist and anti-Communist members but left after disagreements with the pro-communists. However, this left him open to red-baiting from his political opponents in his future political career. In 1947, he bought a ship and started his own shipping company and in 1948, Kim became the publisher of a Mokpo daily newspaper. As the Korean War started in June 1950, Kim was on a business trip in Seoul. As he returned to Mokpo on foot, he was captured by North Korean communists and was sentenced to be shot, though he managed to escape.

==Early political career==

Kim disposed his business, and entered politics in earnest from Mokpo in 1954 during the administration of Korea&#x27;s first president, Syngman Rhee. From 1954 to 1960, he was defeated four times in elections. In 1956, he became the official party spokesman for the opposition Democratic Party led by former prime minister Chang Myon. Cha Yong-ae, Kim&#x27;s wife, died unexpectedly in 1959, and Kim subsequently converted to Catholicism.

Although he was elected as a representative in a by-election for the National Assembly on 14 May 1961, Park Chung Hee seized power two days later in the May 16 coup, and later assumed dictatorial powers, voiding the elections. He was briefly arrested, before having his rights restored.

In 1962, Kim married Lee Hee-ho, a Christian activist, and had another son.

He was able to win a seat in the House in the subsequent elections in 1963 and 1967 and went on to become an eminent opposition leader.

===1971 presidential campaign===
After completing a master&#x27;s course in economics at Kyung Hee University in 1970, he ran as opposition candidate for the country&#x27;s presidential election in 1971, against President Park Chung Hee. President Park had removed term limits and was seeking to run for a third term. A very talented orator, Kim could command unwavering loyalty among his supporters. Kim won the nomination of the opposition party over Kim Young-sam, another pro-democracy politician.

Kim promised a welfare-oriented &quot;mass economy&quot; and also advocated easing tensions with North Korea, while predicting correctly that if Park was reelected, he would become a &quot;generalissimo&quot;.

His staunchest support came from his home region of Jeolla, where he reliably garnered upwards of 95% of the popular vote, a record that has remained unsurpassed in South Korean politics. He performed strongly, achieving a strong showing of 45% of the vote against Park despite handicaps on his candidacy that were imposed by the ruling regime. With this strong showing, Park saw Kim as a threat to his rule.

===1971 assassination attempt===
One month later after the presidential election, while Kim was campaigning for legislative elections, a truck turned directly into the path of his car and seriously injured him and his two aides. Suffering a hip joint injury he was left with a permanent limp. It has been suspected that the collision was an assassination attempt by Park&#x27;s regime. Shortly after, he left for Japan and began an exile movement as President Park launched a self-coup and introduced the dictatorial Yushin Constitution of 1972.

===1973 kidnapping by KCIA===

Kim was almost killed in August 1973, when he was kidnapped from a hotel in Tokyo by KCIA agents in response to his criticism of President Park&#x27;s &quot;yushin&quot; program, which granted near-dictatorial powers. Years later, Kim reflected on these events during his 2000 Nobel Peace Prize lecture:

Philip Habib, the US ambassador in Seoul, had interceded for him with the South Korean government; the &quot;airplane&quot; referred to was a patrol plane from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force which was tracking the kidnappers.
Kim was returned to South Korea, then put under house arrest and banned from politics. He was imprisoned in 1976 for having participated in the proclamation of an anti-government manifesto and sentenced for five years in prison, which was reduced to house arrest in December 1978. During this period, he was designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.

In October 2007, the National Intelligence Service, successor to the KCIA, admitted that the KCIA carried out the plot. The NIS expressed its regret and had planned to kill and dump Kim into the sea. While the NIS panel said President Park &quot;at least gave a passive approval&quot;, the panel added it could not prove Park directly ordered the kidnapping at the time.

===Death sentence and exile===
Kim had his political rights briefly restored in December 1979 by acting President Choi Kyu-hah after Park was assassinated, shortly before the Coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth by Major General Chun Doo-hwan.

In the wake of the coup, Chun&#x27;s regime began a new wave of repression, falsely accusing Kim of instigating the May 1980 popular uprising in Gwangju, his political stronghold, and arrested him on charges of sedition and conspiracy. He was sentenced to death in September 1980.
Pope John Paul II sent a letter to then-South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan on 11 December 1980, asking for clemency for Kim, a Catholic. American intelligence understood that Chun wanted Kim&#x27;s execution to take place during the U.S. presidential transition between the outgoing president Jimmy Carter and president-elect Ronald Reagan. The outgoing Carter Administration, which had poor relations with the South Korean government, asked Reagan&#x27;s incoming National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen to intervene. Allen, not wanting the Reagan Administration to be blamed for the execution, told Chun that Reagan was opposed to Kim&#x27;s execution. Allen asked for Kim&#x27;s sentence to be commuted, and Chun, who was eager to seek American acceptance of his rule following the 1980 coup, accepted in exchange for an invitation to be one of the first foreign leaders to visit the new Reagan Administration at the White House in February 1981. Kim&#x27;s sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison.

In December 1982, he was given exile in the U.S. and temporarily settled in Boston and taught at Harvard University as a visiting professor to the Center for International Affairs. During his period abroad, he authored a number of opinion pieces in leading western newspapers that were sharply critical of the South Korean government. On 30 March 1983, Kim presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the institution.

===Return to South Korea===
Two years later, in February 1985, he returned to his homeland, accompanied by thirty-seven supporters, including Patricia M. Derian, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, two congressmen, and a number of other prominent Americans. Upon arrival in Seoul, many of his traveling companions were roughed up by the KCIA, while Kim and his wife, Lee Hee-ho were immediately put under house arrest.

Following the ruling government&#x27;s drubbing in the 1985 South Korean legislative election, Chun lifted the ban on fourteen opposition politicians, but not for Kim Dae-jung.

===Release, amnesty and 1987 presidential campaign===

During the June Struggle of 1987 against Chun Doo-hwan, Chun succumbed to popular demand, releasing Kim Dae-jung and also allowing the country&#x27;s first free presidential election. The June 29 Declaration by ex-General Roh Tae-woo, Chun Doo-hwan&#x27;s handpicked successor, saw Kim given an amnesty and his political rights restored.

Kim and the other leading opposition figure, Kim Young-sam, initially promised to unite behind one candidate. However, disagreements between the two men over who was in a better position to win made Kim Dae-Jung split from the main opposition party, the Reunification Democratic Party, and formed the Peace Democratic Party to run for the presidency. As a result, the opposition vote was split, and Roh won with only 36.6% of the popular vote. Kim Young-sam received 28% and Kim Dae-jung 27% of the votes.

In July 2019, according to American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) documents obtained by Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; through a freedom of information request, the military-backed ruling forces drew up detailed plans to fix the election result in case Roh lost. The documents suggested that the government was prepared to crack down hard on any unrest following the vote, with an Intel briefing stating that an &quot;open arrest order&quot; had been prepared for Kim Dae-jung if he tried to &quot;instigate a popular revolt against the election results&quot;. As Roh won the election, the plans were not implemented.

Kim was subsequently elected to the National Assembly in 1988 and 1992.

===Hunger strike===
In October 1990, Kim embarked on a hunger strike which lasted 13 days, demanding that the Roh Tae-woo government abandon efforts to amend the Constitution for a parliamentary system of government, and to implement local self-government. He was successful, when Roh decided to accede to Kim&#x27;s demands.

===1992 presidential campaign and hiatus===

In 1992, Kim made yet another failed bid for the presidency, this time solely against Kim Young-sam, who had merged the RDP with the ruling Democratic Justice Party to form the Democratic Liberal Party in 1990, which eventually became the Grand National Party. Kim then announced his retirement from politics.

Kim then departed for the United Kingdom to take a position at Clare Hall, Cambridge, as a visiting scholar.

==Return to politics and 1997 election victory==
However, in 1995, he announced his return to politics. Despite losing his comeback bid for a list seat in the 1996 National Assembly elections, he began his fourth quest for the presidency for the 1997 election.

Initially trailing heavily in the polls and seen by some as a perennial candidate, his situation became favorable when the public revolted against the incumbent conservative Kim Young-sam government in the wake of the nation&#x27;s economic collapse in the Asian financial crisis just weeks before the election.

Forming an alliance with Kim Jong-pil who was previously prime minister under Park Chung Hee, he defeated Lee Hoi-chang, Kim Young-sam&#x27;s designated successor, in the election held on 18 December 1997. His election victory at that time was the closest ever, where a split in the ruling conservative party led to separate candidacies of Lee Hoi-chang and Lee In-je, and both achieved 38.7% and 19.2% of the vote respectively, enabling Kim to win with only 40.3% of the popular vote or by a margin of 390,000 votes of 26 million over Lee Hoi-chang. Lee Hoi-chang was a former Supreme Court Justice and Prime Minister who had graduated at the top of his class from the Seoul National University School of Law. Lee was widely viewed as politically inexperienced, elitist, and his inept handling of charges that his sons had dodged the mandatory military service further damaged his campaign.

Kim, in contrast, had an outsider image which suited the anti-establishment mood and developed a strategy to use the media effectively in his campaign. In 1997, the &quot;North Winds&quot; scandal involved lawmakers of Lee&#x27;s party, who met North Korean agents in Beijing, who agreed to instigate, in exchange for bribes, a skirmish on the DMZ right before the presidential election to try to cause a panic that would hamper Kim&#x27;s campaign due to his dovish stand on North Korea. Lee&#x27;s colleagues were later prosecuted.

Ex-presidents Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo, and Kim Young-sam originated from the Gyeongsang Province region, which became wealthier since 1945 partly because of the policies of Park, Chun, and Roh&#x27;s regimes. Kim Dae-jung was the first president who came from the southwestern Jeolla region to serve a full term, an area that had been neglected and less developed partly because of the previous presidents&#x27; discriminatory policies.

===Transition period as president-elect===
Two days after the election, outgoing president Kim Young-sam and the president-elect Kim Dae-jung met and formed a joint 12-member Emergency Economic Committee (ECC), made up of six members each from the outgoing and incoming governments but effectively under the president-elect&#x27;s control, serving as the de facto economic cabinet until Kim Dae-jung would assume office two months later on 25 February 1998. This meant that Kim effectively had taken charge of making economic decisions during this period even before he took office.

The president-elect&#x27;s coalition and the majority Grand National Party of the outgoing president also agreed to convene a special session of the National Assembly to deal with a series of thirteen financial reform bills required under both the original IMF program and its 24 December revised deal. This transition period saw important financial reform legislation being passed into law, that had been stalled under the outgoing government. The president-elect cooperated with the outgoing government and ruling party to get legislative backing for several important reform measures. In particular, the delegation of substantial powers to the newly created Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) greatly enhanced the government&#x27;s powers to rein in the chaebols who were caught up in the crisis.

As president-elect, Kim Dae-jung also advised outgoing president Kim Young-sam to pardon two former presidents who were both imprisoned in 1996 for corruption, treason and insurrection, Chun Doo-hwan (who had Kim sentenced to death) and Roh Tae-woo (Chun&#x27;s second-in-command), in the spirit of national unity.

==Presidency (1998–2003)==

His swearing-in as the eighth president of South Korea on 25 February 1998, marked the first time in Korean history that the ruling party peacefully transferred power to a democratically elected opposition winner. Kim took office amidst an economic crisis. In his inaugural address, President Kim characterized his administration as a &quot;government of the people&quot;.

===Economic reforms and recovery===
As a presidential candidate, Kim briefly questioned the conditions attached to the IMF loans and suggested that he might renegotiate it. However, upon his election, Kim quickly recognized the importance of the IMF agreement in restoring South Korea&#x27;s economic health. Since then, he has implemented the most neoliberal policy among the major presidents of South Korea, leading to his nickname of &quot;Neoliberal Revolutionist&quot; ().

The first task of the Kim administration was restoring investor confidence. The administration held a series of intensive meetings with foreign creditors and quickly succeeded in rescheduling one-quarter of Korea&#x27;s short-term liabilities.

He vigorously pushed economic reform and restructuring recommended by the International Monetary Fund, in the process significantly altering the landscape of South Korean economy. He commenced the gold-collecting campaign in South Korea to overcome the debt to the International Monetary Fund.

Immediately after taking office, the Kim Dae-jung government pushed for revision of the Outside Auditor Law to facilitate the adoption of consolidated financial statements in accordance with international standards, beginning in 1999.
Furthermore, as cross-guarantees allowed loss-making affiliates and subsidiaries with chaebol groups to continue to borrow from banks and drain financial resources from healthier firms, on 1 April 1998, the government prohibited any new intra-chaebol mutual payment guarantees and ordered the phasing-out of the existing guarantees by March 2000. Banks were directed
to negotiate financial restructuring agreements with chaebol groups to reduce any outstanding debts, including closing insolvent firms. With the government&#x27;s commitment to introduce internationally accepted accounting practices, including independent external audits, full disclosure, and consolidated statements by conglomerates, the Kim administration helped to improve the transparency of chaebol corporate balance-sheets and governance and bring Korea&#x27;s economy to greater integration with the global economy.

The government also adopted a proactive foreign investment policy. Scores of banks were closed, merged or taken over by the government, and surviving banks were recapitalized. The chaebol were pressured to lower their perilously high debt-equity ratios and establish greater corporate transparency and accountability. Foreign direct investment, under Kim, was viewed as vital to the financial and corporate reform process as a form of secure, stable and long-term form of investment, and also able to acquire new technologies and managerial practices.

Kim&#x27;s administration did not shy away from using strong-arm tactics to bring about desired results. For example, when LG Group objected to Hyundai taking the controlling share and decided to pull out in the midst of merger negotiations, the newly created Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) immediately called in LG Group&#x27;s creditors to discuss punitive measures, including immediate suspension of credit and recall of existing loans and threatened to conduct a tax probe. In the end, LG Group agreed to the merger, relinquishing management control and selling its semiconductor business to Hyundai. Similarly, Samsung was encouraged to sell its automotive operations to Daewoo.

The reforms were modestly successful in getting the chaebols to change their ownership structure by separating ownership from management. Therefore, the largest changes made in this period were reforms in chaebol corporate governance through consolidated financial statements, independent external audits and reduction of intra-group mutual payment guarantees.

Chaebols also streamlined their operations by reducing their excessive leverage and consolidating their many operations in a few core competencies. Some also reduced their debt burden and increased their profitability. After the economy shrank by 5.8 percent in 1998, it grew 10.2 percent in 1999, marking an impressive recovery. South Korea repaid the IMF loan in August 2001, 3 years ahead of schedule.

Exports also recovered, led by exporting of semiconductors, automobiles, liquid crystal displays and mobile phones. Foreign investment during 1998 and 1999 exceeded that of the cumulative total for the previous 40 years. Foreign exchange reserves went from a perilously low $3.9 billion in December 1997 to $74.0 billion at the end of 1999, nearly double Korea&#x27;s short-term external liabilities. The exchange rate strengthened quickly by 30% against the U.S. dollar, to the point of actually causing concern about eroding Korea&#x27;s international competitiveness, and unemployment fell.

Despite worries of a second economic crisis in the wake of Daewoo&#x27;s bankruptcy in July 1999 (after its chairman, Kim Woo-choong continued to raise the company&#x27;s indebtedness and aggressively expand in spite of government restructuring and aid), the economic recovery remained on track. By also deciding not to bail out Daewoo, Kim&#x27;s government conveyed a message to chaebols that no company was too big to fail.

The administration also amended the bankruptcy laws, simplifying legal proceedings for corporate rehabilitation and filing of bankruptcy and streamlining provisions for non-viable firms to exit markets.

===Cyberinfrastructure===
The Kim Dae-jung administration built up country-wide high-speed ICT infrastructure and fostered IT and venture businesses as the future source of growth. In his inaugural address, he expressed a vision for South Korea to advance &quot;from the ranks of industrial societies…into the ranks of the knowledge and information-based societies where intangible knowledge and information will be the driving power for economic development&quot;. Today, South Korea is one of the most technologically developed countries in the world and has a well-connected cyberinfrastructure which began to be built and fostered under President Kim.

===Welfare===
Under the administration, expenditure on social protection was tripled. Outlays on social protection were increased from 2.6 trillion won (0.6 per cent of GDP) in 1997 to 9.1 trillion won (2.0 per cent of GDP) in 1999. The biggest policies that were introduced or expanded during Kim&#x27;s term were:

* expansion of the unemployment insurance program by including all firms (originally, only firms with more than 30 employees were covered), shortening the contribution period required for eligibility, and extending the duration of unemployment benefits. Thus the eligible workforce was increased from 5.7 million workers at the beginning of 1998 to 8.7 million at the end of the year.
* introduction of a temporary public work program in May 1998, enrolling 76,000 workers. By January 1999, the program provided 437,000 jobs.
* temporary livelihood protection program covering 750,000 beneficiaries. It also introduced a means-tested noncontributory social pension for 600,000 elderly people.

===Labour reform===
Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s government also enhanced labour market flexibility as a key goal of structural reforms.

Kim forged corporatist agreements between business, labour and government to get them to work together to resolve the country&#x27;s financial woes. Kim&#x27;s long history in the opposition, his pro-labour views and his overall populist, outsider credentials enabled him to get his mobilized and militant working-class voter base to make sacrifices to meet fiscal stabilization, while also asking businesses to make sacrifices at the same time.

After successful tripartite consultative negotiations between labor, business and government, the Labor Standards Act was amended by the National Assembly on 13 February 1998. Under the new accord, business promised to ensure transparency in its management and to take prudent measures when laying off its employees. Specifically, the law provided legal grounds for employment adjustment and permits layoffs only after a company has duly considered the interests of its workers. Labour, on the other hand, agreed to the implementation of flexible worker layoffs for restructuring, while pledging to work towards to enhancing productivity and cooperate with business on terms of wages and working hours. As for government, it committed itself to strengthening its support programs by providing vocational training and information on re-employment. New employment options such as temporary work, part-time employment and work at home were developed. To deal with the expected large-scale layoffs from the economic crisis and restructuring process, the government also pledged to strengthen and expand the coverage of unemployment insurance.

===North Korea policy===


His policy of engagement with North Korea has been termed the Sunshine Policy. He moved to begin détente with respect to the totalitarian government in North Korea, which culminated in a historic summit meeting in 2000 in Pyongyang with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. This marked a critical juncture in inter-Korean relations. On 13 October 2000, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts, and also in conjunction for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea. A big consequence of these efforts is that on 15 September 2000, the Korean Unification Flag () was carried into an Olympic Stadium during an Olympic opening ceremony for the first time. However, the historic event was tainted significantly by allegations that at least several hundred million dollars had been paid to North Korea, known as the cash-for-summit scandal. Hyundai transferred $500 million to the North just months before the summit, triggering criticism that the South Korean government paid for the summit. Hyundai claimed the money was a payment for exclusive business rights in electric power facilities, communication lines, an industrial park, cross-border roads and railway lines in North Korea. And in this regard, Park Jie-won was charged with violating domestic laws on foreign exchange trade and inter-Korean cooperation affairs while orchestrating covert money transfers by Hyundai to North Korea. Park played a pivotal role in arranging the first Inter-Korean summit. In May 2006, he was sentenced to three years in prison. Park was released in February 2007, and pardoned in December 2007. Also to persuade North Korea to attend the summit, several &quot;unconverted long-term prisoners&quot; kept by South Korea were released and returned to North Korea.

===Relationship with former presidents===
After Kim achieved the presidency and moved into the Blue House, there was uncertainty and considerable speculation about how he would deal with previous presidents: he had been sentenced to death under Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo was Chun&#x27;s number two and Kim Young-sam had been his political rival.

However, in December 1997 as president-elect, he advised outgoing president Kim Young-sam to pardon Chun and Roh who were imprisoned in 1996, in the spirit of national unity. Both Roh and Chun would attend Kim&#x27;s inauguration ceremony in February 1998. Early in his term Kim invited Chun and Roh, both of whom attempted to have him killed, to the Blue House and refrained from seeking political vengeance. Subsequently, Kim organized gatherings with the former presidents to seek advice, an unprecedented move. After coming back from overseas visits, he invited them to the Blue House to explain the outcomes. During Kim&#x27;s final days on his deathbed, the former presidents visited him and Chun met Lee Hee-ho, Kim&#x27;s wife and former first lady, and recounted Kim&#x27;s display of magnanimity towards him, even though he had once had him put on death row. On 10 August 2009, eight days before his death, Kim was visited by his predecessor and rival Kim Young-sam. Next Day, President Lee Myung-bak also visited at the hospital.

===Political developments===
When he entered office, he appointed Kim Jong-pil, formerly part of the Park Chung Hee dictatorship and Park&#x27;s prime minister, as his first prime minister in return for Jong-pil endorsing his candidacy in a power-sharing agreement before the 1997 election. Kim&#x27;s National Congress for New Politics, and Jong-pil&#x27;s United Liberal Democrats (ULD) formed a coalition, but did not have a majority in the National Assembly. Instead, the now opposition Grand National Party (GNP) of Lee Hoi-chang held a majority. During the first six months in 1998, most of the 100 major reform measures failed to materialize due to the lack of the legislative support and partisan compromise. It was only in September 1998 that the ruling coalition secured a majority in the National Assembly by enticing a large number of opposition GNP lawmakers to defect. Up to 25 GNP deputies left the party to join the governing coalition, after arm-twisting tactics by the government by launching corruption, campaign finance and tax audit investigations on them.

The ULD and Kim Jong-pil subsequently left the coalition to join the opposition in January 2000, following disagreement with President Kim&#x27;s North Korea policy and the failure of the president to uphold his deal with Jong-pil to introduce a cabinet-style government.

President Kim sought to remake his party into a national broad-based party instead of a base on regional appeal, and introduce multi-member parliamentary constituencies, with the ULD. However, Kim agreed with the GNP to implement a parallel voting system like in Japan, and the agreement collapsed amidst protests from civic groups. Thus the existing system was retained.

In 1999, the Furgate scandal damaged Kim Dae-jung and his party&#x27;s reputation. Also, in spite of his background as a democratic reformer, Kim was accused of being vindictive towards political opponents and even journalists critical of his government, as seen when government agencies used strong-arm tactics against the opposition or reporters via politically motivated investigations along with accusations of spying on the opposition. Kim&#x27;s administration included more individuals from Jeolla, which led to charges of reverse discrimination. Many citizens, in the middle of his term, also did not feel that the economic recovery benefitted them. Finally, conservatives accused Kim of being an appeaser towards North Korea with his Sunshine Policy.

These factors, led to National Congress, now renamed as the Millennium Democratic Party to suffer a setback as the party fell short behind the Grand National Party in the National Assembly during the 2000 South Korean legislative election. The decision to announce an inter-Korean summit 3 days before the election is said to have somewhat limited the governing party&#x27;s losses as 79.6% of respondents in an opinion poll approved of the summit. Kim appointed Lee Han-dong, ULD president, as the new prime minister in a bid to mend fences and continue a governing majority against the GNP.

Later, the ULD left the coalition for good in September 2001. ULD members sided with the GNP to pass a vote of no-confidence by 148 to 119 votes against key Cabinet member, Unification Minister Lim Dong-won, who was in charge of the Kim government&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; with North Korea. President Kim effectively became a lame duck, and the political leverage that he had accumulated thanks to his summit diplomacy came to an abrupt end. Economic reform plans and engagement policies pursued by the administration simultaneously achieved mixed results until the end of his term one and a half years later.

==Post-presidency==
Kim exited at the end of his term on 24 February 2003, and was succeeded by Roh Moo-hyun.

Kim called for restraint against the North Koreans for detonating a nuclear weapon and defended the continued Sunshine Policy towards Pyongyang to defuse the crisis. He also received an honorary doctorate at the University of Portland on 17 April 2008, where he delivered his speech, &quot;Challenge, Response, and God.&quot;

==Illness and death==
Kim died on 18 August 2009, at 13:43 KST, at Severance Hospital of Yonsei University in Seoul aged 85 years old, three months after his successor Roh Moo-hyun. He was first admitted to hospital suffering from pneumonia on 13 July. The cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 
An interfaith state funeral was held for him on 23 August 2009, in front of the National Assembly Building, with a procession leading to the Seoul National Cemetery where he was interred according to Catholic traditions, near former presidents Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee as well. He is the second person in South Korean history to be given a state funeral after Park Chung Hee. It was attended by President Lee Myung-bak, First Lady Kim Yoon-ok, former presidents Chun Doo-hwan, Kim Young-sam, former first Lady Kwon Yang-sook, and members of National Assembly. However, former President Roh Tae-woo and former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil were absent. North Korea sent a delegation to his funeral.

==Legacy==
During his presidency, he introduced South Korea&#x27;s contemporary welfare state, successfully shepherded the country&#x27;s economic recovery, brought in a new era of competitive and transparent economy and fostered a greater role for South Korea in the world stage, including the FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan in 2002. South Korea also became more democratic as a society, wired to the Internet, and based on a knowledge-intensive infrastructure. A presidential library at Yonsei University was built to preserve Kim&#x27;s legacy, and there is a convention center named after him in the city of Gwangju, the Kim Dae-jung Convention Center.

A Gallup Korea poll in October 2021 showed Kim, Roh Moo-hyun, and Park Chung Hee as the most highly rated presidents of South Korean history in terms of leaving a positive legacy. However, compared to Roh and Park, Kim attracted an absolute majority of positive opinions amongst all age groups, with the highest support among citizens in the 40-49 age range.

<text>A eutectic system or eutectic mixture ( ) is a type of a homogeneous mixture that has a melting point lower than those of the constituents. The lowest possible melting point over all of the mixing ratios of the constituents is called the &quot;eutectic temperature&quot;. On a phase diagram, the eutectic temperature is seen as the eutectic point (see plot on the right).

Non-eutectic mixture ratios have different melting temperatures for their different constituents, since one component&#x27;s lattice will melt at a lower temperature than the other&#x27;s. Conversely, as a non-eutectic mixture cools down, each of its components solidifies into a lattice at a different temperature, until the entire mass is solid. A non-eutectic mixture thus does not have a single melting/freezing point temperature at which it changes phase, but rather a temperature at which it changes between liquid and slush (known as the liquidus) and a lower temperature at which it changes between slush and solid (the solidus).

In the real world, eutectic properties can be used to advantage in such processes as eutectic bonding, where silicon chips are bonded to gold-plated substrates with ultrasound, and eutectic alloys prove valuable in such diverse applications as soldering, brazing, metal casting, electrical protection, fire sprinkler systems, and nontoxic mercury substitutes.

The term was coined in 1884 by British physicist and chemist Frederick Guthrie (1833–1886). The word originates . Before his studies, chemists assumed &quot;that the alloy of minimum fusing point must have its constituents in some simple atomic proportions&quot;, which was indeed proven to be not the case.

==Eutectic phase transition==
The eutectic solidification is defined as follows:

:formula_1

This type of reaction is an invariant reaction, because it is in thermal equilibrium; another way to define this is the change in Gibbs free energy equals zero. Tangibly, this means the liquid and two solid solutions all coexist at the same time and are in chemical equilibrium. There is also a thermal arrest for the duration of the phase change during which the temperature of the system does not change.

The resulting solid from a eutectic reaction depends on a few factors, with the most important factor being how the two solid solutions nucleate and grow. The most common structure is a lamellar structure, but other possible structures include rodlike, globular, and acicular.

==Non-eutectic compositions==
Compositions of eutectic systems that are not at the eutectic point can be classified as &quot;hypoeutectic&quot; or &quot;hypereutectic&quot;: 

* &quot;Hypoeutectic&quot; compositions are those with a greater composition of species α and a smaller percent composition of species β than the eutectic composition (E) 

* &quot;Hypereutectic&quot; compositions are characterized as those with a higher composition of species β and a lower composition of species α than the eutectic composition. 

As the temperature of a non-eutectic composition is lowered the liquid mixture will precipitate one component of the mixture before the other. In a hypereutectic solution, there will be a &quot;proeutectoid&quot; phase of species β whereas a hypoeutectic solution will have a &quot;proeutectic&quot; α phase.

==Types==

===Alloys===
Eutectic alloys have two or more materials and have a eutectic composition. When a non-eutectic alloy solidifies, its components solidify at different temperatures, exhibiting a plastic melting range. Conversely, when a well-mixed, eutectic alloy melts, it does so at a single, sharp temperature. The various phase transformations that occur during the solidification of a particular alloy composition can be understood by drawing a vertical line from the liquid phase to the solid phase on the phase diagram for that alloy.

Some uses for eutectic alloys include:
*NEMA eutectic alloy overload relays for electrical protection of three-phase motors for pumps, fans, conveyors, and other factory process equipment.
*Eutectic alloys for soldering, both traditional alloys composed of lead (Pb) and tin (Sn), sometimes with additional silver (Ag) or gold (Au) — especially SnPb and SnPbAg alloy formula for electronics - and newer lead-free soldering alloys, in particular ones composed of tin, silver, and copper (Cu) such as SnAg.
*Casting alloys, such as aluminium-silicon and cast iron (at the composition of 4.3% carbon in iron producing an austenite-cementite eutectic)
*Silicon chips are eutectic bonded to gold-plated substrates through a silicon-gold eutectic by the application of ultrasonic energy to the chip. 
*Brazing, where diffusion can remove alloying elements from the joint, so that eutectic melting is only possible early in the brazing process
*Temperature response, e.g., Wood&#x27;s metal and Field&#x27;s metal for fire sprinklers
*Non-toxic mercury replacements, such as galinstan
*Experimental glassy metals, with extremely high strength and corrosion resistance
*Eutectic alloys of sodium and potassium (NaK) that are liquid at room temperature and used as coolant in experimental fast neutron nuclear reactors.

===Others===

* Sodium chloride and water form a eutectic mixture whose eutectic point is −21.2 °C and 23.3% salt by mass. The eutectic nature of salt and water is exploited when salt is spread on roads to aid snow removal, or mixed with ice to produce low temperatures (for example, in traditional ice cream making).
* Ethanol–water has an unusually biased eutectic point, i.e. it is close to pure ethanol, which sets the maximum proof obtainable by fractional freezing. 
* &quot;Solar salt&quot;, 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3, forms a eutectic molten salt mixture which is used for thermal energy storage in concentrated solar power plants. To reduce the eutectic melting point in the solar molten salts, calcium nitrate is used in the following proportion: 42% Ca(NO3)2, 43% KNO3, and 15% NaNO3.
* Lidocaine and prilocaine—both are solids at room temperature—form a eutectic that is an oil with a melting point that is used in eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) preparations.
* Menthol and camphor, both solids at room temperature, form a eutectic that is a liquid at room temperature in the following proportions: 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 5:5. Both substances are common ingredients in pharmacy extemporaneous preparations.
* Minerals may form eutectic mixtures in igneous rocks, giving rise to characteristic intergrowth textures exhibited, for example, by granophyre.
* Some inks are eutectic mixtures, allowing inkjet printers to operate at lower temperatures.
* Choline chloride produces eutectic mixtures with many natural products such as citric acid, malic acid and sugars. These liquid mixtures can be used, for example, to obtain antioxidant and antidiabetic extracts from natural products.

== Strengthening mechanisms ==

=== Alloys ===
The primary strengthening mechanism of the eutectic structure in metals is composite strengthening (See strengthening mechanisms of materials). This deformation mechanism works through load transfer between the two constituent phases where the more compliant phase transfers stress to the stiffer phase. By taking advantage of the strength of the stiff phase and the ductility of the compliant phase, the overall toughness of the material increases. As the composition is varied to either hypoeutectic or hypereutectic formations, the load transfer mechanism becomes more complex as there is a load transfer between the eutectic phase and the secondary phase as well as the load transfer within the eutectic phase itself.

A second tunable strengthening mechanism of eutectic structures is the spacing of the secondary phase. By changing the spacing of the secondary phase, the fraction of contact between the two phases through shared phase boundaries is also changed. By decreasing the spacing of the eutectic phase, creating a fine eutectic structure, more surface area is shared between the two constituent phases resulting in more effective load transfer. On the micro-scale, the additional boundary area acts as a barrier to dislocations further strengthening the material. As a result of this strengthening mechanism, coarse eutectic structures tend to be less stiff but more ductile while fine eutectic structures are stiffer but more brittle. The spacing of the eutectic phase can be controlled during processing as it is directly related to the cooling rate during solidification of the eutectic structure. For example, for a simple lamellar eutectic structure, the minimal lamellae spacing  is:

Where  is formula_3 is the surface energy of the two-phase boundary, formula_4&quot; &quot;is the molar volume of the eutectic phase, formula_5  is the solidification temperature of the eutectic phase, formula_6 is the enthalpy of formation of the eutectic phase, and formula_7 is the undercooling of the material. So, by altering the undercooling, and by extension the cooling rate, the minimal achievable spacing of the secondary phase is controlled.

Strengthening metallic eutectic phases to resist deformation at high temperatures (see creep deformation) is more convoluted as the primary deformation mechanism changes depending on the level of stress applied. At high temperatures where deformation is dominated by dislocation movement, the strengthening from load transfer and secondary phase spacing remain as they continue to resist dislocation motion. At lower strains where Nabarro-Herring creep is dominant, the shape and size of the eutectic phase structure plays a significant role in material deformation as it affects the available boundary area for vacancy diffusion to occur.

== Other critical points==
===Eutectoid===
When the solution above the transformation point is solid, rather than liquid, an analogous eutectoid transformation can occur. For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the austenite phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce ferrite and cementite, often in lamellar structures such as pearlite and bainite. This eutectoid point occurs at and 0.76 wt% carbon.

===Peritectoid===
A &quot;peritectoid&quot; transformation is a type of isothermal reversible reaction that has two solid phases reacting with each other upon cooling of a binary, ternary, ..., &quot;n&quot;-ary alloy to create a completely different and single solid phase. The reaction plays a key role in the order and decomposition of quasicrystalline phases in several alloy types. A similar structural transition is also predicted for rotating columnar crystals.

===Peritectic===

Peritectic transformations are also similar to eutectic reactions. Here, a liquid and solid phase of fixed proportions react at a fixed temperature to yield a single solid phase. Since the solid product forms at the interface between the two reactants, it can form a diffusion barrier and generally causes such reactions to proceed much more slowly than eutectic or eutectoid transformations. Because of this, when a peritectic composition solidifies it does not show the lamellar structure that is found with eutectic solidification.

Such a transformation exists in the iron-carbon system, as seen near the upper-left corner of the figure. It resembles an inverted eutectic, with the δ phase combining with the liquid to produce pure austenite at and 0.17% carbon.

At the peritectic decomposition temperature the compound, rather than melting, decomposes into another solid compound and a liquid. The proportion of each is determined by the lever rule. In the Al-Au phase diagram, for example, it can be seen that only two of the phases melt congruently, AuAl2 and Au2Al, while the rest peritectically decompose.

===&quot;Bad solid solution&quot;===
Not all minimum melting point systems are &quot;eutectic&quot;. The alternative of &quot;poor solid solution&quot; can be illustrated by comparing the common precious metal systems Cu-Ag and Cu-Au.
Cu-Ag, source for example https://himikatus.ru/art/phase-diagr1/Ag-Cu.php, is a true eutectic system. The eutectic melting point is at 780 °C, with solid solubility limits at fineness 80 and 912 by weight, and eutectic at 719.
Since Cu-Ag is a true eutectic, any silver with fineness anywhere between 80 and 912 will reach solidus line, and therefore melt at least partly, at exactly 780 °C. The eutectic alloy with fineness exactly 719 will reach liquidus line, and therefore melt entirely, at that exact temperature without any further rise of temperature till all of the alloy has melted.
Any silver with fineness between 80 and 912 but not exactly 719 will also reach the solidus line at exactly 780 °C, but will melt partly. It will leave a solid residue with fineness of either exactly 912 or exactly 80, but never some of both. It will melt at constant temperature without further rise of temperature until the exact amount of eutectic (fineness 719) alloy has melted off to divide the alloy into eutectic melt and solid solution residue.
On further heating, the solid solution residue dissolves in the melt and changes its composition until the liquidus line is reached and the whole residue has dissolved away.
Cu-Au source for example https://himikatus.ru/art/phase-diagr1/Au-Cu.php does display a melting point minimum at 910 °C and given as 44 atom % Cu, which converts to about 20 weight percent Cu - about 800 fineness of gold. But this is not a true eutectic.
800 fine gold melts at 910 °C, to a melt of exact same composition, and the whole alloy will melt at exact same temperature. But the differences happen away from the minimum composition.
Unlike silver with fineness other than 719 (which melts partly at exactly 780 °C through a wide fineness range), gold with fineness other than 800 will reach solidus and start partial melting at a temperature different from and higher than 910 °C, depending on the alloy fineness. The partial melting does cause some composition changes - the liquid will be closer in fineness towards 800 than the remaining solid, but the liquid will not have fineness of exactly 800 and the fineness of the remaining solid will depend on the fineness of the liquid.
The underlying reason is that for an eutectic system like Cu-Ag, the solubility in liquid phase is good but solubility in solid phase is limited. Therefore when a silver-copper alloy is frozen, it actually separates into crystals of 912 fineness silver and 80 fineness silver - both are saturated and always have the same composition at the freezing point of 780 °C. Thus the alloy just below 780 °C consists of two types of crystals of exactly the same composition regardless of the total alloy composition, only the relative amount of each type of crystals differs. Therefore they always melt at 780 °C until one or other type of crystals, or both, will be exhausted.
In contrast, in Cu-Au system the components are miscible at the melting point in all compositions even in solid. There can be crystals of any composition, which will melt at different temperatures depending on composition.
However, Cu-Au system is a &quot;poor&quot; solid solution. There is a substantial misfit between the atoms in solid which, however, near the melting point is overcome by entropy of thermal motion mixing the atoms. That misfit, however, disfavours the Cu-Au solution relative to phases in which the atoms are better fitted, such as the melt, and causes the melting point to fall below the melting point of components.

==Eutectic calculation==
The composition and temperature of a eutectic can be calculated from enthalpy and entropy of fusion of each components.

The Gibbs free energy &quot;G&quot; depends on its own differential:
: formula_8

Thus, the &quot;G&quot;/&quot;T&quot; derivative at constant pressure is calculated by the following equation:
: formula_9

The chemical potential formula_10 is calculated if we assume that the activity is equal to the concentration:
: formula_11

At the equilibrium, formula_12, thus formula_13 is obtained as
: formula_14

Using and integrating gives
: formula_15

The integration constant &quot;K&quot; may be determined for a pure component with a melting temperature formula_16 and an enthalpy of fusion formula_17:
: formula_18

We obtain a relation that determines the molar fraction as a function of the temperature for each component:
: formula_19

The mixture of &quot;n&quot; components is described by the system
: formula_20
: formula_21

which can be solved by
: formula_22

<text>Euglenids or euglenoids are one of the best-known groups of eukaryotic flagellates: single-celled organisms with flagella, or whip-like tails. They are classified in the phylum Euglenophyta, class Euglenida or Euglenoidea. Euglenids are commonly found in fresh water, especially when it is rich in organic materials, but they have a few marine and endosymbiotic members. Many euglenids feed by phagocytosis, or strictly by diffusion. A monophyletic subgroup known as Euglenophyceae have chloroplasts and produce their own food through photosynthesis. This group contains the carbohydrate paramylon.

Euglenids split from other Euglenozoa (a larger group of flagellates) more than a billion years ago. The plastids (membranous organelles) in all extant photosynthetic species result from secondary endosymbiosis between a euglenid and a green alga. 
== Structure ==
Euglenoids are distinguished mainly by the presence of a type of cell covering called a pellicle. Within its taxon, the pellicle is one of the euglenoids&#x27; most diverse morphological features. The pellicle is composed of proteinaceous strips underneath the cell membrane, supported by dorsal and ventral microtubules. This varies from rigid to flexible, and gives the cell its shape, often giving it distinctive striations. In many euglenids, the strips can slide past one another, causing an inching motion called metaboly. Otherwise, they move using their flagella.

== Classification ==

The first attempt at classifying euglenids was done by Ehrenberg in 1830, when he described the genus &quot;Euglena&quot; and placed it in the Polygastrica of family Astasiae, containing other creatures of variable body shape and lacking pseudopods or lorica. Later, various biologists described additional characteristics for &quot;Euglena&quot; and established different classification systems for euglenids based on nutrition modes, the presence and number of flagella, and the degree of metaboly. The 1942 revision by A. Hollande distinguished three groups, Peranemoidées (flexible phagotrophs), Petalomonadinées (rigid phagotrophs) and Euglenidinées (phototrophs), and was widely accepted as the best reflection of the natural relationships between euglenids, adopted by many other authors. Gordon F. Leedale expanded on Hollande&#x27;s system, establishing six orders (Eutreptiales, Euglenales, Rhabdomonadales, Sphenomonadales, Heteronematales and Euglenamorphales) and taking into account new data on their physiology and ultrastructure. This scheme endured until 1986, with the sequencing of the SSU rRNA gene from &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot;.

Euglenids are currently regarded as a highly diverse clade within Euglenozoa, in the eukaryotic supergroup Discoba. They are traditionally organized into three categories based on modes of nutrition: the phototrophs (Euglenophyceae), the osmotrophs (mainly the &#x27;primary osmotrophs&#x27; known as Aphagea), and the phagotrophs, from which the first two groups have evolved. The phagotrophs, although paraphyletic, have historically been classified under the name of Heteronematina. 

In addition, euglenids can be divided into inflexible or rigid euglenids, and flexible or metabolic euglenids which are capable of &#x27;metaboly&#x27; or &#x27;euglenid motion&#x27;. Only those with more than 18 protein strips in their pellicle gain this flexibility. Phylogenetic studies show that various clades of rigid phagotrophic euglenids compose the base of the euglenid tree, namely Petalomonadida and the paraphyletic &#x27;Ploeotiida&#x27;. In contrast, all flexible euglenids belong to a monophyletic group known as Spirocuta, which includes Euglenophyceae, Aphagea and various phagotrophs (Peranemidae, Anisonemidae and Neometanemidae). The current classification of class Euglenida, as a result of these studies, is as follows:
* Euglenida &quot;incertae sedis&quot;: &quot;Atraktomonas&quot;, &quot;Calycimonas&quot;, &quot;Dolium&quot;, &quot;Dylakosoma&quot;, &quot;Tropidoscyphus&quot;, &quot;Michajlowastasia&quot;, &quot;Parastasiella&quot;, &quot;Dinemula&quot;, &quot;Paradinemula&quot;, &quot;Mononema&quot;, &quot;Ovicola&quot;, &quot;Naupliicola&quot;, &quot;Embryocola&quot;, &quot;Copromonas&quot;.
* Order Petalomonadida

**** Family Euglenaceae 

==Nutrition==
The classification of euglenids is still variable, as groups are being revised to conform with their molecular phylogeny. Classifications have fallen in line with the traditional groups based on differences in nutrition and number of flagella; these provide a starting point for considering euglenid diversity. Different characteristics of the euglenids&#x27; pellicles can provide insight into their modes of movement and nutrition.

As with other Euglenozoa, the primitive mode of nutrition is phagocytosis. Prey such as bacteria and smaller flagellates is ingested through a cytostome, supported by microtubules. These are often packed together to form two or more rods, which function in ingestion, and in &quot;Entosiphon&quot; form an extendable siphon. Most phagotrophic euglenids have two flagella, one leading and one trailing. The latter is used for gliding along the substrate. In some, such as &quot;Peranema&quot;, the leading flagellum is rigid and beats only at its tip.

=== Osmotrophic euglenoids ===
Osmotrophic euglenids are euglenids which have undergone osmotrophy.

Due to a lack of characteristics that are useful for taxonomical purposes, the origin of osmotrophic euglenids is unclear, though certain morphological characteristics reveal a small fraction of osmotrophic euglenids are derived from phototrophic and phagotrophic ancestors.

A prolonged absence of light or exposure to harmful chemicals may cause atrophy and absorption of the chloroplasts without otherwise harming the organism. A number of species exists where a chloroplast&#x27;s absence was formerly marked with separate genera such as &quot;Astasia&quot; (colourless &quot;Euglena&quot;) and &quot;Hyalophacus&quot; (colourless &quot;Phacus&quot;). Due to the lack of a developed cytostome, these forms feed exclusively by osmotrophic absorption.

== Reproduction ==
Although euglenids share several common characteristics with animals, which is why they were originally classified as so, no evidence has been found of euglenids ever using sexual reproduction. This is one of the reasons they could no longer be classified as animals.

For euglenids to reproduce, asexual reproduction takes place in the form of binary fission, and the cells replicate and divide during mitosis and cytokinesis. This process occurs in a very distinct order. First, the basal bodies and flagella replicate, then the cytostome and microtubules (the feeding apparatus), and finally the nucleus and remaining cytoskeleton. Once this occurs, the organism begins to cleave at the basal bodies, and this cleavage line moves towards the center of the organism until two separate euglenids are evident. Because of the way that this reproduction takes place and the axis of separation, it is called longitudinal cell division or longitudinal binary fission.
== Evolution ==
The earliest fossil of euglenids is attributed to &quot;Moyeria&quot;, which is interpreted as possessing a pellicle composed of proteinaceous strips, the defining characteristic of euglenids. It is found in Middle Ordovician and Silurian rocks, making it the oldest fossil evidence of euglenids.

<doc id="152972" wikidata="Q131630" url="?curid=152972" title="Kinetoplastida">
<text>Kinetoplastida (or Kinetoplastea, as a class) is a group of flagellated protists belonging to the phylum Euglenozoa, and characterised by the presence of a distinctive organelle called the kinetoplast (hence the name), a granule containing a large mass of DNA. The group includes a number of parasites responsible for serious diseases in humans and other animals, as well as various forms found in soil and aquatic environments. The organisms are commonly referred to as &quot;kinetoplastids&quot; or &quot;kinetoplasts&quot;.

The kinetoplastids were first defined by Bronislaw M. Honigberg in 1963 as the members of the flagellated protozoans. They are traditionally divided into the biflagellate Bodonidae and uniflagellate Trypanosomatidae; the former appears to be paraphyletic to the latter. One family of kinetoplastids, the trypanosomatids, is notable as it includes several genera which are exclusively parasitic. &quot;Bodo&quot; is a typical genus within kinetoplastida, which also includes various common free-living species which feed on bacteria. Others include &quot;Cryptobia&quot; and the parasitic &quot;Leishmania&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

===History===

Honigberg created the taxonomic names Kinetoplastida and Kinetoplastea in 1963. Since then there is no consensus on the use of either of the two as a definite taxon. Kinetoplastea is more widely used as the class, while Kinetoplastida is mostly used to designate the order, but is also used as a class. Lynn Margulis, who initially accepted Kinetoplastida as an order in 1974, later placed it as a class. Use of Kinetoplastida as an order also creates confusion as there is already an older name Trypanosomatida Kent, 1880, under which the kinetoplastids are most often placed.

===Classification===

Kinetoplastida is divided into two subclasses - Metakinetoplastina and Prokinetoplastina.
* Family ?Bordnamonadidae 
* Family ?Trypanophididae 
* Subclass Prokinetoplastina 
** Order Prokinetoplastida 
*** Family Ichthyobodonidae 
* Subclass Metakinetoplastina 
** Order Neobodonida 
*** Family Rhynchomonadidae 
*** Family Neobodonidae 
** Order Parabodonida 
*** Family Parabodonidae [Cryptobiaceae ; Cryptobiidae ; Trypanoplasmatidae ]
** Order Bodonida 
*** Family Bodonidae 
** Order Trypanosomatida 
*** Family Trypanosomatidae [Trypanomorphidae ]

==Morphology==
Kinetoplastids are eukaryotic and possess normal eukaryotic organelles, for example the nucleus, mitochondrion, golgi apparatus and flagellum. Along with these universal structures, kinetoplastids have several distinguishing morphological features such as the kinetoplast, sub-pellicular microtubule array and paraflagellar rod.

===Mitochondrion and kinetoplast DNA===

The kinetoplast, after which the class is named, is a dense DNA-containing granule within the cell&#x27;s single mitochondrion, containing many copies of the mitochondrial genome. The structure is made up of a network of concatenated circular DNA molecules and their related structural proteins along with DNA and RNA polymerases. The kinetoplast is found at the base of a cell&#x27;s flagella and is associated to the flagellum basal body by a cytoskeletal structure.

===Cytoskeleton===
The cytoskeleton of kinetoplastids is primarily made up of microtubules. These make a highly regular array, the sub-pellicular array, which runs parallel just under the cell surface along the long axis of the cell. Other microtubules with more specialised roles, such as the rootlet microtubules, are also present. Kinetoplastids are capable of forming actin microfilaments but their role in the cytoskeleton is not clear. Other cytoskeletal structures include the specialised attachment between the flagellum and the kinetoplast.

===Flagella===
All kinetoplastids possess at least one flagellum; species in the order trypanosomatida have one and bodonida have two. In kinetoplastids with two flagella most forms have a leading and trailing flagellum, the latter of which may be attached to the side of the cell. The flagella are used for locomotion and attachment to surfaces. The bases of the flagella are found in a specialised pocket structure which is also the location of the cytostome.

==Life cycle==
Kinetoplastids may be free-living or parasitic. The order trypanosomatida is notable as it includes many genera which are exclusively parasitic. Trypanosomatids may have simple life cycles in a single host or more complex ones which progress through multiple differentiation stages in two hosts. Dramatic morphological changes are possible between lifecycle stages. Diseases caused by members of the order trypanosomatida include sleeping sickness and Chagas disease, caused by species of &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, and leishmaniasis, caused by species of &quot;Leishmania&quot;.

&quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; can undergo meiosis as a likely part of a sexual cycle. &quot;Leishmania major&quot; is also capable of a meiotic process that is likely part of a sexual cycle.

<text>The Ishim (; ) is a river running through Kazakhstan and Russia. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . Its average discharge is . It is a left tributary of the Irtysh. The Ishim is partly navigable in its lower reaches. The upper course of the Ishim passes through Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. In Russia, the course of the river travels through a vast marshland, and has countless meanders and oxbow lakes. The river freezes from late November until March.

== Main tributaries ==
The largest tributaries of the Ishim are, from source to mouth:

* Kalkutan (right)
* Zhabay (right)
* Terisaqqan (left)
* Aqqanburlyq (right)
* Karasul (left)
* Barsuk (right)
== In Astana ==

According to the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Astana was chosen as the capital in part due to the presence of the river. The city is also divided into two sections, the Right (northern) Bank of the Ishim or the old town, and the Left (southern) Bank, where the new government buildings such as the Ak Orda, the House of the Government, and the Supreme Court are located, as well as many prestigious apartment and living complexes.

Since 1998, the Ishim in Astana has been actively managed, for flood management and maintaining water level, in order to provide for recreational use and ensure the showpiece appearance. It is dammed downstream of central Astana, keeping its level higher than it otherwise would be most of the time, while the river bottom has been made deeper, in order to let flood waters through faster. In central Astana, near the city park, there is now a public beach and pedalo boat rental; meanwhile, if the river had not been dammed, &quot;citizens would have been able to walk across it&quot;. Another dam will be constructed upstream of the city, for better flood control.

The city authorities also have plans for further deepening the river, which will eventually allow small passenger boats to operate on a section of the river through the nation&#x27;s capital.

To maintain the desired level of water flow, water is pumped to the Ishim from the Irtysh, over the Irtysh–Karaganda Canal and a pipeline.

<doc id="152974" wikidata="Q314462" url="?curid=152974" title="Harold Lasswell">
<text>Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13, 1902 – December 18, 1978) was an American political scientist and communications theorist. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy and economics and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. He was a professor of law at Yale University. He served as president of the American Political Science Association, American Society of International Law, and World Academy of Art and Science.

According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell&#x27;s death, and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987, Lasswell &quot;ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century.&quot; At the time, Almond asserted that &quot;few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time.&quot;

Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality, social structure, and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. Lasswell was associated with the disciplines of communication, political science, psychology, and sociology – however he did not adhere to the distinction between these boundaries, but instead worked to erase the lines drawn to divide these disciplines.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Lasswell was born on February 13, 1902, in Donnellson, Illinois, to a clergyman and a school teacher. An older brother died in childhood.

=== Education ===
During high school, Lasswell served as editor of the school newspaper and gave a valedictory speech at graduation. Some of his early influences included his uncle, a physician who introduced him to the works of Sigmund Freud; and an English teacher, who introduced him to Karl Marx and Havelock Ellis. Excelling in his academics, particularly history and English, Lasswell was awarded a scholarship to the University of Chicago.

In 1918, at the age of 16, Lasswell began his studies at the University of Chicago, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy and economics. He also received a doctorate from the University of Chicago and penned his dissertation on &quot;Propaganda Technique in the World War&quot; (1927). He also studied at the Universities of London, Geneva, Paris, and Berlin in the 1920s.

=== Teaching career ===
From 1922 to 1938, Lasswell served as an assistant professor and associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago. During this time, Lasswell was granted a postdoctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences Research Council. Lasswell spent a year teaching at the Washington School of Psychiatry from 1938 to 1939, before joining the U.S. Library of Congress as director of war communications research from 1939 to 1945.

During this time, he also taught at the New School of Social Research and Yale Law School. As a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School, Lasswell taught a graduate seminar on &quot;Property in a Crisis Society.&quot; He became a full-time faculty member following World War II, which underscored the need for a better understanding of law and theory about law.

Lasswell taught law and political science at Yale University from 1946 to 1970. From 1970 to 1972, he served as a professor of law at the City University of New York&#x27;s John Jay College. From 1972 to 1976, he served as a distinguished professor at Temple University School of Law, where he retired from teaching. Columbia University also named him the Albert Schewitzer professor of international affairs. After retiring from teaching, Lasswell spent his remaining years working with the Policy Sciences Center.

=== Professional affiliations and honors ===
To institutionalize the policy sciences he was formulating, Lasswell along with Myres McDougal and George Dession created the Policy Sciences Council in 1944 and the Policy Sciences Foundation in 1948.

Lasswell served as president of the American Political Science Association in 1956 and president of the American Society of International Law from 1966 to 1968. He was also involved in the Association for the Advancement of Science, Commission on the Freedom of the Press, Committee for Economic Development, and Rand Corporation.

During the course of his career, Lasswell received many honors, including honorary degrees from the University of Chicago, Columbia University, the University of Illinois, and the Jewish Theological Seminary. The American Council of Learned Societies honored him in 1960, calling him a &quot;master of all the social sciences and pioneer in each.&quot; He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.

=== Later years ===
Lasswell suffered a massive stroke on December 24, 1977. He died of pneumonia on December 18, 1978.

==Work==
Publishing between 4 million to 6 million words during his academic career, Lasswell has been described as a &quot;one-man university&quot; whose &quot;competence in, and contributions to, anthropology, communications, economics, law, philosophy, psychology, psychiatry and sociology are enough to make him a political scientist in the model of classical Greece.&quot;

Lasswell is considered to be a founding father of political psychology and policy sciences and an early proponent of mass communication as a field of scholarly research. He believed universities should become focal centers for the study of communications.

His five-questions model of communication is considered one of the earliest and most influential models of communication. Many consider him the founder of content analysis, having conducted one of the most comprehensive content analysis studies of his time.

=== Propaganda ===
At the age of 25, Lasswell completed his doctoral dissertation on &quot;Propaganda Technique in the World War&quot;. He defined propaganda as &quot;the control of opinion by significant symbols&quot; such as stories, rumors, reports, pictures, and other forms of social communication. He also wrote that propaganda is &quot;concerned with the management of opinions and attitudes by the direct manipulation of social suggestion.&quot; In his dissertation, Lasswell noted that propaganda is unavoidable and democracies must adjust to it, rather than fight it.

His definition of propaganda was viewed as an important development to understanding the goal of propaganda. Lasswell&#x27;s studies on propaganda produced breakthroughs on the subject, which broadened current views on the means and stated objectives that could be achieved through propaganda to include not only the change of opinions but also change in actions. He inspired the definition given by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis: &quot;Propaganda is the expression of opinions or actions carried out deliberately by individuals or groups with a view to influence the opinions or actions of other individuals or groups for predetermined ends through psychological manipulations.&quot;

His study of political and wartime propaganda represented an important early type of communication study. Propaganda analysis has been absorbed into the general body of communication research, though the word propaganda later gained a negative connotation.

=== Content analysis ===
Lasswell&#x27;s study of propaganda and the psychoanalytic biographies of political leaders led to his invention of systematic content analysis, the study of communication documents to examine patterns, and its uses in World War II. In 1935, Lasswell published &quot;World Politics and Personal Insecurity&quot;, a study of international relations using quantitative content analysis. The study included direct observation of the aggressive behavior of welfare clients toward public relief administrators.

Expanding on his work, Lasswell contributed to a wartime communications project sponsored by the Library of Congress. &quot;Language of Politics: Studies in Quantitative Semantics&quot; is thought to be &quot;one of the most comprehensive single content analysis study ever undertaken with scholarly objectives.&quot;

He pioneered such content analysis methods as standardizing the collection of information, developing categories of analysis, and using quantitative measurements to study communication messages. In the next two decades, Lasswell and his associates worked to apply content analysis to a variety of subject matters.

Lasswell wanted to use knowledge to solve public problems. He believed, like John Dewey, that one should pay close attention to the contexts in which concepts were used. For example, social scientists should express their ideas through sentences, not single words, to provide full context.

One criticism of content analysis is its inability to study communication effects. While Lasswell&#x27;s concept of content analysis allows for inferences about data, its weakness is its ability to verify the data.

=== Political psychology ===
Lasswell&#x27;s work was also important in the post-World War II development of behavioralism. Lasswell is credited with being the founder of the field of political psychology, the intersection of psychology and political science, in the 1930s and 1940s.

His works on political psychology include &quot;Psychopathology and Politics&quot;, &quot;World Politics and Personal Insecurity&quot;, and &quot;Power and Personality&quot;.

His psychoanalytic study of political leaders introduced Freudian psychoanalytic theory to the social sciences and focused on power dynamics. Lasswell was particularly influenced by Freud&#x27;s ideas of the aimlessness of instinctual drives and the malleability of human perspectives. In &quot;Politics: Who Gets What, When, How&quot;, he viewed the elite as the primary holders of power.

While studying in Vienna and Berlin with Theodor Reik, a devotee of Freud, Lasswell was able to appropriate Freud&#x27;s methods. Lasswell built a laboratory in his social science office at the University of Chicago to conduct experiments on volunteers and students. Lasswell also used psychoanalytical interviewing and recording methods that he appropriated from his time of studying with Elton Mayo at Harvard University.

=== Garrison state ===
Lasswell introduced the concept of a &quot;garrison state&quot; in a highly influential and often cited 1941 article originally published in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;. It was a &quot;developmental construct&quot; that outlined the possibility of a political-military elite composed of &quot;specialists in violence&quot; in a modern state.

=== Model of communication ===

His five-questions model of communication, which focuses on &quot;who (says) what (to) whom (in) what channel (with) what effect,&quot; led to the emphasis in communication study on determining effects. First published in Lasswell&#x27;s 1948 book, &quot;The Structure and Function of Communication in Society&quot;, the model aims to organize the &quot;scientific study of the process of communication.&quot;

Most criticism of Lasswell&#x27;s model focuses on its simplicity and its lack of relevance due to its linear orientation. Other scholars object to its lack of a feedback loop, that it does not take into consideration the effects of noise, and that it does not address the influences of context on communication.

=== Policy sciences ===
In the 1950s to 1970s, Lasswell helped create the policy sciences, an interdisciplinary movement to integrate social science knowledge with public action. Lasswell was concerned with such questions as how to improve the concepts and procedures of those who study political problems professionally, and how to train policy scientists.

Lasswell’s 1956 book, &quot;The Decision Process: Seven Categories of Functional Analysis&quot;, outlined seven stages of policy decision-making: intelligence, promotion, prescription, invocation, application, termination, and appraisal. The seven stages have been criticized for their construct as a policy cycle or a linear process. He also identified eight &quot;goal values&quot; of policy: wealth, power, respect, rectitude, skill, well being, enlightenment, and affection.

His 1963 book, &quot;The Future of Political Science&quot;, explored the political scientist&#x27;s decision process in both official and unofficial policymaking contexts.

Lasswell co-authored &quot;Jurisprudence for a Free Society&quot; in 1966 along with McDougal. The book examines legal, official, and unofficial decisions that contribute to public and civic order. Policies and how they are made cannot be understood without examining the larger social process.

In his 1971 book, &quot;A Pre-View of the Policy Sciences&quot;, Lasswell prioritized five &quot;intellectual tasks&quot; of the policy scientist: goal clarification, trend description, analysis of conditions, projection of developments, and provision of alternatives.

=== Human rights and future implications ===
In his 1956 presidential address to the American Political Science Association, Lasswell raised the question of whether or not we should give human rights to robots. His overall message was that technological innovation and the Cold War meant the nation&#x27;s future was at stake. Political science, according to Lasswell, needed to provide clear goals, &quot;theoretical models of the political process,&quot; and develop policy alternatives to maximize democratic values. Lasswell believed political science should be practiced like law, as a free profession rather than an academic pursuit.

In 1980, Lasswell and his associates published &quot;Human Rights and World Public Order&quot; to present a &quot;comprehensive framework of inquiry&quot; from which to approach international human rights law, and international law.

<text>John Francombe &quot;Ian&quot; Ure (born 7 December 1939) is a Scottish former football player and manager.

Ure started his career with Dundee, before moving to England to play for Arsenal and Manchester United. After eight years in England, Ure returned to Scotland to play for St Mirren, however, after two seasons with the club and only three league appearances, Ure went into football management with East Stirlingshire.

During his time with Dundee and Arsenal, Ure played on 12 occasions for the Scotland national team.

== Club career ==

Ure started his career as a centre-half with Ayr Albion. In 1958, after being scouted by the Dens Park club, Ure signed for Dundee where he remained for five seasons. During that time, the club won its one and only First Division title in 1961–62, and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1962–63, losing 5–2 on aggregate to eventual champions Milan.

He moved south of the border in 1963 for a transfer fee of £62,500 to play for Arsenal. He only missed one match for Arsenal in his first season, but injury and a loss of form restricted his appearances in 1964–65 and 1965–66, although he still managed more than 20 matches each season. Ure was restored to the Arsenal line-up by Bertie Mee, however, and played 44 matches in 1966–67. Ure continued to feature regularly for Arsenal as the 1960s went on, but during this time made a couple of errors in big matches, exemplified by his mistake in the 1969 League Cup Final against Swindon Town, which allowed Roger Smart to score Swindon&#x27;s opening goal; Swindon went on to win 3–1 after extra time.

Ure played 202 matches for Arsenal in defence over the course of six years, scoring two goals, and picking up two League Cup runners-up medals (1968 and 1969). He was famously involved in a number of clashes with Denis Law in the game against Manchester United in October 1967, that saw both players being sent off and subsequently receiving six-match bans. However, with Frank McLintock and Terry Neill competing for the centre half position, Ure found himself being squeezed out towards the end of that decade, and he left Arsenal in August 1969 to join Manchester United. The only major signing made by manager Wilf McGuinness, Ure spent two seasons at Manchester United before returning to Scotland to play for St Mirren.

After retiring from playing, he spent some time as a coach, including a spell as manager of East Stirlingshire, but later left the game completely, and was employed as a social worker in Kilmarnock.

== International career ==

During his time with Dundee, Ure won eight caps for Scotland. He made his debut international debut on 8 November 1961, in a 2–0 win against Wales. He made 12 appearances in total, with his last cap coming against Northern Ireland on 21 October 1967. One of his appearances was during a 1967 overseas tour that the Scottish Football Association decided in October 2021 to reclassify as a full international, which increased Ure&#x27;s cap tally from 11 to 12.

<text>Bückeburg (; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Bückeborg&quot;) is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany, on the border with North Rhine Westphalia. It is located in the district of Schaumburg close to the northern slopes of the Weserbergland ridge. Bückeburg has a population of 21,030.

==History==
Until the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Bückeburg was the capital of the tiny principality of Schaumburg-Lippe. Schaumburg-Lippe continued to be an independent German state (Free state) until 1946. 

Houses began to gather around the castle and were protected by a city wall in the 17th century. In the 19th century, it was connected to the Minden and Hanover Railway and housed a synagogue. The poet J. G. von Herder was court preacher here from 1771 to 1776.

Bückeburg is a former British garrison town and had a number of British residents until recently. Most of the British residents worked at the British Military Hospital (BMH) in Rinteln, or in the local English Prince Rupert School, also in Rinteln. The number of British military residents in Bückeburg decreased significantly in the late 1990s, when BMH Rinteln closed down, however the staff of Prince Rupert School were still based in Bückeburg until the closure of the school in July 2014.

==Buildings==

===Bückeburg Palace===

Bückeburg Palace (&quot;Schloss Bückeburg&quot;) was the residence of the Princes of Schaumburg-Lippe. Although the Princely family surrendered political power in 1918, they still own it and live there today. The palace, part of which is open to the public, is an important major tourist sight and houses important works of art and an important library. The history of the building spans 700 years, with the most important contributions stemming from the 16th, 17th, and 19th centuries.

The Princely Mausoleum in the palace grounds is open to the public as well. Built in 1915 in Neo-Romanic style and resembling the Roman Pantheon, it is the world&#x27;s largest private sepulchre still in use. The cupola is adorned by an impressive gold mosaic, the second largest of its kind after the one in the Hagia Sophia.

In the period around 1950 when the Royal Air Force had a base nearby, the children of the service families attended a school in the Schloss.

===Helicopter Museum===
Bückeburg is also home to a helicopter museum, which features the early drawings of flying objects by Leonardo da Vinci as well as 40 actual helicopters. The German Army&#x27;s Army Aviators School using Bückeburg Air Base is located here.

===Bückeburg Church===
The Town Church of Bückeburg (&quot;Bückeburger Stadtkirche&quot;) was one of the first Lutheran churches built after the Reformation. It is known for its pulpit and especially for the ornately decorated bronze-cast font, made by the Dutch artist Adriaen de Vries. Composer Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (1732–1795), a son of J.S. Bach, worked at the Bückeburg court from before 1751 until his death, first as a harpsichordist, then, from 1759, as Konzertmeister (director) of the Hofkapelle (court orchestra) there. Bach is buried in the churchyard of the Stadtkirchengemeinde-Bückeburg. Bach set several texts by Johann Gottfried Herder, who was at the Bückeburg court as its superintendent and chief preacher from 1771–1776.

<text>In plane geometry, a pedal triangle is obtained by projecting a point onto the sides of a triangle.

More specifically, consider a triangle , and a point that is not one of the vertices . Drop perpendiculars from to the three sides of the triangle (these may need to be produced, i.e., extended). Label the intersections of the lines from with the sides . The pedal triangle is then .

If is not an obtuse triangle and is the orthocenter, then the angles of are , and .

The quadrilaterals are cyclic quadrilaterals.

The location of the chosen point relative to the chosen triangle gives rise to some special cases:

* If is the orthocenter, then is the orthic triangle.
* If is the incenter, then is the intouch triangle.
* If is the circumcenter, then is the medial triangle.
*If is on the circumcircle of the triangle, collapses to a line (the &quot;pedal line&quot; or &quot;Simson line&quot;).

The vertices of the pedal triangle of an interior point , as shown in the top diagram, divide the sides of the original triangle in such a way as to satisfy Carnot&#x27;s theorem:

formula_1

==Trilinear coordinates==
If has trilinear coordinates , then the vertices of the pedal triangle of are given by
formula_2

==Antipedal triangle==

One vertex, , of the antipedal triangle of is the point of intersection of the perpendicular to through and the perpendicular to through . Its other vertices, and , are constructed analogously. Trilinear coordinates are given by
formula_3
For example, the excentral triangle is the antipedal triangle of the incenter.

Suppose that does not lie on any of the extended sides , and let denote the isogonal conjugate of . The pedal triangle of is homothetic to the antipedal triangle of . The homothetic center (which is a triangle center if and only if is a triangle center) is the point given in trilinear coordinates by

formula_4

The product of the areas of the pedal triangle of and the antipedal triangle of equals the square of the area of .

== Pedal circle ==
The pedal circle is defined as the circumcircle of the pedal triangle. Note that the pedal circle is not defined for points lying on the circumcircle of the triangle. 

=== Pedal circle of isogonal conjugates ===
For any point not lying on the circumcircle of the triangle, it is known that and its isogonal conjugate have a common pedal circle, whose center is the midpoint of these two points.

<text>Robert Simson (14 October 1687 – 1 October 1768) was a Scottish mathematician and professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow. The Simson line is named after him.

==Biography==
Robert Simson was born on 14 October 1687, probably the eldest of the seventeen children, all male, of John Simson, a Glasgow merchant, and Agnes, daughter of Patrick Simpson, minister of Renfrew; only six of them reached adulthood.

Simson matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1701, intending to enter the Church. He followed the course in the faculty of arts (Latin, Greek, logic, natural philosophy) and then concentrated on studying theology and Semitic languages. Mathematics was not taught at the university, but by reading Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Tuyrocinia Mathematica in Novem Tractatus&quot; and then Euclid’s &quot;Elements&quot; Simson soon became deeply interested in mathematics and especially geometry. His efforts impressed the university Senate to such an extent that they offered him the chair of mathematics, to replace the recently-dismissed Sinclair. As he had had no formal training in the subject, Simson turned down the offer but agreed to take up the post a year later, during which time he would increase his knowledge of mathematics.

After a failed attempt to go to Oxford, Simson spent his year in London at Christ&#x27;s Hospital. During this time he made valuable contacts with several prominent mathematicians, including John Caswell, James Jurin (secretary of the Royal Society), Humphrey Ditton and, most importantly, Edmond Halley.

Simson was admitted professor of mathematics at Glasgow, aged 23, on 20 November 1711, where his first task was to design a two-year course in mathematics, some of which he taught himself; his lectures included geometry, of course, and algebra, logarithms and optics. Among his students were Maclaurin, Matthew Stewart, and William Trail. He resigned the post in 1761, and was succeeded by another of his pupils Rev Prof James Williamson FRSE (1725-1795).

During his time at Glasgow Simson noted in 1753 that, as the Fibonacci numbers increased in magnitude, the ratio between adjacent numbers approached the golden ratio, whose value is
As for the man himself, “Simson appears to have been tall and of good stature. In spite of his great scholarship he was a modest, unassuming man who was very cautious in promoting his own work. He enjoyed good company and presided over the weekly meetings of a dining club that he had instituted … He had a special interest in botany, in which he was an acknowledged expert”.

Robert Simson did not marry. He died, aged 80, in his college residence at Glasgow on 1 October 1768, and was interred in the Blackfriars Burying Ground (now known as Ramshorn Cemetery), where, in the south wall, is placed to his memory a plain marble tablet, with a highly and justly complimentary inscription”. Simson&#x27;s library, including some of his own works, was bequeathed to the university on his death. It consists of about 850 printed books, mainly early mathematical and astronomical texts.

Subscriptions towards the erection of a monument to Dr Simson were collected in 1865, with the Senate of the College of Glasgow, the (thirteenth) Earl of Eglinton and Winton, and the Earl Stanhope each donating £10; and John Carrick Moore – the first cousin twice removed of Robert Simson – giving £15. The memorial, designed by Frederick Thomas Pilkington, is “a large octagonal monument with carved Egyptian details, topped with a ball finial”. It is situated on a hilltop in West Kilbride cemetery.

==Works==

Simson&#x27;s contributions to mathematical knowledge took the form of critical editions and commentaries on the works of the ancient geometers. The first of his published writings is a paper in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; (1723, vol. xl. p. 330) on Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Porisms&quot;.

Then followed &quot;Sectionum conicarum libri V.&quot; (Edinburgh, 1735), a second edition of which, with additions, appeared in 1750. The first three books of this treatise were translated into English and, several times, printed as &quot;The Elements of the Conic Sections&quot;. In 1749, was published &quot;Apollonii Pergaei locorum planorum libri II.&quot;, a restoration of Apollonius&#x27;s lost treatise, founded on the lemmas given in the seventh book of Pappus&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Collection&quot;.

In 1756, appeared, both in Latin and in English, the first edition of his &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot;. This work, which contained only the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books, and to which, in its English version, he added the &quot;Data&quot; in 1762, was for long the standard text of Euclid in England.

After Simson&#x27;s death, restorations of Apollonius&#x27;s treatise &quot;De section determinata&quot; and of Euclid&#x27;s treatise &quot;De Porismatibus&quot; were printed for private circulation in 1776, at the expense of Earl Stanhope, in a volume with the title &quot;Roberti Simson opera quaedam reliqua&quot;. The volume contains also dissertations on &quot;Logarithms&quot; and on the &quot;Limits of Quantities and Ratios&quot;, and a few problems illustrating the ancient geometrical analysis.

<doc id="152993" wikidata="Q607651" url="?curid=152993" title="Sopwith Camel">
<text>The Sopwith Camel is a British First World War single-seat biplane fighter aircraft that was introduced on the Western Front in 1917. It was developed by the Sopwith Aviation Company as a successor to the Sopwith Pup and became one of the best-known fighter aircraft of the Great War. Pilots flying Camels were credited with downing 1,294 enemy aircraft, more than any other Allied fighter of the conflict. Towards the end of the war, Camels lost their edge as fighters and were also used as a ground-attack aircraft.

The Camel was powered by a single rotary engine and was armed with twin synchronized Vickers machine guns. It was difficult to fly, with 90% of its weight in the front two metres (seven feet) of the aircraft, but it was highly manoeuvrable in the hands of an experienced pilot, a vital attribute in the relatively low-speed, low-altitude dogfights of the era. Its pilots joked that their fates would involve &quot;a wooden cross, the Red Cross, or a Victoria Cross&quot;.

The main variant of the Camel was designated as the F.1. Other variants included the 2F.1 Ship&#x27;s Camel, which operated from aircraft carriers; the Comic night fighter variant; and the T.F.1, a &quot;trench fighter&quot; armoured for attacks on heavily defended ground targets. A two-seat variant served as a trainer. The last Camels were withdrawn from RAF service in January 1920.

==Development==

When it became clear the Sopwith Pup was no match for the newer German fighters such as the Albatros D.III, the Camel was developed to replace it, as well as the Nieuport 17s that had been purchased from the French as an interim measure. It was recognised that the new fighter needed to be faster and have a heavier armament. The design effort to produce this successor, initially designated as the &quot;Sopwith F.1&quot;, was headed by Sopwith&#x27;s chief designer, Herbert Smith.

Early in its development, the Camel was simply referred to as the &quot;Big Pup&quot;. A metal fairing over the gun breeches, intended to protect the guns from freezing at altitude, created a &quot;hump&quot; that led pilots to call the aircraft &quot;Camel&quot;, although this name was never used officially. On 22 December 1916, the prototype Camel was first flown by Harry Hawker at Brooklands, Weybridge, Surrey; it was powered by a Clerget 9Z.

In May 1917, the first production contract for an initial batch of 250 Camels was issued by the British War Office. Throughout 1917, a total of 1,325 Camels were produced, almost entirely the initial F.1 variant. By the time that production of the type came to an end, approximately 5,490 Camels of all types had been built. In early 1918, production of the naval variant of the Sopwith Camel, the &quot;Ship&#x27;s&quot; Camel 2F.1 began.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Camel had a conventional design for its era, with a wire-braced wooden box-girder fuselage structure, an aluminium engine cowling, plywood panels around the cockpit, and a fabric-covered fuselage, wings and tail. While possessing some clear similarities with the Pup, it had a noticeably bulkier fuselage. For the first time on an operational British-designed fighter, two 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns were mounted directly in front of the cockpit, synchronised to fire forwards through the propeller disc – initially this was the Sopwith firm&#x27;s own synchronizer design, but after the mechanical-linkage Sopwith-Kauper units began to wear out, the more accurate and easier-to-maintain hydraulic-link Constantinesco-Colley system replaced it from November 1917 onward. In addition to the machine guns, a total of four Cooper bombs could be carried for ground attack purposes.

The bottom wing was rigged with 5° dihedral while the top wing lacked any dihedral; this meant that the gap between the wings was less at the tips than at the roots; this change had been made at the suggestion of Fred Sigrist, the Sopwith works manager, as a measure to simplify the aircraft&#x27;s construction. The upper wing had a central cutout section to improve upwards visibility for the pilot.

Production Camels were powered by various rotary engines, most commonly either the Clerget 9B or the Bentley BR1. In order to evade a potential manufacturing bottleneck being imposed upon the overall aircraft in the event of an engine shortage, several other engines were adopted to power the type as well.

===Flight characteristics===

Unlike the preceding Pup and Triplane, the Camel was considered to be difficult to fly. With light and sensitive controls the type owed both its extreme manoeuvrability and its difficult handling to the close placement of the engine, pilot, guns and fuel tank (some 90% of the aircraft&#x27;s weight) within the front of the aircraft, and to the strong gyroscopic effect of the rotating mass of the cylinders common to rotary engines.

Due to the torque of the rotary engine the Camel turned more slowly to the left, which resulted in a nose-up attitude, but the torque also resulted in being able to turn to the right quicker than other fighters, although that resulted in a tendency towards a nose-down attitude from the turn. Because of the faster turning capability to the right, some pilots preferred to change heading 90° to the left by turning 270° to the right.

Upon entering service, the Camel gained an unfortunate reputation with pilots, with inexperienced ones crashing on take-off when the full fuel load pushed the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity beyond the rearmost safe limit.

When in level flight, the Camel was markedly tail-heavy. Unlike the Sopwith Triplane, the Camel lacked a variable incidence tailplane, so that the pilot had to apply constant forward pressure on the control stick to maintain a level attitude at low altitude. The aircraft could be rigged so that at higher altitudes it could be flown &quot;hands off&quot;. A stall immediately resulted in a dangerous spin.
RFC pilots used to joke that it offered the choice between &quot;a wooden cross, the Red Cross, or a Victoria Cross&quot;.

A two-seat trainer version was later built to ease the transition process: in his &quot;Recollections of an Airman&quot;, Lieutenant Colonel L. A. Strange, who served with the central flying school, wrote: &quot;In spite of the care we took, Camels continually spun down out of control when by pupils on their first solos. At length, with the assistance of Lieut Morgan, who managed our workshops, I took the main tank out of several Camels and replaced [them] with a smaller one, which enabled us to fit in dual control.&quot; Such conversions, and dual instruction, went some way to alleviating the previously unacceptable casualties incurred during the critical type-specific solo training stage.

Despite these issues, its agility in combat made the Camel one of the best-remembered Allied aircraft of the First World War. Aviation author Robert Jackson notes that: &quot;in the hands of a novice it displayed vicious characteristics that could make it a killer; but under the firm touch of a skilled pilot, who knew how to turn its vices to his own advantage, it was one of the most superb fighting machines ever built&quot;.

==Operational history==

===Western front===

In June 1917, the Sopwith Camel entered service with No. 4 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service, which was stationed near Dunkirk, France; this was the first squadron to operate the type. Its first combat flight and reportedly its first victory claim were both made on 4 July 1917. By the end of July, the Camel also equipped No. 3 and No. 9 Naval Squadrons; and it had become operational with No. 70 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. By February 1918, 13 squadrons had Camels as their primary equipment. The Camel proved in service to have better manoeuvrability than the Albatros D.III and D.V and offered heavier armament and better performance than the Pup and Triplane. Together with the S.E.5a and the SPAD S.XIII, it helped to re-establish the Allied aerial superiority for a time. While flying a Sopwith Camel with the serial number B6313, the Canadian ace Billy Barker was credited with shooting down 46 aircraft. The total aircraft credited to Barker while flying B6313 is the highest attributed to a single aircraft during World War I.

===Home defence and night fighting===

An important role for the Camel was home defence. The RNAS flew Camels from Eastchurch and Manston airfields against daylight raids by German bombers, including Gothas, from July 1917. The public outcry against the night raids and the poor response of London&#x27;s defences resulted in the RFC deciding to divert Camels that had been heading to the frontlines in France to Britain for the purposes of home defence; in July 1917, 44 Squadron RFC reformed and reequipped with the Camel to conduct the home defence mission. By March 1918, the home defence squadrons had been widely equipped with the Camel and by August 1918, a total of seven home defence squadrons were operating these aircraft.

When the Germans switched to performing night attacks, the Camel proved capable of being flown at night. Those aircraft assigned to home defence squadrons were quickly modified with navigation lights to serve as night fighters. A smaller number of Camels were more extensively changed; on these aircraft, the Vickers machine guns were replaced by over-wing Lewis guns and the cockpit was moved rearwards so the pilot could reload the guns. This modification, which became known as the &quot;Sopwith Comic&quot; allowed the guns to be fired without affecting the pilot&#x27;s night vision and allowed the use of new, more effective incendiary ammunition that was considered unsafe to fire from synchronised Vickers guns.

The Camel was used to intercept and shoot down German bombers on several occasions during 1918, serving in this capacity through] to the final German bombing raid upon Britain on the night of the 20/21 May 1918. During this air raid, a combined force of 74 Camels and S.E.5s intercepted 28 Gothas and Zeppelin-Staaken R.VIs; three German bombers were shot down, while two more were downed by anti-aircraft fire and a further aircraft was lost to engine failure, resulting in the heaviest losses suffered by German bombers during a single night&#x27;s operation over England. In July 1918 seven Sopwith Camels destroyed two German Zeppelins by bombing their hangars in the Tondern Raid; they were flown off and then landed in Denmark or ditched in the sea to be picked up.
The Camel night fighter was also operated by 151 Squadron to intercept German night bombers operating over the Western Front. These aircraft also carried out night intruder missions against German airstrips. After five months of operations, 151 Squadron had claimed responsibility for shooting down 26 German aircraft.

===Shipboard and parasite fighter===
The RNAS operated a number of 2F.1 Camels that were suitable for launching from platforms mounted on the turrets of major warships as well as from some of the earliest aircraft carriers to be built, e.g. HMS Furious. Furthermore, the Camel could be deployed from &quot;aircraft lighters&quot;, which were specially modified barges; these had to be towed fast enough that a Camel could successfully take off. The aircraft lighters served as means of launching interception sorties against incoming enemy air raids from a more advantageous position than had been possible when using shore bases alone.

During the summer of 1918, a single 2F.1 Camel (&quot;N6814&quot;) participated in a series of trials as a parasite fighter. The aircraft used Airship &quot;R23&quot; as a mothership.

===Ground attack===
By mid-1918, the Camel had become obsolescent as a day fighter as its climb rate, level speed and performance at altitudes over 12,000 ft (3,650 m) were outclassed by the latest German fighters, such as the Fokker D.VII. However, it remained viable as a ground-attack and infantry support aircraft and instead was increasingly used in that capacity. The Camel inflicted high losses on German ground forces, albeit suffering from a high rate of losses itself in turn, through the dropping of 25 lb (11 kg) Cooper bombs and low-level strafing runs. The protracted development of the Camel&#x27;s replacement, the Sopwith Snipe, resulted in the Camel remaining in service in this capacity until well after the signing of the Armistice.

During the German spring offensive of March 1918, squadrons of Camels participated in the defence of the Allied lines, harassing the advancing German Army from the skies. Jackson observed that &quot;some of the most intense air operations took place&quot; during the retreat of the British Fifth Army, in which the Camel provided extensive aerial support. Camels flew at multiple altitudes, some as low as for surprise strafing attacks upon ground forces, while being covered from attack by hostile fighters by the higher altitude aircraft. Strafing attacks formed a major component of British efforts to contain the offensive, the attacks often having the result of producing confusion and panic amongst the advancing German forces. As the March offensive waned, the Camel was able to operate within and maintain aerial superiority for the remainder of the war.

===Postwar service===
In the aftermath of the First World War, the Camel saw further combat action. Multiple British squadrons were deployed into Russia as a part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Between the Camel and the S.E.5, which were the two main types deployed to the Caspian Sea area to bomb Bolshevik bases and to provide aerial support to the Royal Navy warships present, Allied control of the Caspian region had been achieved by May 1919. Starting in March 1919, direct support was also provided for White Russian forces, carrying out reconnaissance, ground attack, and escort operations. During the summer of 1919, Camels of No. 47 Squadron conducted offensive operations in the vicinity of Tsaritsyn, primarily against Urbabk airfield; targets including enemy aircraft, cavalry formations, and river traffic. In September 1919, 47 Squadron was relocated to Kotluban, where its aircraft operations mainly focused on harassing enemy communication lines. During late 1919 and early 1920, the RAF detachment operated in support of General Vladimir May-Mayevsky&#x27;s counter-revolutionary volunteer army during intense fighting around Kharkiv. In March 1920, the remainder of the force was evacuated and their remaining aircraft were deliberately destroyed to avoid them falling into enemy hands.

==Variants==
Camels were powered by several makes of rotary engines:
* Bentley BR1, 150 hp (standard for RNAS aircraft)
* Clerget 9B, 130 hp (standard powerplant)
* Clerget 9Bf, 140 hp 
* Le Rhône 9J, 110 hp 
* Gnome Monosoupape 9B-2, 100 hp 
* Gnome Monosoupape 9N, 160 hp

===Sopwith Camel F.1===
The F.1 was the main production version. It was armed with twin synchronised Vickers guns.

===Sopwith Camel 2F.1===
The 2F.1 was a shipboard variant, flown from . It had a slightly shorter wingspan and a Bentley BR1 as its standard engine. Additionally, one Vickers gun was replaced by an overwing Lewis gun to assist in destroying Zeppelins using incendiary ammunition.

===Sopwith Camel &quot;Comic&quot; Night fighter===
The &quot;Comic&quot; was a Camel variant designed specifically for night-fighting duties. The twin Vickers guns were replaced by two Lewis guns on Foster mountings firing forward over the top wing, as the muzzle flash of the Vickers guns could blind the pilot. The second reason to use Lewis guns was to facilitate the use of incendiary ammunition because of the risk of using it in synchronized guns. To allow reloading of the guns, the pilot was moved about to the rear, and to compensate the fuel tank was moved forward. It served with Home Defence Squadrons against German air raids. The &quot;Comic&quot; nickname was unofficial, and was shared with the night fighter version of the Sopwith 1½ Strutter.

===F.1/1===
The F1/1 was a version with tapered wings.

===T.F.1===
The T.F.1 was an experimental trench fighter used for development work for the Sopwith Salamander. Its machine guns were angled downwards for efficient strafing, and it featured armour plating for protection.

===Trainer===
The trainer variant had a second cockpit behind the normal pilot&#x27;s position. The weapons were removed, although the hump was sometimes kept.

==Surviving aircraft==

There are eight known original Sopwith Camels extant:
* B5747 – F.1 on static display at the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels.
* B6291 – F.1 on display at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. After being discovered in the 1960s by Desmond St. Cyrien, the aircraft was restored through the 1980s, with the restoration being completed by Tony Ditheridge at AJD Engineering in the United Kingdom, first flying in 1992. From 2005 the aircraft was part of the Javier Arango Collection in Paso Robles, California and was donated to the NASM on Arango&#x27;s death in April 2017.
* B7280 – F.1 on static display at the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków, Lesser Poland. The aircraft was built in Lincoln by Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth. On 5 September 1918, when being flown by Captain Herbert A. Patey of No. 210 Squadron RAF over Belgium, it was shot down by Ludwig Beckmann of &quot;Jasta 56&quot;. Patey survived and was taken prisoner. The Germans repaired the aircraft and flew it until the end of the war. It was then taken to Berlin and exhibited at the Deutsche Luftfahrt Sammlung (German Aviation Collection). During World War II it was moved to Poland for safekeeping, and put into storage. Restoration began in 2007 and was completed by 2010.
* C8228 – F.1 on static display at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida.

==Specifications (F.1 Camel)==

==Notable appearances in media==
Biggles flies a Sopwith Camel in the novels by W. E. Johns during Biggles&#x27;s spell in 266 Squadron during the First World War. The first collection of Biggles stories, titled &quot;The Camels are Coming&quot;, was published in 1932. The first two collections of stories (broken into three books in Australia) were all true stories or events, lightly fictionalised—some of them are identifiable in official war records, e.g., the accidental discovery of a major camouflaged airfield when rescuing a downed pilot.

The Sopwith Camel was featured as a flyable aircraft in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series, starting with Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0, released in November 1982. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 was the last version to include the Sopwith Camel with the game.

The Camel is the &quot;plane&quot; of Snoopy in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, when he imagines himself as a World War I flying ace and the nemesis of the Red Baron.

<text>Mount Tambora, or Tomboro, is an active stratovolcano in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Located on Sumbawa in the Lesser Sunda Islands, it was formed by the active subduction zones beneath it. Before the 1815 eruption, its elevation reached more than high, making it one of the tallest peaks in the Indonesian archipelago.

Tambora violently erupted in a series of eruptions beginning on 5 April 1815, culminating in the largest eruption in recorded human history and the largest of the Holocene (10,000 years ago to present). The magma chamber under Tambora had been drained by previous eruptions and underwent several centuries of dormancy as it refilled. Volcanic activity reached a peak that year, culminating in an explosive eruption. The explosion was heard on Sumatra island, more than 
 away and possibly over 3350 km (2060 miles) away in Thailand and Laos. Heavy volcanic ash rains were observed as far away as Borneo, Sulawesi, Java, and Maluku islands, and the maximum elevation of Tambora was reduced from about . Estimates vary, but the death toll was at least 71,000 people. The eruption contributed to global climate anomalies in the following years, while 1816 became known as the &quot;year without a summer&quot; because of the impact on North American and European weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, crops failed and livestock died, resulting in the worst famine of the century.

== Geographical setting ==

Mount Tambora, also known as Tomboro, is situated in the northern part of Sumbawa island, part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is a segment of the Sunda Arc, a chain of volcanic islands that make up the southern chain of the Indonesian archipelago. Tambora forms its own peninsula on Sumbawa, known as the Sanggar peninsula. To the north of the peninsula is the Flores Sea and to the south is the long and wide Saleh Bay. At the mouth of Saleh Bay there is an islet called Mojo.

Besides the seismologists and vulcanologists who monitor the mountain&#x27;s activity, Mount Tambora is an area of interest to archaeologists and biologists. The mountain also attracts tourists for hiking and wildlife activities, though in small numbers. The two nearest cities are Dompu and Bima. There are three concentrations of villages around the mountain slope. At the east is Sanggar village, to the northwest are Doro Peti and Pesanggrahan villages, and to the west is Calabai village.

There are two routes of ascent to the caldera. The first begins at Doro Mboha village on the southeast of the mountain and follows a paved road through a cashew plantation to an elevation of . The road terminates at the southern part of the caldera, which at is reachable only by hiking. This location is only one hour from the caldera, and usually serves as a base camp from which volcanic activity can be monitored. The second route starts from Pancasila village at the northwest of the mountain and is only accessible on foot. The hike from Pancasila at elevation to the caldera of the volcano takes approximately 14 hours with several stops (&quot;pos&quot;) en route to the top. The trail leads through dense jungle with wildlife such as &quot;Elaeocarpus&quot;, Asian water monitor, reticulated python, hawks, orange-footed scrubfowl, pale-shouldered cicadabird (&quot;Coracina dohertyi&quot;), brown and scaly-crowned honeyeater, yellow-crested cockatoo, yellow-ringed white-eye, helmeted friarbird, wild boar, Javan rusa and crab-eating macaques.

== History ==

=== Geological history ===
==== Formation ====

Tambora lies 
 north of the Java Trench system and above the upper surface of the active north-dipping subduction zone. Sumbawa Island is flanked to the north and south by oceanic crust. The convergence rate of the Australian Plate beneath the Sunda Plate is per year. Estimates for the onset of the volcanism at Mount Tambora range from 57 to 43 ka. The latter estimate published in 2012 is based on argon dating of the first pre-caldera lava flows. The formation of Tambora drained a large magma chamber pre-existing under the mountain. The Mojo islet was formed as part of this process in which Saleh Bay first appeared as a sea basin about 25,000 years ago.

A high volcanic cone with a single central vent formed before the 1815 eruption, which follows a stratovolcano shape. The diameter at the base is . The volcano frequently erupted lava, which descended over steep slopes. Tambora has produced trachybasalt and trachyandesite rocks which are rich in potassium. The volcanics contain phenocrysts of apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, leucite, magnetite, olivine and plagioclase, with the exact composition of the phenocrysts varying between different rock types. Orthopyroxene is absent in the trachyandesites of Tambora. Olivine is most present in the rocks with less than 53 percent SiO2, while it is absent in the more silica-rich volcanics, characterised by the presence of biotite phenocrysts. The mafic series also contain titanium magnetite and the trachybasalts are dominated by anorthosite-rich plagioclase. Rubidium, strontium and phosphorus pentoxide are especially rich in the lavas from Tambora, more than the comparable ones from Mount Rinjani. The lavas of Tambora are slightly enriched in zircon compared with those of Rinjani.

The magma involved in the 1815 eruption originated in the mantle and was further modified by melts derived from subducted sediments, fluids derived from the subducted crust and crystallization processes in magma chambers. 87Sr86Sr ratios of Mount Tambora are similar to those of Mount Rinjani, but lower than those measured at Sangeang Api. Potassium levels of Tambora volcanics exceed 3 weight percent, placing them in the shoshonite range for alkaline series.

Since the 1815 eruption, the lowermost portion contains deposits of interlayered sequences of lava and pyroclastic materials. Approximately 40% of the layers are represented in the lava flows. Thick scoria beds were produced by the fragmentation of lava flows. Within the upper section, the lava is interbedded with scoria, tuffs, pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic falls. Tambora has at least 20 parasitic cones and lava domes, including &quot;Doro Afi Toi&quot;, &quot;Kadiendi Nae&quot;, &quot;Molo&quot; and &quot;Tahe&quot;. The main product of these parasitic vents is basaltic lava flows.

==== Eruptive history ====
Radiocarbon dating has established that Mount Tambora had erupted three times during the current Holocene epoch before the 1815 eruption, but the magnitudes of these eruptions are unknown. Their estimated dates are 3910 BC ± 200 years, 3050 BC and 740 AD ± 150 years. An earlier caldera was filled with lava flows starting from 43,000 BC; two pyroclastic eruptions occurred later and formed the Black Sands and Brown Tuff formations, the last of which was emplaced between about 3895 BC and 800 AD.

In 1812, Mount Tambora became highly active, with its maximum eruptive intensity occurring in April 1815. The magnitude was 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scale, with a total tephra ejecta volume of up to 1.8 × 1011 cubic metres. Its eruptive characteristics included central vent and explosive eruptions, pyroclastic flows, tsunamis and caldera collapse. This eruption had an effect on global climate. Volcanic activity ceased on 15 July 1815. Activity resumed in August 1819—a small eruption with &quot;flames&quot; and rumbling aftershocks, and was considered to be part of the 1815 eruption. This eruption was recorded at 2 on the VEI scale.

Around 1880 ± 30 years, eruptions at Mount Tambora have been registered only inside the caldera. It created small lava flows and lava dome extrusions; this was recorded at two on the VEI scale. This eruption created the &quot;Doro Api Toi&quot; parasitic cone inside the caldera.

Mount Tambora is still active and minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. The last eruption was recorded in 1967. It was a gentle eruption with a VEI of 0, which means it was non-explosive. Another very small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the alert level for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increased activity was reported in the caldera, including earthquakes and steam emissions.

=== 1815 eruption ===

==== Chronology of the eruption ====
Before 1815, Mount Tambora had been dormant for several centuries, as hydrous magma cooled gradually in a closed magma chamber. Inside the chamber, at depths of , cooling and partial crystallization of the magma exsolved high-pressure magmatic fluid. Overpressure of the chamber of about was generated as temperatures ranged from . In 1812, the crater began to rumble and generated a dark cloud.

A moderate-sized eruption on 5 April 1815 was followed by thunderous detonation sounds that could be heard in Ternate on the Molucca Islands, from Mount Tambora. On the morning of 6 April 1815, volcanic ash began to fall in East Java, with faint detonation sounds lasting until 10 April.
What was first thought to be the sound of firing guns was heard on 10 and 11 April on Sumatra island (more than away), and possibly over 3350 km (2060 miles) away in Thailand and Laos.
The eruptions intensified at about 7:00 p.m. on the 10th. Three plumes rose and merged. Pieces of pumice of up to in diameter rained down at approximately 8 p.m., followed by ash at around 9–10 p.m. The eruption column collapsed, producing hot pyroclastic flows that cascaded down the mountain and towards the sea on all sides of the peninsula, wiping out the village of Tambora. Loud explosions were heard until the next evening, 11 April. The veil of ash spread as far as West Java and South Sulawesi, while a &quot;nitrous odor&quot; was noticeable in Batavia. The heavy tephra-tinged rain did not recede until 17 April. Analysis of various sites on Mount Tambora using ground-penetrating radar has revealed alternations of pumice and ash deposits covered by the pyroclastic surge and flow sediments that vary in thickness regionally.

The eruption is estimated to have had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7. It had 4–10 times the energy of the 1883 Krakatoa eruption. An estimated of pyroclastic trachyandesite was ejected, weighing approximately 1.4×1014 kg. This has left a caldera measuring across and deep. The density of fallen ash in Makassar was 636 kg/m3. Before the explosion, Mount Tambora was approximately high, one of the tallest peaks in the Indonesian archipelago. After the eruption of 1815, the maximum elevation was reduced to .

The 1815 Tambora eruption is the largest and most devastating observed eruption in recorded history; a comparison with other major eruptions is listed below. The explosion was heard or away, and ash deposits were registered at a distance of at least . A pitch of darkness was observed as far away as from the mountain summit for up to two days. Pyroclastic flows spread to distances of about from the summit and an estimated 9.3–11.8 × 1013 g of stratospheric sulfate aerosols were generated by the eruption.

==== Aftermath ====
The island&#x27;s entire vegetation was destroyed as uprooted trees, mixed with pumice ash, washed into the sea and formed rafts of up to across. One pumice raft was found in the Indian Ocean, near Calcutta, on 1 and 3 October 1815. Clouds of thick ash still covered the summit on 23 April. Explosions ceased on 15 July, although smoke emissions were still observed as late as 23 August. Flames and rumbling aftershocks were reported in August 1819, four years after the event.

A moderate tsunami struck the shores of various islands in the Indonesian archipelago on 10 April, with waves reaching in Sanggar at around 10 p.m. A tsunami causing waves of was reported in Besuki, East Java before midnight and another exceeded in the Molucca Islands. The eruption column reached the stratosphere at an altitude of more than . Coarser ash particles fell one to two weeks after the eruptions, while finer particles stayed in the atmosphere for months to years at an altitude of . There are various estimates of the volume of ash emitted: a recent study estimates a dense-rock equivalent volume for the ash of and a dense-rock equivalent volume of for the pyroclastic flows. Longitudinal winds spread these fine particles around the globe, creating optical phenomena. Between 28 June and 2 July, and between 3 September and 7 October 1815, prolonged and brilliantly coloured sunsets and twilights were frequently seen in London. Most commonly, pink or purple colours appeared above the horizon at twilight and orange or red near the horizon.

==== Fatalities ====
The number of fatalities has been estimated by various sources since the nineteenth century. Swiss botanist Heinrich Zollinger travelled to Sumbawa in 1847 and recollected witness accounts about the 1815 eruption of Tambora. In 1855, he published estimates of directly killed people at 10,100, mostly from pyroclastic flows. A further 37,825 died from starvation on Sumbawa island.
 On Lombok, another 10,000 died from disease and hunger. Petroeschevsky (1949) estimated that about 48,000 and 44,000 people were killed on Sumbawa and Lombok, respectively. Several authors have used Petroeschevsky&#x27;s figures, such as Stothers (1984), who estimated 88,000 deaths in total. Tanguy et al. (1998) considered Petroeschevsky&#x27;s figures based on untraceable sources, so developed an estimate based solely on two primary sources: Zollinger, who spent several months on Sumbawa after the eruption, and the notes of Sir Stamford Raffles, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies during the event. Tanguy pointed out that there may have been additional victims on Bali and East Java because of famine and disease, and estimated 11,000 deaths from direct volcanic action and 49,000 from post-eruption famine and epidemics. Oppenheimer (2003) estimated at least 71,000 deaths, and numbers as high as 117,000 have been proposed.

===== Global effects =====

The 1815 eruption released 10 to 120 million tons of sulfur into the stratosphere, causing a global climate anomaly. Different methods have been used to estimate the ejected sulfur mass: the petrological method, an optical depth measurement based on anatomical observations, and the polar ice core sulfate concentration method, which calibrated against cores from Greenland and Antarctica.

In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent stratospheric sulfate aerosol veil, described then as a &quot;dry fog&quot;, was observed in the northeastern United States. It was not dispersed by wind or rainfall, and it reddened and dimmed sunlight to an extent that sunspots were visible to the naked eye. Areas of the northern hemisphere suffered extreme weather conditions and 1816 became known as the &quot;year without a summer&quot;. Average global temperatures decreased about , enough to cause significant agricultural problems around the globe. After 4 June 1816, when there were frosts in Connecticut, cold weather expanded over most of New England. On 6 June 1816, it snowed in Albany, New York and Dennysville, Maine. Similar conditions persisted for at least three months, ruining most crops across North America while Canada experienced extreme cold. Snow fell until 10 June near Quebec City, accumulating to .

That year became the second-coldest year in the northern hemisphere since 1400, while the 1810s were the coldest decade on record, a result of Tambora&#x27;s eruption and other suspected volcanic events between 1809 and 1810. (See sulfate concentration chart.) Surface-temperature anomalies during the summers of 1816, 1817 and 1818 were −0.51, −0.44 and −0.29 °C, respectively. Along with a cooler summer, parts of Europe experienced a stormier winter, and the Elbe and Ohře Rivers froze over for twelve days in February 1816. As a result, prices of wheat, rye, barley and oats rose dramatically by 1817.

This climate anomaly has been cited as a reason for the severity of the 1816–19 typhus epidemic in southeast Europe and the eastern Mediterranean. Large numbers of livestock died in New England during the winter of 1816–1817, while cool temperatures and heavy rains led to failed harvests in the British Isles. Families in Wales travelled long distances as refugees, begging for food. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, oat and potato harvests. The crisis was severe in Germany, where food prices rose sharply. Demonstrations at grain markets and bakeries, followed by riots, arson and looting, took place in many European cities. It was the worst famine of the 19th century.

== Culture ==

A human settlement obliterated by the Tambora eruption was discovered in 2004. That summer, a team led by Haraldur Sigurðsson with scientists from the University of Rhode Island, the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and the Indonesian Directorate of Volcanology began an archaeological dig in Tambora. Over six weeks, they unearthed evidence of habitation about west of the caldera, deep in jungle, from shore. The team excavated of deposits of pumice and ash. The scientists used ground-penetrating radar to locate a small buried house which contained the remains of two adults, bronze bowls, ceramic pots, iron tools and other artifacts. Tests revealed that objects had been carbonized by the heat of the magma. Sigurdsson dubbed the find the &quot;Pompeii of the East&quot;, and media reports referred to the &quot;Lost Kingdom of Tambora&quot;. Sigurdsson intended to return to Tambora in 2007 to search for the rest of the villages, and hopefully to find a palace. Many villages in the area had converted to Islam in the 17th century, but the structures uncovered so far do not show Islamic influence.

Based on the artifacts found, such as bronzeware and finely decorated china possibly of Vietnamese or Cambodian origin, the team concluded that the people were well-off traders. The Sumbawa people were known in the East Indies for their horses, honey, sappan wood (for producing red dye), and sandalwood (for incense and medications). The area was thought to be highly productive agriculturally.

The language of the Tambora people was lost with the eruption. Linguists have examined remnant lexical material, such as records by Zollinger and Raffles, and established that Tambora was not an Austronesian language, as would be expected in the area, but possibly a language isolate, or perhaps a member of one of the families of Papuan languages found or more to the east.

The eruption is captured in latter-day folklore, which explains the cataclysm as divine retribution. A local ruler is said to have incurred the wrath of Allah by feeding dog meat to a &quot;hajji&quot; and killing him. This is expressed in a poem written around 1830:
== Ecosystem ==
A team led by the Swiss botanist Heinrich Zollinger arrived on Sumbawa in 1847. Zollinger sought to study the area of eruption and its effects on the local ecosystem. He was the first person after the eruption to ascend the summit, which was still covered by smoke. As Zollinger climbed, his feet sank several times through a thin surface crust into a warm layer of powder-like sulfur. Some vegetation had regrown, including trees on the lower slope. A &quot;Casuarina&quot; forest was noted at , while several &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot; grasslands were also found. In August 2015 a team of Georesearch Volcanedo Germany followed the way used by Zollinger and explored this way for the first time since 1847. Because of the length of the distance to be travelled on foot, the partly very high temperatures and the lack of water it was a particular challenge for the team of Georesearch Volcanedo.

Resettlement of the area began in 1907, and a coffee plantation was established in the 1930s in the Pekat village on the northwestern slope. A dense rain forest of &quot;Duabanga moluccana&quot; trees had grown at an altitude of . It covers an area up to . The rain forest was discovered by a Dutch team, led by Koster and de Voogd in 1933. From their accounts, they started their journey in a &quot;fairly barren, dry and hot country&quot;, and then they entered &quot;a mighty jungle&quot; with &quot;huge, majestic forest giants&quot;. At , the trees became thinner in shape. Above , they found &quot;Dodonaea viscosa&quot; flowering plants dominated by &quot;Casuarina&quot; trees. On the summit was sparse &quot;Edelweiss&quot; and &quot;Wahlenbergia&quot;.

An 1896 survey records 56 species of birds including the crested white-eye. Several other zoological surveys followed and found other bird species, with over 90 bird species discoveries in this period, including yellow-crested cockatoos, Zoothera thrushes, Hill mynas, green junglefowl and rainbow lorikeets are hunted for the cagebird trade by the local people. Orange-footed scrubfowl are hunted for food. This bird exploitation has resulted in population declines, and the yellow-crested cockatoo is nearing extinction on Sumbawa island.

A commercial logging company began to operate in the area in 1972, posing a threat to the rain forest. The company holds a timber-cutting concession for an area of , or 25% of the total area. Another part of the rain forest is used as a hunting ground. In between the hunting ground and the logging area, there is a designated wildlife reserve where deer, water buffalos, wild pigs, bats, flying foxes and species of reptiles and birds can be found. In 2015, the conservation area protecting the mountain&#x27;s ecosystem was upgraded to a national park.

=== Exploration of the caldera floor ===
Zollinger (1847), van Rheden (1913) and W. A. Petroeschevsky (1947) could only observe the caldera floor from the crater rim. In 2013, a German research team (Georesearch Volcanedo Germany) for the first time carried out a longer expedition into this caldera, about 1300 m deep, and with the help of a native team climbed down the southern caldera wall, reaching the caldera floor while experiencing extreme conditions. The team stayed in the caldera for nine days. People had reached the caldera floor only in a few cases as the descent down the steep wall is difficult and dangerous, subject to earthquakes, landslides and rockfalls. Moreover, only relatively short stays on the caldera floor had been possible because of logistical problems, so that extensive studies had been impossible. The investigation program of Georesearch Volcanedo on the caldera floor included researching the visible effects of smaller eruptions which had taken place since 1815, gas measurements, studies of flora and fauna and measurement of weather data. Especially striking was the relatively high activity of Doro Api Toi (&quot;Gunung Api Kecil&quot; means &quot;small volcano&quot;) in the southern part of the caldera and the gases escaping under high pressure on the lower north-east wall. Besides the team discovered near the Doro Api Toi a lavadome which had not yet been mentioned in scientific studies. The team called this new discovery &quot;Adik Api Toi (Indonesian &quot;adik&quot;: younger brother). Later this lavadome was called by the Indonesians &quot;Doro Api Bou&quot; (&quot;new volcano&quot;). This lavadome probably appeared in 2011/2012 when there was an increased seismic activity and probably volcanic activity on the caldera floor (there is no exact information about the caldera floor at that time). In 2014 the same research team carried out a further expedition into the caldera and set a new record: over 12 days the investigations of 2013 were continued.

== Monitoring ==

Indonesia&#x27;s population has been increasing rapidly since the 1815 eruption. In 2020, the population of the country reached 270 million people, of which 56% concentrated on the island of Java. An event as significant as the 1815 eruption would impact about eight million people.

Seismic activity in Indonesia is monitored by the Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation with the monitoring post for Mount Tambora located at Doro Peti village. They focus on seismic and tectonic activity by using a seismograph. There has been no significant increase in seismic activity since the 1880 eruption. Monitoring is continuously performed inside the caldera, with a focus on the parasitic cone &quot;Doro Api Toi&quot;.

The directorate created a disaster mitigation map for Mount Tambora, which designates two zones for an eruption: a dangerous zone and a cautious zone. The dangerous zone identifies areas that would be directly affected by pyroclastic flows, lava flows or pyroclastic falls. It includes areas such as the caldera and its surroundings, a span of up to where habitation is prohibited. The cautious zone consists of land that might be indirectly affected, either by lahar flows and other pumice stones. The size of the cautious area is , and includes Pasanggrahan, Doro Peti, Rao, Labuan Kenanga, Gubu Ponda, Kawindana Toi and Hoddo villages. A river, called Guwu, at the southern and northwest part of the mountain is also included in the cautious zone.

<doc id="152995" wikidata="Q47386" url="?curid=152995" title="Kenny McCormick">
<text>Kenneth McCormick is a fictional character and one of the four main protagonists in the adult animated sitcom &quot;South Park&quot;, alongside Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman. His often muffled and incomprehensible speech—the result of his parka hood covering his mouth—is provided by co-creator Matt Stone. After early appearances in &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; shorts in 1992 and 1995, Kenny appeared in &quot;South Park&quot; television episodes beginning August 13, 1997, as well as the 1999 feature film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, where his uncovered face and voice were first revealed.

Kenny was a third, later fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer to look as he did in the show&#x27;s original method of cutout animation.

The character gained popularity thanks to a running gag during the first five seasons of the series, whereby Kenny would routinely suffer an excruciating death before returning alive and well in the next episode with little or no explanation. Stan would frequently use the catchphrase &quot;Oh my god! They killed Kenny!&quot;, followed by Kyle exclaiming &quot;You bastard(s)!&quot;. Since the sixth season in 2002, the practice of killing Kenny has been seldom used by the show&#x27;s creators. Various episodes have set up the gag, sometimes presenting alternate explanations for Kenny&#x27;s unacknowledged reappearances.

==Role in &quot;South Park&quot;==
Kenny attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison&#x27;s fourth-grade class. During the first 58 episodes, Kenny and the other main child characters were in the third grade. Kenny comes from a poor household, presided over by his alcoholic, unemployed father, Stuart McCormick. His mother Carol McCormick has a job washing dishes at Olive Garden. Kenny has an older brother named Kevin. He also has a younger sister who is shown with his family in the season nine episode &quot;Best Friends Forever&quot;, but does not reappear until the 15th season episode &quot;The Poor Kid&quot;, where her name is revealed to be Karen, whom he loves unconditionally. Kenny is friends with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Butters. Kenny is regularly teased for living in poverty, particularly by Cartman.

Kenny&#x27;s superhero alter ego, Mysterion, first appeared in the season 13 episode &quot;The Coon&quot;, as a rival to Eric Cartman&#x27;s eponymous supervillain alter ego. He unmasks himself at the end of the episode, but his identity is left intentionally ambiguous to the viewer. He is not revealed to be Kenny until the season 14 episode &quot;Mysterion Rises&quot;, the character&#x27;s third appearance as part of a three-part story arc.

==Deaths==

Prior to season six, Kenny died in almost every episode. The nature of the deaths were often gruesome and portrayed in a comically absurd fashion, and usually followed by Stan or Kyle respectively yelling &quot;Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!&quot; with the other yelling &quot;You bastard(s)!&quot; Shortly afterward, rats would commonly appear and begin picking at his corpse. In a following episode, Kenny would reappear alive and well, usually without any explanation. Most characters appear oblivious or indifferent to the phenomenon, although occasionally one will acknowledge awareness of it. In &quot;Cherokee Hair Tampons&quot;, Kenny gets irritated and offended when Stan laments Kyle&#x27;s critical condition while utterly ignoring Kenny&#x27;s past demises. Eric Cartman commented on Kenny&#x27;s deaths in the episode &quot;Cartmanland&quot; when he is being sued for unsafe rides insisting to attorneys representing his family that &quot;Kenny? He dies all the time!&quot; In &quot;Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo&quot;, as the episode is about to end, the kids point out that &quot;something feels unfinished&quot;, and Kenny celebrates as &quot;The End&quot; sign appears; it is the first episode in the series he survives.

Near the end of the production run of the show&#x27;s fifth season, Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kenny was killed off permanently. The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans, and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch, a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show. In the episode &quot;Kenny Dies&quot;, Kenny dies after developing terminal muscular dystrophy, while Parker and Stone claimed that Kenny would not be returning in subsequent episodes. The duo insisted they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode. Stone stated that thinking of humorous ways to kill the character was initially fun, but became more mundane as the series progressed. When they determined that it would be too difficult to develop the character because he was too much of a &quot;prop&quot;, Parker and Stone finally decided to kill off Kenny permanently.

For much of season six, Kenny remained dead, though he still appears to possess Cartman&#x27;s body, and both Stone and Parker entertained the idea of eventually bringing the character back. According to Stone, only a small minority of fans were significantly angered by Kenny&#x27;s absence to threaten a boycott of the cable channel Comedy Central, on which &quot;South Park&quot; is aired. For most of the season, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman fill the void left by Kenny by allowing the characters Butters Stotch and Tweek Tweak into their group, paving the way for those characters to receive more focus on the show; nevertheless, Kenny returned from the year-long absence in the season six finale &quot;Red Sleigh Down&quot;, has remained a main character since, and has been given larger roles in episodes.

The first explanation given for Kenny&#x27;s deaths and reappearances was given in the 53rd episode &quot;Cartman Joins NAMBLA&quot;, wherein the McCormicks have a baby exactly like Kenny, including the characteristic orange parka, shortly after the former Kenny dies. Mr. McCormick exclaims, &quot;God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened&quot;, to which Mrs. McCormick quickly replies, &quot;Fifty-second&quot;. This explanation is expanded upon in the season 14 episodes &quot;Coon 2: Hindsight&quot;, &quot;Mysterion Rises&quot; and &quot;Coon vs. Coon and Friends&quot;, in which Kenny, while playing superheroes with his friends, claims his &quot;superpower&quot; is immortality. He actually dies several times during these episodes—even committing suicide more than once—reawakening alive and unharmed in his bed each time. He is frustrated and angry that no one can remember him dying every time he regenerates and longs to know the source of his power, which he views as a curse. Unbeknownst to him, his parents were previously connected to a Cthulhu-worshipping death cult. After Kenny shoots himself the second time, Mrs. McCormick awakes with a scream, shrieks &quot;It&#x27;s happening again!&quot;, and minutes later, is shown gently placing a newborn Kenny in his bed. &quot;We should never have gone to that stupid cult meeting,&quot; she grouses as she and her husband return to bed.

In &quot;Put It Down&quot;, he is killed off-screen by a driver on his phone, as his picture is shown among those of kids killed by a driver on phone texting tribute. In &quot;Bike Parade&quot;, Jeff Bezos tells Alexa to kill Kenny, and Cartman hauls his coffin while riding his bike in the parade. &quot;The Pandemic Special&quot; sees Kenny being gunned down by the police when they are equipped with military weaponry to deal with the children breaking free from COVID-19 quarantine.

In &quot;South Park: Post Covid&quot;, as a millionaire scientist in the future finding the cause of COVID-19, Kenny dies due to a time travel experiment that got him a variant named COVID Delta+ Rewards. This death is undone in &quot;South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid&quot; after Stan, Kyle, and Cartman time travel to the past.

In &quot;South Park: The End of Obesity&quot;, Kenny was killed by Tony the Tiger in is his first on-screen death since &quot;The Pandemic Special&quot;.

==Character==
===Creation and design===

When developing the character, the show&#x27;s creators had observed that most groups of childhood friends in small middle-class towns always included &quot;the one poor kid&quot; and decided to portray Kenny in this light.

In a 2000 interview, Parker said that Kenny was based on a childhood friend of his who was also named Kenny and wore an orange parka that muffled his voice. He was the poorest child in the neighborhood and often skipped school, causing Parker and his friends to jokingly say he died, only for him to return to school later.

An unnamed precursor to Kenny first appeared in the first &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short, dubbed &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot;, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short, dubbed &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;. In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.
Kenny next appeared on August 13, 1997, when &quot;South Park&quot; debuted on Comedy Central with the episode &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot;.

In tradition with the show&#x27;s animation style, Kenny is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion. Ever since the show&#x27;s second episode, &quot;Weight Gain 4000&quot; (season one, 1997), Kenny, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique.

The effect of Kenny&#x27;s speech is achieved by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny&#x27;s lines. While he originally voiced Kenny without any computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking in his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth-grader. As the technique of Kenny&#x27;s muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.

He first appeared unobscured by his hood in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, where it was revealed that he had messy blonde hair. Mike Judge provided the voice for Kenny&#x27;s one line of uninsulated dialogue: &quot;Goodbye, you guys.&quot; On a few occasions during episodes that have originally aired since the film&#x27;s release, he has been seen without the parka; however, unlike in &quot;Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; his entire face has been only seen four times in the television series without being partially obscured or otherwise altered, this being in &quot;The Losing Edge&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Getting Old&quot;, and &quot;DikinBaus Hot Dogs&quot; (except in DikiniBaus Hot Dogs, his face is slightly concealed by a pair of sunglasses shades). He also speaks unmuffled during some of these instances, in which case co-producer Eric Stough provides Kenny&#x27;s voice. During &quot;The Coon&quot; episodes of seasons 13 and 14, Kenny has his first major speaking role as the character Mysterion.

===Personality and traits===
While most child characters on the show are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an &quot;underlying sweetness&quot; aspect to the character, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Kenny and his friends as &quot;sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence&quot;. He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode &quot;The Ring&quot;, when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed to find out that she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in &quot;Mysterion Rises&quot; in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion, he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her &quot;guardian angel&quot;), as revealed in &quot;The Poor Kid&quot;; however, in all of his guises, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.

In the trilogy of episodes &quot;Black Friday&quot;, &quot;A Song of Ass and Fire&quot; and &quot;Titties and Dragons&quot;, in which the boys play-act characters from the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, Kenny cross-dresses as a fantasy-style princess with a wig and dress similar to the video game character Princess Zelda, and becomes a Japanese-speaking moe anime character at one point. When Cartman complains, &quot;You&#x27;re never going to be a real princess&quot;, Princess Kenny responds (via her translator, Stan) angrily to Cartman, calling him a &quot;ball-licking lesbian&quot;.

This portrayal continues in the video game &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot; where Cartman notes that playing a &quot;chick&quot; is &quot;just how [Kenny] seems to be rolling right now&quot;. Kenny&#x27;s sister also refers to Kenny as a girl, if you talk to her in the McCormick house. Throughout the game, Kenny posts &#x27;status updates&#x27; referring to herself as &quot;the cutest of them all&quot;.

==In other media==
Kenny had a major role in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, the full-length film based on the series, and appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack singing (albeit muffled) several lines of the song &quot;Mountain Town&quot; from the film. As a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch, a short that features Kenny as a &quot;dead friend&quot; being returned by Cartman to a shop run by Kyle aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. Kenny was also featured in the documentary film &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;, listening to Cartman tell his version of the film&#x27;s titular joke, and in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, a short spoofing both &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; that aired during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.

Kenny also appears in six &quot;South Park&quot;-related video games: In &quot;South Park&quot;, Kenny is controlled by the player through the first-person shooter mode who attempts to ward off enemies from terrorizing the town of South Park. In &quot;South Park: Chef&#x27;s Luv Shack&quot;, a user has the option of playing as Kenny when participating in the game&#x27;s several &quot;minigames&quot; based on other popular arcade games. In the racing game &quot;South Park Rally&quot;, a user can race as Kenny against other users playing as other characters, while choosing to place him in any of a variety of vehicles. In &quot;South Park Let&#x27;s Go Tower Defense Play!&quot;, Kenny can be selected as a playable character used to establish a tower defense against the game&#x27;s antagonists. In &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, Kenny (as Princess Kenny) can be selected as a companion over the course of much of the game. In &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot;, Kenny is seen as his alter-ego Mysterion.

==Cultural impact==

Kenny&#x27;s deaths are well-known in popular culture, and was one of the things viewers most commonly associated with &quot;South Park&quot; during its earlier seasons. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Kenny at #6 on their &quot;The Top 25 South Park Characters&quot; list. The exclamation of &quot;Oh my God! They killed Kenny!&quot; quickly became a popular catchphrase, while both Kenny and the phrase have appeared on some of the more popular pieces of &quot;South Park&quot; merchandise, including shirts, bumper stickers, calendars and baseball caps, and inspired the rap song &quot;Kenny&#x27;s Dead&quot; by Master P, which was featured on &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot;.

The running gag of Kenny&#x27;s deaths in earlier seasons was incorporated into the season 9 (2005) episode &quot;Best Friends Forever&quot; when Kenny, in a vegetative state, is kept alive by a feeding tube while a media circus erupted over whether the tube should be removed and allow Kenny to die. The episode received much attention as it served to provide commentary on the Terri Schiavo case, originally airing just one day before Schiavo died. The episode earned &quot;South Park&quot; its first Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.

Kenny&#x27;s deaths have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world. In the book &quot;South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating&quot;, an essay by Southern Illinois University philosophy professor Randall Auxier, entitled &quot;Killing Kenny: Our Daily Dose of Death&quot;, suggests that the fashion of the recurring gag serves to help the viewer become more comfortable with the inevitability of their own death. In the book &quot;South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today&quot;, University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point professor Karin Fry wrote an essay concerning the parallels between Kenny&#x27;s role in the show and the different concepts of existentialism.

When Sophie Rutschmann of the University of Strasbourg discovered a mutated gene that causes an adult fruit fly to die within two days after it is infected with certain bacteria, she named the gene &quot;Kenny&quot; in honor of the character.
